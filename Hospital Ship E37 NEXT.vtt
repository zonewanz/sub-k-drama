00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.150
(Episode 37)

2
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.989
- I'll go to the ER. - Okay. See you later at the lobby.

3
00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.359
Let's go.

4
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.469
- You should go with them. - But she's...

5
00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.700
I only need to take her to the internal medicine doctor here.

6
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.840
You should go.

7
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.280
Nurse Pyo made a hard decision. You must be worried about her.

8
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.179
I'll leave her to you then.

9
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.119
Ma'am, shall we go inside?

10
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.289
- Okay. - Hang in there.

11
00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.899
- Doctor Kwak. - Hello.

12
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.670
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Tae Ho, the chief of Internal Medicine.

13
00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.200
Nice to meet you too.

14
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.439
This is her, right? It must've been hard for her.

15
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.609
Let's test her blood first then get an x-ray.

16
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.959
Why isn't Mr. Chu here?

17
00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.900
It's because he's in the ER.

18
00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.240
Why?

19
00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.569
Do you need to ask?

20
00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.969
He's the patient's family. He should be with her.

21
00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.710
Where else should he be?

22
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.979
No, what I mean is,

23
00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.849
why is she still in the ER?

24
00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.620
She should be moved to the ICU.

25
00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.349
They might transfer her to a different hospital.

26
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.759
Transfer? Why would they move her to another hospital?

27
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.960
It's because there is no surgeon who can operate on her here.

28
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.060
Doctor Song is here.

29
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.659
Haven't you heard?

30
00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.099
Doctor Song got fired from this hospital today.

31
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.810
So where is Doctor Song now?

32
00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.479
She went to see the director for the final negotiation.

33
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.080
Final negotiation?

34
00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.719
Transfer the patient to another hospital.

35
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.219
I want to save the patient, sir.

36
00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.759
Remember the support that Doosung Group promised you.

37
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.060
Director Kim.

38
00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:29.780
Have a seat here.

39
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.750
Let's talk privately...

40
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.789
without Doctor Song.

41
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.780
He can't just walk out like that, can he?

42
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.280
What else can he do?

43
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.990
Should he let Eun Jae operate and close his hospital?

44
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.389
What about Ms. Kim Sung Hee?

45
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.360
Without the surgery, she will die.

46
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.930
- Can you really not do it? - Do what?

47
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.199
The surgery. Can't you do it yourself?

48
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.399
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.639
Goodness, this is so frustrating.

50
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.970
- Where are you going? - To find the director.

51
00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.639
- Are you going to convince him? - I don't know.

52
00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:33.879
Darn it. Is there really no way?

53
00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.920
Please let me do the surgery.

54
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.680
Director Kim will let me operate...

55
00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.160
if you don't pressure him.

56
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.930
Do you...

57
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.490
want to operate that badly?

58
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:52.129
Of course.

59
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.399
You should do it then.

60
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.399
Are you giving me your approval?

61
00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:59.439
I am...

62
00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.269
but on one condition.

63
00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.610
I'll gather up some reporters.

64
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.550
Just say a few things about the hospital ship.

65
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.279
Are you telling me to criticize it?

66
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.220
I'm not such a cold-hearted person.

67
00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:22.459
You did work there...

68
00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:24.600
even though it was just for a few months.

69
00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.230
It wouldn't be right if you criticized it.

70
00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.269
I just want you to point out one problem.

71
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.639
What is that problem?

72
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.509
Free medical treatment.

73
00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.740
It's a big problem...

74
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.879
that the hospital ship treats patients for free.

75
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.550
"There should be no free treatments."

76
00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.750
Just put emphasis on this.

77
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.420
I don't think your own opinion about this matter...

78
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.589
would be so different from mine.

79
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.660
Why do you think so?

80
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.670
11 years.

81
00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:07.810
You spent 11 years of your life studying to get a medical degree.

82
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.209
That's not all.

83
00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:12.279
From the day you became a doctor until today,

84
00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:14.680
you've been stuck in the operating room,

85
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.509
not being able to eat or sleep properly to save people's lives.

86
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.680
You're providing that kind of great service for free?

87
00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.019
That's absolute nonsense.

88
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.819
Chairman Jang.

89
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.860
We're living in a capitalistic society.

90
00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.699
People have plenty of opportunities to make money.

91
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.329
So everyone should work hard, earn money,

92
00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:39.769
and buy the things they need with that money.

93
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.269
Health care is not an exception, of course.

94
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.680
Especially, a competent doctor like you...

95
00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:52.579
should sell your skills at a very high price.

96
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.350
- Don't you agree? - No.

97
00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.720
I don't agree with you.

98
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.459
How so?

99
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.629
Do you think it's okay to provide it for free?

100
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:06.759
Of course.

101
00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.199
You're a generous person.

102
00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.300
Technically, I'm not the one you should compliment.

103
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.439
You're right.

104
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:19.680
You're a paid doctor hired by the city government.

105
00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.879
So what are you saying?

106
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.579
Are you saying it's okay to ladle it out because it's tax?

107
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.920
That's not what I meant.

108
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.689
Why do the society and the country have to take care of...

109
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.689
those who have been lazy all their lives and became poor?

110
00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:38.730
That's such a shameless thing to ask.

111
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.660
There are many people who are...

112
00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:44.029
barely making a living although they've worked hard all their lives.

113
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:47.500
If they had worked hard, they wouldn't have become poor.

114
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.810
That's just an excuse.

115
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.910
I feel differently about it.

116
00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.350
But even if everything you just said was true,

117
00:07:56.079 --> 00:08:01.250
I still believe we should treat anyone who is sick,

118
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.920
even if he's lazy or poor,

119
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:07.060
without any conditions.

120
00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:09.829
For free?

121
00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:12.000
As much as we can.

122
00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:16.399
I just realized that you're a bit foolish.

123
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:18.939
It sounds like you're overly idealistic.

124
00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:20.899
That foolish idealism...

125
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.610
may be the thing that saved your son's life.

126
00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.009
I saved the life of...

127
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.120
Jang Sung Ho who was in a car accident and needed immediate help.

128
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.720
I didn't save Jang Sung Ho who could pay me a lot of money...

129
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.120
for saving his life as Doosung Group's heir.

130
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.730
At the time,

131
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.059
there was nothing around him...

132
00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:48.629
to hint of who he was.

133
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.200
What would've happened if I'd turned my back...

134
00:08:52.539 --> 00:08:53.840
on him because of that?

135
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:58.080
If we operate on a patient whose identity is unknown...

136
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.610
and if that patient does not wake up,

137
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.710
we will not get paid a cent.

138
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.279
This happens in the ER all the time.

139
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.950
We're sometimes told not to...

140
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.659
operate on people who cannot pay.

141
00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:16.159
If I had been...

142
00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:20.899
sly and calculative at the scene of your son's accident,

143
00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.429
then he likely...

144
00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:26.100
would have died then and there.

145
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.240
Are you bragging about...

146
00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:31.539
saving my son's life?

147
00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:34.850
The second you sell health for a profit,

148
00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:40.480
you could end up putting a price on a human life.

149
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.419
Doctor Song.

150
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.090
Are you naive, or are you pretending to be so?

151
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.360
Are all human lives worth the same?

152
00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:57.129
Do you really believe so?

153
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.639
No.

154
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.100
Then what?

155
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.539
So many lives are not taken seriously.

156
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.970
That is why...

157
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.580
free medicine is needed even more.

158
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.820
Did you say the patient's name was Kim Sung Hee?

159
00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:14.149
Yes.

160
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.690
Don't you want to save her?

161
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.590
Of course, I do.

162
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.230
Then show that you're willing to negotiate.

163
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.230
I am not willing to negotiate over a person's life.

164
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.529
We all have only one,

165
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.139
and therefore,

166
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.769
not even a deity...

167
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.169
can decide its worth.

168
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.149
I beg of you...

169
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.720
to make...

170
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.820
the right call.

171
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.720
Too bad.

172
00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:55.590
The conversation is over.

173
00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:14.879
You look tired, sir.

174
00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:18.679
Not even a deity can decide the worth of a human life?

175
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.049
She's so obsessive and persistent.

176
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.820
She never gave in once. Goodness.

177
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.289
I'll send an acupressure therapist to your home.

178
00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:29.389
No, no. Send her to my villa.

179
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.159
I'll take a long bath and rest.

180
00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:34.429
Yes, sir. Right away.

181
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.230
Well?

182
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.169
What do you mean?

183
00:12:14.909 --> 00:12:16.610
The OR's still closed?

184
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.450
Who won't let you operate?

185
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:23.049
Joon Young.

186
00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:24.879
Jae Geol's dad?

187
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.879
- No. - Then who?

188
00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:28.919
Doosung Group?

189
00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:32.190
Jae Geol's dad is under their control?

190
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.460
Doctor Cha.

191
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.789
It's fine.

192
00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:37.730
Don't beat around the bush, and just tell us.

193
00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:39.600
Let's solve the issue.

194
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.159
(Fire and Rescue)

195
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.129
Full-body bruising and irregular breathing.

196
00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:12.500
Are you conscious?

197
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.059
Straight to Zone A.

198
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.799
Do you know where you are?

199
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.500
- Let's swap. - Okay.

200
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.000
150 joules.

201
00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:22.610
Clear.

202
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:24.509
1, 2.

203
00:13:26.409 --> 00:13:27.440
1, 2.

204
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.789
2, 3, 4.

205
00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:57.340
John Doe. John Doe.

206
00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.279
It's a John Doe.

207
00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:00.980
He's dead.

208
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.009
(Not paid)

209
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:07.149
We can't keep going if we treat patients...

210
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.649
who can't pay.

211
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.960
We'll have to close the ER.

212
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.629
Then what can we do, sir? We can't send away a patient that came in.

213
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.429
(Not paid)

What will...

216
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.879
happen to my wife now?

217
00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:44.960
Doctor Song.

218
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.730
Are your children on their way?

219
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.070
Doctor Song.

220
00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.970
I think...

221
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.740
you should call them.

222
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.179
Are you just...

223
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.019
going to give up?

224
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.350
Without even...

225
00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:16.019
trying?

226
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.659
We won't give up.

227
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.830
Doctor Song.

228
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.269
You don't give up.

229
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.470
Director Kim.

230
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.070
The OR's open. Send her up.

231
00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:35.970
I already called two anesthetists.

232
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.570
Doctor Myung will take the donor,

233
00:15:37.809 --> 00:15:40.980
and Doctor Song will do the transplant, right?

234
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:42.610
Thank you.

235
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.309
Thank you, sir.

236
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.750
No.

237
00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:50.590
I should apologize.

238
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.360
Go, and prepare for surgery.

239
00:15:54.529 --> 00:15:56.190
Let's save the patient...

240
00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:57.929
and then talk.

241
00:15:58.429 --> 00:15:59.500
Yes, sir.

242
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.970
We'll send her over. You two should go and get ready.

243
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.070
Okay.

244
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.779
You don't have to say anything.

245
00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:22.289
You always...

246
00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:25.059
do your best for the patients.

247
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.059
I know that better than anyone.

248
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.129
So I'll...

249
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.830
trust you and wait.

250
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.149
Good luck.

251
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.120
Remember.

252
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.789
Don't think of anything else.

253
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.900
(NICU)

254
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.910
Are you sick?

255
00:17:17.509 --> 00:17:18.509
You're so hot.

256
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.309
Your fever's... Ma'am.

257
00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.150
Ma'am.

258
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:24.210
Oh no, In Kyung.

259
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.579
- Ma'am. - Oh no.

260
00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.150
Wake up, ma'am.

261
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.750
What's going on?

262
00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:31.220
Doctor Kwak, who is she?

263
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:33.390
She gave birth on our ship.

264
00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:36.259
Oh, this is the mother?

265
00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:37.730
Her breathing and pulse are fine.

266
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.160
- But... - But what?

267
00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:40.630
She has a fever.

268
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.000
Ma'am, I'll take your temperature.

269
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.640
It's 38.5°C. That's quite high.

270
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.539
- Her BP? - 85 over 60.

271
00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:51.779
That's too low.

272
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.579
Put her on a drip to prevent dehydration.

273
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.750
Do an alcohol massage to lower her temperature.

274
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.779
Okay.

275
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.190
So many things happened today.

276
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.930
Is this hospital's ER ever quiet?

277
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.230
That's true.

278
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.930
I hope it all works out for Doctor Song.

279
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.930
I don't even know what's right or wrong now.

280
00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:19.299
Some patients change...

281
00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:23.240
as soon as the surgery's over, and they think they're safe.

282
00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:09.190
You can do it.

283
00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:32.710
Can you do it?

284
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.150
It's hard to know.

285
00:19:36.349 --> 00:19:38.579
- Are you afraid? - As always.

286
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.250
We have to do it.

287
00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:46.289
- It's the fate of a surgeon. - Stay strong.

288
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.130
I'll help you as soon as I'm done.

289
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.099
Please take good care of Nurse Pyo.

290
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.349
What?

291
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.460
What did Song Eun Jae do?

292
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.329
Who told her to operate?

293
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.700
Who gave her the permission?

294
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.299
- Of course, it was... - Of course what?

295
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.299
Answer my question.

296
00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:36.839
Don't treat me like a fool.

297
00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:40.380
I'm sorry. I'll take action as soon as possible.

298
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.609
Please continue with your massage.

299
00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:46.319
You arrogant punk.

300
00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:48.519
Don't tell me what to do.

301
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.690
Are you looking down on me? Are you the chairman?

302
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.700
- Chairman Jang. - What's with that look?

303
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.130
Director Kim is here, sir.

304
00:21:06.069 --> 00:21:07.500
I hear that...

305
00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:11.279
you let something interesting happen.

306
00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:15.579
It's more exciting than interesting.

307
00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:20.650
Saving patients excites the doctors...

308
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.250
the most, sir.

309
00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:28.990
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

310
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.130
What is it?

311
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.130
It's the original memorandum of understanding from...

312
00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:37.230
Geoje Jeil Hospital.

313
00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:43.809
- What do you mean? - We'd like to...

314
00:21:44.609 --> 00:21:48.250
terminate the memorandum of understanding between...

315
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.750
Doosung Group and the hospital.

316
00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:55.819
Aren't you afraid of what may happen as a consequence?

317
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.490
Will you tear it yourself?

318
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.660
Or shall I get rid of it?

319
00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:49.670
Find a way to destroy them.

320
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.279
Whether it's Song Eun Jae or Geoje Jeil Hospital,

321
00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:54.980
destroy them completely.

322
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.180
We scheduled a press conference tomorrow.

323
00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:00.319
What is it for?

324
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.450
We can always find something to criticize in any organization.

325
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.619
Though it's not a serious matter,

326
00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:08.829
we made it possible for the hospital to seem immoral.

327
00:23:08.829 --> 00:23:12.660
Won't you do something about Song Eun Jae?

328
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:14.400
Of course, we will.

329
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.640
We'll have reporters question Hwang In Kyung.

330
00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:21.710
We'll play a video of a baby...

331
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.940
who is barely breathing with many tubes attached.

332
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.410
The press will be more criticizing of Song Eun Jae.

333
00:23:51.769 --> 00:23:54.200
Hello, Director Kim.

334
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.279
- The operation is going well. - Yes.

335
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.519
Chairman Jang won't back down easily.

336
00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:13.220
He'll try to threaten us.

337
00:24:13.859 --> 00:24:17.589
Maybe the real war starts now.

338
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.099
What do you mean by war?

339
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.029
Isn't the memorandum of understanding destroyed?

340
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:24.400
Doosung Group hasn't invested anything in Geoje Jeil Hospital.

341
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.269
They'll think that we ruined their plan.

342
00:24:26.869 --> 00:24:28.869
If the base hospital disappears,

343
00:24:28.869 --> 00:24:30.609
remote medical service won't function.

344
00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:32.809
It'll be frustrating for Doosung Group to earn money.

345
00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:35.579
Will Jeil Hospital become enemies with Doosung Group?

346
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:37.410
It's like David and Goliath.

347
00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:40.750
It's doomed.

348
00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:43.920
Shouldn't we have a stone?

349
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.119
- A stone? - That's right.

350
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.430
We should shoot a slingshot like David.

351
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.700
Didn't I warn you, Jae Geol?

352
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.069
Use a simpler language.

353
00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:57.069
Have you met Hwang In Kyung?

354
00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:01.000
I don't mean an eye contact.

355
00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:04.109
Have you questioned her thoroughly?

356
00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:08.210
- You didn't, did you? - I tried.

357
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.750
- But? - Her baby is sick.

358
00:25:10.849 --> 00:25:13.819
- Also... - Also what?

359
00:25:13.819 --> 00:25:14.920
Today,

360
00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:17.920
the mother is sick too.

361
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.359
You're so frustrating.

362
00:25:21.829 --> 00:25:23.059
Hyun.

363
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:25.900
Listen to me carefully.

364
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.930
Honestly, it's where it all started.

365
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.369
Hwang In Kyung sued Dr. Song.

366
00:25:32.369 --> 00:25:34.910
On the day that the press went after her,

367
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.670
all dangers took place.

368
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.579
How is it possible for a woman to start all this?

369
00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:45.380
It's probably impossible. There's someone behind it.

370
00:25:45.819 --> 00:25:48.150
- Who? - Do you mean Doosung Group?

371
00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:52.920
That's most likely. Dr. Song told me about...

372
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.789
Lawyer Jo who defends Hwang In Kyung.

373
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:59.130
He specializes in labor laws, not medical malpractice.

374
00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:02.470
He worked for Doosung Group when there was a strike.

375
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.769
They provided a lawyer.

376
00:26:04.769 --> 00:26:07.539
They probably promised to pay her if things work out.

377
00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:08.769
That's why...

378
00:26:08.769 --> 00:26:11.539
she did this to the doctors who saved her child.

379
00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:15.250
She accepted their offer.

380
00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:18.150
- Jae Geol. - That's it.

381
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.990
- What do you mean? - It's the stone. Hey.

382
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.759
- Let's report it to the press. - We can't.

383
00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:27.619
- Why not? - We don't have proof.

384
00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.690
Did they have proof to sue Dr. Song?

385
00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:33.930
- They're assuming too. - It's the wrong approach.

386
00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.130
We're left with nothing if we lose the chance.

387
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.799
What if it isn't true?

388
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.769
What if everything we assume is wrong?

389
00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:45.339
What will you do if we're wrong about everything?

390
00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:48.210
Having a sick child is difficult enough for her.

391
00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:52.180
We can't hurt the mother anymore.

392
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:55.190
Do you know how David won with a slingshot?

393
00:26:56.589 --> 00:26:58.119
It was the right timing.

394
00:26:58.759 --> 00:27:00.690
This is the right time.

395
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.490
Verifying the truth comes first.

396
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:04.859
Hwang In Kyung is also a patient now.

397
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.700
I'll talk to her once she gets better.

398
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.339
- Let me take care of it. - We don't have much time.

399
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.009
They might try to attack us tomorrow morning.

400
00:27:15.009 --> 00:27:16.769
- I know. - Do you?

401
00:27:18.309 --> 00:27:19.680
Do you really know?

402
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.250
Fine.

403
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.279
Give it a try.

404
00:27:28.089 --> 00:27:29.849
This is the last time.

405
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.220
If your method doesn't work,

406
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.259
I'll do it my way.

407
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.829
(Emergency Medical Center)

408
00:27:42.829 --> 00:27:43.930
There he is.

409
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:48.839
- You're here too. - I had an emergency call.

410
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.779
Have a cup of coffee. Dr. Lee bought it.

411
00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:53.309
Thank you.

412
00:27:53.609 --> 00:27:56.579
I heard that you're taking care of the baby's mother.

413
00:27:56.579 --> 00:27:57.920
It's nothing.

414
00:27:58.019 --> 00:28:00.579
All I did was bring her here from the corridor.

415
00:28:00.849 --> 00:28:03.519
You're impressive, Dr. Kwak.

416
00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:06.190
The guardian is so heartless.

417
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.559
How can you take such good care of the baby?

418
00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:10.559
He's an angel.

419
00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:12.660
Hello, Dr. Kim.

420
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.099
Han Sol? I'll be right there.

421
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.640
Doctor, what's wrong with Han Sol?

422
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.309
Go, and find out.

423
00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:32.619
What happened?

424
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.220
Oxygen saturation is 85.

425
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.650
Capillary transit time is five seconds.

426
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.720
- Inject epinephrine, please. - Yes, doctor.

427
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.529
It's not working.

428
00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:50.299
Doctor, the baby's heart rate is down to 60.

429
00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:52.640
Oh, no. Starting compression.

430
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:05.720
- Doctor. - It's not working.

431
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.720
It's only tormenting the baby.

432
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.160
Let's put her on ECMO then.

433
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.690
That will help her.

434
00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:15.829
Unfortunately, our hospital doesn't have ECMO.

435
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.799
We don't have it here?

436
00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:21.730
That's right. To move her to the hospital that has it,

437
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.329
it'd take an hour and a half at least.

438
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.799
Do you think she can hold out for that long?

439
00:29:26.569 --> 00:29:28.640
Do you think that's the best for her?

440
00:29:31.079 --> 00:29:34.579
I'm sorry, but there is nothing more we can do.

441
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.579
We've done everything we can do by science.

442
00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:51.930
Then...

443
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.430
why don't we try something else?

444
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.200
If we've done everything we can do by science,

445
00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:02.369
we should...

446
00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:08.009
try something we can do as humans.

447
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:10.579
Let's give it a try...

448
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.220
- and think of it as a prayer. - A prayer?

449
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.359
Doctor Kwak, you're not saying...

450
00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:21.190
Please let me do it.

451
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.430
If there is something I can try until the end,

452
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.869
I want to try everything.

453
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.900
Please.

454
00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:54.483
(Episode 38 will air shortly.)
