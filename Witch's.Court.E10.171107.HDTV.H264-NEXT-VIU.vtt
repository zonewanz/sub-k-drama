3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.980
(Episode 10)

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.080
Kwak Young Shil...

5
00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.050
died.

6
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.090
14 years ago.

7
00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.360
Liar.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.430
I saw with my own eyes.

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.930
She died.

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400
Why?

11
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.439
When?

12
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.650
Where? How did my mom die?

13
00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.519
Did you...

14
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.689
Did you kill her?

15
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.709
You shameless scumbag.

16
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.519
You killed my mom, but you've been doing fine,

17
00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:22.580
and now, you want to save your brother?

18
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.950
Do you think I'll allow that?

19
00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.459
Don't make me laugh.

20
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.519
Forget the evidence.

21
00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.090
I'll send both you...

22
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.060
and Cho Gap Soo to prison.

23
00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.269
I'll turn myself in.

24
00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.140
- What? - I was prepared...

25
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.909
to pay for killing her when I came here.

26
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.610
I'll testify...

27
00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.750
that Cho Gap Soo ordered me to kill her.

28
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:52.980
I have evidence...

29
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.689
of him ordering the murder 14 years ago.

30
00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.590
I'll give it all to you.

31
00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:00.659
Please...

32
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.890
save...

33
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.959
my brother Min Ho.

34
00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:10.830
Please.

35
00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.249
Where did you bury...

36
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.279
my mom?

37
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.480
There was a fire at Sena Mental Hospital.

38
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.010
While escaping,

39
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.320
Kwak Young Shil suffered a bad burn.

40
00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.149
When I got there, she was practically comatose.

41
00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.119
I took care of her at the hospital...

42
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.890
where she was being treated.

43
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.989
We usually keep unclaimed ashes...

44
00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.899
for only 10 years.

45
00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.499
This way.

46
00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.100
If she passed away in 2003,

47
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.940
it was probably spread somewhere...

48
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.670
with other ashes four years ago.

49
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.540
Take a look.

50
00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.409
No.

51
00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.180
It isn't true.

52
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.979
You saw.

53
00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.219
Kwak Young Shil was burned and hurt while saving you.

54
00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.719
Detective Baek took her to another hospital,

55
00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.089
and that's all I know.

56
00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.029
How could you just send her?

57
00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.729
She saved my life.

58
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.599
You should've reported it.

59
00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.070
You should've told her family.

60
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.269
It's not like I forgot and lived in peace.

61
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.570
I was miserable too.

62
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.969
You must come clean and say what you know.

63
00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.609
What would that change?

64
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.810
It's been over 10 years.

65
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:42.909
Mom.

66
00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:47.050
Tell me what happened to Ms. Ma back then.

67
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.250
Please.

68
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.859
What if your career is ruined...

69
00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:57.490
because of something from the past?

70
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.830
You're a prosecutor.

71
00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.029
I'm fine with my life being ruined.

72
00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.669
But I won't let...

73
00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.870
your reputation as a prosecutor be tainted.

74
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.070
That's right.

75
00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.370
I'm a prosecutor.

76
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.339
That's why I can't ignore what those people did...

77
00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.080
to Ms. Ma's mother.

78
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.680
I must uncover the truth and punish them.

79
00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.149
- Jin Wook. - I hope you will...

80
00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.120
change your mind before I do that.

81
00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:35.500
(Ma Yi Deum)

82
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.140
(Ma Yi Deum)

83
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.909
(Ma Yi Deum)

84
00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.899
I asked her about...

85
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.870
your mother.

86
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.539
- My mother... - I know...

87
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.510
my mom's no longer in this world.

88
00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:28.649
So?

89
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.890
What did she say?

90
00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:35.289
That she had no other choice?

91
00:07:37.859 --> 00:07:39.190
Does she want to bury...

92
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.000
what's in the past?

93
00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.870
Do you know what I'm most upset about?

94
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.209
No matter what happens, I can't understand her.

95
00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:56.209
But, maybe 20 years ago,

96
00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:59.479
let's say she couldn't help it. However,

97
00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:01.580
she met me.

98
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.190
I went to ask her with my mom's picture.

99
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.789
But she kept her mouth shut.

100
00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.890
How can anyone do that?

101
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.729
What a nerve. It's abominable.

102
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.870
I'm speechless.

103
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:28.940
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.180
I'm really sorry.

105
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:34.020
Don't be sorry.

106
00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:39.550
It's not you who should be sorry.

107
00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:43.160
Also,

108
00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:46.530
this isn't something an apology can fix.

109
00:08:47.229 --> 00:08:48.459
You know that, don't you?

110
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.270
No matter what happens,

111
00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:57.170
I'll pay your mother back...

112
00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:59.940
for what she did to my mom.

113
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.820
Can you still work with me after this?

114
00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:09.180
No, right?

115
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.790
How can you work with me when I'll make her pay?

116
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.889
Let's split up from Kong Soo Ah's case.

117
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.160
I'll take care of it by myself.

118
00:09:19.489 --> 00:09:20.729
Ms. Ma.

119
00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:22.160
From now on,

120
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.800
let's never get involved again.

121
00:09:44.089 --> 00:09:47.459
(Defendant: Ahn Tae Kyoo, Baek Min Ho)

122
00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:52.089
(Regarding the case above...)

123
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.910
(Baek Min Ho's evidence: witness, CCTV...)

124
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.450
(Ahn Tae Kyoo's evidence)

125
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.160
(Q: Min Ho? Are you referring to Baek Min Ho?)

126
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.229
(Q: Who hit her? A: It was Baek Min Ho.)

127
00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.830
Did you receive it? The glove...

128
00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:33.670
Ahn Tae Kyoo was wearing at the time.

129
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.770
I'll testify...

130
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.739
that Cho Gap Soo ordered me to kill her.

131
00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:39.209
I have evidence...

132
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.780
of him ordering the murder 14 years ago.

133
00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:44.410
I'll give it all to you.

134
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.050
Please save my brother Min Ho.

135
00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:59.190
(A: It was Baek Min Ho. Baek Min Ho did it.)

136
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:05.129
(Ahn Tae Kyoo)

137
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.170
(Spelling edited)

138
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.879
(True correction, true happiness)

139
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:47.540
Listen carefully, Min Ho.

140
00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:50.849
I intend on getting you out no matter what.

141
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.619
Why?

142
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.450
Because your brother has what I want.

143
00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:03.859
I knew it. He wouldn't just leave me here.

144
00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:05.129
Don't misunderstand.

145
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.099
I won't cover up the crimes you committed.

146
00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:12.499
Then what do I do now?

147
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.239
You have to stay focused.

148
00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:17.040
If you testify like the interrogation,

149
00:12:17.469 --> 00:12:19.469
you'll be blamed for Tae Kyoo's doings.

150
00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:20.780
Okay.

151
00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:33.660
This is the last bit.

152
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.489
Why are you showing this to me?

153
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.660
Things didn't go well with the district attorney.

154
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.469
I know you didn't see him.

155
00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.570
I know you never intended to help me from the start.

156
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.709
Are you telling me you'll go...

157
00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:56.509
and do what you want?

158
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.009
You're the one that threw me away first.

159
00:13:00.249 --> 00:13:02.119
You're the one that stabbed me in the back!

160
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.790
That notebook.

161
00:13:07.989 --> 00:13:10.060
I know you won't hand it over for free.

162
00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:12.629
I'll give you this...

163
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.160
if you give me that notebook.

164
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:16.770
If I release the video,

165
00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.300
Kingdom will be known to the world.

166
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.469
Are you telling me you'll help Min Ho...

167
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.310
while taking that into account?

168
00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:28.509
What can I do?

169
00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:32.479
Both of our lives are on the line.

170
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.359
You better make the right choice.

171
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.030
I told you earlier, right?

172
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.800
This is your last chance.

173
00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:54.400
I realized something while serving you for 20 years.

174
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.570
You would...

175
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.670
never give up something to help someone else.

176
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.739
Then...

177
00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:03.379
what is that prosecutor giving up for you?

178
00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:06.920
That prosecutor and I have an understanding.

179
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.420
Do you really want to take this all the way?

180
00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:13.420
Is that what you want?

181
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.609
What is this?

182
00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:40.820
It was mailed to CAGU this morning.

183
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.680
- Who is it from? - I don't know.

184
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.119
It came anonymously.

185
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.619
Also,

186
00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:48.690
this box...

187
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.859
must be the one with the glove from yesterday.

188
00:15:08.979 --> 00:15:12.310
(Ahn Tae Kyoo, main culprit)

189
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.749
(Baek Min Ho, accomplice)

190
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.820
(Ahn Tae Kyoo)

191
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.999
What are you doing at my desk?

192
00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:40.410
Let's talk.

193
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.109
What is this?

194
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.580
What did you do yesterday?

195
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:50.690
When did they take that?

196
00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:53.320
Why did Ahn Tae Kyoo become the main culprit?

197
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.560
You also fixed Hyun Ji Soo's testimony.

198
00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.160
What did you agree to with Baek Sang Ho?

199
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.800
I told you to take your hands off this case.

200
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.729
Don't you know what you did?

201
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.770
I got a call from Ji Soo.

202
00:16:09.599 --> 00:16:11.009
She had the glove...

203
00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:14.009
Ahn Tae Kyoo wore while hitting Soo Ah...

204
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:16.009
from that night.

205
00:16:18.849 --> 00:16:20.749
I sent the glove to the NFS.

206
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.420
If Tae Kyoo's DNA and Soo Ah's blood are found,

207
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.749
it'll become a sure evidence.

208
00:16:25.719 --> 00:16:26.920
Are you happy?

209
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.190
This is still wrong.

210
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.530
- What is? - I know you're hurt.

211
00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:33.930
I understand.

212
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.930
I'm frustrated because I can't help.

213
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.229
But what about Soo Ah's trial?

214
00:16:39.729 --> 00:16:40.800
What about it?

215
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.770
If they find the statement was fabricated,

216
00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:45.209
they'll say that the glove will not be admissible.

217
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:46.680
What will you do then?

218
00:16:46.979 --> 00:16:48.879
Because of what you did on your own,

219
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.050
we might lose the real culprit...

220
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.150
and ruin the trial!

221
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.650
Before it's too late, get off the case.

222
00:16:57.849 --> 00:16:59.589
- Why should I? - Ms. Ma!

223
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.589
I won't ruin the trial.

224
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.659
I'll put Tae Kyoo in as a murderer.

225
00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:06.490
I'll help Soo Ah take her revenge.

226
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.000
Then I have no choice. I'll have to report.

227
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.570
I can't let you ruin the case...

228
00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:16.710
for personal reasons.

229
00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:23.010
Yes?

230
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:25.679
We have the result for the glove.

231
00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:26.780
I'll come right now.

232
00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:30.419
Do as you wish.

233
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.720
I won't give up on this case.

234
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.699
We found Ahn Tae Kyoo's DNA on the glove.

235
00:17:46.939 --> 00:17:48.899
We also found Kong Soo Ah's blood.

236
00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:53.109
Yes.

237
00:17:54.609 --> 00:17:55.740
(Autopsy Report)

238
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.909
It's still a no.

239
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:59.550
You're no longer on this case.

240
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.679
I can't let you do that.

241
00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:04.149
Meeting a family member of a suspect...

242
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:06.119
disqualifies you from going to court.

243
00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:07.290
You know that already.

244
00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:08.659
I can't do that.

245
00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:10.460
I have to take this case.

246
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.830
Ms. Ma.

247
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.730
I know it's hard because of your mother.

248
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.869
Know what?

249
00:18:18.199 --> 00:18:20.740
How much do you know about my mom?

250
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:22.869
That she was abducted by Cho Gap Soo...

251
00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:24.310
while trying to report to you,

252
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.740
then being confined in a mental institute?

253
00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:30.409
Then how she was killed by Baek Sang Ho...

254
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:32.879
in case she became a problem?

255
00:18:32.879 --> 00:18:34.750
How much of it do you know?

256
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.490
Do you know why I became a prosecutor?

257
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.649
He stole my mom...

258
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.589
and made me suffer for 20 years.

259
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.359
I became a prosecutor to arrest him myself.

260
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.330
Now,

261
00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:50.399
I know exactly who he is.

262
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:53.399
Cho Gap Soo and Baek Sang Ho...

263
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:56.169
The statute of limitations for them will expire soon.

264
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.540
If I don't get Baek Sang Ho's testimony,

265
00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.810
Cho Gap Soo...

266
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.139
will get out of it just like 20 years ago.

267
00:19:02.139 --> 00:19:05.050
I'll make him pay with my own hands.

268
00:19:05.349 --> 00:19:06.379
In order to do that,

269
00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:08.949
I have to get Min Ho out of his charge.

270
00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:11.750
Before you're Young Shil's daughter,

271
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.320
you're prosecutor Ma Yi Deum.

272
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.820
Did you forget?

273
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.830
Didn't you think...

274
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.359
you might ruin Kong Soo Ah's trial?

275
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.429
I'm not turning...

276
00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:22.300
someone innocent into a criminal.

277
00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:24.970
Ahn Tae Kyoo is the main culprit.

278
00:19:25.369 --> 00:19:27.399
I will win the trial...

279
00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.000
and arrest Cho Gap Soo too.

280
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.369
You can't take both of them to court.

281
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.179
As a prosecutor,

282
00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:35.980
if you cannot be just in court,

283
00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:40.020
you have to step out.

284

Are you saying...

295
00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:02.560
we should disregard Hyun Ji Soo's testimony?

296
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.330
That's what I decided.

297
00:21:09.699 --> 00:21:11.409
Did you know about...

298
00:21:11.639 --> 00:21:13.409
Ms. Ma's mother too?

299
00:21:14.639 --> 00:21:17.280
I know how much pain she's suffering.

300
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.649
I didn't report it to you because I didn't know.

301

- Yeo. - She fabricated evidence.

302
00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:26.960
We can't cover the fact she met with his family.

303

Is this the right choice for us to make?

304

It's true what Ma did was wrong.

340
00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:21.000
In 1996, Cho Gap Soo...

341
00:23:21.369 --> 00:23:24.040
was under trial for the Hyungjae Factory Case.

342
00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:26.470
He was found innocent at the first trial...

343
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.810
when he ran into a victim...

344
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.480
named Kwak Young Shil.

345
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.849
He abducted her right away...

346
00:23:31.849 --> 00:23:33.550
and confined her at a mental institute.

347
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.179
I almost forgot about it...

348
00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:36.419
until seven years later.

349
00:23:36.689 --> 00:23:39.820
When he started politics with the Future Party,

350
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.159
he figured she might become a hindrance...

351
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.089
and ordered me to kill her.

352
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.040
The first reason why the victim died...

353
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.000
was due to cruel assault.

354
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.139
Ahn Tae Kyoo...

355
00:23:58.139 --> 00:23:59.210
(Evidence one)

356
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.609
wore this glove with studs...

357
00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:03.040
while he assaulted Kong Soo Ah.

358
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.649
She ends up...

359
00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:06.649
losing consciousness.

360
00:24:11.689 --> 00:24:13.290
(Defense)

361
00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.520
(Defendant)

362
00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:19.859
(Jury)

363
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.530
According to the NFS,

364
00:24:22.899 --> 00:24:24.500
they found Kong Soo Ah's blood...

365
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.470
and Ahn Tae Kyoo's DNA...

366
00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:28.270
on the glove.

367
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.800
I object.

368
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.240
Do you have evidence...

369
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.280
that the glove belongs to him?

370
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.780
(Defendant)

371
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.050
Do you see it?

372
00:24:47.689 --> 00:24:48.689
A.T.K.

373
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:50.790
What could it be?

374
00:24:52.689 --> 00:24:54.960
It's Ahn Tae Kyoo's initials.

375
00:24:56.129 --> 00:24:57.169
Is that good enough?

376
00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:01.439
That's all, Your Honor.

377
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.050
Sir.

378
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.909
The press is going crazy.

379
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.250
Since they released it first,

380
00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:17.750
it's all over the internet.

381
00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:20.159
Let's wait a while longer.

382
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.500
The rain will stop soon.

383
00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:31.830
Like Prosecution said,

384
00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:34.169
let's consider that the glove...

385
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.639
belongs to Ahn Tae Kyoo.

386
00:25:37.639 --> 00:25:39.839
It's the truth. Why would you assume?

387
00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:40.909
However,

388
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:44.050
we cannot conclude it proves his violence.

389
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.720
Defense, what do you mean?

390
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.580
Kong Soo Ah's blood on the glove...

391
00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:51.320
might not be from an assault.

392
00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:54.220
It's possible it got on in the process...

393
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.720
of abducting the corpse.

394
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.790
I object.

395
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.760
It's a claim she cannot substantiate.

396
00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.929
It's clouding the issue.

397
00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:00.960
I have...

398
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.730
the evidence.

399
00:26:03.869 --> 00:26:04.899
Your Honor,

400
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.169
I'd like to submit the knuckle...

401
00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:09.639
found in Ahn Tae Kyoo's scraped car.

402
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.879
This knuckle was worn...

403
00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:18.010
often by the other defendant, Baek Min Ho,

404
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.750
who has a violent nature.

405
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.720
I have never seen that in my life!

406
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.089
Quiet down.

407
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.919
On this knuckle,

408
00:26:26.349 --> 00:26:28.119
we found Baek Min Ho's DNA...

409
00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:31.790
and the victim's blood.

410
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.030
It's a fabrication!

411
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.530
I have never worn this in my life!

412
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.869
Defendant.

413
00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:38.970
Your Honor, I object.

414
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.599
Defense just said...

415
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:43.639
that Kong's blood on Ahn's glove...

416
00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:45.810
was due to moving the body.

417
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.240
That means the blood on the knuckle...

418
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.780
cannot be seen as evidence of an assault.

419
00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:51.949
Your Honor,

420
00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:55.179
I have evidence to show that this knuckle...

421
00:26:55.179 --> 00:26:56.589
was used for assault.

422
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.990
What is it?

423
00:27:02.619 --> 00:27:03.629
It's...

424
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.389
her scars.

425
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.830
The distance between each cut...

426
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.330
and the distance between the knuckles...

427
00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:13.300
match exactly.

428
00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:16.869
What could this mean?

429
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.310
The one that assaulted the victim...

430
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.609
and pushed her to death...

431
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.710
is defendant...

432
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.750
Baek Min Ho.

433
00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:29.990
What are you saying? I've never seen that before!

434
00:27:30.589 --> 00:27:33.720
Your Honor, I'm being framed!

435
00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.760
I... I've never seen that before, not even once.

436
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.129
Hey, Tae Kyoo. Tell the truth!

437
00:27:39.129 --> 00:27:41.000
- Calm down. - Tell the truth, you rat!

438
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.730
- Calm down. - Hey!

439
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:45.099
Keep it down!

440
00:27:58.879 --> 00:28:02.349
Prosecution. Reevaluate the case a little more,

441
00:28:02.879 --> 00:28:06.790
and revise the indictment of Baek Min Ho.

442
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.530
We will continue the trial thereafter.

443
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.699
We will adjourn until the same time tomorrow.

444
00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.010
Ma'am.

445
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.050
What's going on?

446
00:28:35.349 --> 00:28:38.520
Why did the trial end like this?

447
00:28:39.859 --> 00:28:43.290
Didn't those jerks do bad things?

448
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.899
Then can't you just punish them both?

449
00:28:47.199 --> 00:28:48.800
What's the problem...

450
00:28:48.899 --> 00:28:51.500
that you're stalling like this?

451
00:28:52.599 --> 00:28:54.540
Ma'am, the thing is...

452
00:28:57.939 --> 00:29:00.909
I'm Shin Kyung Tae with Internal Affairs.

453
00:29:01.179 --> 00:29:03.609
I have some questions. Please come with us.

454
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.550
Questions about what?

455
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.250
What's going on?

456
00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:12.389
I'm the chief prosecutor of CAGU, Min Ji Sook.

457
00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:21.530
Don't worry.

458
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.830
We'll lock them both up at the trial tomorrow.

459
00:29:23.869 --> 00:29:24.929
Okay.

460
00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:27.470
Let's go.

461
00:29:36.494 --> 00:29:39.726
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E10 Witch's Court "Ahn versus Baek"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

462
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.879
Take a look.

463
00:29:45.419 --> 00:29:48.460
What is your relationship with Baek Sang Ho?

464
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.189
Nothing much.

465
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.460
Why did you meet the defendant's family?

466
00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:57.669
I ran into him by chance.

467
00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:03.070
If there's no relationship and you met by chance,

468
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.609
why did you change the testimony?

469
00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:17.889
- I can't remember. - What are you doing?

470
00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:21.320
Look. You're doing this out of order.

471
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.859
Shouldn't you look into who took these...

472
00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:25.589
and why they sent them to you first?

473
00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:27.000
Ma Yi Deum.

474
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.500
Answer the question.

475
00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.830
Not until you tell me who sent in these photos.

476
00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:36.169
I'll assert my right to remain silent.

477
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:42.080
Fine. You try that.

478
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.919
It's over.

479
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.089
It's really over for me now.

480
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.790
- Min Ho. - You saw.

481
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.699
How could we beat them? They can make up anything.

482
00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:10.710
I mean... Does this make any sense?

483
00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:14.780
I'm going to rot in jail for at least 20 years,

484
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.980
but Tae Kyoo will live like nothing happened.

485
00:31:26.189 --> 00:31:27.359
What is this?

486
00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:31.659
(Deed)

487
00:31:32.129 --> 00:31:33.300
Do you remember?

488
00:31:35.129 --> 00:31:36.530
That house with the tree that you liked...

489
00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:40.500
that we saw on the way to the market...

490
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:41.869
when you were little.

491
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.570
You said you'd make a lot of money and buy it...

492
00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:45.869
when you grew up.

493
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.879
Sang Ho. This house is really nice.

494
00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:52.310
That tree is super nice too.

495
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.790
Later on, I'll make lots and lots of money...

496
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.619
and buy this house.

497
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.689
Then we will live here for a long time, okay?

498
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.159
Okay?

499
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.300
Sure. Let's live here for a long time.

500
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.629
I couldn't wait any longer...

501
00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:13.970
and bought that house.

502
00:32:14.169 --> 00:32:17.270
What are you saying? Didn't you hear me?

503
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.540
My life...

504
00:32:25.349 --> 00:32:27.020
is completely over.

505
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.990
No. It isn't over yet.

506
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.490
Min Ho.

507
00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:41.159
Listen to me.

508
00:32:42.099 --> 00:32:43.629
We have one last shot.

509
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.070
I swear I'll get you out.

510
00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.210
It's Baek Sang Ho.

511
00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.280
I'll give you my planner. Where should I go?

512
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.790
Sang Ho.

513
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.990
Where did you say you lived?

514
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.199
Things are a big mess.

515
00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:18.699
You may end up getting hurt by this too.

516
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.099
I'm worried for you.

517
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:23.070
Why don't you just dump that prosecutor?

518
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.810
What happened with Ms. Ma?

519
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.179
It won't be easy.

520
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.189
Ahn Tae Kyoo's side must be behind...

521
00:33:37.189 --> 00:33:38.790
the photos and testimony.

522
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.760
Perhaps.

523
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:44.929
I'll go to NFS.

524
00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:48.599
I'll check if the knuckle glove evidence is real.

525
00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:56.270
Knuckle?

526
00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.439
I don't remember seeing it.

527
00:34:00.109 --> 00:34:03.139
If we had received it, I would've seen it.

528
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.379
The technician listed was Jung Young Ho.

529
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.580
He took a personal day today.

530
00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.989
- Pardon? - I'll tell him to call...

531
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.750
when he comes in tomorrow.

532
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:25.869
Hello?

533
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.900
You said you needed to see me?

534
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.440
I heard Ms. Ma Yi Deum was unreachable.

535
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.580
What do you want to tell me?

536
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.420
My brother says...

537
00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:48.159
he has a video that could be evidence.

538
00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.159
A video?

539
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.029
Of that night.

540
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.330
A video of Tae Kyoo hitting her that night.

541
00:34:57.299 --> 00:35:00.340
My brother says he'll take the stand tomorrow...

542
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.340
and show the video then since we don't know...

543
00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:05.869
what they'll do if we submit it beforehand.

544
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.940
I really...

545
00:35:11.009 --> 00:35:12.480
didn't do it.

546
00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:16.619
That video will prove it. So please,

547
00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:21.219
call my brother to testify tomorrow...

548
00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:24.090
at the trial.

549
00:35:39.569 --> 00:35:40.779
Hello, sir.

550
00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.849
Sang Ho.

551
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.119
Is this how you've lived?

552
00:35:49.449 --> 00:35:50.549
Yes.

553
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.989
You and I...

554
00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.730
both lived lonely lives.

555
00:36:09.699 --> 00:36:10.770
Here it is.

556
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.290
Sang Ho.

557
00:36:31.259 --> 00:36:32.929
I'm sorry.

558
00:36:33.929 --> 00:36:35.960
That's not necessary.

559
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.969
No.

560
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.869
I really mean it.

561
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.940
I know what Min Ho means to you.

562
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.610
After your mom left when he was a baby,

563
00:36:51.009 --> 00:36:53.150
you raised him like he was your son.

564
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.849
But I took Tae Kyoo's side instead of him.

565
00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:00.989
You must've been so angry.

566
00:37:01.989 --> 00:37:03.690
But Sang Ho,

567
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.900
can't you trust me just one more time?

568
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.830
You know, right?

569
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.900
I barely got here after all this time...

570
00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.710
without any connections or support.

571
00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:19.069
I still have so much to do.

572
00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.440
I can't fall for no reason...

573
00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.009
for something that's in the past.

574
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.750
Gap Soo.

575
00:37:43.529 --> 00:37:44.670
Are you telling me...

576
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.500
to take the fall...

577
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.540
once again?

578
00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.840
You're the only one...

579
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.610
who can save me,

580
00:37:52.969 --> 00:37:54.639
and I'm the only person...

581
00:37:55.409 --> 00:37:56.980
who can save Min Ho.

582
00:38:00.049 --> 00:38:02.119
This is neither an order...

583
00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:03.690
or a threat.

584
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.520
As a friend who cherishes you,

585
00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.190
I'm asking you for this favor.

586
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.690
Can't you do it?

587
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.929
Sang Ho.

588
00:38:17.299 --> 00:38:18.330
I promise...

589
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.540
to save Min Ho.

590
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.440
So...

591
00:38:24.139 --> 00:38:26.880
please save me just this once.

592
00:38:35.319 --> 00:38:40.319
(Confession)

593
00:38:40.319 --> 00:38:46.130
(I, Baek Sang Ho)

594
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:47.830
Sang Ho.

595
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:51.199
Thank you.

596
00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:21.199
(Ma Yi Deum made me lie.)

597
00:39:45.849 --> 00:39:48.020

(Defendant)

604
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.849
Prosecutor. Is your witness here?

605
00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:17.349
Please give him another minute.

606
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.690
He'll be here soon.

607
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.259
Your Honor.

608
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.759
Isn't it a waste of time to wait for a witness...

609
00:40:22.759 --> 00:40:24.259
who isn't coming?

610
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.199
The prosecutor hasn't revised the indictment...

611
00:40:27.199 --> 00:40:29.599
using the witness as an excuse.

612
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.299
Prosecutor.

613
00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.239
He died...

614
00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:34.770
because of the prosecutor.

615
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.670
Baek Min Ho's brother?

616
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.540
That's right. His brother.

617
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.710
He really died.

618
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.310
It's his brother.

619
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.480
What?

620
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.849
He died.

621
00:40:53.049 --> 00:40:54.460
Quiet down.

622
00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.630
Prosecutor.

623
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.630
Is your witness...

624
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.730
Baek Min Ho's brother,

625
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.599
Baek Sang Ho?

626
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:10.670
Yes, it is.

627
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.040
Baek Sang Ho...

628
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.310
was just found dead.

629
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.630
I, Baek Sang Ho,

630
00:41:36.799 --> 00:41:38.900
lied in order to save my brother...

631
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.400
who is on trial...

632
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.940
because of Ma Yi Deum, the prosecutor.

633
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.270
The recording that I abducted, locked up,

634
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.679
and murdered Kwak Young Shil...

635
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.779
was a lie coerced by Ma Yi Deum.

636
00:41:51.279 --> 00:41:54.049
I declare that Cho Gap Soo is innocent...

637
00:41:54.549 --> 00:41:55.920
in it all.

638
00:41:57.049 --> 00:41:58.750
Everything above...

639
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:00.920
is true.

640
00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.960
The brother of Baek on trial for murder,

641
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.690
Baek Sang Ho,

642
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.960
was found dead in his house.

643
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.929
His suicide note states...

644
00:42:09.929 --> 00:42:12.230
he was threatened by Ma, the prosecutor...

645
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.969
on his brother's case.

646
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.810
Cho Gap Soo, who was especially close to Baek,

647
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.009
canceled his campaign schedule...

648
00:42:20.009 --> 00:42:21.480
to show his respects...

649
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.380
and showed deep sorrow.

650
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.849
Sang Ho...

651
00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:35.889
He says Ma Yi Deum...

652
00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:38.460
had been pressuring him...

653
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.860
to lie if necessary,

654
00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:42.929
to create a political scandal.

655
00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.799
To create evidence,

656
00:42:46.799 --> 00:42:47.969
even if it's fake,

657
00:42:47.969 --> 00:42:49.400
to save his brother.

658
00:42:51.509 --> 00:42:54.139
Sang Ho was unable to endure this...

659
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.549
and took his own life.

660
00:42:57.549 --> 00:43:00.020
Why didn't anyone stop that prosecutor?

661
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:03.190
What was...

662
00:43:03.949 --> 00:43:05.989
the prosecutors' office doing this entire time?

663
00:43:06.889 --> 00:43:08.389
Baek Min Ho...

664
00:43:08.659 --> 00:43:10.690
assaulted the victim for a prolonged time...

665
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:13.299
while raping her, causing her death.

666
00:43:13.429 --> 00:43:16.330
He disposed of the body in order to cover up...

667
00:43:16.529 --> 00:43:18.830
his crime. These are heinous crimes.

668
00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:22.040
However, he shows no remorse for his crimes,

669
00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:23.639
but rather,

670
00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:27.040
accused Ahn Tae Kyoo who was with him.

671
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.210
His actions cannot be tolerated.

672
00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.520
Thus,

673
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.520
I accept the jury's unanimous vote...

674
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.290
and declare the following.

675
00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:40.060
Defendant...

676
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.630
Baek Min Ho is sentenced to 18 years in prison.

677
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.190
Ahn Tae Kyoo...

678
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.960
admitted to aiding and abetting,

679
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.699

689

698

699
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.500
Yes.

700
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.540
I ordered her to alter the testimony as well.

701
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.110

It may not end with demotion...

706

Just quit on your own before you're fired.
