00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.106
(for viewers under the age of 12.)

3
00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:09.253
(1hour before situational outbreak)

4
00:00:10.323 --> 00:00:12.183
(It's a peaceful morning at the twin's.)

5
00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:13.823
(What's with their hair?)

6
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:17.855
Their new hairstyle doesn't seem unfamiliar.

7
00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.355
They once woke up to a new bowl cut.

8
00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:25.395
(They've been maintaining it as a yearly custom.)

9
00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:27.134
This was the second lovely bowl cut.

10
00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:28.695
The bangs used to be straighter.

11
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.704
The third bowl cut looks mischievous.

12
00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:36.344
This year, they look a bit more grown up.

13
00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.204
- Mom. - Yes?

14
00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.574
- Open this for us, mom. - Can we have a bite...

15
00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:42.714
of the chocolate bun?

16
00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.915
- It'll be mealtime soon. - Just one bite.

17
00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:46.115
(He makes an ardent request.)

18
00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:48.155
I'll just take a bite.

19
00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:50.485
Me too.

20
00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:52.024
Just one bite, okay?

21
00:00:52.024 --> 00:00:53.394
(They received approval.)

22
00:00:53.394 --> 00:00:56.064
Let's share it. I want a bite too.

23
00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.564
You have to make sure to eat during mealtime.

24
00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:01.935
- Both of you, okay? - All right.

25
00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:08.475
(Seo Jun takes one bite.)

26
00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:11.145
(Devouring)

27
00:01:12.645 --> 00:01:15.345
(Now, this is it.)

28
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:20.055
(He becomes infatuated over the bun.)

29
00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:22.755
(To Seo Eon, it's very special.)

30
00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:26.024
He fatefully encountered it first at Vietnam.

31
00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:27.324
(He had it for the first time at Vietnam.)

32
00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.494
Seo Eon is in love with chocolate buns.

33
00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:34.794
It's even present in his dreams.

34
00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:40.805
Since then, his fondness for it has been constant.

35
00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:42.574
(Licking)

36
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.374
Come eat now, Seo Eon.

37
00:01:48.044 --> 00:01:49.915
(He responds to his mom's call.)

38
00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:52.115
(But he heads to the bedroom instead?)

39
00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:54.555
Seo Eon.

40
00:01:56.354 --> 00:01:58.624
Stop eating and come over.

41
00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.665
(My bread can rest on my bed.)

42
00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:06.395
- Thank you for the meal. - Okay.

43
00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:09.505
You mix it all up first...

44
00:02:10.204 --> 00:02:12.435
(Taking a big bite)

45
00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:15.435
Bring your head closer for the bite.

46
00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.875
- I need to go pee. - Okay. Go ahead.

47
00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:20.475
- This is hot. - Blow on it.

48
00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:22.215
(Seo Eon's footsteps are urgent.)

49
00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:27.454
(Why did he pass the bathroom?)

50
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:34.294
(Sweet and savory, kimchi plus chocolate bread)

51
00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:37.764
Finish your food before you go.

52
00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.364
Thank you for the meal.

53
00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:43.704
(30 minutes ago)

54
00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:47.475
(Is there anything fun to do?)

55
00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:58.345
(Are you up to mischief?)

56
00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:02.584
(I'm going to hurry back to my chocolate bun.)

57
00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:04.984
All right. Eat the kimchi now.

58
00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:08.725

59

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:16.204
(They are fixated on a cartoon after eating.)

61
00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.905
Be well, okay?

62
00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:23.275
(Don't worry, mom.)

63
00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:28.345
(Their 48 hours without their mom begins.)

64
00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:34.185
(Gosh. It's so noisy.)

65
00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:39.595
(5 minutes before situational outbreak)

66
00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:45.695
I'm going to air out the room,

67
00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:47.035
so don't close the window.

68
00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:48.095
Okay.

69
00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.864
Stop watching TV now.

70
00:03:50.704 --> 00:03:52.875
You've watched it non-stop since before mom left.

71
00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.435
(Then, how should I play now?)

72
00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.975
Stop watching TV now.

73
00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:02.745
(He chooses to play with toys instead.)

74
00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:08.954
Seo Eon discovers Seo Jun's chocolate bun.

75
00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:11.584
(Oh, that's right. I have some too.)

76
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.294
Chocolate bun time.

77
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:15.965
(My dear, chocolate bun)

78
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:18.994
But where has Seo Eon's chocolate bun gone?

79
00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:22.095
(It has vanished without a trace.)

80
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.665
Daddy.

81
00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:26.535
Seo Eon's chocolate bread has disappeared.

82
00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.934
Where's my chocolate bun?

83
00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:30.845
(Where have you gone?)

84
00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:34.244
Seo Jun's is the only one left.

85
00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:35.314
(Seo Jun's chocolate bun)

86
00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:38.614
His look hides an ulterior motive.

87
00:04:40.484 --> 00:04:42.215
The chocolate bun has disappeared.

88
00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.225
No one else has entered the house.

89
00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:50.165
The only possible culprit is either dad and Seo Jun.

90
00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:54.794
Who ate my chocolate bun?

91
00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.104
It wasn't me.

92
00:04:58.234 --> 00:05:00.434
(You didn't eat it?)

93
00:05:01.504 --> 00:05:03.444
(Well, I did take a bite.)

94
00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:06.275
Did you lose something, Seo Eon?

95
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:07.915
My chocolate bun.

96
00:05:07.944 --> 00:05:09.544
Chocolate bun?

97
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.885
Where did you put it?

98
00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:13.655
It was in the bedroom, but it's gone.

99
00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:15.085
The bedroom?

100
00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:17.155
Seo Jun, help him find it.

101
00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:19.225
I don't want to.

102
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.854
- What? - I don't want to.

103
00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:24.494
(Why is he refusing to help?)

104
00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.234
Well, you should still help him.

105
00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:29.405
I don't want to.

106
00:05:29.734 --> 00:05:32.304
(Seo Jun appears at the scene of the crime.)

107
00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:35.804
(Something seems to occupy his mind.)

108
00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:37.674
Hey, Seo Eon.

109
00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.575
Was your bun new?

110
00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:41.744
(Nodding side-to-side)

111
00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:43.114
Was it leftovers?

112
00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:47.114
(You should know since we got it together.)

113
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:55.194
(Seo Jun suddenly fetches his own bun.)

114
00:05:58.265 --> 00:05:59.364
Here.

115
00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:01.294
(Here)

116
00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:06.075
(What's going on?)

117
00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:10.205
(What's up with the troublemaker today?)

118
00:06:10.205 --> 00:06:14.275
Did you try looking for it everywhere, Seo Eon?

119
00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:15.345
Yes.

120
00:06:16.244 --> 00:06:22.254
(It still remains missing.)

121
00:06:24.124 --> 00:06:26.754
(Then, perhaps...)

122
00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:29.294
Are you sure you didn't eat it, Dad?

123
00:06:29.294 --> 00:06:31.624
Me? You think I'd eat your bun?

124
00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:34.135
Think about it, Seo Eon.

125
00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:42.744
(Is Hwi Jae the culprit?)

126
00:06:43.575 --> 00:06:46.145
If I really ate your bun,

127
00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:48.775
then I'll do everything you want today.

128
00:06:48.814 --> 00:06:50.585
But it wasn't me.

129
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:52.614
Really?

130
00:06:52.754 --> 00:06:54.085
Of course.

131
00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:58.484
The uncle in the playroom is chewing something.

132
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.725
(What?)

133
00:07:02.194 --> 00:07:05.025
The three cameramen are extra suspects.

134
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:08.135
(Walking quickly)

135
00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:09.535
Open your mouth.

136
00:07:09.535 --> 00:07:10.705
(Open your mouth.)

137
00:07:12.674 --> 00:07:14.734
(Peeking inside)

138

(This forensic detective uses his five senses.)

139
00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:20.575
(I don't catch a hint of chocolate.)

140
00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:24.684
Uncle, did you eat my chocolate bun?

141
00:07:25.015 --> 00:07:26.415
I didn't eat it.

142
00:07:26.754 --> 00:07:29.285
(He storms the tent for a search.)

143
00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:30.525
I really didn't eat it.

144
00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:33.655
Open your mouth.

145
00:07:34.794 --> 00:07:36.265
(Sniffing)

146
00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:39.765
(Something smells familiar.)

147
00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.304
(Flaring)

148
00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:46.734
I smell dried squid.

149
00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:50.405
Did you eat dried squid?

150
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.544
Yes, I did.

151
00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:54.114
You guessed right.

152
00:07:54.614 --> 00:07:57.385
(Detective Seo Eon, sniffing expert)

153

(This smell...)

156
00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:10.494
- Is that mango juice? - Yes.

157
00:08:10.494 --> 00:08:12.835
He said he had mango juice.

158
00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:14.595
(His olfactory abilities are top notch.)

159
00:08:16.104 --> 00:08:18.535
If none of them ate it,

160
00:08:18.934 --> 00:08:21.035
where could the bun have gone?

161
00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:25.345
It's not here.

162
00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:30.285
(Tag team)

163
00:08:34.554 --> 00:08:38.084
(Seo Eon gradually becomes drained.)

164
00:08:38.824 --> 00:08:40.224
I found it.

165
00:08:40.224 --> 00:08:41.824
- What? - I found it.

Where was it?

169

It was in the fridge.

170
00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:52.304
(It's an emotional reunion with the bun.)

171
00:08:52.304 --> 00:08:54.174
Thank him. You should give him a hug.

172
00:08:54.174 --> 00:08:55.304
Thank you.

173
00:08:55.304 --> 00:08:57.745
(Thank you.)

174
00:08:59.074 --> 00:09:01.245
Hi-five. Good job.

175
00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:02.915
(The case of the missing bun, solved)

176
00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:07.615
But how did this end up in the fridge?

177
00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.054
I don't know.

178
00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:12.184
Well, mom gave them to us.

179
00:09:12.554 --> 00:09:14.855
Maybe she put it in.

180
00:09:15.324 --> 00:09:17.025
Can I call mom?

181
00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:19.235
Sure. Shall we ring her up?

182
00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.635
(This sure tastes good.)

183
00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:25.905
Hello? Seo Jun?

184
00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:27.275
Mommy.

185
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.674
Yes, Seo Eon?

186
00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:32.615
Did you put the chocolate bun into the fridge?

187
00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.074
Yes. Earlier,

188
00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:38.915
I placed it in there in case it melts...

189
00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:41.285
or gets ruined.

190
00:09:41.454 --> 00:09:44.054
She put it in there to make sure it didn’t melt.

191
00:09:45.454 --> 00:09:48.755
(She discovers the bread on top of the bed.)

192
00:09:49.294 --> 00:09:52.365
(That is how it ended up in the fridge.)

193
00:09:54.165 --> 00:09:55.395
Mommy.

194
00:09:56.834 --> 00:10:00.005
Thank you for looking after it.

195
00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:02.704
(He tears up.)

196
00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:06.074
I love you, mommy.

197
00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:09.314
I love you too, Seo Eon.

198
00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:12.954
The three siblings visit Jeonju's Nambu Market.

199
00:10:13.255 --> 00:10:16.355
It's hot. Be careful.

200
00:10:17.824 --> 00:10:20.054
None of these have been seasoned.

201
00:10:20.054 --> 00:10:21.954
Make sure to put in the pickled shrimp.

202
00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:24.924
Take a look. This is sundaeguk.

203
00:10:25.294 --> 00:10:26.735
You're eating well, Si An.

204
00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:28.194
You all have mature taste buds.

205
00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:32.804
(Si An has gained a taste for sundaeguk.)

206
00:10:33.775 --> 00:10:34.834
(Gobbling away)

207
00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:36.605
- Daddy. - Yes?

208
00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:39.714
This is so good.

209
00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:41.174
It's very tasty?

210
00:10:41.944 --> 00:10:43.844
You eat kkakdugi?

211
00:10:45.214 --> 00:10:47.954
- Do you want more? - Soo A and Seol A...

212
00:10:47.954 --> 00:10:50.454
don't wash their kkakdugi.

213
00:10:50.454 --> 00:10:51.755
Really?

214
00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:53.655
(She gently places the red-hot piece on top.)

215
00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.324
(The trio really know how to eat.)

216
00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.665
You sure know how to eat.

217
00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:02.265
I don't worry about you Soo A.

218
00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:05.204
I don't worry about taking you around at all.

219
00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:08.334
All right. Let's all sit.

220
00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.474
Okay, take a seat.

221
00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:12.304
Everyone, take a seat.

222
00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.944
These are filled with 5-dollar bills.

223
00:11:14.944 --> 00:11:16.615
This is five dollars, right?

224
00:11:16.615 --> 00:11:19.214
You can buy whatever you want.

225
00:11:19.214 --> 00:11:20.785
But it must all stay below 5 dollars.

226
00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:22.525
How about me?

227
00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:23.824
I have one for you too.

228
00:11:23.824 --> 00:11:25.824
How much is in here, Si An?

229
00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:28.194
Five dollars.

230
00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:29.865
- Five dollars. - There you go.

231
00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:31.964
That's a lot of money for you guys.

232
00:11:31.964 --> 00:11:34.365
Daddy, I want to hurry and shop.

233
00:11:34.365 --> 00:11:35.865
All right. Let's go.

234
00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:39.875
Just remember that I'm always watching you.

235
00:11:39.934 --> 00:11:41.635
I'm always watching, okay?

236
00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:44.775
I'm watching you, like this.

237
00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:45.804
- Okay. - All right.

238
00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:47.544
Okay, be on your way now.

239
00:11:47.544 --> 00:11:48.745
Buy what you want.

240
00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:50.745
You don't have to get me anything.

241
00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:53.915
You don't have to buy me a gift.

242
00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:56.485
- Really? - Yes.

243
00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:59.724
Let's go over there where the gifts are.

244
00:12:01.355 --> 00:12:04.365
Where did Soo A the Eater choose for her first stop?

245
00:12:04.365 --> 00:12:06.064
(She arrives at a slushie shop.)

246
00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:07.934
Would you like one of these?

247
00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:09.905
What design would you like?

248
00:12:09.905 --> 00:12:10.934
This one?

249
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:14.135
She'd definitely choose a sweet snack.

250
00:12:14.974 --> 00:12:16.704
(Give me a lot, please.)

251
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.674
(And what is that?)

252
00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:22.684
How much was that?

253
00:12:22.684 --> 00:12:24.544
- 4 dollars. - 4 dollars?

254
00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:25.855
4 dollars.

255
00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:28.855
Thank you.

256
00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:32.025
Seol A and Soo A spend their money in one go.

257
00:12:34.424 --> 00:12:37.924
(This is tasty.)

258
00:12:39.235 --> 00:12:42.735
But it's good to see them sharing.

259
00:12:44.605 --> 00:12:46.074
(Si An is still browsing.)

260
00:12:46.074 --> 00:12:48.035
I want to...

261
00:12:48.505 --> 00:12:52.105
eat something tasty.

262
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:54.714
What is that?

263
00:12:56.115 --> 00:12:59.515
Is it fish? Is it a shark?

264
00:13:00.755 --> 00:13:03.385
(Hello. I'm a pollack.)

265
00:13:04.424 --> 00:13:06.895
(What kind of place is this?)

266
00:13:06.895 --> 00:13:10.025
(He visits a clothing store.)

267
00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.135
Should I buy something for Mommy?

268
00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:19.474
(Looking about)

269
00:13:19.804 --> 00:13:21.574
Hello.

270
00:13:21.574 --> 00:13:24.275
Hello. Aren't you Daebak?

271
00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:26.415
- I'm Si An. - You're not?

272
00:13:26.474 --> 00:13:28.214
- I'm Si An. - Si An?

273
00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:30.214
Who's that?

274
00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:33.615
(No, that's not it.)

275
00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.454
(You're so cute.)

276
00:13:37.324 --> 00:13:38.525
You're so cute.

277
00:13:38.525 --> 00:13:40.324
- Hello. - Hello there.

278
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.995
What are these?

279
00:13:43.064 --> 00:13:44.365
They're sweet potato stalks.

280
00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:46.834
Sweet potato stalks.

281
00:13:47.365 --> 00:13:50.135
- Sweet potato stalks? - Yes.

282
00:13:50.304 --> 00:13:51.564
Where are you from?

283
00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:54.605
- I came from over there. - From over there?

284
00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:56.674
Thank you for paying me a visit.

285
00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:00.245
(What's over here?)

286
00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:03.184
(He discovers a market.)

287
00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:08.714
(He bops about thinking of chocolate.)

288
00:14:10.824 --> 00:14:13.424
(He keeps going without pausing.)

289
00:14:13.424 --> 00:14:15.054
Here it is.

290
00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:16.895
Here it is.

291
00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:18.765
(He has acquired a chocolate.)

292
00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:24.535
I can hear the chocolate inside.

293
00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:28.974
- How much is it? - A dollar and 50 cents.

294
00:14:29.444 --> 00:14:31.745
I have the money in here.

295
00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:33.745
(He opens his wallet for the first time.)

296
00:14:35.415 --> 00:14:36.515
Is that from your mom?

297
00:14:36.684 --> 00:14:38.785
- My dad gave it to me. - Your father? I see.

298
00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:41.655
Here you go.

299
00:14:42.525 --> 00:14:44.255
- Thank you. - Bye.

300
00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:49.724
(He sits himself at an in-store table.)

301
00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:53.635
I should eat it here before I go.

302
00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:58.105
It's chocolate.

303
00:14:59.204 --> 00:15:01.674
(Shall I give it a taste?)

304
00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:04.405
(Bump)

305
00:15:05.574 --> 00:15:07.775
(Feeling urgently flustered)

306
00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:13.415
(He employs his armpit.)

307
00:15:13.755 --> 00:15:16.224
(He pushes it back with his elbow.)

308
00:15:19.924 --> 00:15:22.964
(Humans must use tools.)

309
00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.365
Why isn't this...

310
00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:27.464
staying on top?

311
00:15:29.735 --> 00:15:32.704
(He eventually uses his hand.)

312
00:15:34.074 --> 00:15:36.444
(How about this time?)

313
00:15:38.574 --> 00:15:41.674
(He scores by lowering his head.)

314
00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:44.915
This is good.

315
00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:49.625
(He is full of happiness.)

316
00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:52.625
I should finish it before Dad sees it.

317
00:15:54.324 --> 00:15:57.424
(He enjoys his 1-dollar-and-50-joy.)

318
00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.665
(He even scrapes it clean.)

319
00:16:00.665 --> 00:16:02.194
I'm done.

320
00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:05.735
(He even recycles.)

321
00:16:05.735 --> 00:16:07.974
I should go back to Daddy now.

322
00:16:12.844 --> 00:16:14.015
Hey, Si An.

323
00:16:15.314 --> 00:16:17.385
Si An.

324
00:16:17.985 --> 00:16:19.954
I found daddy.

325
00:16:20.285 --> 00:16:21.584
It's not me.

326
00:16:21.885 --> 00:16:24.285
- It's you, daddy. - It's not.

327
00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:26.294
- It's not. - Daddy.

328
00:16:26.294 --> 00:16:27.924
You're right. It's me.

329
00:16:28.094 --> 00:16:30.025
What did you buy? Let's see it.

330
00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:32.365
What did you buy?

331
00:16:32.665 --> 00:16:34.194
It's a secret.

332
00:16:34.365 --> 00:16:35.865
What's a secret. Come over here.

333
00:16:35.865 --> 00:16:37.334
No. Do you have money?

334
00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:39.505
- Come sit here. - I want to eat this.

335
00:16:39.505 --> 00:16:41.375
No, you don't have money.

336
00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:43.875
- I have money. - Sit over here.

337
00:16:43.944 --> 00:16:45.775
I have money right here.

338
00:16:46.275 --> 00:16:48.415
You still have a lot of money left.

339
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.515
Excuse me.

340
00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:52.885
Excuse me.

341
00:16:54.755 --> 00:16:57.054
- Can I get one? - Don't ask me for help.

342
00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.155
Do you have four dollars?

343
00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.194
(It's not possible with 3 dollars and 50 cents.)

344
00:17:03.194 --> 00:17:06.295
- You need another dollar. - It's not enough.

345
00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:08.034
- Ask the owner. - You need four dollars.

346
00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:09.565
- 4 dollars? - Yes, 4 dollars.

347
00:17:09.704 --> 00:17:11.264
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:17.174
(I wanted it.)

349
00:17:17.174 --> 00:17:19.244
- What's for two dollars? - That would be this.

350
00:17:19.244 --> 00:17:21.815
You can have this. This one's possible.

351
00:17:22.444 --> 00:17:24.284
I just need two of these.

352
00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:26.184
Two.

353
00:17:27.555 --> 00:17:29.055
Hey, Si An.

354
00:17:29.254 --> 00:17:32.024
What did Seol and Soo A go to buy? Where are they?

355
00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:35.724
They must be spending all their money.

356
00:17:35.724 --> 00:17:37.694
This is too cold.

357
00:17:37.694 --> 00:17:39.335
It's too cold?

358
00:17:40.764 --> 00:17:42.494
- It's too cold. - It's too cold.

359
00:17:42.565 --> 00:17:44.534
Gosh. It's cold.

360
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.204
(Meanwhile, the sisters return.)

361
00:17:47.204 --> 00:17:48.504
How much do you have left?

362
00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:51.045
(It's counting time.)

363
00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:52.845
I have the same amount.

364
00:17:53.014 --> 00:17:55.615
I have what's left over.

365
00:17:55.615 --> 00:17:56.645
Is that leftover change?

366
00:17:56.815 --> 00:17:59.355
I have a lot left over.

367
00:17:59.984 --> 00:18:02.625
(Where is it?)

368
00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.585
(Feeling nervous)

369
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.095
I don't have mine.

370
00:18:07.694 --> 00:18:09.724
- What did you lose? - My ring.

371
00:18:10.325 --> 00:18:11.365
Wear it.

372
00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:13.365
(Soo A's ring...)

373
00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:16.805
(On their past birthday)

374
00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.835
(Dong Kook prepared a chicken-shaped cake.)

375
00:18:19.305 --> 00:18:20.905
(What is that?)

376
00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:24.004
For their birthdays, they received...

377
00:18:24.004 --> 00:18:26.214
handcrafted rings made by Dong Kook.

378
00:18:27.014 --> 00:18:30.085
She wore it earlier. Where did it go?

379
00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.254
I gave it to you for your birthday.

380
00:18:33.254 --> 00:18:34.484
Right?

381
00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:35.784
Is it in your pocket?

382
00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:38.825
There's a hole in your pocket.

383
00:18:40.795 --> 00:18:43.194
(Oh, no.)

384
00:18:43.194 --> 00:18:44.325
Give me your ring.

385
00:18:45.565 --> 00:18:47.194
It looks like this. Take a good look.

386
00:18:47.464 --> 00:18:48.635
It looks like this.

387
00:18:48.635 --> 00:18:50.605
You saw it right, Si An?

388
00:18:50.934 --> 00:18:54.174
We'll head this way...

389
00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:55.944
so you head that way, Si An.

390
00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:58.174
Tell me if you find it.

391
00:18:58.444 --> 00:19:00.415
I'll go find it.

392
00:19:03.284 --> 00:19:05.615
(He searches every corner thoroughly.)

393
00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:08.885
(He employs a hand magnifying glass.)

394
00:19:11.224 --> 00:19:14.024
(He searches every nook and cranny.)

395
00:19:14.024 --> 00:19:16.065
Did it fall in there?

396
00:19:17.964 --> 00:19:21.234
It's not here. I thought it might be here.

397
00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:26.575
(Meanwhile, what are the sisters doing?)

398
00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:29.345
Where is it?

399
00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:30.875
(Where can it be?)

400
00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.674
Have you not seen a ring?

401
00:19:33.915 --> 00:19:36.415
A ring? I haven't seen it.

402
00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.915
- This one. - You're wearing it.

403
00:19:38.915 --> 00:19:40.055
It looks like this.

404
00:19:40.115 --> 00:19:42.724
Go ask your mom to get you another one.

405
00:19:43.524 --> 00:19:45.825
(Sighing)

406
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:50.524
(What if I can't find it?)

407
00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:55.234
(Si An takes a bathroom break.)

408
00:19:56.565 --> 00:19:58.764
(Cameraman says, "Are you going to pee?")

409
00:20:00.335 --> 00:20:02.905
(He does his business with his help.)

410
00:20:04.004 --> 00:20:08.274
(I'm off to search for the ring again.)

411
00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:12.855
(What's this?)

412
00:20:12.855 --> 00:20:14.014
I found it.

413
00:20:17.055 --> 00:20:20.325
Soo A dropped it here.

414
00:20:20.454 --> 00:20:21.924
This is Soo A's.

415
00:20:22.524 --> 00:20:24.395
How did it end up here?

416
00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:28.565
I should head back now.

417
00:20:29.034 --> 00:20:30.434
This is exciting.

418
00:20:30.934 --> 00:20:33.504
I found it.

419
00:20:33.575 --> 00:20:36.045
I found it.

420
00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:40.214
(Feeling excited)

421
00:20:40.415 --> 00:20:41.674
Hey, Si An.

422
00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:44.345
- I found it, Daddy. - Where was it?

423
00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:45.545
It's over here.

424
00:20:45.984 --> 00:20:47.415
- Who found it. - I did.

425
00:20:47.415 --> 00:20:48.714
Did you now?

426
00:20:49.825 --> 00:20:52.155
There it is. You really found it.

427
00:20:52.155 --> 00:20:53.855
(Here is the ring.)

428
00:20:54.555 --> 00:20:56.964
(Feeling proud)

429
00:20:57.865 --> 00:21:01.165
I found it over there.

430
00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:05.335
- They're back. - Did he find it?

431
00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:07.105
(Take the ring, Soo A.)

432
00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:08.474
Is it not this one?

433
00:21:08.504 --> 00:21:10.645
- I found it. - Si An found it.

434
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.415
Soo A, give him a hug.

435
00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:14.974
(Thank you, Si An.)

436
00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:16.784
Where did you find it?

437
00:21:16.784 --> 00:21:18.885
It was near the bathroom.

438
00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:21.355
He found it near the bathroom. Sit here.

439
00:21:22.454 --> 00:21:24.555
There's the bathroom.

440
00:21:24.555 --> 00:21:26.524
(Seol A stopped by earlier.)

441
00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:30.665
(She took it off briefly to wash her hands.)

442
00:21:31.194 --> 00:21:35.234
It went into the pocket but fell out the hole.

443
00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:37.835
You took it off to wash your hands.

444
00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:39.234
It must've fallen then.

445
00:21:39.605 --> 00:21:42.575
I found it near the bathroom.

446
00:21:42.704 --> 00:21:44.845
- Thank you, Si An. - This...

447
00:21:49.784 --> 00:21:51.545
(What is William doing this morning?)

448
00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:53.115
Shall we meet William,

449
00:21:53.115 --> 00:21:54.484
who is doing his morning exercise?

450
00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:55.815
Hey, William.

451
00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:58.924
(Let's exercise properly.)

452
00:21:59.224 --> 00:22:01.224
(This trampoline promotes...)

453
00:22:01.224 --> 00:22:03.224
(early height growth and athleticism.)

454
00:22:03.224 --> 00:22:04.565
Can you do it?

455
00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:08.095
(I'm ready, Coach Sam.)

456
00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:11.635
There you go. Hold on tightly not to fall.

457
00:22:12.264 --> 00:22:13.375
Jump.

458
00:22:16.905 --> 00:22:19.474
(Jumping)

459
00:22:21.244 --> 00:22:22.585
(He bounces with his little bottom.)

460
00:22:22.585 --> 00:22:23.984
Up and down.

461
00:22:24.115 --> 00:22:27.784
(Jumping, jumping, everybody)

462
00:22:31.055 --> 00:22:33.254
You are really good at this.

463
00:22:36.464 --> 00:22:39.795
(The entire family jumps.)

464
00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:44.065
(I am jumping very well today, right?)

465
00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:46.474
William, you can jump very well.

466
00:22:46.474 --> 00:22:50.045
You could become a basketball player.

467
00:22:50.375 --> 00:22:52.744
(It's this one.)

468
00:22:54.274 --> 00:22:56.085
Slam dunk!

469
00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:58.784
(Slam dunk on a trampoline)

470
00:22:58.784 --> 00:23:00.254
(Amazing)

471
00:23:00.885 --> 00:23:03.385
(He dunks every time he holds the ball.)

472
00:23:03.385 --> 00:23:05.784
You are really good.

473
00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.254
Slam dunk.

474
00:23:07.254 --> 00:23:08.754
(William is an aspiring basketball player.)

475
00:23:09.424 --> 00:23:10.724
(You have a good success rate.)

476
00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:13.194
You are doing as well as Michael Jordan.

477
00:23:14.234 --> 00:23:16.734
(I will make your dream come true.)

478
00:23:17.565 --> 00:23:19.405
(Rustling)

479
00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:21.805
(Sam is making something.)

480
00:23:22.905 --> 00:23:24.345
(What are you doing, Dad?)

481
00:23:24.944 --> 00:23:27.845
Man Doo and Ga Ji are pretty old now.

482
00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:30.184
I am afraid they will get sick.

483
00:23:30.184 --> 00:23:33.155
A doghouse will keep them warm.

484
00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:34.954
I could buy it,

485
00:23:35.155 --> 00:23:37.085
but they might not use...

486
00:23:37.085 --> 00:23:38.784
the one I bought.

487
00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.825
That's why I am making it.

488
00:23:40.825 --> 00:23:44.994
If they like it, I will buy one for them.

489
00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:48.365
He begins to make a house for Ga Ji and Man Doo.

490
00:23:49.204 --> 00:23:51.865
- Dad. - I am Dad.

491
00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:55.075
I am your dad.

492
00:23:55.274 --> 00:23:56.875
(What is this?)

493
00:23:58.045 --> 00:24:00.575
Don't take it off, William.

494
00:24:01.244 --> 00:24:02.744
You need to help me.

495
00:24:02.744 --> 00:24:04.014
Do you want to do that?

496
00:24:04.014 --> 00:24:06.315
(This time,)

497
00:24:06.315 --> 00:24:08.815
(he really interrupts Sam's work.)

498
00:24:09.355 --> 00:24:11.454
Be careful, mate.

499
00:24:12.724 --> 00:24:14.694
(He is absorbed in building a roof.)

500
00:24:16.165 --> 00:24:17.865
(Why is it quiet?)

501
00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:21.065
(The sheet of paper got on him.)

502
00:24:21.934 --> 00:24:23.534
(Here is another one.)

503
00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:26.575
(What is this?)

504
00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:29.504
Those are wings.

505
00:24:29.504 --> 00:24:31.405
(William suffers repercussions.)

506
00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:34.474
(How dare you!)

507
00:24:36.385 --> 00:24:40.555
(The 13-month-old grabs the back of his neck.)

508
00:24:42.055 --> 00:24:44.585
William, can you see what I made?

509
00:24:44.754 --> 00:24:45.825
Man Doo.

510
00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:48.424
(Man Doo enters the doghouse first.)

511
00:24:48.424 --> 00:24:50.165
There you go. Sit.

512
00:24:50.424 --> 00:24:52.964
(He gets a house after 13 years.)

513
00:24:52.964 --> 00:24:54.795
Paw. Give me your paw.

514
00:24:56.165 --> 00:24:58.135
(I know you like it.)

515
00:24:59.674 --> 00:25:01.174
(The doghouse is nice.)

516
00:25:02.704 --> 00:25:04.375
(Ga Ji enters as well.)

517
00:25:04.375 --> 00:25:05.545
Come here.

518
00:25:06.415 --> 00:25:07.545
Sit.

519
00:25:08.444 --> 00:25:09.585
There you go.

520
00:25:10.645 --> 00:25:12.655
(I have never been this comfortable before.)

521
00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:16.055
(I am envious.)

522
00:25:17.855 --> 00:25:20.125
Did you see that? Give me a big hand.

523
00:25:21.224 --> 00:25:22.325
(Sam's house gets residents.)

524
00:25:22.325 --> 00:25:23.524
High five.

525
00:25:26.165 --> 00:25:27.694
(However)

526
00:25:27.694 --> 00:25:29.264
- Get out. - How pretty!

527
00:25:29.405 --> 00:25:31.135
How pretty!

528
00:25:31.135 --> 00:25:35.034
(Everyone wants to live in Sam's house.)

529
00:25:37.345 --> 00:25:39.615
(Ga Ji ends up leaving.)

530
00:25:39.615 --> 00:25:41.615
William, Ga Ji came out because of you.

531
00:25:41.615 --> 00:25:43.244
(He looks dejected.)

532
00:25:44.944 --> 00:25:47.315
(This is too much.)

533
00:25:49.454 --> 00:25:52.125
(Let me check the interior design.)

534
00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:53.555
It's Man Doo's house.

535
00:25:55.224 --> 00:25:56.224
Hey.

536
00:25:56.224 --> 00:25:59.395
(I own this house.)

537
00:26:00.335 --> 00:26:03.034
(Sulking)

538
00:26:03.204 --> 00:26:05.504
Ga Ji needs to live there.

539
00:26:05.665 --> 00:26:08.875
Come on out. You shouldn't be there.

540
00:26:09.674 --> 00:26:10.845
Come on out.

541
00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:16.184
I will make something tasty.

542
00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:20.815
(He uses this chance to enter the house.)

543
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:22.524
It seems like...

544
00:26:22.524 --> 00:26:24.754
William likes the house Sam made.

545
00:26:24.754 --> 00:26:26.754
(He kicks out Man Doo...)

546
00:26:28.055 --> 00:26:30.295
(and tries to make the house his.)

547
00:26:32.024 --> 00:26:34.494
(That's right. This is Ga Ji's house.)

548
00:26:34.764 --> 00:26:37.365
Ga Ji. Ga Ji.

549
00:26:38.135 --> 00:26:40.534
Ga Ji. Ga Ji.

550
00:26:40.534 --> 00:26:42.105
(Did he call my name?)

551
00:26:44.345 --> 00:26:46.974
(Ga Ji, come here.)

552
00:26:46.974 --> 00:26:48.145
Ga Ji.

553
00:26:51.315 --> 00:26:53.254
(Will you live with me?)

554
00:26:53.254 --> 00:26:55.014
(Grinning)

555
00:26:56.254 --> 00:26:58.484
(What about me? They are excluding me.)

556
00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:02.254
(Man Doo feels lonely.)

557
00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:04.924
Hey, hey.

558
00:27:06.135 --> 00:27:07.734
What are you doing in there?

559
00:27:08.395 --> 00:27:10.464
- Will you live in it? - Yes.

560
00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:12.365
Okay.

561
00:27:12.365 --> 00:27:14.305
(He even brought a blanket.)

562
00:27:15.575 --> 00:27:17.845
Will you live in it?

563
00:27:18.004 --> 00:27:19.174
Do you like it?

564
00:27:20.174 --> 00:27:21.315
Do you like it?

565
00:27:21.744 --> 00:27:22.744
Give me your hand.

566
00:27:22.744 --> 00:27:24.115
(Come on out.)

567
00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:27.784
Watch your head.

568
00:27:28.385 --> 00:27:31.655
I made it for Man Doo and Ga Ji.

569
00:27:31.655 --> 00:27:35.155
Man Doo and Ga Ji need to live in it.

570
00:27:35.964 --> 00:27:39.165
Gosh, who pooped?

571
00:27:39.865 --> 00:27:42.034
(William heads to the kitchen.)

572
00:27:43.065 --> 00:27:45.665
(He says hello to the camera.)

573
00:27:45.665 --> 00:27:48.605
Mom, hi.

574
00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:49.905
(It's me.)

575
00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:53.014
(Grabbing)

576
00:27:54.774 --> 00:27:56.014
Is pooping the only thing you can do?

577
00:27:56.615 --> 00:27:58.244
You are like a poop factory.

578
00:27:59.855 --> 00:28:02.014
He takes a snack without Sam's knowledge...

579
00:28:03.454 --> 00:28:05.385
and heads somewhere.

580
00:28:07.424 --> 00:28:10.125
(How is this my life?)

581
00:28:11.395 --> 00:28:13.994
(I like it here because it's soft.)

582
00:28:13.994 --> 00:28:16.165
I am a bit worried.

583
00:28:17.805 --> 00:28:20.105
(This is fun.)

584
00:28:20.674 --> 00:28:22.504
(He drops snacks on the bed.)

585
00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:27.645
My goodness.

586
00:28:27.845 --> 00:28:28.944
William.

587
00:28:29.415 --> 00:28:31.915
(Freeze)

588
00:28:31.915 --> 00:28:34.254
(Unfreeze)

589
00:28:34.714 --> 00:28:38.385
(It's a mess.)

590
00:28:41.655 --> 00:28:42.665
William.

591
00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:43.795
(He is not in the doghouse.)

592
00:28:47.665 --> 00:28:50.305
(He made a mess while Sam was preoccupied.)

593
00:28:50.764 --> 00:28:52.704
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

594
00:28:54.674 --> 00:28:58.405
You are unbelievable.

595
00:28:59.444 --> 00:29:03.214
(You know what you did.)

596
00:29:04.345 --> 00:29:07.615
I need to clean up thanks to you.

597
00:29:07.615 --> 00:29:10.355
Why did you spill so much?

598
00:29:11.754 --> 00:29:13.524
(That looks fun.)

599
00:29:15.194 --> 00:29:17.964
You need to work since you made this mess.

600
00:29:21.065 --> 00:29:24.464
(William finishes up.)

601
00:29:25.734 --> 00:29:27.534
(William is still excited.)

602
00:29:28.575 --> 00:29:30.145
(Sighing)

603
00:29:31.075 --> 00:29:32.305
(The living room is a mess too.)

604
00:29:32.305 --> 00:29:34.474
William. William.

605
00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:36.315
I think we need to clean the house.

606
00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:37.815
Will you help me?

607
00:29:40.085 --> 00:29:43.224
You aren't helping.

608
00:29:43.224 --> 00:29:44.454
Ga Ji.

609
00:29:44.454 --> 00:29:45.895
(Ga Ji, don't be like that.)

610
00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:47.424
William, do you want to try it?

611
00:29:48.024 --> 00:29:50.494
Try it. Can you do it by yourself?

612
00:29:50.994 --> 00:29:52.734
Use both of your hands.

613
00:29:52.734 --> 00:29:54.234
(William can do it.)

614
00:29:55.135 --> 00:29:58.964
(I will clean the house thoroughly.)

615
00:30:00.105 --> 00:30:01.375
Is it heavy?

616
00:30:02.034 --> 00:30:03.704
Good job.

617
00:30:04.244 --> 00:30:07.944
(I will do the rest.)

618
00:30:07.944 --> 00:30:10.845
William is starting to cause troubles.

619
00:30:11.284 --> 00:30:13.655
Sam, this is the beginning.

620
00:30:13.655 --> 00:30:15.155
(I won't make a mess next time.)

621
00:30:17.325 --> 00:30:19.055
Moscow is the capital of Russia.

622
00:30:19.055 --> 00:30:20.494
(Novorossiysk, Moscow)

623
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:24.024
What is this building inside a dense forest?

624
00:30:24.024 --> 00:30:25.825
(What is this building?)

625
00:30:29.605 --> 00:30:32.434
It's an ice stadium.

626
00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:33.575
(Incredible speed)

627
00:30:33.575 --> 00:30:35.375
Short track speed skating that requires...

628
00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:37.375
quickness and skills is taking place.

629
00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:41.774
(Short track speed skating?)

630
00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:45.244
On the ice, a fierce match is taking place.

631
00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:46.984
Who will be the hero of the day?

632
00:30:46.984 --> 00:30:49.055
(Is there a Superman dad?)

633
00:30:49.784 --> 00:30:51.585
A toddler appears.

634
00:30:51.585 --> 00:30:53.125
(A toddler appears at the ice stadium.)

635
00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:56.964
She walks as if she is familiar with the place.

636
00:30:58.395 --> 00:31:01.934
Whom did this cute girl come to meet?

637
00:31:03.335 --> 00:31:06.704
(I am here to cheer for my dad.)

638
00:31:08.174 --> 00:31:11.244
- Dad, Dad. - Dad, Dad.

639
00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:13.444
(Dad, Dad, Dad.)

640
00:31:13.815 --> 00:31:16.484
She is loved by everyone in the ice rink.

641
00:31:16.484 --> 00:31:18.345
(She is popular.)

642
00:31:20.954 --> 00:31:22.855
She is friends with everyone.

643
00:31:22.855 --> 00:31:24.555
(She can talk to a Russian man.)

644
00:31:24.754 --> 00:31:26.754
(He is a funny man.)

645
00:31:28.454 --> 00:31:30.395
She is popular no matter where she goes.

646
00:31:30.395 --> 00:31:34.095
(She is a superstar of the ice rink.)

647
00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:39.774
(Who is her dad?)

648
00:31:39.774 --> 00:31:40.905
Dad.

649
00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:46.444
Shall we meet the Superman dad?

650
00:31:50.615 --> 00:31:52.415
(A gun shot)

651
00:31:52.415 --> 00:31:54.014
(My goodness.)

652
00:31:56.155 --> 00:31:58.325
(The dad is leading.)

653
00:31:59.694 --> 00:32:01.024
He is coming.

654
00:32:02.595 --> 00:32:06.464
(He skates with speed.)

655
00:32:08.264 --> 00:32:10.405
(He is doing well.)

656
00:32:11.865 --> 00:32:15.135
(The final match is neck-and-neck.)

657
00:32:16.944 --> 00:32:19.174
(Dad, come on.)

658
00:32:20.145 --> 00:32:23.214
(The bell lets them know it's the last lap.)

659
00:32:23.615 --> 00:32:24.645
Good.

660
00:32:25.484 --> 00:32:26.655
Come here.

661
00:32:33.295 --> 00:32:37.994
(He wins the 500m race.)

662
00:32:38.964 --> 00:32:40.694
Let's give him a big hand. He came in first.

663
00:32:41.534 --> 00:32:42.665
Dad.

664
00:32:42.704 --> 00:32:44.405
How nice!

665
00:32:45.605 --> 00:32:47.034
It's very nice.

666
00:32:49.575 --> 00:32:51.674
Victor An, Moscow.

667
00:32:55.244 --> 00:32:58.585
It's Victor An, the king of speed skating.

668
00:32:59.714 --> 00:33:02.924
(Superman of the day is Victory An.)

669
00:33:03.855 --> 00:33:06.395
Hello, I am dad of Jane, a 19-month-old girl.

670
00:33:06.395 --> 00:33:08.524
I am Victor An, a speed skater.

671
00:33:09.224 --> 00:33:11.424
I moved to Russia...

672
00:33:11.424 --> 00:33:13.194
about six years ago.

673
00:33:13.964 --> 00:33:15.665
I am very thankful for my wife.

674
00:33:15.665 --> 00:33:17.504
She came to me when I was struggling.

675
00:33:17.504 --> 00:33:18.964
Even though...

676
00:33:19.234 --> 00:33:21.734
her family and friends are in Korea,

677
00:33:21.734 --> 00:33:24.145
she moved to Russia for me.

678
00:33:24.145 --> 00:33:26.514
It must have been a difficult decision.

679
00:33:26.514 --> 00:33:29.484
She believed in me and moved to Russia...

680
00:33:29.484 --> 00:33:32.115
to be my support.

681
00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:34.214
I am thankful for that.

682
00:33:34.214 --> 00:33:35.924
After she moved to Russia,

683
00:33:35.924 --> 00:33:38.284
(They used to live in a studio apartment.)

684
00:33:38.284 --> 00:33:41.355
she struggled a lot because of me.

685
00:33:41.355 --> 00:33:44.764
I wouldn't be here without her.

686
00:33:44.764 --> 00:33:46.694
That's why I wanted to give her a break.

687
00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:48.934
When I was dating him, I realized that...

688
00:33:48.934 --> 00:33:50.135
(Woo Na Ri, Jane's mom)

689
00:33:50.335 --> 00:33:51.865
I want to give him a hug.

690
00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:55.105
He always seemed sad.

691
00:33:55.105 --> 00:33:58.075
He seemed like a lonely man...

692
00:33:58.075 --> 00:34:01.545
who didn't have anyone by his side.

693
00:34:01.545 --> 00:34:04.444
That's why I strongly felt...

694
00:34:04.444 --> 00:34:08.054
I should remain by his side.

695
00:34:08.585 --> 00:34:09.855
(Then Jane came to them.)

696
00:34:09.855 --> 00:34:12.695
Then the best present visited them.

697
00:34:13.195 --> 00:34:16.994
(Even the heartbeat sounds special.)

698
00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:21.235
That's how they became a family of three.

699
00:34:21.235 --> 00:34:22.565
(She is another haven for Victor.)

700
00:34:22.565 --> 00:34:26.105
Victor started his life as Jane's dad.

701
00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:29.844
A girl with round eyes, Jane An.

702
00:34:29.844 --> 00:34:31.204
(She is a daughter.)

703
00:34:31.675 --> 00:34:34.175
(Victor and Jane will share 48 hours.)

704
00:34:34.175 --> 00:34:36.215
It's nice.

705
00:34:36.915 --> 00:34:39.784
(Fall into my cuteness.)

706
00:34:40.884 --> 00:34:42.684
(It's nice.)

707
00:34:42.925 --> 00:34:44.755
(She shows off her charms.)

708
00:34:44.824 --> 00:34:46.525
In 1, 2.

709
00:34:46.525 --> 00:34:48.654
(They spend 48 hours in an incredible way.)

710
00:34:48.654 --> 00:34:51.224
(It starts now.)

711
00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:55.735
It's a small town that is located in Moscow.

712
00:34:55.735 --> 00:34:57.934
(Khimki, Moscow)

713
00:34:57.934 --> 00:34:59.934
(When you pass a quiet residential area,)

714
00:34:59.934 --> 00:35:02.875
An family's house is in this town.

715
00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:04.474
(you will find Jane's house.)

716
00:35:04.474 --> 00:35:06.244
Shall we go inside?

717
00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:11.514
The living room and kitchen...

718
00:35:11.514 --> 00:35:13.855
are decorated in Nordic style.

719
00:35:14.255 --> 00:35:20.154
(The couple decorated the place.)

720
00:35:22.154 --> 00:35:25.864
Every prop has their touch.

721
00:35:25.864 --> 00:35:27.395
(There are family pictures on the wall.)

722
00:35:27.395 --> 00:35:28.965
There are family pictures...

723
00:35:29.665 --> 00:35:32.034
as well as the presents from the fans.

724
00:35:33.574 --> 00:35:35.945
(Let's go to the 2nd floor.)

725
00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:38.474
Shall we go up the stairs to the second floor?

726
00:35:40.614 --> 00:35:43.384
The second floor is a resting area.

727
00:35:45.915 --> 00:35:49.054
On the wall are Victor's medals.

728
00:35:49.054 --> 00:35:50.884
There are a lot of medals.

729
00:35:52.594 --> 00:35:54.255
(There are gold medals from the Olympics.)

730
00:35:55.594 --> 00:35:58.525
There is a cute room for Jane.

731
00:35:58.525 --> 00:36:01.094
(This is Jane's room.)

732
00:36:01.094 --> 00:36:04.165
There is a bedroom for the couple.

733
00:36:06.335 --> 00:36:09.175
Let's meet Jane's family in the morning.

734
00:36:12.574 --> 00:36:16.545
(Blinking)

735
00:36:18.815 --> 00:36:21.184
(Stretching)

736
00:36:22.154 --> 00:36:23.184
Mom.

737
00:36:23.184 --> 00:36:26.255
(Mom?)

738
00:36:26.255 --> 00:36:29.154
Mom. Mom.

739
00:36:30.324 --> 00:36:31.965
You should sleep some more.

740
00:36:33.094 --> 00:36:35.665
(He hands her a stuffed rabbit.)

741
00:36:37.965 --> 00:36:39.775
Give Okie a kiss.

742
00:36:41.134 --> 00:36:42.574
(Kissing)

743
00:36:44.904 --> 00:36:47.074
(Peek-a-boo)

744
00:36:48.275 --> 00:36:50.184
(Mom, where were you?)

745
00:36:50.184 --> 00:36:51.684
Jane.

746
00:36:51.684 --> 00:36:53.684
Mom was gone, right?

747
00:36:54.054 --> 00:36:55.085
Hey!

748
00:36:55.085 --> 00:36:57.154
(Hugging)

749
00:36:57.755 --> 00:36:58.755
My goodness.

750
00:36:58.755 --> 00:37:01.755
(Jane gives Mom a morning kiss.)

751
00:37:01.755 --> 00:37:04.764
Thank you. Give Dad a kiss.

752
00:37:06.134 --> 00:37:08.295
Give Dad a kiss, Jane.

753
00:37:08.295 --> 00:37:10.204
(I refuse.)

754
00:37:10.335 --> 00:37:11.864
Mom will give Dad a kiss.

755
00:37:11.864 --> 00:37:14.474
(Then I will give him a kiss.)

756
00:37:15.945 --> 00:37:18.005
(Lovey-dovey)

757
00:37:19.105 --> 00:37:22.645
(Stop kissing and come on out.)

758
00:37:23.014 --> 00:37:24.284
All right.

759
00:37:24.344 --> 00:37:25.415
Yes.

760
00:37:26.384 --> 00:37:29.054
(Stiff)

761
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:33.594
Okay.

762
00:37:33.594 --> 00:37:35.054
(She finds an uncle inside the tent.)

763
00:37:35.054 --> 00:37:36.324
Who is that?

764
00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:42.065
Say hello.

765
00:37:42.065 --> 00:37:43.634
(She walks forward confidently...)

766
00:37:43.634 --> 00:37:45.875
(and steps back.)

767
00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:48.204
(Shy)

768
00:37:49.704 --> 00:37:51.005
You should say hello.

769
00:37:51.804 --> 00:37:53.474
Are you embarrassed?

770
00:37:53.645 --> 00:37:55.244
Hello.

771
00:37:56.485 --> 00:37:58.284
(They come to the living room.)

772
00:37:58.284 --> 00:37:59.485
What is that?

773
00:37:59.485 --> 00:38:02.215
Watch what I am drawing.

774
00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:04.585
A heart.

775
00:38:05.485 --> 00:38:06.695
A heart.

776
00:38:06.695 --> 00:38:08.954
- You said, "A heart". - A heart.

777
00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:11.724
- I love you. - I love you.

778
00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:13.895
A heart.

779
00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:18.034
There you go. Both hands should go up.

780
00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:19.034
There you go.

781
00:38:19.034 --> 00:38:20.704
Say hello.

782
00:38:20.704 --> 00:38:22.375
Say hello.

783
00:38:22.375 --> 00:38:24.574
(Hello, Uncle.)

784
00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:26.074
Wink to Uncle.

785
00:38:26.344 --> 00:38:28.145
Wink, wink.

786
00:38:29.445 --> 00:38:31.545
She looks exactly like you.

787
00:38:32.344 --> 00:38:34.784
Which one is Jane and which one is Victor?

788
00:38:36.054 --> 00:38:37.454
She looks like a son.

789
00:38:37.454 --> 00:38:39.695
Why does she look like a son today?

790
00:38:40.094 --> 00:38:41.755
She isn't wearing a ponytail.

791
00:38:43.065 --> 00:38:45.665
Don't treat her like a son.

792
00:38:46.034 --> 00:38:47.665
Look forward.

793
00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:49.605
(Her mom takes an emergency measure.)

794
00:38:49.605 --> 00:38:51.505
(She puts Jane's hair in a ponytail.)

795
00:38:51.735 --> 00:38:55.105
Jane, ask your dad to do your hair nicely.

796
00:38:55.675 --> 00:38:57.574
(Sitting still)

797
00:38:57.574 --> 00:39:00.915
3, 4, 5 times.

798
00:39:00.915 --> 00:39:03.085
Then pull the top part.

799
00:39:03.085 --> 00:39:05.415
(Does she look like a daughter now?)

800
00:39:05.415 --> 00:39:06.585
You should do it too.

801
00:39:06.585 --> 00:39:07.915
What do you want for breakfast?

802
00:39:08.755 --> 00:39:10.755
Jane, what do you want for breakfast?

803
00:39:11.255 --> 00:39:13.795
Honey, this is the last meal...

804
00:39:14.695 --> 00:39:16.594
you will get from me.

805
00:39:16.994 --> 00:39:18.925
(Thinking)

806
00:39:20.235 --> 00:39:21.235
Tteokbokki.

807
00:39:21.235 --> 00:39:23.864
Tteokbokki? For breakfast?

808
00:39:24.434 --> 00:39:26.134
(Surprised)

809
00:39:26.275 --> 00:39:28.204
- Jane. - Would you be okay?

810
00:39:28.204 --> 00:39:29.645
Do you want tteokbokki?

811
00:39:29.645 --> 00:39:30.844
- Yes. - Yes.

812
00:39:33.014 --> 00:39:35.014
While his wife makes breakfast...

813
00:39:35.014 --> 00:39:36.545
Will you carry it around?

814
00:39:37.844 --> 00:39:40.355
Victor goes to the workout room.

815
00:39:40.454 --> 00:39:43.585
An athlete's morning sure is different.

816
00:39:44.724 --> 00:39:46.755
(He has a lot of scars.)

817
00:39:49.395 --> 00:39:52.165
(He works out his abs.)

818
00:39:53.134 --> 00:39:55.904
(One, two)

819
00:39:57.235 --> 00:39:59.675
(She comes into the room.)

820
00:40:01.775 --> 00:40:04.505
You are here.

821
00:40:04.505 --> 00:40:06.114
Do you want to copy me?

822
00:40:09.445 --> 00:40:11.485
I put one foot forward like that, right?

823
00:40:11.844 --> 00:40:14.585
I put one foot forward like that.

824
00:40:14.585 --> 00:40:16.425
Jane, do you want to do this?

825
00:40:16.454 --> 00:40:17.684
Do this.

826
00:40:18.525 --> 00:40:21.695
(Why is my body moving backwards?)

827
00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:25.295
Lean forward. Lean forward.

828
00:40:25.295 --> 00:40:27.465
Lean sideways. Lean sideways.

829
00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:30.105
Meanwhile, Na Ri makes breakfast...

830
00:40:30.105 --> 00:40:31.704
for Victor and Jane.

831
00:40:31.835 --> 00:40:33.634
Because Victor and Jane like Korean food,

832
00:40:33.634 --> 00:40:35.235
Na Ri makes Korean dishes for three meals a day...

833
00:40:35.235 --> 00:40:38.005
with the ingredients she brought from Korea.

834
00:40:38.244 --> 00:40:40.474
She is incredible.

835
00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:45.145
(It contains fish cake and spring onion.)

836
00:40:46.415 --> 00:40:48.485
(Jane's breakfast is complete.)

837
00:40:49.014 --> 00:40:51.355
Are you hungry? Do you want breakfast?

838
00:40:51.355 --> 00:40:52.425
Breakfast.

839
00:40:52.425 --> 00:40:54.054
Do you want breakfast?

840
00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.594
Look at tteokbokki.

841
00:40:57.625 --> 00:40:58.895
It looks tasty.

842
00:40:59.465 --> 00:41:01.864
What do you need to drink before you eat?

843
00:41:01.864 --> 00:41:04.304
- Water. - Water. That's right.

844
00:41:05.235 --> 00:41:06.605
Honey, why aren't you eating?

845
00:41:06.605 --> 00:41:07.835
(Jane is ready to eat.)

846
00:41:08.404 --> 00:41:10.645
- Should I cut it? - No.

847
00:41:12.105 --> 00:41:13.244
Gosh, it's spicy.

848
00:41:13.244 --> 00:41:16.344
I tried to make it less spicy.

849
00:41:16.415 --> 00:41:17.815
(You are overreacting.)

850
00:41:17.815 --> 00:41:19.485
- It's spicy. - It's a bit spicy.

851
00:41:22.525 --> 00:41:23.925
Does it look tasty?

852
00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:26.054
Do you want to try it?

853
00:41:26.154 --> 00:41:27.925
- She can't eat it. - Do you want to try it?

854
00:41:28.824 --> 00:41:30.324
She can't eat it.

855
00:41:31.065 --> 00:41:32.324
- You don't want it. - No?

856
00:41:32.324 --> 00:41:33.364
(Taken aback)

857
00:41:34.795 --> 00:41:37.304
She can't eat it. Her bottom will be red.

858
00:41:37.304 --> 00:41:39.605
- It's hot. - It's hot.

859
00:41:39.974 --> 00:41:41.304
Your bottom will be red.

860
00:41:41.775 --> 00:41:43.304
- It's tasty, right? - Yes.

861
00:41:43.304 --> 00:41:44.775
- Is it soft? - Yes.

862
00:41:44.775 --> 00:41:47.614
It was in the fridge for a few days.

863
00:41:47.614 --> 00:41:49.215
It's soft.

864
00:41:49.215 --> 00:41:50.545
(Jane takes after Victor and eats well.)

865
00:41:50.545 --> 00:41:54.415
(She takes a big bite.)

866
00:41:57.284 --> 00:41:59.295
- I won't be here. - Let's take a bite.

867
00:41:59.295 --> 00:42:00.994
It's the last bite.

868
00:42:00.994 --> 00:42:02.154
- It's the last bite. - Open wide.

869
00:42:02.154 --> 00:42:03.965
- Let's go for a walk. - Jane, open wide.

870
00:42:03.965 --> 00:42:05.094
Let's go for a walk.

871
00:42:07.764 --> 00:42:09.465
Don't act cute.

872
00:42:11.034 --> 00:42:12.934
(Let's eat this, my daughter.)

873
00:42:14.505 --> 00:42:16.275
(I wanted to play around with Dad.)

874
00:42:16.275 --> 00:42:17.675
He got you.

875
00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:22.715
It's the last bite.

876
00:42:22.715 --> 00:42:25.684
Eat well when Dad cooks, Jane.

877
00:42:25.855 --> 00:42:26.855
Okay?

878
00:42:26.855 --> 00:42:28.715
You can do well without me, right?

879
00:42:29.625 --> 00:42:31.025
I am worried.

880
00:42:31.954 --> 00:42:33.454
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

881
00:42:33.654 --> 00:42:34.895
Let's go.

882
00:42:34.925 --> 00:42:37.125
- Cheers. - Cheers.

883
00:42:40.565 --> 00:42:43.364
- Jane, wash your face. - That's right.

884
00:42:43.364 --> 00:42:46.904
I got these packages yesterday evening...

885
00:42:46.934 --> 00:42:48.434
at the training center.

886
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:51.244
(There are 2 packages from Korea.)

887
00:42:51.244 --> 00:42:54.045
- Jane, look at these. - This one is heavier.

888
00:42:54.175 --> 00:42:55.275
Please take it.

889
00:42:56.045 --> 00:42:57.145
Let's take them inside.

890
00:42:57.145 --> 00:42:59.085
Come here.

891
00:42:59.284 --> 00:43:01.684
- Jane. - Let's open them.

892
00:43:02.784 --> 00:43:04.184
Let's see what's inside.

893
00:43:04.684 --> 00:43:05.824
(My goodness.)

894
00:43:05.824 --> 00:43:09.054
We usually receive Jane's items.

895
00:43:10.364 --> 00:43:12.994
Jane, do you know what a happy moment it is?

896
00:43:13.034 --> 00:43:14.494
- Jane. - I think it's Jane's.

897
00:43:14.594 --> 00:43:15.735
Look at this.

898
00:43:15.735 --> 00:43:17.505
- It's a present for Jane. - What is this?

899
00:43:17.505 --> 00:43:20.134
- It's a heart. - Let's see what's inside.

900
00:43:22.235 --> 00:43:23.445
- What's that? - Snacks.

901
00:43:23.445 --> 00:43:24.775
- These are snacks. - Snacks.

902
00:43:25.005 --> 00:43:26.844
- You want to try it. - It's very spicy.

903
00:43:26.844 --> 00:43:27.875
(It's a spicy cup noodle from Korea.)

904
00:43:29.244 --> 00:43:30.815
What is this?

905
00:43:30.815 --> 00:43:35.014
(Amazed)

906
00:43:35.284 --> 00:43:38.255
- Isn't it a nesting doll? - It's wearing hanbok.

907
00:43:38.724 --> 00:43:39.954
(A nesting doll in hanbok)

908
00:43:39.954 --> 00:43:42.025
It looks interesting.

909
00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:44.594
Jane, ask Dad to show you something fascinating.

910
00:43:45.565 --> 00:43:47.094
Look at this, Jane.

911
00:43:47.465 --> 00:43:50.005
Let me take out another one.

912
00:43:50.565 --> 00:43:52.335
There is another one.

913
00:43:52.364 --> 00:43:53.375
Open it.

914
00:43:53.474 --> 00:43:54.634
- It's very cute. - I know.

915
00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:58.045
(These nesting dolls look unique.)

916
00:43:58.875 --> 00:44:00.244
(Studying carefully)

917
00:44:00.244 --> 00:44:02.545
It's Jane. It's her in the picture.

918
00:44:02.915 --> 00:44:04.344
It's Jane.

919
00:44:04.344 --> 00:44:05.585
It looks exactly like her.

920
00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:07.954
I know.

921
00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:10.784
Jane, this is you.

922
00:44:11.054 --> 00:44:12.895
This is you.

923
00:44:14.154 --> 00:44:15.154
Open it.

924
00:44:15.154 --> 00:44:16.824
- There is another doll. - There is another doll.

925
00:44:16.824 --> 00:44:19.594
Jane, it looks exactly like your pajamas.

926
00:44:20.094 --> 00:44:22.665
It's pretty. Give it a kiss.

927
00:44:22.665 --> 00:44:25.634
- A kiss. How pretty! - Give it to me.

928
00:44:26.105 --> 00:44:27.835
When I do this...

929
00:44:27.835 --> 00:44:31.875
(Let's see. Now, it looks exactly like me.)

930
00:44:31.875 --> 00:44:34.145
The bottom part...

931
00:44:35.514 --> 00:44:36.614
Jane.

932
00:44:36.614 --> 00:44:38.344
(Surprised)

933
00:44:39.255 --> 00:44:41.085
It's a carrier blanket.

934
00:44:42.284 --> 00:44:45.154
This wig will make you look less like a son.

935
00:44:46.425 --> 00:44:47.855
Jane.

936
00:44:50.465 --> 00:44:52.835
(My goodness.)

937
00:44:53.465 --> 00:44:55.295
There are three wigs.

938
00:44:55.295 --> 00:44:57.835
- This one is short. - Jane, choose a style.

939
00:44:57.835 --> 00:45:00.074
- Try on a wig. - You want to try it on.

940
00:45:00.074 --> 00:45:02.175
(Hurry up and put it on me.)

941
00:45:06.744 --> 00:45:08.175
(Smiling)

942
00:45:08.175 --> 00:45:11.244
Jane, let's put it on.

943
00:45:11.645 --> 00:45:13.355
I will make you look pretty.

944
00:45:13.355 --> 00:45:14.355
Jane, look at me.

945
00:45:14.355 --> 00:45:16.824
(Ta-da)

946
00:45:17.554 --> 00:45:19.795
You don't like it. Go look in the mirror.

947
00:45:19.855 --> 00:45:21.324
- Go look in the mirror. - Look in the mirror.

948
00:45:21.324 --> 00:45:23.125
Look in the mirror. My goodness.

949
00:45:24.594 --> 00:45:26.134
She looks so cute.

950
00:45:26.134 --> 00:45:27.934
(She goes to look in the mirror.)

951
00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:30.034
She is so pretty!

952
00:45:30.904 --> 00:45:33.904
Does it tickle? You look very pretty.

953
00:45:33.904 --> 00:45:36.175
- Look at me. - How pretty!

954
00:45:37.545 --> 00:45:39.844
- She looks so cute. - Jane.

955
00:45:39.974 --> 00:45:41.375
Jane, look at Uncle.

956
00:45:43.184 --> 00:45:45.284
Act cute, Jane.

957
00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:46.915
My goodness.

958
00:45:47.384 --> 00:45:49.355
- My goodness. - Wink at him.

959
00:45:49.355 --> 00:45:50.625
Wink, wink.

960
00:45:51.224 --> 00:45:53.255
Look in the mirror.

961
00:45:53.255 --> 00:45:56.625
Doesn't she look different with all that hair?

962
00:45:56.764 --> 00:45:59.065
- She looks cute. - She looks like you.

963
00:46:00.434 --> 00:46:01.434
Look in the mirror.

964
00:46:01.434 --> 00:46:03.065
She will want to try it on.

965
00:46:03.065 --> 00:46:07.175
(What's the next present?)

966
00:46:10.545 --> 00:46:13.344
(There is a message on the clothing.)

967
00:46:14.244 --> 00:46:16.114
"Stop asking. She is a daughter."

968
00:46:16.384 --> 00:46:18.284
"Stop asking. She is a daughter."

969
00:46:18.614 --> 00:46:20.985
- This. - It's written in Russian.

970
00:46:22.454 --> 00:46:23.654
It's correct, right?

971
00:46:23.925 --> 00:46:25.994
"Stop asking. She is a daughter."

972
00:46:25.994 --> 00:46:28.094
Russian is written on the back.

973
00:46:28.224 --> 00:46:32.195
It's like Jane's birthday today.

974
00:46:32.934 --> 00:46:35.034
"I have been a fan for many years."

975
00:46:35.534 --> 00:46:38.404
"I have always cheered for you..."

976
00:46:38.404 --> 00:46:40.835
"throughout your success and struggles."

977
00:46:41.934 --> 00:46:45.204
"The fans gathered around to send you this present."

978
00:46:45.304 --> 00:46:48.744
"It's nothing special, but I hope you enjoy it."

979
00:46:48.744 --> 00:46:50.715
(The fans still cheer for him.)

980
00:46:50.715 --> 00:46:52.915
- Thank you. - Thank you.

981
00:46:55.284 --> 00:46:57.824
Jane, let's go and shop for groceries.

982
00:46:59.925 --> 00:47:01.855
While I am gone,

983
00:47:02.454 --> 00:47:04.295
you will need...

984
00:47:05.264 --> 00:47:06.634
groceries.

985
00:47:08.494 --> 00:47:10.065
After that...

986
00:47:10.764 --> 00:47:13.974
After we get groceries,

987
00:47:14.335 --> 00:47:17.005
- we should part. - That's right.

988
00:47:17.005 --> 00:47:19.744
It will be better than saying goodbye at home.

989
00:47:20.445 --> 00:47:22.375
You will do well, right?

990
00:47:22.915 --> 00:47:25.045
How pretty!

991
00:47:25.045 --> 00:47:26.114
(I don't know what you mean, but sure.)

992
00:47:27.114 --> 00:47:29.554
Will you be able to do well?

993
00:47:29.554 --> 00:47:32.755
(Na Ri is more worried about Victor.)

994
00:47:35.755 --> 00:47:38.264
Jane, look at the camera.

995
00:47:38.264 --> 00:47:39.795
Wink.

996
00:47:39.795 --> 00:47:41.695
(She winks and blows a kiss.)

997
00:47:41.695 --> 00:47:42.704
Blow a kiss.

998
00:47:42.704 --> 00:47:44.634
(She winks and blows a kiss.)

999
00:47:48.304 --> 00:47:53.875
(This is how big a mart is in Russia.)

1000
00:47:57.715 --> 00:47:59.654
(She wore a dress from the fans.)

1001
00:47:59.654 --> 00:48:01.454
Let's go, Jane.

1002
00:48:01.454 --> 00:48:02.485
Jane, come here.

1003
00:48:04.025 --> 00:48:06.295
Jane, you can ride a cart.

1004
00:48:06.925 --> 00:48:08.355
(I am all grown up.)

1005
00:48:08.355 --> 00:48:10.195
- She doesn't want to. - No?

1006
00:48:12.425 --> 00:48:14.534
(They begin to explore the mart.)

1007
00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:15.634
Now...

1008
00:48:17.934 --> 00:48:19.675
Milk. Milk.

1009
00:48:20.704 --> 00:48:21.775
Milk.

1010
00:48:22.304 --> 00:48:24.404
- Buy it. - Milk. Milk.

1011
00:48:25.275 --> 00:48:27.915
Let's go, Jane. We have milk at home.

1012
00:48:28.415 --> 00:48:29.585
There is a lot of milk for you.

1013
00:48:30.284 --> 00:48:31.384
We don't need more yet.

1014
00:48:31.384 --> 00:48:32.445
(Then we shouldn't overspend money.)

1015
00:48:32.445 --> 00:48:34.014
- She is fascinated. - Yes.

1016
00:48:34.614 --> 00:48:37.224
(Jane leads the way.)

1017
00:48:38.454 --> 00:48:41.855
She is roaming the mart.

1018
00:48:42.525 --> 00:48:43.724
Do you want to go that way?

1019
00:48:43.724 --> 00:48:44.925
Yes.

1020
00:48:45.025 --> 00:48:47.364
These cabbages aren't that great.

1021
00:48:47.364 --> 00:48:50.634
(Bumping)

1022
00:48:52.465 --> 00:48:54.505
Watch where you are going.

1023
00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:58.974
Hi. Hi.

1024
00:48:59.775 --> 00:49:01.074
(It's nice to meet you.)

1025
00:49:02.645 --> 00:49:05.014
What a cute baby! Hello.

1026
00:49:05.014 --> 00:49:07.684
Hello. Look at the baby.

1027
00:49:07.915 --> 00:49:09.324
- She is older. - Hello.

1028
00:49:09.454 --> 00:49:11.224
How pretty!

1029
00:49:13.154 --> 00:49:16.925
(Let's get the items in the cart.)

1030
00:49:19.094 --> 00:49:21.764
(Heave-ho)

1031
00:49:21.764 --> 00:49:24.204
- Thank you. - Good job.

1032
00:49:24.204 --> 00:49:26.034
- Thank you. - Good job.

1033
00:49:26.105 --> 00:49:27.375
- Do we need to weigh it? - Yes.

1034
00:49:27.375 --> 00:49:30.204
(How are the vegetables today?)

1035
00:49:31.175 --> 00:49:33.474
Jane, this is radish.

1036
00:49:33.675 --> 00:49:34.744
Hold it.

1037
00:49:34.744 --> 00:49:36.545
(This radish looks strange.)

1038
00:49:36.545 --> 00:49:38.045
It's food. It's tasty.

1039
00:49:38.045 --> 00:49:40.255
Why is it so thin and long?

1040
00:49:40.355 --> 00:49:43.125
- It's here. - Back ribs.

1041
00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:45.025
- Will you cook meat? - These are back ribs.

1042
00:49:45.855 --> 00:49:48.395
I like it.

1043
00:49:49.494 --> 00:49:50.565
Tasty.

1044
00:49:53.594 --> 00:49:54.764
Jane, let's go this way.

1045
00:49:55.494 --> 00:49:57.934
This isn't a place for Jane.

1046
00:49:58.434 --> 00:50:00.204
Look at these vodka.

1047
00:50:00.875 --> 00:50:02.275
There are so many varieties.

1048
00:50:02.275 --> 00:50:04.074
There is a large selection.

1049
00:50:04.074 --> 00:50:05.945
This is incredible.

1050
00:50:05.945 --> 00:50:08.114
(Everything in sight is alcohol.)

1051
00:50:08.114 --> 00:50:10.014
Which one have you tried?

1052
00:50:10.344 --> 00:50:14.215
I have only bought it as a gift.

1053
00:50:14.255 --> 00:50:15.554
You haven't tried anything.

1054
00:50:16.255 --> 00:50:19.525
(Let's see.)

1055
00:50:21.925 --> 00:50:23.025
Look at this.

1056
00:50:23.324 --> 00:50:24.425
It reads like "Let's fight" in Korean.

1057
00:50:24.425 --> 00:50:25.494
(Let's fight?)

1058
00:50:25.494 --> 00:50:26.795
That's the name of the alcoholic drink.

1059
00:50:27.335 --> 00:50:30.034
- Let's drink and fight. - Jane, look at this.

1060
00:50:30.434 --> 00:50:31.864
I like it.

1061
00:50:32.105 --> 00:50:35.675
Russia sure is different. I see alcohol everywhere.

1062
00:50:36.404 --> 00:50:38.005
Alcohol is cheap here.

1063
00:50:38.005 --> 00:50:40.715
(The same alcoholic drink is half the price.)

1064
00:50:43.045 --> 00:50:44.614
(Jane found something.)

1065
00:50:44.614 --> 00:50:45.915
What is it?

1066
00:50:45.915 --> 00:50:47.554
What?

1067
00:50:48.255 --> 00:50:49.855
(It's fresh bread.)

1068
00:50:49.855 --> 00:50:52.994
- It's bread. - It's warm.

1069
00:50:53.895 --> 00:50:55.554
It's what we eat.

1070
00:50:56.025 --> 00:50:57.824
Hold it. Look at this.

1071
00:50:57.824 --> 00:50:59.695
(It's as big as her face.)

1072
00:50:59.695 --> 00:51:01.134
Let's get this one.

1073
00:51:01.665 --> 00:51:05.735
This costs less than 90 cents.

1074
00:51:05.735 --> 00:51:07.204
Really?

1075
00:51:07.735 --> 00:51:10.505
- That one is really big. - There is a bigger one.

1076
00:51:11.645 --> 00:51:14.074
- Jane, look at this. - I will hold it.

1077
00:51:14.074 --> 00:51:15.375
(It's as big as Jane.)

1078
00:51:15.375 --> 00:51:16.614
Isn't it really big?

1079
00:51:16.915 --> 00:51:18.915
- Bread. - Bread.

1080
00:51:19.614 --> 00:51:20.884
Bread.

1081
00:51:22.255 --> 00:51:24.384
(She opens her mouth.)

1082
00:51:24.925 --> 00:51:26.625
It only costs a dollar and 60 cents.

1083
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:28.125
Really?

1084
00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:29.465
(It's very cheap.)

1085
00:51:31.264 --> 00:51:33.195
- It's a baguette. - A dollar and 60 cents.

1086
00:51:33.195 --> 00:51:34.835
- A dollar and 60 cents. - Water.

1087
00:51:34.835 --> 00:51:36.704
It looks like an earring.

1088
00:51:36.835 --> 00:51:39.275
Did you spill water? It's okay.

1089
00:51:39.275 --> 00:51:40.934
- Water. - Let's go.

1090
00:51:41.304 --> 00:51:43.474
It's okay. Let's go.

1091
00:51:43.645 --> 00:51:44.704
Let's go.

1092
00:51:45.775 --> 00:51:47.315
- Let's go. - We need to go.

1093
00:51:47.645 --> 00:51:49.684
- What is it? - She spilled water.

1094
00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:51.614
- Shall we go? - Use the end.

1095
00:51:51.684 --> 00:51:52.755
You want to wipe it.

1096
00:51:52.985 --> 00:51:55.514
My goodness, you are wiping it.

1097
00:51:55.554 --> 00:51:57.125
You want to wipe it.

1098
00:51:57.355 --> 00:51:58.824
She is wiping it with her blanket.

1099
00:51:59.994 --> 00:52:01.994
I don't know what to do.

1100
00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.864
Are you cleaning up after yourself?

1101
00:52:05.395 --> 00:52:08.094
You are done. Let's go.

1102
00:52:08.094 --> 00:52:09.704
Okay.

1103
00:52:09.704 --> 00:52:10.704
Water.

1104
00:52:11.465 --> 00:52:13.735
She wants to wipe it.

1105
00:52:13.974 --> 00:52:18.605
(She sits down and wipes her shoes.)

1106
00:52:18.605 --> 00:52:20.114
We need to go, Jane.

1107
00:52:20.215 --> 00:52:21.315
Let's go.

1108
00:52:22.715 --> 00:52:23.784
Jane.

1109
00:52:23.784 --> 00:52:24.915
(He looks familiar.)

1110
00:52:24.915 --> 00:52:26.215
Good job.

1111
00:52:26.415 --> 00:52:27.614
(He looks familiar.)

1112
00:52:27.784 --> 00:52:29.724
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1113
00:52:30.355 --> 00:52:31.654
Let's get going.

1114
00:52:32.025 --> 00:52:33.824
- Hello. - Hello.

1115
00:52:33.824 --> 00:52:36.425
My name is Mihail.

1116
00:52:36.895 --> 00:52:40.364
Victor, I heard you were at our store.

1117
00:52:40.364 --> 00:52:41.665
I'd like to ask for an autograph.

1118
00:52:41.665 --> 00:52:42.934
My pleasure.

1119
00:52:45.304 --> 00:52:49.974
(On top of the ice cream freezer,)

1120
00:52:50.204 --> 00:52:53.175
(he signs an autograph with all his heart.)

1121
00:52:55.545 --> 00:52:57.485
(I want to sign one too.)

1122
00:52:57.485 --> 00:52:59.085
Jane says she wants to sign too.

1123
00:52:59.815 --> 00:53:01.855
(Thank you.)

1124
00:53:03.255 --> 00:53:04.755
Go ahead. Do it on the floor.

1125
00:53:04.755 --> 00:53:07.054
Jane, you can sign an autograph too.

1126
00:53:07.755 --> 00:53:09.224
Jane.

1127
00:53:09.224 --> 00:53:10.425
(Jane signs an autograph too.)

1128
00:53:12.094 --> 00:53:15.034
(It's an honor to meet you.)

1129
00:53:17.804 --> 00:53:20.404
(Acting cute)

1130
00:53:21.275 --> 00:53:24.145
Jane, you don't know what's going on at all.

1131
00:53:24.445 --> 00:53:26.045
- Jane. - Jane.

1132
00:53:26.045 --> 00:53:27.514
You know nothing, do you?

1133
00:53:27.514 --> 00:53:28.815
- Give Mom a kiss. - Bye.

1134
00:53:28.974 --> 00:53:30.114
Jane, Mommy is going.

1135
00:53:30.114 --> 00:53:31.945
We're going to meet tomorrow, okay?

1136
00:53:31.945 --> 00:53:34.154
Mommy is going. Bye.

1137
00:53:34.154 --> 00:53:35.684
Okay. Bye.

1138
00:53:36.255 --> 00:53:38.554
(She says her farewell rather nonchalantly.)

1139
00:53:40.454 --> 00:53:41.525
Bye.

1140
00:53:41.525 --> 00:53:43.165
(Honey, enjoy your free time.)

1141
00:53:43.165 --> 00:53:44.224
(Kissing)

1142
00:53:45.065 --> 00:53:47.034
- It's hard. Good luck. - Bye.

1143
00:53:47.034 --> 00:53:51.335
(Look forward to 48 hours of Victor and Jane.)

1144
00:53:52.934 --> 00:53:55.474
We're here. Let's go.

1145
00:53:55.675 --> 00:53:58.474
There's a moray eel there. Right there.

1146
00:53:58.474 --> 00:54:00.844
Guys, did you catch a lot?

1147
00:54:01.375 --> 00:54:03.915
Seung Jae is getting stronger day by day.

1148
00:54:03.915 --> 00:54:05.545
It's getting hard for me to keep up.

1149
00:54:05.545 --> 00:54:07.755
So I thought it'd be a nice experience.

1150
00:54:07.755 --> 00:54:10.224
And we could replenish our energy at the same time.

1151
00:54:10.384 --> 00:54:12.485
- He got it! - To invigorate Ji Yong,

1152
00:54:12.485 --> 00:54:14.525
Seung Jae and Ji Yong came to catch eels.

1153
00:54:14.525 --> 00:54:15.895
- Get it. - Let me!

1154
00:54:16.224 --> 00:54:17.895
I want to catch eels now.

1155
00:54:18.864 --> 00:54:20.795
(Seung Jae enters the tideland with high hopes.)

1156
00:54:20.795 --> 00:54:21.835
(What is this?)

1157
00:54:21.835 --> 00:54:23.605
- Are there many eels? - No, no.

1158
00:54:24.264 --> 00:54:25.505
They're not scary.

1159
00:54:26.005 --> 00:54:28.404
My feet are stuck.

1160
00:54:28.404 --> 00:54:29.545
Let's go there.

1161
00:54:29.545 --> 00:54:31.105
(He starts moving with some courage.)

1162
00:54:31.105 --> 00:54:32.614
Wait. I don't like it.

1163
00:54:32.614 --> 00:54:35.014
(But he can't hide the nervousness in his eyes.)

1164
00:54:36.485 --> 00:54:37.744
We are not eels.

1165
00:54:37.744 --> 00:54:39.855
(Flopping)

1166
00:54:40.715 --> 00:54:43.125
It's okay. The water can't get inside the pants.

1167
00:54:43.125 --> 00:54:45.554
(It's odd. My body isn't listening to me.)

1168
00:54:46.895 --> 00:54:48.525
(Moving carefully)

1169
00:54:48.525 --> 00:54:51.295
- There. Dad, get that. - Where?

1170
00:54:51.724 --> 00:54:55.465
(He spots an eel hiding in the mud.)

1171
00:54:57.335 --> 00:54:58.764
(The eel slithers past him.)

1172
00:54:58.764 --> 00:55:00.335
(This is nothing.)

1173
00:55:00.835 --> 00:55:02.275
(But the eel escapes.)

1174
00:55:04.344 --> 00:55:05.445
Goodness.

1175
00:55:06.574 --> 00:55:09.545
(Did you think I'd let you catch me?)

1176
00:55:11.445 --> 00:55:13.614
(Chuckling)

1177
00:55:15.154 --> 00:55:16.485
Where did it go?

1178
00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:19.855
- An eel got away. - Take a look at that.

1179
00:55:19.855 --> 00:55:23.264
That eel. Look. That eel is sleeping. Catch it.

1180
00:55:23.695 --> 00:55:24.695
(Flinching)

1181
00:55:25.065 --> 00:55:27.134
- Dad. - What?

1182
00:55:27.134 --> 00:55:29.634
Even if it's hard, you can pull your legs out...

1183
00:55:29.634 --> 00:55:31.165
like this. Just like this.

1184
00:55:32.335 --> 00:55:34.574
No, I can't get them out. They're stuck.

1185
00:55:36.505 --> 00:55:37.704
Here's one too.

1186
00:55:37.704 --> 00:55:39.815
(He goes to catch eels with Ji Yong's help.)

1187
00:55:39.815 --> 00:55:41.474
(Another kid intercepts the eel.)

1188
00:55:44.244 --> 00:55:45.744
Let's catch that one.

1189
00:55:46.485 --> 00:55:47.755
Hey, there's an eel.

1190
00:55:47.755 --> 00:55:50.025
Hey, that one. Go and catch the baby eel.

1191
00:55:50.025 --> 00:55:51.485
You can crawl with me.

1192
00:55:52.125 --> 00:55:53.195
No, I can't.

1193
00:55:53.195 --> 00:55:54.494
There's a mudskipper here too.

1194
00:55:56.764 --> 00:55:58.425
(He's puzzled. What just happened?)

1195
00:55:59.025 --> 00:56:00.465
Where's the eel?

1196
00:56:00.465 --> 00:56:02.094
- You want to catch eels? - Yes.

1197
00:56:02.804 --> 00:56:04.965
(What should I do?)

1198
00:56:06.235 --> 00:56:08.574
I'll throw the eels. You should catch them. Okay?

1199
00:56:09.505 --> 00:56:12.074
- He suggests another way. - Catch that one.

1200
00:56:12.175 --> 00:56:14.244
This is a joint operation of the Kos.

1201
00:56:14.244 --> 00:56:15.375
Put it in there. Oh, my.

1202
00:56:16.244 --> 00:56:18.344
- There's one. - Catch it.

1203
00:56:19.215 --> 00:56:21.784
(Seung Jae's hands are swift.)

1204
00:56:22.085 --> 00:56:24.085
There's another one. Please put that in.

1205
00:56:24.355 --> 00:56:26.494
They are the perfect pair.

1206
00:56:27.025 --> 00:56:29.895
How old is this one? How can it be so quick?

1207
00:56:29.895 --> 00:56:32.025
- This one is so fast. - It is, isn't it?

1208
00:56:32.025 --> 00:56:33.895
It ran away even when I caught it.

1209
00:56:33.895 --> 00:56:35.934
Hey, try to catch this.

1210
00:56:36.264 --> 00:56:38.764
- Look. This is huge. - That's huge.

1211
00:56:39.505 --> 00:56:41.804
- He caught a massive one. - You're good, Seung Jae.

1212
00:56:41.804 --> 00:56:43.175
- Are they your friends? - This is a grandpa,

1213
00:56:43.175 --> 00:56:44.574
and that one is a grandma.

1214
00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:48.045
Gosh, it's warm.

1215
00:56:48.775 --> 00:56:51.085
Seung Jae, let's wash out all the mud, okay?

1216
00:56:51.884 --> 00:56:54.085
(The spa with the ocean view has open.)

1217
00:56:54.284 --> 00:56:57.925
Wash this foot here too. Help me wash it too.

1218
00:56:57.925 --> 00:56:59.755
(Customers' satisfaction is the top priority.)

1219
00:57:00.824 --> 00:57:02.594
My hands are so muddy.

1220
00:57:04.195 --> 00:57:07.295
(Ji Yong is washing his muddy hands.)

1221
00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:10.364
(Trying to read his face)

1222
00:57:12.574 --> 00:57:14.835
(Oh, no. I peed.)

1223
00:57:16.704 --> 00:57:18.505
(What should I do?)

1224
00:57:18.505 --> 00:57:19.675
What are you doing?

1225
00:57:20.815 --> 00:57:23.184
(Dad, I made a bathroom with a nice view.)

1226
00:57:24.315 --> 00:57:26.985
All right. Let's wash your hair.

1227
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:28.855
(What did you say?)

1228
00:57:30.454 --> 00:57:32.554
(He's going to wash with this yellow water?)

1229
00:57:33.224 --> 00:57:34.824
(No, that can't happen.)

1230
00:57:35.724 --> 00:57:38.465
No, I don't want to wash it.

1231
00:57:39.065 --> 00:57:40.235
(He lets go of the bucket.)

1232
00:57:40.235 --> 00:57:42.165
Seung Jae failed to hold onto the bucket.

1233
00:57:42.735 --> 00:57:45.165
How is he going to avert this crisis?

1234
00:57:45.165 --> 00:57:46.675
(The bucket with yellow water is approaching.)

1235
00:57:46.675 --> 00:57:49.344
(This is a critical moment!)

1236
00:57:49.344 --> 00:57:51.404
(This is it!)

1237
00:57:51.675 --> 00:57:53.875
Dad, you have to get splashed.

1238
00:57:53.875 --> 00:57:56.145
(Dad, you have to get splashed.)

1239
00:57:56.145 --> 00:57:57.315
Where will I get splashed?

1240
00:57:57.744 --> 00:58:00.654
(The best defense is a good offense!)

1241
00:58:01.184 --> 00:58:02.654
Why? What is it?

1242
00:58:02.654 --> 00:58:04.554
(Dad, you cannot come close.)

1243
00:58:05.724 --> 00:58:08.224
(Yes! I've successfully evaded the crisis.)

1244
00:58:09.025 --> 00:58:10.764
- Dad, you should wash. - Okay. I will.

1245
00:58:11.264 --> 00:58:12.395
(His outfit is a mess.)

1246
00:58:12.395 --> 00:58:14.364
Dad, your clothes are dirty.

1247
00:58:14.465 --> 00:58:15.864
Aren't my clothes dirty?

1248
00:58:17.434 --> 00:58:18.605
- Did you finish? - Yes.

1249
00:58:18.605 --> 00:58:20.704
- I finished washing him. - Gosh, they are dirty.

1250
00:58:20.704 --> 00:58:22.404
I forgot to bring an extra set of clothes.

1251
00:58:22.404 --> 00:58:23.904
- You forgot? - I forgot to bring pants.

1252
00:58:23.904 --> 00:58:25.204
Do you have a spare pair of pants?

1253
00:58:25.204 --> 00:58:27.775
Sure. If you go that way, you'll see my house.

1254
00:58:27.775 --> 00:58:29.945
I can lend you a pair.

1255
00:58:29.945 --> 00:58:32.344
I'll bring your pants, Dad.

1256
00:58:32.344 --> 00:58:33.884
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1257
00:58:34.054 --> 00:58:35.925
Where is your house?

1258
00:58:35.925 --> 00:58:37.425
You can go that way. It's not far.

1259
00:58:37.425 --> 00:58:40.525
The pants are at the house with the blue roof.

1260
00:58:40.525 --> 00:58:43.094
I will tell them to give you the pants, okay?

1261
00:58:43.094 --> 00:58:45.295
- Okay. Yes. - Be brave, and come back.

1262
00:58:45.295 --> 00:58:46.395
Go, go!

1263
00:58:46.395 --> 00:58:48.094
(Seung Jae sets out!)

1264
00:58:51.005 --> 00:58:52.134
Wait. What is that?

1265
00:58:52.134 --> 00:58:53.275
(He gets distracted from the start.)

1266
00:58:53.275 --> 00:58:55.735
Here it is. It's here.

1267
00:58:55.735 --> 00:58:56.875
Hello.

1268
00:58:57.505 --> 00:58:59.275
Is your mom here?

1269
00:59:00.045 --> 00:59:01.875
(Croaking)

1270
00:59:02.884 --> 00:59:04.045
That's a frog.

1271
00:59:04.045 --> 00:59:07.415
(Where is the frog?)

1272
00:59:07.415 --> 00:59:10.425
Hey, what are you? Are you a frog?

1273
00:59:11.755 --> 00:59:13.324
(He wants to catch it with his hands.)

1274
00:59:13.324 --> 00:59:14.355
(Jumping)

1275
00:59:14.994 --> 00:59:16.724
The frog is so fast.

1276
00:59:17.494 --> 00:59:18.965
(What are you doing, Seung Jae?)

1277
00:59:18.965 --> 00:59:20.434
(He puts the water bottle gently on the ground.)

1278
00:59:21.195 --> 00:59:23.304
Hey, frog. You should go in.

1279
00:59:23.665 --> 00:59:25.404
That's your house, isn't it?

1280
00:59:27.235 --> 00:59:30.045
Frog, go inside.

1281
00:59:30.304 --> 00:59:33.675
This is your house. Hey, come in.

1282
00:59:34.045 --> 00:59:35.175
Frog!

1283
00:59:35.645 --> 00:59:37.485
(Oh, no. It left.)

1284
00:59:39.215 --> 00:59:40.355
Let's go.

1285
00:59:41.284 --> 00:59:43.884
(Seung Jae hurries as he thinks about his dad.)

1286
00:59:45.925 --> 00:59:47.494
What are you doing?

1287
00:59:47.795 --> 00:59:49.324
I'm catching fish.

1288
00:59:49.625 --> 00:59:52.224
Fish? Did you catch any fish?

1289
00:59:52.224 --> 00:59:54.295
Yes, I caught three fish.

1290
00:59:54.295 --> 00:59:56.565
- Please show me. - You want to see?

1291
00:59:57.005 --> 00:59:59.204
- Let's see. - Let's see.

1292
01:00:01.534 --> 01:00:04.005
I like fish.

1293
01:00:04.675 --> 01:00:05.675
- You do? - Yes.

1294
01:00:05.675 --> 01:00:07.474
This is how the fish looks.

1295
01:00:08.514 --> 01:00:11.184
(His smile disappears when he sees the fish.)

1296
01:00:11.184 --> 01:00:13.085
(What have you done to the fish?)

1297
01:00:13.855 --> 01:00:15.284
You should put it in the river.

1298
01:00:15.284 --> 01:00:17.284
(You should put it in the river.)

1299
01:00:18.054 --> 01:00:22.054
Put it in deep water.

1300
01:00:22.154 --> 01:00:23.364
When I put it in, it swims away.

1301
01:00:23.364 --> 01:00:25.665
You should put it in the river.

1302
01:00:25.994 --> 01:00:28.295
That's how it can breathe.

1303
01:00:28.735 --> 01:00:30.634
(He puts it in the net. The net is in the water.)

1304
01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:32.465
Are you happy now?

1305
01:00:33.175 --> 01:00:34.735
No. Take it out of the net.

1306
01:00:34.735 --> 01:00:36.275
- You're not? - Put it without the net.

1307
01:00:36.275 --> 01:00:38.704
The fish can only live without the net.

1308
01:00:39.744 --> 01:00:41.675
You have to let the fish live.

1309
01:00:41.675 --> 01:00:44.645
- Okay. - Please promise me.

1310
01:00:45.045 --> 01:00:46.884
I'm going to release them later.

1311
01:00:46.884 --> 01:00:49.855
You must put them in the water for them to live.

1312
01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.884
Okay. What a nice boy.

1313
01:00:51.884 --> 01:00:53.454
I have to go get my dad's pants.

1314
01:00:53.454 --> 01:00:56.724
I will be on my way to find them.

1315
01:00:57.395 --> 01:00:59.125
Hang in there!

1316
01:01:00.895 --> 01:01:02.735
There's the blue roof!

1317
01:01:03.565 --> 01:01:06.534
Is this the house? Mister!

1318
01:01:07.534 --> 01:01:09.304
Yes? Are you here for the pants?

1319
01:01:09.645 --> 01:01:10.875
Are you here for the pants?

1320
01:01:11.145 --> 01:01:13.014
Yes, I'm here for the pants.

1321
01:01:13.014 --> 01:01:15.145
- What's your name? - The blue-roofed house...

1322
01:01:15.145 --> 01:01:17.244
- What's your name? - I'm Ko Seung Jae.

1323
01:01:17.244 --> 01:01:18.384
Is it Ko Seung Jae?

1324
01:01:18.384 --> 01:01:21.554
- This is a puppy. A pup. - What?

1325
01:01:22.654 --> 01:01:24.654
What is this?

1326
01:01:26.295 --> 01:01:27.724
You're full of questions.

1327
01:01:27.724 --> 01:01:28.994
You're so curious.

1328
01:01:28.994 --> 01:01:30.364
(He's full of curiosity.)

1329
01:01:30.364 --> 01:01:32.065
Do you have the pants?

1330
01:01:32.065 --> 01:01:33.634
Yes, give them to your dad.

1331
01:01:33.634 --> 01:01:35.295
(Seung Jae goes away when he gives the pair.)

1332
01:01:35.295 --> 01:01:36.835
Take this pair to your dad.

1333
01:01:36.835 --> 01:01:39.375
I'll give you the yogurt drink. Here it is.

1334
01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:41.634
- Mister. - Yes?

1335
01:01:41.634 --> 01:01:45.045
But what about some candy?

1336
01:01:45.045 --> 01:01:47.514
I don't have candy. I'll give you the drink.

1337
01:01:47.514 --> 01:01:48.715
- I'll give you this. - Yogurt drink.

1338
01:01:48.715 --> 01:01:50.815
Have a seat and drink this.

1339
01:01:50.815 --> 01:01:52.045
Thank you.

1340
01:01:52.684 --> 01:01:55.215
(It tastes the sweetest on an errand.)

1341
01:01:56.985 --> 01:01:58.255
You're drinking it.

1342
01:01:58.255 --> 01:02:00.295
(He drinks it without taking a breath.)

1343
01:02:00.295 --> 01:02:01.324
All right.

1344
01:02:02.025 --> 01:02:04.895
(He even gargles with the drink.)

1345
01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:06.364
You drank it all.

1346
01:02:07.165 --> 01:02:08.534
Did you like it?

1347
01:02:08.534 --> 01:02:10.634
- Take them to your dad. - Thank you.

1348
01:02:10.634 --> 01:02:12.534
Sure. Good boy.

1349
01:02:14.304 --> 01:02:16.775
(Ji Yong is about to turn into a stone waiting.)

1350
01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:19.675
What's taking him so long?

1351
01:02:20.344 --> 01:02:22.715
Dad. Dad!

1352
01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:23.884
Seung Jae.

1353
01:02:24.815 --> 01:02:27.255
(You had to wait long, didn't you?)

1354
01:02:27.585 --> 01:02:28.985
Why isn't it coming?

1355
01:02:28.985 --> 01:02:30.324
(He's readjusting.)

1356
01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:37.264
- Dad, I have your pants. - Yes?

1357
01:02:37.264 --> 01:02:38.494
My pants?

1358
01:02:38.494 --> 01:02:40.634
You brought me such a nice pair.

1359
01:02:40.634 --> 01:02:42.864
Dad, these are for you.

1360
01:02:42.864 --> 01:02:44.065
Are they for me?

1361
01:02:45.105 --> 01:02:47.005
I think they will fit.

1362
01:02:47.105 --> 01:02:50.005
Dad, these will fit too.

1363
01:02:50.005 --> 01:02:51.505
- These too? - Yes.

1364
01:02:51.505 --> 01:02:53.215
The pink one is nice.

1365
01:02:53.215 --> 01:02:54.614
- This one? - Yes.

1366
01:02:54.614 --> 01:02:55.715
(Seung Jae has a particular taste.)

1367
01:02:55.715 --> 01:02:58.284
- Wear that one. - Okay, I will.

1368
01:02:58.284 --> 01:03:00.915
Okay. Hurry up and change your pants.

1369
01:03:00.915 --> 01:03:03.154
Okay, I'll go get changed.

1370
01:03:04.025 --> 01:03:07.025
(Elegant white sneakers...)

1371
01:03:07.025 --> 01:03:10.565
(and wine-colored pants look fancy together.)

1372
01:03:11.824 --> 01:03:13.264
(Lady Ji Yong)

1373
01:03:13.264 --> 01:03:14.764
(2017 fall and winter trend)

1374
01:03:15.264 --> 01:03:17.404
Look at all your friends.

1375
01:03:17.404 --> 01:03:19.335
You have to sit here for the eels to come out.

1376
01:03:21.335 --> 01:03:23.545
(This looks like a grill...)

1377
01:03:24.474 --> 01:03:26.645
(Side dishes are coming out.)

1378
01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:32.284
(I thought eels lived in water...)

1379
01:03:33.454 --> 01:03:34.915
(It's here!)

1380
01:03:35.784 --> 01:03:38.554
(Wait...)

1381
01:03:39.695 --> 01:03:41.425
(Squirming)

1382
01:03:41.425 --> 01:03:43.165
(Hello, Seung Jae)

1383
01:03:44.994 --> 01:03:49.565
Don't cut the eel.

1384
01:03:50.165 --> 01:03:51.434
(Right...)

1385
01:03:51.434 --> 01:03:52.934
I realized then.

1386
01:03:52.974 --> 01:03:55.235
I only thought about how tasty it would be.

1387
01:03:55.235 --> 01:03:58.244
I forgot how they serve it.

1388
01:03:58.804 --> 01:04:01.915
(He especially loves sea creatures. )

1389
01:04:02.585 --> 01:04:03.915
Should we eat it?

1390
01:04:04.384 --> 01:04:06.315
(We're going to eat the crab?)

1391
01:04:07.485 --> 01:04:11.784
(How can I eat my friends?)

1392
01:04:12.384 --> 01:04:14.554
(Teary)

1393
01:04:15.324 --> 01:04:19.264
You get strong if you eat eels.

1394
01:04:19.264 --> 01:04:21.465
See? What did he say?

1395
01:04:21.465 --> 01:04:22.634
(Will his friend help Seung Jae?)

1396
01:04:22.634 --> 01:04:25.134
I don't want to eat it.

1397
01:04:26.235 --> 01:04:28.235
(He's feeling sad because of the eel.)

1398
01:04:28.235 --> 01:04:30.545
- You don't want it? - No.

1399
01:04:30.545 --> 01:04:33.045
Okay. We'll ask for something else.

1400
01:04:33.145 --> 01:04:36.545
If we eat it, it'll die.

1401
01:04:36.545 --> 01:04:38.784
Okay, okay.

1402
01:04:39.184 --> 01:04:42.014
Okay. Do you feel bad for the eel?

1403
01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:44.324
I'm sorry.

1404
01:04:44.324 --> 01:04:46.255
He's crying too much. Could you cook it inside?

1405
01:04:46.255 --> 01:04:47.324
Yes.

1406
01:04:47.324 --> 01:04:49.895
I'm sorry. Bye, eel.

1407
01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:54.565
Turn it back into an eel.

1408
01:04:54.565 --> 01:04:58.034
Fix the eel...

1409
01:04:58.204 --> 01:05:01.735
- Fix the eel. - Okay, I will.

1410
01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:04.145
The owner will put him back together.

1411
01:05:05.505 --> 01:05:08.175
(Here is the eel doctor.)

1412
01:05:08.775 --> 01:05:09.784
(He's suspicious.)

1413
01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:11.645
I'm putting the eel back together.

1414
01:05:11.645 --> 01:05:12.855
He's putting it back together.

1415
01:05:12.855 --> 01:05:14.755
This is like pork.

1416
01:05:17.054 --> 01:05:18.684
Let's have the meat with rice, okay?

1417
01:05:18.684 --> 01:05:19.895
Can you eat it now?

1418
01:05:19.895 --> 01:05:20.954
(The eel is disguised as pork.)

1419
01:05:22.425 --> 01:05:23.864
(Ji Yong is taking a bite first.)

1420
01:05:24.494 --> 01:05:26.295
Did you get stronger?

1421
01:05:26.295 --> 01:05:28.195
Yes, I think I'm getting stronger.

1422
01:05:30.134 --> 01:05:31.934
I'm getting strong.

1423
01:05:32.465 --> 01:05:34.235
(Seung Jae is taking a bite.)

1424
01:05:35.175 --> 01:05:38.545
(It tastes pretty good.)

1425
01:05:39.815 --> 01:05:42.145
(This meat is good!)

1426
01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:45.384
- I think I'm stronger. - Have one more.

1427
01:05:46.784 --> 01:05:49.755
Mister, I...

1428
01:05:49.755 --> 01:05:52.054
I will finish all the food in two spoonfuls.

1429
01:05:52.054 --> 01:05:55.395
Then you can eat a second eel.

1430
01:05:55.554 --> 01:05:57.165
(What?)

1431
01:05:57.395 --> 01:05:59.364
(We just calmed him down...)

1432
01:06:00.065 --> 01:06:02.534
It's not an eel. It's pork.

1433
01:06:02.534 --> 01:06:04.304
Oh, is it pork?

1434
01:06:04.704 --> 01:06:07.675
I don't like to eat eels.

1435
01:06:07.835 --> 01:06:10.804
Dad. Is the owner...

1436
01:06:10.804 --> 01:06:13.074
- putting him together? - Yes, he is.

1437
01:06:13.074 --> 01:06:14.375
Seung Jae, if you finish this,

1438
01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:16.215
he'll bring out the eel.

1439
01:06:16.645 --> 01:06:18.415
(He's so cute.)

1440
01:06:18.884 --> 01:06:20.954
Here comes another one. Is it good?

1441
01:06:20.954 --> 01:06:22.014
Yes.

1442
01:06:22.415 --> 01:06:24.324
(I can't help but laugh.)

1443
01:06:24.324 --> 01:06:28.755
(Look at the muscles I got from the meat.)

1444
01:06:32.264 --> 01:06:34.965
This modern living room is filled with warm light.

1445
01:06:36.005 --> 01:06:37.665
Whose house could this be?

1446
01:06:37.665 --> 01:06:39.235
(Whose house is this?)

1447
01:06:41.404 --> 01:06:43.574
The bedroom looks clean.

1448
01:06:44.175 --> 01:06:45.474
There's an island in the kitchen.

1449
01:06:45.474 --> 01:06:46.974
(The kitchen is clean and modern too.)

1450
01:06:49.074 --> 01:06:51.884
In the lovely children's room,

1451
01:06:52.614 --> 01:06:54.384
there are three scooters.

1452
01:06:56.824 --> 01:06:58.884
There is an area that stands out.

1453
01:06:59.855 --> 01:07:01.824
It's full of gym gear.

1454
01:07:01.824 --> 01:07:03.494
(It's a home gym set in the balcony.)

1455
01:07:03.494 --> 01:07:05.824
(Could this place belong to an athlete?)

1456
01:07:07.335 --> 01:07:10.434
Here is a crucial clue. There are many trophies.

1457
01:07:11.005 --> 01:07:13.404
For some reason, they look familiar.

1458
01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:15.434
(Wait!)

1459
01:07:15.804 --> 01:07:18.605
The trophy's owner is Dong Gook.

1460
01:07:19.005 --> 01:07:21.474
The Lee family must have moved.

1461
01:07:22.415 --> 01:07:24.184
My job requires me to move a lot.

1462
01:07:24.184 --> 01:07:26.985
We moved many times,

1463
01:07:26.985 --> 01:07:30.525
and it was always during a game.

1464
01:07:30.525 --> 01:07:32.994
I was out of the country...

1465
01:07:32.994 --> 01:07:35.824
for a game again this time.

1466
01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.724
I feel bad because we always move without me.

1467
01:07:38.724 --> 01:07:41.165
I'm thankful but I also feel bad.

1468
01:07:41.534 --> 01:07:42.565
Did you sleep well?

1469
01:07:42.565 --> 01:07:44.704
- Yes. - I feel strange.

1470
01:07:44.704 --> 01:07:46.704
This is my first time in the new place.

1471
01:07:46.704 --> 01:07:48.105
I came last night,

1472
01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:50.244
so I don't know what's what.

1473
01:07:50.244 --> 01:07:53.344
Dad, I got hurt here...

1474
01:07:53.344 --> 01:07:54.744
at our original house.

1475
01:07:54.744 --> 01:07:56.884
What's original house and what's this house?

1476
01:07:57.284 --> 01:07:58.645
(Where are we?)

1477
01:07:58.645 --> 01:07:59.715
What is this place?

1478
01:08:00.355 --> 01:08:01.514
Our new place.

1479
01:08:01.514 --> 01:08:03.954
Yes, this is our new place.

1480
01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:05.184
What about the old house?

1481
01:08:06.094 --> 01:08:07.094
Songdo house.

1482
01:08:07.094 --> 01:08:09.264
Songdo house? Where are we now?

1483
01:08:09.264 --> 01:08:10.264
The new house.

1484
01:08:10.264 --> 01:08:11.795
- Yes, the new house. - New house.

1485
01:08:12.224 --> 01:08:13.335
Guys.

1486
01:08:14.134 --> 01:08:17.364
Where did you get that?

1487
01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:21.475
(This sign accompanied the kids last week.)

1488
01:08:22.234 --> 01:08:25.244
You were gone to play soccer.

1489
01:08:25.244 --> 01:08:27.314
The fake dad came.

1490
01:08:27.314 --> 01:08:29.845
Real dad was gone,

1491
01:08:29.845 --> 01:08:33.015
so fake dad came.

1492
01:08:33.015 --> 01:08:35.454
Do you like him or me?

1493
01:08:35.454 --> 01:08:37.454
- This one. - What about Si An?

1494
01:08:38.524 --> 01:08:39.954
Real dad.

1495
01:08:39.954 --> 01:08:41.394
I'm curious.

1496
01:08:41.394 --> 01:08:44.024
What did you do when you met the teacher?

1497
01:08:44.225 --> 01:08:45.665
- Attention. - Attention.

1498
01:08:45.795 --> 01:08:46.935
Who was the leader?

1499
01:08:46.935 --> 01:08:48.435
Si An.

1500
01:08:48.435 --> 01:08:50.064
Were you the leader?

1501
01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:52.734
Father.

1502
01:08:52.734 --> 01:08:54.435
- Father. - Good.

1503
01:08:54.435 --> 01:08:56.604
- Father. - Father.

1504
01:08:56.604 --> 01:08:59.545
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1505
01:08:59.545 --> 01:09:01.915
I just woke up. Should I sleep again?

1506
01:09:01.915 --> 01:09:04.614
- Hello. - It's good morning.

1507
01:09:04.614 --> 01:09:07.314
Good morning.

1508
01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:10.625
Good. Did you all sleep well?

1509
01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.824
- Yes. - Now that we moved,

1510
01:09:12.824 --> 01:09:15.024
we should show Grandpa the new house.

1511
01:09:15.024 --> 01:09:16.994
(They're calling Dong Gook's dad.)

1512
01:09:16.994 --> 01:09:18.824
Grandpa.

1513
01:09:19.095 --> 01:09:21.665
- Si An. - Attention.

1514
01:09:21.734 --> 01:09:24.765
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1515
01:09:24.765 --> 01:09:28.475
Si An, do you like the new house?

1516
01:09:28.475 --> 01:09:29.505
I like it.

1517
01:09:29.505 --> 01:09:30.675
- Do you? - Yes.

1518
01:09:30.675 --> 01:09:32.814
(Grandpa, come visit us.)

1519
01:09:33.114 --> 01:09:35.885
After you move,

1520
01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:39.354
you should hang pollack on a silk thread.

1521
01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:40.454
Dried pollack?

1522
01:09:40.614 --> 01:09:43.585
Dried pollack. Hang a big one.

1523
01:09:43.654 --> 01:09:45.425
Make some rice cakes...

1524
01:09:45.425 --> 01:09:47.225
and give a lot to your neighbor below.

1525
01:09:47.494 --> 01:09:48.824
Because the kids run?

1526
01:09:48.824 --> 01:09:50.394
Yes, they run too much.

1527
01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:52.465
You should go and say hello.

1528
01:09:52.465 --> 01:09:54.135
- I'll do that. - Okay.

1529
01:09:54.135 --> 01:09:56.635
You should visit sometime.

1530
01:09:56.635 --> 01:09:58.234
- Okay. Bye. - Okay.

1531
01:09:58.234 --> 01:09:59.675
Bye.

1532
01:10:01.435 --> 01:10:03.704
- It's here. - Dad.

1533
01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:05.744
Look, these are rice cakes.

1534
01:10:05.805 --> 01:10:08.144
- Hello. - Hello.

1535
01:10:08.345 --> 01:10:10.784
- I ordered on the phone. - It's rice cakes!

1536
01:10:10.784 --> 01:10:12.654
- Yes. - Rice cakes!

1537
01:10:13.055 --> 01:10:14.984
This one is good...

1538
01:10:14.984 --> 01:10:18.125
No, no. We're not here for those.

1539
01:10:19.194 --> 01:10:21.595
- What are we buying? - Steamed rice cakes.

1540
01:10:21.595 --> 01:10:23.324
Steamed rice cakes?

1541
01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:25.364
This is ours, Si An.

1542
01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:28.234
(He ordered 24 packages.)

1543
01:10:28.994 --> 01:10:31.435
(They're being put into a plastic bag.)

1544
01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:32.734
This one.

1545
01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:34.475
Are you going to put some there?

1546
01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:36.475
- Yes. - You can do it.

1547
01:10:36.545 --> 01:10:37.975
Si An.

1548
01:10:37.975 --> 01:10:38.975
Yes?

1549
01:10:38.975 --> 01:10:42.144
We should share the load since we're both men.

1550
01:10:42.144 --> 01:10:44.585
It would be unfair for me to carry it all.

1551
01:10:44.784 --> 01:10:46.555
(No!)

1552
01:10:47.215 --> 01:10:49.114
Let's split it in half.

1553
01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:51.425
- What? - Let's do half and half.

1554
01:10:51.524 --> 01:10:53.625
(I can't hear you.)

1555
01:10:53.725 --> 01:10:55.965
You tend to ignore me when it's disadvantageous.

1556
01:10:56.265 --> 01:10:59.095
I think it'll be heavy.

1557
01:10:59.635 --> 01:11:02.364
(Si An is rushing out.)

1558
01:11:02.364 --> 01:11:04.835
Si An. You're carrying just two rice cakes.

1559
01:11:04.835 --> 01:11:06.505
Look how many I have.

1560
01:11:06.904 --> 01:11:09.305
Look. I have so many.

1561
01:11:09.774 --> 01:11:12.375
Take as many as you can help me.

1562
01:11:12.875 --> 01:11:13.875
(Gosh...)

1563
01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:16.244
- This one? - Yes.

1564
01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.215
As much as you can take.

1565
01:11:18.444 --> 01:11:20.415
Take as much as you can carry.

1566
01:11:20.415 --> 01:11:23.685
(3 is all I can carry.)

1567
01:11:23.954 --> 01:11:26.494
Just three? You're being cheap.

1568
01:11:26.494 --> 01:11:28.055
I'm carrying so many.

1569
01:11:28.425 --> 01:11:31.024
Are you only going to carry three?

1570
01:11:31.024 --> 01:11:32.165
(Yes!)

1571
01:11:32.165 --> 01:11:34.465
You have a bag too. Let's put some in here.

1572
01:11:35.494 --> 01:11:37.734
Don't be cheap. I have so many.

1573
01:11:37.734 --> 01:11:39.604
(Dong Gook is trying to give Si An more.)

1574
01:11:40.074 --> 01:11:42.604
(One more rice cake in the backpack...)

1575
01:11:43.104 --> 01:11:44.875
Another one.

1576
01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:46.675
(He's adding one more.)

1577
01:11:46.675 --> 01:11:48.444
I have too many, right?

1578
01:11:50.114 --> 01:11:52.215
Dad, it's too heavy.

1579
01:11:52.215 --> 01:11:54.784
If you want to become an adult,

1580
01:11:54.784 --> 01:11:56.085
you have to carry this.

1581
01:11:56.085 --> 01:11:58.625
- Bye. - Take care.

1582
01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:01.194
Si An, this way.

1583
01:12:01.194 --> 01:12:02.625
Si An.

1584
01:12:02.824 --> 01:12:04.465
- Si An. - Si An.

1585
01:12:04.595 --> 01:12:07.694
My name is Si An.

1586
01:12:09.835 --> 01:12:12.704
(Si An is being delayed.)

1587
01:12:13.104 --> 01:12:15.604
Dad, it's too heavy.

1588
01:12:15.704 --> 01:12:17.204
Mine is heavier.

1589
01:12:17.204 --> 01:12:18.675
I don't have any hands.

1590
01:12:18.675 --> 01:12:20.345
It's too heavy.

1591
01:12:20.345 --> 01:12:22.144
Is it too heavy? Let me see.

1592
01:12:23.685 --> 01:12:25.185
I'll carry one.

1593
01:12:25.284 --> 01:12:27.984
I'll take one. Carry it.

1594
01:12:28.284 --> 01:12:29.354
Okay.

1595
01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:33.125
(Dong Gook is evil.)

1596
01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:34.154
Let's go.

1597
01:12:34.154 --> 01:12:36.564
(Si An hasn't sensed it.)

1598
01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:39.935
(Why does it still feel so heavy?)

1599
01:12:39.935 --> 01:12:41.034
It's not hard anymore, right?

1600
01:12:41.465 --> 01:12:43.765
It's a little hard.

1601
01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:46.604
It's a little hard.

1602
01:12:47.904 --> 01:12:50.944
Wave hello to the man on the bicycle.

1603
01:12:51.505 --> 01:12:53.274
(Hello, Si An.)

1604
01:12:53.644 --> 01:12:55.614
Say hello to that man.

1605
01:12:55.644 --> 01:12:57.444
Hello.

1606
01:12:59.144 --> 01:13:01.685
(Dong Gook is fast with the rice cakes.)

1607
01:13:01.685 --> 01:13:03.984
Let's go. Carry it.

1608
01:13:07.194 --> 01:13:09.465
- Let's go. - It's heavy!

1609
01:13:09.925 --> 01:13:10.925
What?

1610
01:13:10.925 --> 01:13:13.335
It's heavy!

1611
01:13:13.335 --> 01:13:14.465
Okay, give me one.

1612
01:13:14.494 --> 01:13:16.234
Take this out!

1613
01:13:17.404 --> 01:13:20.635
You put it in, right?

1614
01:13:20.635 --> 01:13:24.074
No. It must have jumped. Give it to me.

1615
01:13:24.875 --> 01:13:26.915
Put it in. Let's go.

1616
01:13:28.574 --> 01:13:31.144
(Si An is still suspicious.)

1617
01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:35.555
One, two.

1618
01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:37.925
- Two. - Two?

1619
01:13:38.185 --> 01:13:40.154
- Come here, Si An. - Yes?

1620
01:13:40.295 --> 01:13:43.465
It's so heavy. Should we eat one?

1621
01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:44.795
Yes.

1622
01:13:45.324 --> 01:13:48.694
I'll eat my own.

1623
01:13:49.564 --> 01:13:52.064
(He wants to make his load lighter.)

1624
01:13:52.104 --> 01:13:53.135
Here.

1625
01:13:53.704 --> 01:13:56.345
No, we'll eat mine.

1626
01:13:56.375 --> 01:13:58.574
(Are we eating yours?)

1627
01:13:58.574 --> 01:14:00.715
Go feed the cameraman.

1628
01:14:03.415 --> 01:14:07.085
We just moved. Eat some.

1629
01:14:11.454 --> 01:14:14.354
We just moved. Eat some.

1630
01:14:14.354 --> 01:14:16.165
Have a rice cake.

1631
01:14:16.564 --> 01:14:18.994
Thank you. I'll eat it.

1632
01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:24.734
(I better eat as much as I can.)

1633
01:14:25.265 --> 01:14:26.335
(Chewing)

1634
01:14:26.335 --> 01:14:28.104
Let's go, Si An.

1635
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:29.604
Carry it.

1636
01:14:29.604 --> 01:14:31.975
(Already? We only ate yours.)

1637
01:14:32.345 --> 01:14:35.114
Let's eat Si An's.

1638
01:14:35.215 --> 01:14:37.885
Let's eat Si An's.

1639
01:14:38.644 --> 01:14:39.685
What?

1640
01:14:39.685 --> 01:14:41.854
(Dong Gook is laughing at what Si An said.)

1641
01:14:41.854 --> 01:14:44.984
Okay, okay. We'll eat yours now.

1642
01:14:44.984 --> 01:14:46.095
(You're getting smart.)

1643
01:14:47.194 --> 01:14:49.595
Hey, it's a policeman.

1644
01:14:49.625 --> 01:14:51.894
- It's a policeman. - Salute.

1645
01:14:52.935 --> 01:14:53.994
Salute.

1646
01:14:55.965 --> 01:14:58.234
(Salute...)

1647
01:15:00.305 --> 01:15:02.135
We just moved.

1648
01:15:02.175 --> 01:15:04.704
- Enjoy the rice cake. - Say salute.

1649
01:15:05.005 --> 01:15:06.475
Salute.

1650
01:15:07.644 --> 01:15:09.244
Have a good day.

1651
01:15:10.444 --> 01:15:11.484
Si An.

1652
01:15:11.744 --> 01:15:12.854
Yes?

1653
01:15:13.354 --> 01:15:16.085
Should we play rock-paper-scissors?

1654
01:15:16.425 --> 01:15:17.425
Okay.

1655
01:15:17.685 --> 01:15:21.654
Dad, you go like this and I'll go like this.

1656
01:15:22.255 --> 01:15:23.394
(Dad versus Si An)

1657
01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:25.425
I should do this and you'll do this?

1658
01:15:25.425 --> 01:15:26.534
Do you trust me?

1659
01:15:27.965 --> 01:15:31.635
(No way...)

1660
01:15:32.364 --> 01:15:34.835
If you lose, you have to carry this.

1661
01:15:35.005 --> 01:15:36.704
- We have to switch. - Okay.

1662
01:15:36.904 --> 01:15:39.314
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1663
01:15:39.314 --> 01:15:41.345
(Dad will let me win, right?)

1664
01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:44.885
(Dong Gook wins!)

1665
01:15:45.515 --> 01:15:48.854
(Why did you play a rock?)

1666
01:15:50.024 --> 01:15:51.625
(He's grabbing Si An's basket.)

1667
01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:52.625
Let's go.

1668
01:15:52.854 --> 01:15:53.894
What?

1669
01:15:53.894 --> 01:15:55.354
(Fussing)

1670
01:15:55.354 --> 01:15:57.295
Okay, I'll give you one more chance.

1671
01:15:57.425 --> 01:15:58.494
I'll give you a chance.

1672
01:15:58.494 --> 01:16:00.435
(Si An's plan was ruined.)

1673
01:16:01.694 --> 01:16:04.704
(Si An is completely upset.)

1674
01:16:06.975 --> 01:16:09.345
Yes. You must be upset.

1675
01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:12.574
This is how you learn.

1676
01:16:13.545 --> 01:16:14.644
All right.

1677
01:16:14.644 --> 01:16:16.585
(There's no dad you can trust.)

1678
01:16:18.045 --> 01:16:20.314
All done. Are you done crying?

1679
01:16:20.885 --> 01:16:23.854
Let's go buy banana milk, okay?

1680
01:16:23.854 --> 01:16:26.255
(He's calming Si An down with banana milk.)

1681
01:16:26.454 --> 01:16:28.925
Let's consider it never happened...

1682
01:16:28.954 --> 01:16:31.394
and make up like real men.

1683
01:16:31.765 --> 01:16:33.835
Give me a punch. Come on.

1684
01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:36.064
Come on, let's be a men. I'll buy you banana milk.

1685
01:16:36.465 --> 01:16:40.404
Hold this. I'll hold this until the crosswalk.

1686
01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.144
I'll carry it for you until then.

1687
01:16:43.144 --> 01:16:44.744
(They're still sharing the load.)

1688
01:16:45.345 --> 01:16:47.314
You can't cry like that just because you lost.

1689
01:16:47.314 --> 01:16:49.284
No one will want to play the game with you again.

1690
01:16:50.015 --> 01:16:53.085
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

1691
01:16:53.814 --> 01:16:54.954
Isn't that right?

1692
01:16:56.425 --> 01:16:58.524
You shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

1693
01:16:58.984 --> 01:17:00.725
You should be thoughtful.

1694
01:17:01.154 --> 01:17:02.494
Become a bigger person.

1695
01:17:04.595 --> 01:17:08.394
All right. Go downstairs and hand these to them.

1696
01:17:08.394 --> 01:17:10.005
Use two hands. Good luck!

1697
01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:13.274
(Today's delivery man is Si An.)

1698
01:17:13.274 --> 01:17:15.234
Should I ring the bell?

1699
01:17:15.774 --> 01:17:17.074
(Jumping)

1700
01:17:17.074 --> 01:17:18.904
(I can't reach it.)

1701
01:17:18.904 --> 01:17:20.515
(I'll just knock instead.)

1702
01:17:20.515 --> 01:17:22.545
We just moved.

1703
01:17:23.915 --> 01:17:26.385
Hello. Hello.

1704
01:17:27.055 --> 01:17:28.185
Hello.

1705
01:17:29.284 --> 01:17:30.454
Hello.

1706
01:17:31.154 --> 01:17:34.954
We just moved. Please enjoy it.

1707
01:17:35.725 --> 01:17:38.194
- How old are you? - How old are you?

1708
01:17:38.864 --> 01:17:40.265
He's younger. He's three years old.

1709
01:17:40.635 --> 01:17:44.104
Let's get along.

1710
01:17:44.935 --> 01:17:47.074
- Bye. - Thank you.

1711
01:17:47.175 --> 01:17:48.875
Hello?

1712
01:17:53.244 --> 01:17:55.885
- Gosh, Si An. - Hello.

1713
01:17:56.085 --> 01:17:58.944
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1714
01:17:58.944 --> 01:18:01.114
I came to give you rice cakes.

1715
01:18:01.114 --> 01:18:02.954
- Are you giving it to me? - Yes.

1716
01:18:03.524 --> 01:18:05.385
- Is it for me? - Yes.

1717
01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:07.494
Gosh, thank you.

1718
01:18:07.555 --> 01:18:09.154
I won't run.

1719
01:18:09.225 --> 01:18:11.064
Okay, thank you.

1720
01:18:11.064 --> 01:18:13.234
Let's take a picture.

1721
01:18:13.494 --> 01:18:15.734
- Good luck. - One, two, three.

1722
01:18:15.835 --> 01:18:17.034
Good luck.

1723
01:18:17.064 --> 01:18:20.074
- Bye, Si An. - Thank you. Bye.

1724
01:18:20.074 --> 01:18:22.644
- Bye. See you soon. - Okay.

1725
01:18:23.975 --> 01:18:26.915
(Where is he going last?)

1726
01:18:29.284 --> 01:18:31.114
(Who is that?)

1727
01:18:33.454 --> 01:18:35.854
- I'm here. - Who are you?

1728
01:18:36.255 --> 01:18:38.954
- I'm Si An. Si An. - Who? Come in.

1729
01:18:39.425 --> 01:18:42.255
I came to give you rice cakes.

1730
01:18:42.564 --> 01:18:45.095
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

1731
01:18:45.935 --> 01:18:47.194
Who is your dad?

1732
01:18:47.465 --> 01:18:49.435
Lee Dong Gook.

1733
01:18:49.505 --> 01:18:50.835
Are you Si An?

1734
01:18:51.005 --> 01:18:52.335
I'm Si An.

1735
01:18:52.904 --> 01:18:54.074
How old are you?

1736
01:18:54.805 --> 01:18:57.505
Four? You're the same as my granddaughter.

1737
01:18:57.774 --> 01:18:58.944
Thank you.

1738
01:18:59.274 --> 01:19:01.475
No problem. Salute.

1739
01:19:01.675 --> 01:19:02.744
Salute.

1740
01:19:04.185 --> 01:19:05.545
- Okay. - Bye.

1741
01:19:05.545 --> 01:19:07.055
- See you. - Okay.

1742
01:19:07.585 --> 01:19:11.255
- The dried pollack... - Do you untie it?

1743
01:19:11.454 --> 01:19:12.755
Wrap it like this?

1744
01:19:13.324 --> 01:19:15.555
- Tie it. - Yes, like this.

1745
01:19:16.694 --> 01:19:18.265
What do you do next?

1746
01:19:19.234 --> 01:19:21.435
- Okay, follow me. - Okay.

1747
01:19:22.364 --> 01:19:23.765
Are you really hanging it?

1748
01:19:23.765 --> 01:19:25.875
In the olden days...

1749
01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:27.604
- Are we hanging it? - Yes.

1750
01:19:30.644 --> 01:19:33.314
Okay, say hello to the pollack.

1751
01:19:33.314 --> 01:19:35.375
Hello, fish.

1752
01:19:35.614 --> 01:19:37.284
It's pollack.

1753
01:19:37.284 --> 01:19:39.454
Hello, pollack.

1754
01:19:39.484 --> 01:19:41.854
Wow, look at that!

1755
01:19:42.055 --> 01:19:44.354
Si An!

1756
01:19:44.854 --> 01:19:46.994
- I'm done. - Si An.

1757
01:19:47.024 --> 01:19:48.595
Soo A. Si An.

1758
01:19:48.925 --> 01:19:51.524
- Si An has a basket hat. - Guys, come here.

1759
01:19:51.725 --> 01:19:54.465
How was it, Si An? What did they say?

1760
01:19:54.465 --> 01:19:56.564
They thanked me.

1761
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.805
What a good boy. Good job.

1762
01:19:58.805 --> 01:20:01.335
- Come here. - I came like this.

1763
01:20:01.475 --> 01:20:03.305
- Like this. - Did you come like that?

1764
01:20:03.305 --> 01:20:04.975
- Yes. - Come here.

1765
01:20:05.345 --> 01:20:07.274
Good job.

1766
01:20:07.944 --> 01:20:09.215
Si An.

1767
01:20:11.385 --> 01:20:14.755
(What is William doing?)

1768
01:20:15.854 --> 01:20:19.125
(The television sound woke him up.)

1769
01:20:19.524 --> 01:20:23.125
(He's getting down from the bed alone.)

1770
01:20:25.765 --> 01:20:27.935
(Toddling)

1771
01:20:28.894 --> 01:20:31.064
(The door is blocking me.)

1772
01:20:32.165 --> 01:20:34.534
(Sam is busy watching television.)

1773
01:20:36.444 --> 01:20:38.774
(He's putting in his hand first.)

1774
01:20:38.774 --> 01:20:42.144
(I'll escape through the gap.)

1775
01:20:43.144 --> 01:20:46.515
(He's pushing with his whole body.)

1776
01:20:47.015 --> 01:20:48.484
Good morning.

1777
01:20:50.225 --> 01:20:51.255
William.

1778
01:20:53.225 --> 01:20:54.255
William.

1779
01:20:54.255 --> 01:20:55.755
(Did you call me?)

1780
01:20:56.364 --> 01:20:58.694
(Happy)

1781
01:20:59.564 --> 01:21:03.805
(He has a million-dollar smile.)

1782
01:21:06.975 --> 01:21:09.345
(Hugging)

1783
01:21:10.175 --> 01:21:11.345
Cuddle.

1784
01:21:11.345 --> 01:21:14.574
(I live because of you.)

1785
01:21:15.415 --> 01:21:19.015
What should we do now that you're up?

1786
01:21:19.885 --> 01:21:23.385
(What do we do in the morning?)

1787
01:21:24.154 --> 01:21:28.295
(Brush, brush)

1788
01:21:29.494 --> 01:21:32.225
(He's imitating brushing his teeth.)

1789
01:21:32.324 --> 01:21:34.265
That's right. Let's brush our teeth.

1790
01:21:36.064 --> 01:21:37.704
Let's brush it together.

1791
01:21:38.505 --> 01:21:40.875
(Let's go to the washroom.)

1792
01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:42.944
Mom. Mom.

1793
01:21:43.505 --> 01:21:44.644
I'm probably Dad.

1794
01:21:45.944 --> 01:21:48.444
(He has William on his legs.)

1795
01:21:48.444 --> 01:21:51.314
(It's a magic spell for brushing teeth.)

1796
01:21:51.314 --> 01:21:54.015
(He's getting all the corners.)

1797
01:21:54.854 --> 01:21:57.654
(He's under a teeth-brushing spell.)

1798
01:21:58.154 --> 01:22:02.255
(Korean Dental Association likes this video.)

1799
01:22:03.564 --> 01:22:05.465
We just did it. Let's wash your face.

1800
01:22:05.465 --> 01:22:07.034
(He's getting his face washed.)

1801
01:22:08.135 --> 01:22:10.805
(That feels good.)

1802
01:22:10.805 --> 01:22:13.635
(He's making manly sounds.)

1803
01:22:14.274 --> 01:22:15.975
(He wants to go outside.)

1804
01:22:15.975 --> 01:22:17.475
Okay. Here.

1805
01:22:17.904 --> 01:22:19.215
Go.

1806
01:22:19.215 --> 01:22:21.015
(Yes, let's go play!)

1807
01:22:22.215 --> 01:22:23.415
William.

1808
01:22:23.845 --> 01:22:24.915
Look.

1809
01:22:24.915 --> 01:22:26.385
(Where are they?)

1810
01:22:26.385 --> 01:22:27.685
There's so much water.

1811
01:22:29.585 --> 01:22:32.425
The view is wonderful at Han River.

1812
01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:33.595
Hey.

1813
01:22:33.954 --> 01:22:36.994
- Hey. - Hello.

1814
01:22:37.925 --> 01:22:40.064
(Everyone is here.)

1815
01:22:40.064 --> 01:22:42.564
(The foreign dads are saying hello.)

1816
01:22:42.564 --> 01:22:43.765
Hello.

1817
01:22:43.765 --> 01:22:46.005
Hey, guys.

1818
01:22:46.435 --> 01:22:47.475
Hello.

1819
01:22:47.475 --> 01:22:48.635
(Nice to see you!)

1820
01:22:48.635 --> 01:22:49.904
You're good.

1821
01:22:50.505 --> 01:22:52.274
Keep your head up.

1822
01:22:53.644 --> 01:22:57.415
I have some friends I made in Korea.

1823
01:22:57.415 --> 01:22:59.255
I told them I'm expecting our second child,

1824
01:22:59.255 --> 01:23:02.784
so they came to see me and congratulate me.

1825
01:23:02.784 --> 01:23:05.425
They're in the same situation as I am.

1826
01:23:05.425 --> 01:23:08.854
They all have two kids.

1827
01:23:10.324 --> 01:23:12.694
I have a friend that's in fitness consulting.

1828
01:23:15.095 --> 01:23:18.305
He hosts an English radio show.

1829
01:23:20.074 --> 01:23:22.034
He's teaching English.

1830
01:23:24.204 --> 01:23:25.375
Hello.

1831
01:23:25.604 --> 01:23:27.675
Do you want to say hi as well?

1832
01:23:28.345 --> 01:23:31.385
- Hi. - There is a big...

1833
01:23:32.185 --> 01:23:34.415
She's so big now.

1834
01:23:35.255 --> 01:23:37.055
- Hi. - Hello.

1835
01:23:37.385 --> 01:23:39.194
- She's so big. - William is big.

1836
01:23:39.194 --> 01:23:40.595
William is so big now.

1837
01:23:41.125 --> 01:23:43.795
She eats more than her older brother.

1838
01:23:43.795 --> 01:23:46.335
- Three months. - Three months?

1839
01:23:46.335 --> 01:23:47.665
- What about Estella? - Two.

1840
01:23:47.935 --> 01:23:49.034
Two.

1841
01:23:49.204 --> 01:23:51.505
(They're going off in different directions.)

1842
01:23:51.505 --> 01:23:53.104
She's so big for her age.

1843
01:23:53.104 --> 01:23:55.305
Come back, baby. Come back, come on.

1844
01:23:55.305 --> 01:23:56.805
No, no, no.

1845
01:23:57.505 --> 01:23:59.975
- Come back. - Let's go.

1846
01:24:00.144 --> 01:24:01.375
William, let's go.

1847
01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:03.085
Let's go with your friends.

1848
01:24:04.444 --> 01:24:07.585
Us moms go to kids' cafes too.

1849
01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:09.725
I guess foreign dads do the same.

1850
01:24:09.725 --> 01:24:11.685
This place is huge.

1851
01:24:13.095 --> 01:24:15.055
William, let's ride this.

1852
01:24:15.225 --> 01:24:16.925
You love watermelons.

1853
01:24:16.925 --> 01:24:18.425
(It's a watermelon tube.)

1854
01:24:20.064 --> 01:24:21.665
(Excited)

1855
01:24:24.064 --> 01:24:26.404
- Dad! - What is it?

1856
01:24:26.704 --> 01:24:27.835
William.

1857
01:24:28.305 --> 01:24:31.274
(He's heading for William.)

1858
01:24:35.114 --> 01:24:36.185
William.

1859
01:24:36.845 --> 01:24:38.984
(It's a super dive.)

1860
01:24:40.954 --> 01:24:42.255
(There is a wave of balls.)

1861
01:24:42.255 --> 01:24:43.625
I'm sinking.

1862
01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:47.095
(William is buried.)

1863
01:24:47.994 --> 01:24:50.694
(What is this?)

1864
01:24:51.994 --> 01:24:54.394
Hello. It's okay.

1865
01:24:56.064 --> 01:24:57.435
He's saying what's going on.

1866
01:24:57.435 --> 01:24:58.805
(It's not okay.)

1867
01:24:59.835 --> 01:25:01.234
Let it go.

1868
01:25:01.234 --> 01:25:02.675
(Screaming)

1869
01:25:03.074 --> 01:25:05.404
(William is struggling.)

1870
01:25:06.244 --> 01:25:07.975
(Screaming)

1871
01:25:09.114 --> 01:25:10.314
Once you say stop...

1872
01:25:11.345 --> 01:25:15.314
- Come here. - Let it go.

1873
01:25:16.954 --> 01:25:17.984
Leila!

1874
01:25:17.984 --> 01:25:18.984
(Let's play.)

1875
01:25:19.795 --> 01:25:22.225
We're tanning. We're catching some tans.

1876
01:25:22.925 --> 01:25:26.494
(It's a dad joke.)

1877
01:25:28.564 --> 01:25:30.805
He has the two teeth thing happening.

1878
01:25:33.034 --> 01:25:34.435
You're so cute.

1879
01:25:34.774 --> 01:25:35.904
You're cute.

1880
01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:37.444
William, you're cute.

1881
01:25:37.444 --> 01:25:38.444
(Then...)

1882
01:25:39.215 --> 01:25:40.574
(Diving)

1883
01:25:40.944 --> 01:25:42.074
William!

1884
01:25:44.385 --> 01:25:45.984
Sam is in an emergency.

1885
01:25:45.984 --> 01:25:47.854
How will William react?

1886
01:25:48.614 --> 01:25:50.685
Help me!

1887
01:25:51.425 --> 01:25:53.354
William! Help me!

1888
01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:55.755
Help me!

1889
01:25:55.755 --> 01:25:58.095
(I think he's joking.)

1890
01:25:58.095 --> 01:25:59.435
(Ignoring)

1891
01:25:59.994 --> 01:26:02.704
(He's not falling for it?)

1892
01:26:04.904 --> 01:26:07.904
- William! William! - He's gone!

1893
01:26:08.234 --> 01:26:10.644
- William! William! - He's gone!

1894
01:26:10.644 --> 01:26:12.915
(What? Is this real?)

1895
01:26:12.915 --> 01:26:14.215
Help me!

1896
01:26:14.215 --> 01:26:16.614
(William is starting to get worried.)

1897
01:26:16.614 --> 01:26:18.085
Help me.

1898
01:26:18.484 --> 01:26:20.484
William, help me!

1899
01:26:21.984 --> 01:26:24.824
(William is swimming through the pool.)

1900
01:26:24.824 --> 01:26:25.994
Dad!

1901
01:26:27.595 --> 01:26:30.994
(He's working hard to move the balls.)

1902
01:26:32.965 --> 01:26:35.465
(Sam's head is finally showing.)

1903
01:26:37.935 --> 01:26:38.965
Dad!

1904
01:26:39.404 --> 01:26:41.274
(He's so excited that he's waving.)

1905
01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:45.444
Dad.

1906
01:26:45.675 --> 01:26:48.475
(Ta-da!)

1907
01:26:49.545 --> 01:26:51.585
(It's dad.)

1908
01:26:52.444 --> 01:26:56.125
(He successfully saved his dad.)

1909
01:26:56.824 --> 01:26:58.185
Where's your dad?

1910
01:26:59.454 --> 01:27:00.555
Kiss.

1911
01:27:01.555 --> 01:27:02.665
Kiss.

1912
01:27:02.665 --> 01:27:05.225
(Even the pool can't come between us.)

1913
01:27:05.225 --> 01:27:06.265
(Kissing)

1914
01:27:06.265 --> 01:27:08.965
(Sam and William love each other.)

1915
01:27:08.965 --> 01:27:11.104
Clap. Clap.

1916
01:27:13.774 --> 01:27:15.635
Let's drink something. I'm hot.

1917
01:27:16.144 --> 01:27:18.404
With daddy. Come.

1918
01:27:18.404 --> 01:27:19.915
(It's break time.)

1919
01:27:22.175 --> 01:27:24.784
Did you all go to a maternity ward...

1920
01:27:24.784 --> 01:27:25.854
after giving birth?

1921
01:27:25.854 --> 01:27:27.614
- No, we didn't. - No.

1922
01:27:27.614 --> 01:27:29.255
- We went straight home. - Really?

1923
01:27:29.255 --> 01:27:31.685
But then my wife went to her grandma's.

1924
01:27:31.685 --> 01:27:33.494
She stayed there.

1925
01:27:33.494 --> 01:27:34.795
- Really? - Yes.

1926
01:27:35.024 --> 01:27:38.694
We met 20 years ago.

1927
01:27:39.394 --> 01:27:43.335
We've been married for 3, almost 4 years now.

1928
01:27:45.104 --> 01:27:48.534
She was sitting at a table next to me and asked me...

1929
01:27:48.534 --> 01:27:49.774
where I'm from in English.

1930
01:27:50.604 --> 01:27:52.614
I told her to guess.

1931
01:27:53.274 --> 01:27:55.375
She asked me if I'm from England.

1932
01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:57.715
(My fate came to me like a coincidence.)

1933
01:27:58.045 --> 01:28:00.085
I met my wife...

1934
01:28:00.614 --> 01:28:03.625
in Itaewon in a club.

1935
01:28:04.255 --> 01:28:06.354
In a club in Itaewon?

1936
01:28:08.154 --> 01:28:10.165
(The dads are busy chatting.)

1937
01:28:10.925 --> 01:28:12.064
(Food?)

1938
01:28:12.064 --> 01:28:13.465
(Is he hungry?)

1939
01:28:14.635 --> 01:28:16.635
(William's stomach is calling for food.)

1940
01:28:16.635 --> 01:28:17.665
Food.

1941
01:28:17.935 --> 01:28:19.505
William, are you hungry?

1942
01:28:19.805 --> 01:28:21.574
Are you hungry? Let's eat.

1943
01:28:21.574 --> 01:28:24.204
- It's time for dinner. - Let's go.

1944
01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:26.875
Hey, now we're talking.

1945
01:28:29.585 --> 01:28:30.685
So...

1946
01:28:30.814 --> 01:28:32.114
(Yes, rice balls!)

1947
01:28:32.114 --> 01:28:34.484
Yes? Now?

1948
01:28:34.484 --> 01:28:35.614
You like it?

1949
01:28:36.024 --> 01:28:37.784
William, is it good?

1950
01:28:37.925 --> 01:28:39.295
Kids should eat,

1951
01:28:39.295 --> 01:28:41.024
- but we should eat too. - Hey.

1952
01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:44.165
Over back there is a convenience store.

1953
01:28:44.165 --> 01:28:46.894
When I come to Han River, it's for ramyeon.

1954
01:28:47.765 --> 01:28:49.635
Ramyeon.

1955
01:28:49.805 --> 01:28:52.005
- Who's going to... - Rock...

1956
01:28:52.005 --> 01:28:54.604
- Rock-paper-scissors? - For the convenience?

1957
01:28:54.604 --> 01:28:55.845
- Rock-paper-scissors? - Okay.

1958
01:28:56.104 --> 01:28:58.505
Winners will go buy, and losers will stay.

1959
01:28:58.505 --> 01:29:00.045
- Okay. - That's a good one.

1960
01:29:00.045 --> 01:29:01.845
That's a great deal.

1961
01:29:02.274 --> 01:29:04.015
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1962
01:29:04.015 --> 01:29:07.015
(Paper, scissors, scissors, paper)

1963
01:29:07.984 --> 01:29:10.024
(Yes, we're going to the store!)

1964
01:29:10.024 --> 01:29:11.385
- We're the winners. - Losers.

1965
01:29:11.755 --> 01:29:15.425
(Oh my goodness!)

1966
01:29:15.725 --> 01:29:18.295
- Stay here. - Sit down.

1967
01:29:18.994 --> 01:29:22.165
(Why am I getting teary?)

1968
01:29:23.005 --> 01:29:24.135
Good luck.

1969
01:29:24.534 --> 01:29:26.904
- William. - Sam.

1970
01:29:27.704 --> 01:29:29.135
Sam. William.

1971
01:29:29.345 --> 01:29:31.175
(Did you call me Sam?)

1972
01:29:32.244 --> 01:29:33.845
(Laughing)

1973
01:29:33.845 --> 01:29:35.244
You were calling him Sam.

1974
01:29:35.244 --> 01:29:37.515
Big Sam and small Sam.

1975
01:29:37.515 --> 01:29:39.385
William is a small Sam.

1976
01:29:39.915 --> 01:29:41.055
Small Sam.

1977
01:29:43.784 --> 01:29:46.295
- Dad. Dad. - Dad? Dad?

1978
01:29:46.694 --> 01:29:48.755
He's going to go get food.

1979
01:29:50.364 --> 01:29:52.095
This store is pretty good.

1980
01:29:52.835 --> 01:29:55.795
It's really good. Great selection.

1981
01:29:56.305 --> 01:29:58.165
Do you want tteokbokki?

1982
01:29:58.805 --> 01:30:01.835
These two taste good together.

1983
01:30:02.475 --> 01:30:03.644
Deals.

1984
01:30:04.305 --> 01:30:05.805
(Sam is surprised.)

1985
01:30:05.805 --> 01:30:07.015
Deals.

1986
01:30:07.744 --> 01:30:09.215
They don't have stir-fried kimchi.

1987
01:30:09.944 --> 01:30:11.284
(He's practically Korean.)

1988
01:30:11.284 --> 01:30:12.614
All right.

1989
01:30:12.614 --> 01:30:14.515
Look at these things.

1990
01:30:14.515 --> 01:30:16.824
The cooker is over here. They're special cookers.

1991
01:30:16.824 --> 01:30:19.154
It's my first time eating ramyeon in my whole life.

1992
01:30:20.524 --> 01:30:23.064
- It's your first time? - It's my first time.

1993
01:30:24.795 --> 01:30:27.095
- What did you push? - The one on the far left.

1994
01:30:30.064 --> 01:30:31.305
(One button will give them water.)

1995
01:30:31.305 --> 01:30:32.435
Done.

1996
01:30:32.435 --> 01:30:35.404
Ramyeon cookers only exist in Korea.

1997
01:30:35.635 --> 01:30:39.215
Instant ramyeon at Han River is tasty.

1998
01:30:39.545 --> 01:30:42.274
(The ramyeon is boiling.)

1999
01:30:43.185 --> 01:30:44.345
Sam!

2000
01:30:44.345 --> 01:30:46.885
(It's chaotic here.)

2001
01:30:48.314 --> 01:30:49.925
I wasn't trained for this.

2002
01:30:49.925 --> 01:30:51.885
- Me neither. - I wasn't trained.

2003
01:30:52.324 --> 01:30:54.954
Sam! What's taking you so long?

2004
01:30:55.225 --> 01:30:56.665
Cody, hurry up.

2005
01:30:56.864 --> 01:30:59.465
- Cody, please hurry up! - Ladies and gentlemen,

2006
01:31:00.765 --> 01:31:02.704
food has arrived.

2007
01:31:03.505 --> 01:31:06.704
It's super hot, kids. Step back.

2008
01:31:06.704 --> 01:31:09.244
These have cheese in them.

2009
01:31:09.244 --> 01:31:10.274
I love it.

2010
01:31:10.274 --> 01:31:12.545
Yes, it's a good idea. I think it'll be...

2011
01:31:12.545 --> 01:31:14.215
- great. - It could be disaster.

2012
01:31:14.215 --> 01:31:16.484
(Slurping)

2013
01:31:18.314 --> 01:31:20.215
I'll have a little.

2014
01:31:22.215 --> 01:31:23.585
Good choice.

2015
01:31:24.784 --> 01:31:27.595
It's so delicious. It's so good.

2016
01:31:28.055 --> 01:31:29.824
I'm actually a big fan of chicken and beer.

2017
01:31:30.524 --> 01:31:33.064
Fried chicken. It's the good stuff.

2018
01:31:33.064 --> 01:31:34.265
Lunch.

2019
01:31:34.265 --> 01:31:36.305
Next time, let's get bossam and soju.

2020
01:31:36.305 --> 01:31:38.465
(I want to try bossam and soju.)

2021
01:31:38.665 --> 01:31:41.435
Lunch, maybe. My wife cooks dinner.

2022
01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:44.574
Bossam, pork bone soup, braised spicy chicken...

2023
01:31:44.574 --> 01:31:46.114
- Really? - At home?

2024
01:31:46.114 --> 01:31:47.545
Always at home. Yes.

2025
01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:50.314
I've never seen anyone make pork bone soup.

2026
01:31:51.114 --> 01:31:52.515
- Bossam. - Tteokbokki.

2027
01:31:53.055 --> 01:31:54.614
Yes, I've never seen it.

2028
01:31:54.784 --> 01:31:56.654
- One more time. - One more time?

2029
01:31:56.654 --> 01:31:59.595
Can I have a bite of food and then give you more?

2030
01:32:01.024 --> 01:32:04.925
One more time! One more time!

2031
01:32:06.064 --> 01:32:08.564
(Give me more water.)

2032
01:32:09.305 --> 01:32:11.305
It's so hard to eat with babies.

2033
01:32:12.165 --> 01:32:14.675
It's tough to do this with kids.

2034
01:32:14.675 --> 01:32:15.845
Yes.

2035
01:32:15.845 --> 01:32:18.545
Mommy! Mommy!

2036
01:32:19.774 --> 01:32:22.114
(He's covering his ears.)

2037
01:32:23.385 --> 01:32:25.545
William. What's wrong?

2038
01:32:26.284 --> 01:32:27.385
Is she too loud?

2039
01:32:27.385 --> 01:32:29.854
Estella, don't say anything.

2040
01:32:29.854 --> 01:32:31.354
Mommy!

2041
01:32:33.425 --> 01:32:35.625
(Leila is calming down William.)

2042
01:32:35.625 --> 01:32:36.725
William.

2043
01:32:37.564 --> 01:32:39.265
(Thank you, Leila.)

2044
01:32:39.265 --> 01:32:42.034
It's time. It's time for them to go to bed.

2045
01:32:42.034 --> 01:32:44.204
Thanks, guys. Thanks for coming out.

2046
01:32:44.204 --> 01:32:45.835
When number two comes out?

2047
01:32:46.204 --> 01:32:48.074
- That sounds good. - Good luck, buddy.

2048
01:32:48.074 --> 01:32:50.104
- We'll talk to you. - Good luck.

2049
01:32:50.244 --> 01:32:51.944
All right, all right.

2050
01:32:51.944 --> 01:32:53.890
(Good luck Sam! Let's gather soon!)
