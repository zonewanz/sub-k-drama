1
00:00:06.034 --> 00:00:09.503
In a moment, Byung Man's Tribe
survives in two groups with...

2
00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:12.514
one group by the Navua River and
the other by the Yasawa Islands.

3
00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:16.383
They both get fire and a shelter ready...

4
00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:18.244
and they adjust to the jungle life.

5
00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:19.383
(They experience up and
downs in the jungle.)

6
00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:21.985
They keep up the momentum
and go for night hunting.

7
00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:25.253
Sung Hoon's team goes out
to hunt anaconda eels.

8
00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:26.293
(Team Sung Hoon versus anaconda eels)

9
00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:29.224
Gold medalist swimmer Da
Rae of Team Dindin...

10
00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.525
goes out for night hunting by herself.

11
00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:33.534
(Welcome to the jungle survival.)

12
00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:36.564
The last part of their exciting survival...

13
00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:38.334
starts now.

14
00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:44.245
Let's build a shelter.

15
00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:46.944
Our plan is to make four pillars...

16
00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:50.444
and make a square out of bamboo sticks.

17
00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.455
Then we'll put banana leaves on top.

18
00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.885
We can do it.

19
00:00:57.484 --> 00:00:59.654
(Woo Jin cuts bamboo he's
going to use as pillars.)

20
00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:02.193
(Chae Kyung is his assistant.)

21
00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.195
Hold on.

22
00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:04.264
You tie this.

23
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.164
(Step 1 is to build the framework.)

24
00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.034
- Isn't this coming together?
- I think so.

25
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.763
(What's this?)

26
00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:13.975
Where did you get the tape?

27
00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:15.374
I brought it.

28
00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:18.704
We couldn't use any tools at the sea.

29
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.673
I hope you don't say anything about this.

30
00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:21.813
(You are supposed to
find tools from nature.)

31
00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.745
- We are all the way here.
- Right.

32
00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.615
We don't have enough people.

33
00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:29.755
Three is a bit tough.

34
00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:32.325
Can somebody hold this for a second?

35
00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:33.995
(Please help us.)

36
00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:36.564
You have to form a cross.

37
00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.564
(They speed up the process.)

38
00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:43.105
Okay.

39
00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:46.904
It's looking for like a house now.

40
00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:51.305
(They're a bit less organized
without Chief Byung Man, )

41
00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:54.314
(but they work pretty well together.)

42
00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:57.483
(They try to finish before sunset.)

43
00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.715
It's a house.

44
00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:00.915
(The framework is complete.)

45
00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:03.824
Should we put the leaves on top?

46
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.424
(Step 2 is to build the
roof with banana leaves.)

47
00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.564
(They lay big leaves on top.)

48
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:10.565
It's so long.

49
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.293
(The roof will block
rain from dripping in.)

50
00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:14.565
Doesn't it look like a house now?

51
00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:16.834
Isn't it cozy?

52
00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:18.463
(Let me see.)

53
00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:19.935
If it rains, we're in trouble.

54
00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:23.043
If it doesn't rain, we'll be okay.

55
00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:24.944
If it rains, we have to move.

56
00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.613
Look here.

57
00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:29.314
The river is right next to us.

58
00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.884
If it rains, we have to get out.

59
00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:34.284
The water will fill up...

60
00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:37.125
all the way here. This won't work.

61
00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.994
If it doesn't rain,

62
00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:42.094
the scariest part is the wind.

63
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.325
- Yes, right.
- We need to build the wall then.

64
00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:47.564
(It's windy.)

65
00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:48.565
What should we do?

66
00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:51.404
Now that I think of it,

67
00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.005
the water will overflow if it rains.

68
00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.404
- We have to run away first.
- Of course.

69
00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.944
- We won't be happy.
- We won't be relieved...

70
00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:00.013
just because we are sheltered.
We have to run away.

71
00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.075
- Then...
- Then we have to block the sides.

72
00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:06.214
I'm going to unpack my bag.

73
00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:08.554
I worked hard, so I'll get some sleep.

74
00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:14.125
I wonder if they built a house.

75
00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:15.695
I don't know either.

76
00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:17.793
(It's 7pm right now.)

77
00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:18.824
Sung Hoon.

78
00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:20.094
You are back.

79
00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:21.793
Hello.

80
00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:23.505
- You are back.
- Hello.

81
00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:26.575
- Oh, dear.
- Welcome.

82
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.535
You are back.

83
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:30.474
Did you see sharks?

84
00:03:30.475 --> 00:03:32.514
Help us right away.

85
00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:34.673
It's okay.

86
00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:35.945
We'll talk later.

87
00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:41.104
(He looks at the construction
as soon as he arrives.)

88
00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.975
- You just need to block the wind.
- Right?

89
00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:45.255
This is great.

90
00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:47.825
Oh, dear.

91
00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:49.294
(Jong Hyuk works hard.)

92
00:03:51.394 --> 00:03:53.165
- It's better with you here.
- What?

93
00:03:53.695 --> 00:03:55.364
Jae Hyun left,

94
00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:57.764
so we didn't have enough people.

95
00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:01.905
(He's reliable.)

96
00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:07.414
(With Jong Hyuk there,
they speed up even more.)

97
00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:08.415
All right.

98
00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.554
(The floor is laid down at the end.)

99
00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:15.284
Our shelter is nice.

100
00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:16.485
This is great.

101
00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:21.524
The four of them work together
and build a cozy shelter.

102
00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.195
This is awesome.

103
00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:26.394
They follow up by building a fire.

104
00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:28.294
(They build a fire in no time.)

105
00:04:28.295 --> 00:04:30.033
- This is nice.
- It's cozy with the fire.

106
00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:33.704
It'll be a perfect day if they get to eat.

107
00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.045
I always get hungry.

108
00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:41.513
Meanwhile, Dindin and Da Rae
are busy looking for food.

109
00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:42.514
This is the real jungle.

110
00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.985
- Do you trust me?
- Of course.

111
00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:46.354
You just gained my trust.

112
00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:47.713
When I saw you throwing the rope.

113
00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:49.754
- I was shocked too.
- That was instantaneous.

114
00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.354
Are there no plants on the ground?

115
00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:54.354
There must be something we can dig up.

116
00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:57.694
- What is it?
- What's this?

117
00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:59.393
(Da Rae cries out.)

118
00:04:59.394 --> 00:05:00.594
What is it?

119
00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:03.903
It's scary.

120
00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:05.034
(Staff follows them.)

121
00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:09.274
- Da Rae.
- Chief.

122
00:05:09.404 --> 00:05:10.545
What do we do?

123
00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:12.004
It's alive.

124
00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:13.774
(Is it a toad?)

125
00:05:13.945 --> 00:05:14.945
My gosh.

126
00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:16.344
(Cane toad)

127
00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:18.414
They destroy the ecosystem.

128
00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:20.384
(That's a bullfrog.)

129
00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:21.484
It moved.

130
00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:23.354
It's sleeping...

131
00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:25.593
so don't try to get on its nerves.
We have to be quiet.

132
00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:26.624
That's true.

133
00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:27.695
(They're nervous.)

134
00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.795
Hey. It opened its eyes.

135
00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:34.393
You can't get him in a bad mood.

136
00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:38.004
You have to let it sleep.

137
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:39.034
(Hopping)

138
00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:41.734
Hey, be careful. Let's move quietly.

139
00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:43.744
(They move quietly.)

140
00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:46.114
Hurry up.

141
00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:47.815
- Hurry.
- It's sleeping.

142
00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:50.545
We are in a hurry.

143
00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:52.143
It's scary to look at so don't look at it.

144
00:05:52.144 --> 00:05:53.704
- Don't look?
- Dont' look at anything.

145
00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:56.184
I feel like we might see snakes too.

146
00:05:56.185 --> 00:05:57.665
(Dindin is not so confident anymore.)

147
00:05:58.584 --> 00:06:00.495
We need to eat some fish.

148
00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:01.625
What's this?

149
00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:04.495
- What?
- Shine the light here, Da Rae.

150
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.135
- What is it?
- Is it a hermit crab?

151
00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:08.795
Can we eat it?

152
00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:12.004
- Hey, Da Rae.
- It looks awesome.

153
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:13.675
- What?
- Shine the light.

154
00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:15.204
Can it cut your finger?

155
00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:17.604
- Is it dangerous?
- Is it a baby?

156
00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:20.644
I'm curious. Chief, catch it for me.

157
00:06:21.175 --> 00:06:22.685
(It'll hurt if it grabs me.)

158
00:06:23.914 --> 00:06:26.654
(Dindin grabs the hermit crab carefully.)

159
00:06:28.185 --> 00:06:29.584
(Why is he being so brave?)

160
00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:31.255
It's cute. Let me see.

161
00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:34.594
It's about to come out.

162
00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:38.624
- Why are you coming out? No.
- It's weird.

163
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.695
(Why are you coming out?)

164
00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:43.033
(It escapes.)

165
00:06:43.034 --> 00:06:44.034
(Screaming)

166
00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.604
What is it?

167
00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:49.004
- Did it go out?
- It escaped from its shell.

168
00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:51.045
- Where is it?
- It's here.

169
00:06:51.774 --> 00:06:54.374
It looks like an alien.

170
00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:55.514
Should I let it go?

171
00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:57.184
- Let it go.
- Go.

172
00:06:57.185 --> 00:06:58.185
I'll let you go.

173
00:06:58.186 --> 00:06:59.684
(It's not because he's scared.
It's because it's a baby.)

174
00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.523
If you see a weird-looking
creature, tell me right away.

175
00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:05.593
- Okay.
- I know how cassavas look like.

176
00:07:05.594 --> 00:07:06.724
They are not here.

177
00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:08.795
How do they look?

178
00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:10.495
Are those cassavas?

179
00:07:10.524 --> 00:07:11.794
- I found it.
- Okay.

180
00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:13.195
- Which ones?
- These are cassavas.

181
00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:15.135
- Cassavas?
- Cassavas.

182
00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:19.103
- Cassavas?
- Cassava trees look like this.

183
00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:21.075
You have to take the roots out.

184
00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:23.574
- The roots?
- This one looks huge.

185
00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:25.744
- Can you pull it out?
- Yes, you have to shake it.

186
00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:26.774
(She's doubtful.)

187
00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:28.984
You have to turn it.

188
00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:30.283
(He makes a circle.)

189
00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.784
(Cracking)

190
00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:34.153
What is it? Is it there?

191
00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:35.685
I pulled it out.

192
00:07:36.354 --> 00:07:38.284
(They're so happy to see it.)

193
00:07:38.654 --> 00:07:40.995
- It's a cassava.
- This is a cassava.

194
00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:43.663
Let's take some back. We
can eat it for breakfast.

195
00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:44.695
This is good.

196
00:07:46.094 --> 00:07:47.663
- Let's take another one...
- I've never seen this before.

197
00:07:47.664 --> 00:07:48.764
For breakfast.

198
00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:51.565
Chief.

199
00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:55.805
I'm Chief Dindin. Okay.

200
00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:57.445
This one is huge.

201
00:07:58.914 --> 00:08:00.674
- That one's unbeatable.
- Da Rae.

202
00:08:00.675 --> 00:08:03.184
- It's insane.
- I'm the Chief.

203
00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:05.044
I'm the Chief.

204
00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:06.814
You're so good at this.

205
00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:07.913
My gosh.

206
00:08:07.914 --> 00:08:09.153
This is game over.

207
00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:10.384
(It's game over.)

208
00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:11.954
I didn't know I'm this good.

209
00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:14.154
We picked too many cassavas.

210
00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:16.723
I'm like a local here.

211
00:08:16.724 --> 00:08:17.893
Sure.

212
00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:18.935
(He bluffs a lot.)

213
00:08:19.034 --> 00:08:20.365
Good.

214
00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:22.903
There's more.

215
00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:24.004
(They find more shortly after.)

216
00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:27.033
We can't climb. We can't reach.

217
00:08:27.034 --> 00:08:29.544
I want to get some for Roy.
He said he loves mangoes.

218
00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:30.705
Are there some on the ground?

219
00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:31.945
Should we go in some more?

220
00:08:33.015 --> 00:08:34.815
(They look for some on the ground instead.)

221
00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:37.244
- What is it?
- This looks...

222
00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:38.785
totally ripe.

223
00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:41.884
Right? Here.

224
00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:43.983
Should we cut it?

225
00:08:43.984 --> 00:08:45.753
(The knife slides in smoothly.)

226
00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:48.094
- I think it's ripe. Oh, dear.
- It must be.

227
00:08:48.925 --> 00:08:50.593
- Oh, dear.
- It looks great.

228
00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:51.723
This is great.

229
00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:53.034
(It has a nice color, )

230
00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:54.035
(and it smells great too.)

231
00:08:54.036 --> 00:08:56.665
I've never smelled something
like this in the jungle.

232
00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:58.404
- Isn't it awesome?
- It's so nice.

233
00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:00.604
- This looks like that.
- It's a real mango.

234
00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:01.675
(Her mouth gets watery.)

235
00:09:02.645 --> 00:09:06.015
(Would it taste sweet?)

236
00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:08.544
(His eyes turn soft.)

237
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:09.584
Try it.

238
00:09:10.714 --> 00:09:12.983
(She has high expectations.)

239
00:09:12.984 --> 00:09:14.754
It's sweet. It's super sweet.

240
00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:16.284
I've never tried anything like this here.

241
00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:18.055
I've never had anything like this here.

242
00:09:18.655 --> 00:09:20.655
It's a mango but it's really sweet.

243
00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.894
- This's a luxury for my taste buds.
- This's a whole different level.

244
00:09:23.925 --> 00:09:25.964
The sweetness is on a different level.

245
00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:29.104
This is different from mangoes in Korea.

246
00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:31.565
- It's so good.
- Oh, dear.

247
00:09:31.964 --> 00:09:33.404
Let's get some for Roy.

248
00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:34.873
(Wait, Roy. Mangoes are coming for you.)

249
00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.004
There are so many.

250
00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.305
This is a paradise.

251
00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:41.844
- Look at this.
- You're the Chief indeed.

252
00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:43.244
What's this?

253
00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:44.984
Chief Dindin gathers momentum.

254
00:09:45.315 --> 00:09:48.083
He finds soursop, a fruit
that tastes like yogurt.

255
00:09:48.084 --> 00:09:49.223
- What's that?
- Hold it.

256
00:09:49.224 --> 00:09:50.654
He even finds cayenne peppers.

257
00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:52.753
They manage to find many types of food.

258
00:09:52.754 --> 00:09:54.654
It looks really good.

259
00:09:54.655 --> 00:09:57.264
This is who I am. Let's go.

260
00:09:57.265 --> 00:09:58.895
- Okay.
- Let's go.

261
00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:02.504
Do you think Roy built a house and a fire?

262
00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:04.204
I hope he did.

263
00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:06.874
Why is this not working?

264
00:10:07.075 --> 00:10:10.275
Roy is still struggling to
make a fire by himself.

265
00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:12.874
Gosh, my hands ache.

266
00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:15.175
(Sighing)

267
00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.814
(He's been in the same
position for 1 hour.)

268
00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:20.114
This should work by now.

269
00:10:22.954 --> 00:10:25.224
(The jungle is...)

270
00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:27.853
(He's depressed.)

271
00:10:27.854 --> 00:10:29.864
(He's mad.)

272
00:10:30.094 --> 00:10:32.535
I need to do this and build a house.

273
00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:36.535
(This place doesn't suit me.)

274
00:10:42.104 --> 00:10:45.044
(He's better than before.)

275
00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.874
It worked.

276
00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.084
It worked.

277
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.285
Hey, hey. I almost had it. Wait.

278
00:10:56.254 --> 00:10:58.954
(He tries to blow on the ember.)

279
00:11:00.224 --> 00:11:01.994
(This must be a dream.)

280
00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:03.194
I got it now though.

281
00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:04.195
(Does he get it after
some trial and error?)

282
00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.494
I got it. I can do it now.

283
00:11:06.494 --> 00:11:08.634
(He takes a deep breath.)

284
00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:09.964
I'll get it this time.

285
00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:12.603
I didn't have a strategy in the beginning,

286
00:11:12.604 --> 00:11:15.275
so I thought you just hit it...

287
00:11:15.645 --> 00:11:16.675
but you have to chop it.

288
00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:18.004
I'll get it this time.

289
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:24.343
(The ember comes alive.)

290
00:11:24.344 --> 00:11:25.344
(He's dazed.)

291
00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:30.154
(He was so anxious for this moment.)

292
00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:31.155
It's hot.

293
00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:34.324
(It's the same feeling when
humans first discovered fire.)

294
00:11:34.325 --> 00:11:35.325
Move.

295
00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:38.993
It worked. It worked.

296
00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:41.234
It worked. It did it.

297
00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:43.364
It worked.

298
00:11:43.665 --> 00:11:46.374
This is it.

299
00:11:46.734 --> 00:11:47.805
This is it, right?

300
00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:50.404
That's right. Good job, Sang Woo.

301
00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:53.544
(The dream in my heart)

302
00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:55.714
(The fire blazes up.)

303
00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:58.214
(He did it.)

304
00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:01.184
(He improved a lot.)

305
00:12:01.185 --> 00:12:02.254
This is it.

306
00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:04.185
I did it.

307
00:12:04.186 --> 00:12:07.824
(It's a dramatic victory like a musical.)

308
00:12:07.825 --> 00:12:08.895
I did it.

309
00:12:11.025 --> 00:12:12.093
I did it.

310
00:12:12.094 --> 00:12:14.333
(It's freedom beyond anything expected.)

311
00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:17.065
I was so worried we wouldn't
be able to roast anything.

312
00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:18.535
Mission complete.

313
00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:22.003
Let me build a shelter.

314
00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:23.603
(He sets off for his next mission.)

315
00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:25.515
I can do it. Let's go.

316
00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:27.415
I'll try. There are trees here.

317
00:12:28.344 --> 00:12:30.444
It's bamboo. All right.

318
00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:31.514
(He collects wood to use as pillars.)

319
00:12:31.515 --> 00:12:32.515
This is good.

320
00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:33.613
(He can do it by himself.)

321
00:12:33.614 --> 00:12:34.614
Let's go.

322
00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:36.285
Gosh.

323
00:12:36.286 --> 00:12:38.184
(He digs up the ground to put pillars in.)

324
00:12:38.185 --> 00:12:41.694
(He makes it deep.)

325
00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:43.424
(He connects the pillars
with a sturdy string.)

326
00:12:43.425 --> 00:12:44.994
I want to finish before they get back.

327
00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:48.194
It's difficult to build four pillars,

328
00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:50.364
so I'll make a triangle like a tent.

329
00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:53.334
Bugs don't matter.

330
00:12:54.405 --> 00:12:55.904
(He collects palm tree
leaves for the roof.)

331
00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:56.944
I'm so tired.

332
00:12:56.945 --> 00:12:58.074
(He collects palm tree
leaves for the roof.)

333
00:12:58.075 --> 00:12:59.814
I've never built a shelter before.

334
00:12:59.815 --> 00:13:01.874
I was going through trial and error...

335
00:13:02.984 --> 00:13:04.614
and tried my best.

336
00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:06.015
I'm so tired.

337
00:13:06.315 --> 00:13:09.354
Life is about patience and
satisfaction, Sang Woo.

338
00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:12.493
I have to lay these by the entrance.
It's like the honeymoon.

339
00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:13.494
(He's a romantic guy.)

340
00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:14.554
I think this is good.

341
00:13:14.555 --> 00:13:19.463
(He completes the shelter after
2 hours of building it.)

342
00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:22.334
I wanted our shelter to
look nice as in the movies,

343
00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:24.764
so I tried to make it pretty.

344
00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:27.334
I was so satisfied by it.

345
00:13:31.704 --> 00:13:34.074
(He adds the background music.)

346
00:13:34.075 --> 00:13:36.884
(He's self-sufficient in every aspect.)

347
00:13:38.214 --> 00:13:40.814
This is our shelter.

348
00:13:40.815 --> 00:13:42.555
(Welcome to Roy's house.)

349
00:13:43.124 --> 00:13:46.825
There's a nice bed that's cushioned.

350
00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:48.554
We need somewhere to put our heads down,

351
00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:51.224
so I put more cushioning on this side.

352
00:13:51.594 --> 00:13:53.863
For a sturdy house,

353
00:13:53.864 --> 00:13:55.394
I dug very deep.

354
00:13:55.395 --> 00:13:58.133
I used rocks and strings...

355
00:13:58.134 --> 00:13:59.734
to make the pillars even more strong.

356
00:14:00.134 --> 00:14:03.743
You might get cold at night.
If you can't sleep,

357
00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:06.675
then there's...

358
00:14:07.744 --> 00:14:10.145
a warm sauna right next to it.

359
00:14:10.244 --> 00:14:12.614
I'm hungry. If you're hungry...

360
00:14:12.884 --> 00:14:15.054
(He forgot about the kitchen.)

361
00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:19.454
(He hums and works on the kitchen.)

362
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:22.224
I got a cramp.

363
00:14:22.724 --> 00:14:24.194
(He was in too much hurry.)

364
00:14:24.195 --> 00:14:25.223
I got a cramp.

365
00:14:25.224 --> 00:14:26.934
(He was in too much hurry.)

366
00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:31.164
(He continues as if nothing happened.)

367
00:14:31.165 --> 00:14:33.474
There's a snug kitchen as well.

368
00:14:34.075 --> 00:14:36.144
This lamp will warm up your heart.

369
00:14:36.145 --> 00:14:37.674
(He keeps on improvising.)

370
00:14:37.675 --> 00:14:38.805
There's a pot as well.

371
00:14:39.744 --> 00:14:40.874
This love house...

372
00:14:41.775 --> 00:14:44.015
lacks only food.

373
00:14:44.744 --> 00:14:45.854
We just need food.

374
00:14:46.354 --> 00:14:49.655
Sincerity moves paradise. Good job, Roy.

375
00:14:51.655 --> 00:14:53.524
(The veteran team is preparing food.)

376
00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:54.554
(Roasted bananas are for snacks.)

377
00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:55.564
We're hungry.

378
00:14:55.565 --> 00:14:56.593
(Roasted bananas are for snacks.)

379
00:14:56.594 --> 00:14:58.394
- Let's have bananas.
- Should we roast them?

380
00:14:58.525 --> 00:15:01.463
- I'm curious.
- Pick the nice-looking ones.

381
00:15:01.464 --> 00:15:02.934
(She picks the solid ones.)

382
00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:05.603
- I'm hungry.
- I get hungry when we make fire.

383
00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.805
(They put it in the fire.)

384
00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:10.873
That's good.

385
00:15:10.874 --> 00:15:12.973
(I hope they're delicious.)

386
00:15:12.974 --> 00:15:14.473
- Let's fill ourselves up.
- Okay.

387
00:15:14.474 --> 00:15:17.284
There are eels here, so let's catch some.

388
00:15:17.285 --> 00:15:18.814
I hope they're here.

389
00:15:18.815 --> 00:15:21.753
- Are there shrimps here too?
- Shrimp? There's freshwater shrimp.

390
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:22.924
- Right?
- Yes.

391
00:15:22.925 --> 00:15:25.083
- I want broiled eels.
- Me too.

392
00:15:25.084 --> 00:15:27.024
You can dip it in the sauce.

393
00:15:27.025 --> 00:15:28.655
- I want some shrimps.
- Shrimps?

394
00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:33.295
- Are they burning?
- They need to burn a bit.

395
00:15:33.964 --> 00:15:34.964
I'm curious.

396
00:15:34.965 --> 00:15:37.165
(Chae Kyung is new, so she's
curious about everything.)

397
00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:38.503
(Woo Jin takes a banana out.)

398
00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:39.504
It's probably hot.

399
00:15:39.974 --> 00:15:41.704
It's hot.

400
00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:45.004
- I don't know.
- Really?

401
00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:48.175
You're a dad.

402
00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:51.145
(He checks the temperature with his mouth.)

403
00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:55.254
It's really hot. Are you okay?

404
00:15:56.484 --> 00:15:57.685
Look at the steam.

405
00:15:59.395 --> 00:16:01.525
(He tries the hot banana.)

406
00:16:02.124 --> 00:16:03.895
- I ate the peel too.
- You did.

407
00:16:04.665 --> 00:16:06.065
Don't do that.

408
00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:09.503
(This tastes like...)

409
00:16:09.504 --> 00:16:11.664
- It tastes like nothing.
- Really?

410
00:16:11.665 --> 00:16:14.134
It's neither good nor bad.
There's no taste.

411
00:16:15.004 --> 00:16:16.275
It's not uncooked.

412
00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:18.243
It's actually cooked.

413
00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:19.613
(She takes a bite.)

414
00:16:19.614 --> 00:16:22.344
It's good. It tastes like cassava.

415
00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:24.784
(Really?)

416
00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:25.814
What does it taste like?

417
00:16:25.815 --> 00:16:27.713
- Cassavas.
- Doesn't it smell like potatoes?

418
00:16:27.714 --> 00:16:29.753
It does. It tastes like potatoes too.

419
00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:31.584
Is your mouth weird too?

420
00:16:32.494 --> 00:16:33.555
(Is your mouth weird too?)

421
00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:37.123
- Who?
- Me. Is your mouth weird too?

422
00:16:37.124 --> 00:16:38.124
(You know how bananas taste like.)

423
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:39.133
My mouth too?

424
00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:40.194
(Chae Kyung said it's good.)

425
00:16:40.195 --> 00:16:43.233
I mean... You said it
didn't taste like anything.

426
00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:44.904
Hey, you...

427
00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:46.474
- Try it.
- You are weird.

428
00:16:47.334 --> 00:16:49.404
- It's good.
- It doesn't taste like anything.

429
00:16:49.405 --> 00:16:53.915
(Sung Hoon tries it to find out the truth.)

430
00:16:55.645 --> 00:16:58.214
- Isn't it good?
- It's good.

431
00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:01.185
(What? It's good?)

432
00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:04.024
- Be honest.
- It's good.

433
00:17:04.025 --> 00:17:05.853
- No, you think...
- It's so good.

434
00:17:05.854 --> 00:17:07.093
- I get what you mean.
- Doesn't it taste like cassava?

435
00:17:07.094 --> 00:17:09.724
You were going to say it's
good even before you ate it.

436
00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:10.795
You're right.

437
00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.834
(What does Sung Hoon think?)

438
00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:18.103
(Woo Jin pranked him during the day.)

439
00:17:18.104 --> 00:17:19.133
(Spitting)

440
00:17:19.134 --> 00:17:26.614
(He got tricked by the banana
and the chilli peppers.)

441
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.344
This is really good. What do you mean?

442
00:17:30.644 --> 00:17:32.784
Look at this guy. Try this.

443
00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:33.785
You try it.

444
00:17:34.255 --> 00:17:35.923
It doesn't taste like anything, right?

445
00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:38.994
(This tastes like...)

446
00:17:38.995 --> 00:17:40.825
- It's a potato.
- Right?

447
00:17:41.555 --> 00:17:43.394
It doesn't taste like anything.

448
00:17:43.694 --> 00:17:46.593
- Look at this guy.
- Be honest, Sung Hoon.

449
00:17:46.594 --> 00:17:47.633
- You have to be honest.
- My gosh.

450
00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:49.764
There are people who are
curious about the taste.

451
00:17:49.765 --> 00:17:51.004
Did you eat something else?

452
00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:53.633
- Did you not tell us?
- Do you have a bad nose?

453
00:17:53.634 --> 00:17:55.034
- No.
- Do you have a bad nose?

454
00:17:55.035 --> 00:17:56.443
- It's fine.
- You have a bad nose, right?

455
00:17:56.444 --> 00:17:58.604
I can taste everything.
That's how good I am.

456
00:17:59.374 --> 00:18:01.144
Your tongue is weird then.

457
00:18:01.844 --> 00:18:02.943
(He's dazed by Sung Hoon's argument.)

458
00:18:02.944 --> 00:18:05.714
You scared me. This is really good.

459
00:18:05.715 --> 00:18:08.014
- Try this.
- There are personal preferences.

460
00:18:08.015 --> 00:18:10.525
- What?
- I don't think this is good.

461
00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:12.495
You must think this is good.

462
00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.353
- I think it's good.
- No, no.

463
00:18:14.354 --> 00:18:15.794
- I think this is good too.
- It doesn't taste like nothing.

464
00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:17.893
- It tastes like potatoes...
- Exactly.

465
00:18:17.894 --> 00:18:19.664
Or cassavas.

466
00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:26.275
- Come here. Come here, Chae Kyung.
- There's too much smoke.

467
00:18:26.604 --> 00:18:29.075
There's no smoke. It's okay. Come.

468
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.021
(The banana battle ends
with Sung Hoon's victory.)

469
00:18:31.045 --> 00:18:32.075
Let's go and catch eels.

470
00:18:33.075 --> 00:18:34.673
- You go.
- Where?

471
00:18:34.674 --> 00:18:35.684
Go catch eels.

472
00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:38.314
- You're on the show too.
- It's a penalty.

473
00:18:38.315 --> 00:18:40.083
We need to talk.
- "We"?

474
00:18:40.084 --> 00:18:41.653
(We need to talk.)

475
00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:42.725
"We"?

476
00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:44.854
We have to go together.

477
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:46.624
Let's go catch eels.

478
00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.393
- Sung Hoon is the best.
- Let's get ready.

479
00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:49.394
Let's get ready.

480
00:18:49.624 --> 00:18:51.424
Get some shrimps too.

481
00:18:52.235 --> 00:18:53.235
Shrimps.

482
00:18:53.236 --> 00:18:55.965
- We can catch them too.
- We can.

483
00:18:56.305 --> 00:18:58.904
Are you here as viewers? The three of you?

484
00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.234
- The flame is going to die.
- What do we do?

485
00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:03.774
This is really wet.

486
00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:05.774
It's different from the sea,

487
00:19:05.775 --> 00:19:07.673
so the three of us have to watch the fire.

488
00:19:07.674 --> 00:19:09.014
(That means Woo Jin has to go alone.)

489
00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:10.344
- I'm really sorry.
- The fire?

490
00:19:10.444 --> 00:19:13.254
- I'll catch the eels by myself...
- Yes.

491
00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:14.895
- And the fire...
- We need three people.

492
00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:18.201
(They're saying the same thing
but have different intentions.)

493
00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:19.555
Is this how it usually works?

494
00:19:20.755 --> 00:19:21.824
It usually...

495
00:19:21.825 --> 00:19:25.164
Is there a cameraman who wants to join me?

496
00:19:25.594 --> 00:19:28.333
- There's no one.
- You're going to protect the fire?

497
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.834
One camera has to just film the fire.

498
00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:32.650
- A camera just films the fire?
- He'll give you a camera?

499
00:19:32.674 --> 00:19:33.833
We'll give you a camera.

500
00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:35.235
He's going to give you a camera.

501
00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:37.444
Then I didn't have to come
to the base camp then.

502
00:19:37.674 --> 00:19:39.975
- I'll wear my flip-flops.
- Take off the microphone.

503
00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:41.695
- What?
- You said you'll go in the water.

504
00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.745
I will go without my
microphone and the camera.

505
00:19:44.844 --> 00:19:46.431
Then would the viewers know
that I starred on the show?

506
00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:48.413
He said that you'll have the camera.

507
00:19:48.414 --> 00:19:49.754
- You can have the camera like this.
- The camera.

508
00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.354
- The viewers will know.
- They can't see what I'm doing.

509
00:19:52.854 --> 00:19:57.393
You can film yourself and the
water as you catch the eels.

510
00:19:57.394 --> 00:20:00.364
Am I on some sort of an online show?

511
00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:04.735
Or do you want to stay
here by yourself here?

512
00:20:04.834 --> 00:20:05.903
(The ideas never stop coming.)

513
00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:07.274
- Hey.
- No, no. Hear me out.

514
00:20:07.275 --> 00:20:10.044
- We came here all together.
- With the camera,

515
00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:12.914
you can film yourself when
you keep the fire going.

516
00:20:13.174 --> 00:20:14.643
- That actually sounds better.
- Going together...

517
00:20:14.644 --> 00:20:16.221
- means nothing.
- The three of us will be go.

518
00:20:16.245 --> 00:20:17.584
We'll be back.

519
00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:18.785
- Wait.
- Don't you agree?

520
00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:20.554
Why are you trying to
move as a group of three?

521
00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:21.954
- My stomach hurts.
- Include me in.

522
00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:23.083
(Teasing)

523
00:20:23.084 --> 00:20:24.623
(Sung Hoon pays back for what he got.)

524
00:20:24.624 --> 00:20:26.754
Sung Hoon. I...

525
00:20:26.755 --> 00:20:28.994
I'm starring on the show with you...

526
00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:31.824
- for now.
- You have a great role here!

527
00:20:31.825 --> 00:20:33.064
(Sung Hoon, a 43-year-old man)

528
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.370
- You did what?
- I gave you a great role...

529
00:20:34.394 --> 00:20:36.305
which is keeping the fire going.

530
00:20:36.334 --> 00:20:39.103
The three of us will go, so wait here.

531
00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:43.005
- Why are you assigning the roles?
- Everyone has a job.

532
00:20:43.444 --> 00:20:45.005
(Goofing around)

533
00:20:47.015 --> 00:20:48.444
He's a comedian.

534
00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:51.715
Comedians should be good at talking, but...

535
00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:55.015
I wonder why this guy
is invited here at all.

536
00:20:56.485 --> 00:20:58.485
(Their quarrel never ends.)

537
00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:00.124
(They're having a blast.)

538
00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:03.994
To be honest, it takes a
lot of time for me...

539
00:21:03.995 --> 00:21:06.964
to get to know someone whom I just met.

540
00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:09.863
Thanks to Woo Jin, it was fun.

541
00:21:09.864 --> 00:21:11.024
(Woo Jin helped him survive.)

542
00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:12.634
It was a good experience.

543
00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:15.705
All of us will go.

544
00:21:15.706 --> 00:21:16.774
(Their survival begins now.)

545
00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.643
- All right.
- Let's all go.

546
00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:19.644
(The four of them will go hunt.)

547
00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.544
You should consider yourself very grateful.

548
00:21:21.545 --> 00:21:23.113
(Sung Hoon's jokes liven up the mood.)

549
00:21:23.114 --> 00:21:24.545
You ought to be grateful.

550
00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:26.785
- Because you're coming along?
- Yes.

551
00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:29.083
- Roy.
- Roy.

552
00:21:29.084 --> 00:21:31.554
- Gosh. The house looks pretty.
- You're incredible.

553
00:21:31.555 --> 00:21:33.224
This is amazing. What's all this?

554
00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:34.923
(They look around the house
as soon as they return.)

555
00:21:34.924 --> 00:21:36.764
This is unbelievable.

556
00:21:36.765 --> 00:21:37.795
Hey.

557
00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:41.334
- It's the best house in the jungle.
- It's the prettiest.

558
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.565
Please give it up for Roy Kim.

559
00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:45.364
Hold on.

560
00:21:47.134 --> 00:21:49.304
- You're unbelievable.
- Thank you, all.

561
00:21:49.305 --> 00:21:51.544
- I think this has to be the best...
- Thank you.

562
00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:53.014
- House I've seen on the show.
- I did it.

563
00:21:53.015 --> 00:21:54.144
It really looks pretty.

564
00:21:54.275 --> 00:21:55.984
I spent hours building this house.

565
00:21:55.985 --> 00:21:57.643
- It must've been boring.
- I agree.

566
00:21:57.644 --> 00:21:58.985
This house...

567
00:22:00.055 --> 00:22:01.114
only lacks food.

568
00:22:01.455 --> 00:22:02.724
- Get ready.
- All right.

569
00:22:02.725 --> 00:22:03.883
Did you... Oh, my!

570
00:22:03.884 --> 00:22:04.954
- Can you see?
- Get ready.

571
00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:06.353
- I'm seeing something.
- What is it?

572
00:22:06.354 --> 00:22:08.153
- What is it? Are they bananas?
- Bananas.

573
00:22:08.154 --> 00:22:09.325
Don't just focus on bananas.

574
00:22:09.765 --> 00:22:12.025
- This is amazing.
- We brought you your favorite.

575
00:22:12.334 --> 00:22:14.164
We talked about this even yesterday.

576
00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:16.464
- Lobster?
- What are you craving the most?

577
00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:18.934
- It's lobster.
- No, it's some kind of shaved ice.

578
00:22:19.535 --> 00:22:21.805
- Is it a mango?
- A mango!

579
00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:23.374
(It's a mango.)

580
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.045
(No, he's Manggu, the dummy.)

581
00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:27.344
- Did you get me a mango?
- A mango. Hold on.

582
00:22:27.575 --> 00:22:28.883
Is that mango for me?

583
00:22:28.884 --> 00:22:30.214
Hey, I'm serious.

584
00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:32.183
- It's the best mango...
- Did you taste it?

585
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.383
- I've tasted.
- It's the tastiest.

586
00:22:33.384 --> 00:22:35.054
We just picked up the ones on the ground.

587
00:22:35.055 --> 00:22:36.525
This is so tasty.

588
00:22:36.985 --> 00:22:38.455
(He peels the skin off.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

589
00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:40.124
Try it.

590
00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:42.324
(He takes a bite of it.)

591
00:22:42.325 --> 00:22:44.364
- How is it?
- Isn't this amazing?

592
00:22:45.495 --> 00:22:46.965
Isn't it sweet?

593
00:22:47.735 --> 00:22:50.704
(He shuts his eyes tightly.)

594
00:22:50.705 --> 00:22:51.833
(He's in awe.)

595
00:22:51.834 --> 00:22:55.174
I've never tasted such a
sweet mango as this one.

596
00:22:57.404 --> 00:22:59.444
(This mango-lover is reacting right away.)

597
00:22:59.614 --> 00:23:01.643
I've never tasted such a
sweet mango as this one.

598
00:23:01.644 --> 00:23:02.883
I guess this has to be an apple mango.

599
00:23:02.884 --> 00:23:03.944
- I thought so.
- Right.

600
00:23:04.144 --> 00:23:05.754
(His hands are asking for more.)

601
00:23:05.755 --> 00:23:07.714
We got such expensive fruits.

602
00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:09.330
If you're going to peel it
off like that, I can do it.

603
00:23:09.354 --> 00:23:10.653
(Give me that.)

604
00:23:10.654 --> 00:23:12.955
A while ago, my feet hurt so much.

605
00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:14.375
I guess they want to go out.

606
00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:16.593
I guess I have to go to the sea tonight.

607
00:23:16.594 --> 00:23:17.663
(He reacts right away.)

608
00:23:17.664 --> 00:23:19.465
We should. Hey, is it good?

609
00:23:20.035 --> 00:23:21.465
Isn't it really good?

610
00:23:22.864 --> 00:23:25.634
(He's just eating a mango, but
strangely, it looks erotic.)

611
00:23:27.775 --> 00:23:30.245
(Only the mango and I exist in this world.)

612
00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:34.344
The mango shaved ice will be
really good with this mango.

613
00:23:35.985 --> 00:23:37.815
If you do, that's demeaning...

614
00:23:38.854 --> 00:23:41.614
to this mango. We can just eat this mango.

615
00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.201
- We don't need other ingredients.
- This is really good.

616
00:23:44.225 --> 00:23:46.593
But this is the tastiest
mango I've ever had.

617
00:23:46.594 --> 00:23:47.794
It's really good.

618
00:23:47.795 --> 00:23:48.893
- But this is better.
- This one.

619
00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:50.994
- What is this?
- It tastes like yogurt.

620
00:23:50.995 --> 00:23:53.995
- It's a fruit at the foreign aisle.
- I heard this is really sweet.

621
00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:56.234
- I'm going to cut it.
- Do it.

622
00:23:56.235 --> 00:23:57.305
Let's go.

623
00:23:57.664 --> 00:23:59.103
(He finally cuts the fruit at last.)

624
00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:01.373
Hey, it feels...

625
00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:03.275
sweet as soon as I put the knife in.

626
00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.004
You know what I mean?

627
00:24:05.005 --> 00:24:08.143
When the fruits are sweet, the
knife goes in really smoothly.

628
00:24:08.144 --> 00:24:09.785
It feels like I'm slicing Korean melons.

629
00:24:10.045 --> 00:24:11.645
It's similar to Korean melons or melons.

630
00:24:12.914 --> 00:24:15.215
But there are seeds? What is this?

631
00:24:16.084 --> 00:24:17.285
It looks a bit strange.

632
00:24:17.684 --> 00:24:19.353
This looks like a cassava.

633
00:24:19.354 --> 00:24:21.054
(Let's not lose hope.)

634
00:24:21.055 --> 00:24:22.640
- Wait.
- Why don't we cut a piece of it?

635
00:24:22.664 --> 00:24:23.694
Just a piece of it.

636
00:24:24.325 --> 00:24:25.393
I'll try it first.

637
00:24:25.394 --> 00:24:27.594
Gosh, this looks like a mango.

638
00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:29.765
(Gosh, this looks like a mango.)

639
00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:31.005
I think it will taste sweet.

640
00:24:31.005 --> 00:24:32.005
(Did he have a hunch it'll be sweet?)

641
00:24:32.006 --> 00:24:33.433
- Let me try it.
- It will taste like either...

642
00:24:33.434 --> 00:24:35.034
a cassava or a mango.

643
00:24:35.035 --> 00:24:36.075
Let me taste it first.

644
00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:39.045
(Roy tastes the fruit first as always.)

645
00:24:42.184 --> 00:24:44.285
- Is it ripe?
- How is it?

646
00:24:45.914 --> 00:24:46.955
How is it?

647
00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:48.653
(Tilting his head)

648
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:50.083
You don't know what this tastes like?
Don't eat it yet.

649
00:24:50.084 --> 00:24:52.755
(Excuse me. Please tell us something.)

650
00:24:52.995 --> 00:24:55.495
- What is it?
- Would you have seconds?

651
00:24:58.394 --> 00:25:01.364
I've never tasted anything
like this, but it sort of...

652
00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:04.265
tastes like a mango and Korean melon.

653
00:25:04.765 --> 00:25:06.774
So is it good or not?

654
00:25:06.775 --> 00:25:08.134
- It's good?
- It's good?

655
00:25:09.245 --> 00:25:11.274
(Dindin tastes it with Roy's approval.)

656
00:25:11.275 --> 00:25:12.275
(Is he frowning?)

657
00:25:12.276 --> 00:25:13.873
Mangos are tastier though.

658
00:25:13.874 --> 00:25:14.943
(What's up with his look?)

659
00:25:14.944 --> 00:25:16.184
What's wrong with his look?

660
00:25:18.584 --> 00:25:20.083
(Is it not good?)

661
00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:22.924
- No.
- Right? It's hard to explain.

662
00:25:23.184 --> 00:25:24.555
It's an odd taste.

663
00:25:25.124 --> 00:25:26.853
- Really?
- But it's good.

664
00:25:26.854 --> 00:25:29.324
- It's weird.
- It's a new taste.

665
00:25:29.325 --> 00:25:31.623
We are just unfamiliar with the taste.

666
00:25:31.624 --> 00:25:33.034
That's why we don't know
what this tastes like.

667
00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:34.093
We just don't what this is.

668
00:25:34.094 --> 00:25:35.133
(Soursop hasn't appeared in
the jungle for a while.)

669
00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:36.304
There are seeds.

670
00:25:36.305 --> 00:25:38.334
(Da Rae joins them to taste the fruit.)

671
00:25:38.805 --> 00:25:40.133
Even it looks weird.

672
00:25:40.134 --> 00:25:41.134
(Taking a bite)

673
00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:43.674
You don't know what this
tastes like, do you?

674
00:25:43.975 --> 00:25:45.644
This is sort of ambiguous taste.

675
00:25:46.914 --> 00:25:50.285
This is something we've never had before.

676
00:25:50.644 --> 00:25:51.745
But I could eat.

677
00:25:53.414 --> 00:25:54.514
What is this?

678
00:25:54.515 --> 00:25:56.254
(It's fragrant, sour, and sweet. It
has fibers, proteins, and vitamins.)

679
00:25:56.255 --> 00:25:57.684
How could I explain this?

680
00:25:59.825 --> 00:26:01.525
This tastes a bit erotic.

681
00:26:02.124 --> 00:26:03.795
(He's unbelievable.)

682
00:26:04.924 --> 00:26:06.633
This tastes like plums.

683
00:26:06.634 --> 00:26:07.863
(It tastes similar to a plum.)

684
00:26:07.864 --> 00:26:08.903
This is like the sherbet.

685
00:26:08.904 --> 00:26:10.144
(It tastes similar to sherbet.)

686
00:26:10.334 --> 00:26:12.604
Don't cacao beans make chocolate?

687
00:26:12.874 --> 00:26:14.174
There are seeds.

688
00:26:14.735 --> 00:26:16.075
This sort of makes me feel good.

689
00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:19.314
- I don't know.
- I can't describe it.

690
00:26:19.315 --> 00:26:20.413
(They take in a lot of vitamins.)

691
00:26:20.414 --> 00:26:21.644
This really tastes like soaps.

692
00:26:22.344 --> 00:26:23.384
It really does.

693
00:26:23.745 --> 00:26:25.954
Actually, I was reminded of this.

694
00:26:25.955 --> 00:26:28.984
You know one of those paper soaps?

695
00:26:28.985 --> 00:26:30.254
It tastes like that.

696
00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.623
When producers hold auditions for
the panels of cooking shows,

697
00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.623
When producers hold auditions for
the panels of cooking shows,

698
00:26:34.624 --> 00:26:36.024
they can just feed the participants this.

699
00:26:36.025 --> 00:26:37.964
They can ask to describe this taste.

700
00:26:37.965 --> 00:26:39.234
(Even Mr. Baek might struggle with it.)

701
00:26:39.235 --> 00:26:41.634
The participants just have
to describe this taste well.

702
00:26:42.805 --> 00:26:43.805
This is good.

703
00:26:43.806 --> 00:26:47.333
They replenished their vitamins
with tasty tropical fruits.

704
00:26:47.334 --> 00:26:48.903
For their night hunting at the sea,

705
00:26:48.904 --> 00:26:50.504
they get down to make their hunting tools.

706
00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:51.781
(These newbies are making tools.)

707
00:26:51.805 --> 00:26:54.605
Da Rae, the queen of the swimmers,
are going to hunt underwater alone.

708
00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:57.844
Dindin and Roy will set out to hunt crabs.

709
00:26:58.684 --> 00:27:01.413
As these newbies are improving rapidly,

710
00:27:01.414 --> 00:27:03.054
I'm looking forward to their night hunting.

711
00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:04.495
(The newbies are improving quickly.)

712
00:27:05.025 --> 00:27:06.593
Chae Kyung, just shine the
light, and we'll catch.

713
00:27:06.594 --> 00:27:08.114
- Chae Kyung, shine the light.
- Okay.

714
00:27:08.725 --> 00:27:11.094
Can you see my breath when I exhale?

715
00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:15.394
- It's cold.
- Can the camera catch it?

716
00:27:15.664 --> 00:27:16.704
It can.

717
00:27:16.705 --> 00:27:17.734
(The temperature has dropped.)

718
00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:19.535
- It's winter.
- This is how cold it is here.

719
00:27:21.035 --> 00:27:23.705
- Gosh, the water's so cold.
- Really?

720
00:27:23.944 --> 00:27:25.143
(The water's gone icy.)

721
00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.515
Gosh, it's freezing here.

722
00:27:28.444 --> 00:27:30.984
Hey, don't go in the water. It's cold.

723
00:27:30.985 --> 00:27:32.315
I'll go in.

724
00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:33.515
It's cold, isn't it?

725
00:27:34.055 --> 00:27:35.254
No way. It's ice water.

726
00:27:35.255 --> 00:27:36.383
(Sung Hoon is reliable as always.)

727
00:27:36.384 --> 00:27:37.755
Goodness!

728
00:27:38.654 --> 00:27:41.154
- It's so cold.
- It's freezing cold.

729
00:27:42.325 --> 00:27:44.225
(Staring)

730
00:27:44.995 --> 00:27:46.035
A shrimp!

731
00:27:46.934 --> 00:27:48.294
Hold on. There's a shrimp.

732
00:27:48.295 --> 00:27:50.164
- Why?
- Where is it?

733
00:27:51.535 --> 00:27:52.903
There's one. Wait.

734
00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:54.633
It's right here. Right here.

735
00:27:54.634 --> 00:27:56.943
(Under the cold water of the valley, )

736
00:27:56.944 --> 00:27:59.775
(a shrimp is spotted.)

737
00:28:01.914 --> 00:28:03.814
That's a real shrimp. It looks
like the one from the snack bag.

738
00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.284
(He's motivated to hunt.)

739
00:28:05.285 --> 00:28:07.315
(Let's hurry and catch it.)

740
00:28:07.985 --> 00:28:10.423
(It's a small-sized prawn.)

741
00:28:10.424 --> 00:28:11.555
(Grabbing)

742
00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:16.094
(He lost the shrimp.)

743
00:28:17.594 --> 00:28:18.725
It's really fast.

744
00:28:19.065 --> 00:28:21.164
It swam away, and it was really fast.

745
00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.204
(However)

746
00:28:24.205 --> 00:28:25.504
Hey, there are shrimps here.

747
00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:26.505
(There's hope.)

748
00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:29.443
When you flash the light on them,

749
00:28:29.444 --> 00:28:30.604
their eyes are red.

750
00:28:30.874 --> 00:28:33.074
- When I flash the light?
- Yes. Shrimps' eyes are red.

751
00:28:33.215 --> 00:28:35.014
Flash it where the current isn't strong.

752
00:28:35.015 --> 00:28:36.844
There are small ones here.

753
00:28:37.084 --> 00:28:38.814
- Are those shrimps?
- They are so tiny.

754
00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:40.554
We can't eat them. They're too small.

755
00:28:40.555 --> 00:28:41.583
(They let go of the small ones.)

756
00:28:41.584 --> 00:28:43.684
(We are going to catch only the big ones!)

757
00:28:44.725 --> 00:28:47.654
(They put up their guards
with their lighting eyes.)

758
00:28:49.565 --> 00:28:51.693
(Their hunting begins.)

759
00:28:51.694 --> 00:28:54.394
(The hunters of the shrimps venture out.)

760
00:28:55.965 --> 00:28:58.205
(Shall I start hunting now?)

761
00:29:00.535 --> 00:29:02.903
(He gets one of his hands ready carefully.)

762
00:29:02.904 --> 00:29:04.174
(Snatching)

763
00:29:05.545 --> 00:29:06.545
Did you get it?

764
00:29:06.546 --> 00:29:07.575
(Did he catch it?)

765
00:29:11.184 --> 00:29:12.214
(There's no shrimp.)

766
00:29:12.215 --> 00:29:13.590
- That was close.
- Wasn't it fast?

767
00:29:13.614 --> 00:29:14.854
Was it fast?

768
00:29:16.025 --> 00:29:17.083
(He's excited.)

769
00:29:17.084 --> 00:29:18.225
This one is big.

770
00:29:20.495 --> 00:29:22.124
(Approaching carefully)

771
00:29:23.225 --> 00:29:25.065
(It's pretty big.)

772
00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:31.465
(It runs away upon feeling vibration.)

773
00:29:32.535 --> 00:29:34.974
For goodness' sake. This
is driving me crazy.

774
00:29:34.975 --> 00:29:36.004
Why is it so fast?

775
00:29:36.005 --> 00:29:37.174
(It's so fast.)

776
00:29:39.114 --> 00:29:41.014
There are a lot here.

777
00:29:41.015 --> 00:29:42.215
- Really?
- Come here.

778
00:29:42.485 --> 00:29:43.943
There are a lot here.

779
00:29:43.944 --> 00:29:45.383
Don't get excited. Don't get excited.

780
00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:47.184
(They are excited to
find a group of shrimp.)

781
00:29:47.914 --> 00:29:49.324
- You see them, right?
- Yes.

782
00:29:49.325 --> 00:29:50.724
This one is the biggest.

783
00:29:50.725 --> 00:29:52.894
- Is this one the biggest?
- Yes, it's the biggest.

784
00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:55.093
Be careful.

785
00:29:55.094 --> 00:29:56.194
(He approaches carefully.)

786
00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:57.594
Okay.

787
00:29:58.295 --> 00:30:00.363
(Escaping)

788
00:30:00.364 --> 00:30:02.465
(It escapes to a space between the rocks.)

789
00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:04.705
Where did it go?

790
00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:07.575
(He aims for the shrimp.)

791
00:30:09.104 --> 00:30:11.603
(It stands still.)

792
00:30:11.604 --> 00:30:13.844
(He grabs it with enough force
to make the water muddy.)

793
00:30:14.215 --> 00:30:15.415
Gosh, I felt it with my hands.

794
00:30:15.985 --> 00:30:17.413
It escaped between my fingers.

795
00:30:17.414 --> 00:30:18.584
(It was close.)

796
00:30:19.715 --> 00:30:22.084
(I went easy on you.)

797
00:30:25.455 --> 00:30:27.093
(Chae Kyung reaches out quickly, )

798
00:30:27.094 --> 00:30:28.094
It's gone.

799
00:30:28.095 --> 00:30:29.364
(but her hands come up empty.)

800
00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:33.433
(Nothing is easy in the jungle.)

801
00:30:33.434 --> 00:30:34.465
My goodness.

802
00:30:34.565 --> 00:30:37.065
We tried our best in the cold weather...

803
00:30:37.334 --> 00:30:38.334
to no avail.

804
00:30:38.634 --> 00:30:41.775
The shrimp moved so fast
that we couldn't catch it.

805
00:30:41.904 --> 00:30:45.844
It was impossible to catch it with hands...

806
00:30:46.275 --> 00:30:48.245
because I couldn't tell where it would go.

807
00:30:50.084 --> 00:30:51.284
(Empty)

808
00:30:51.285 --> 00:30:52.325
- It's gone.
- Is it gone?

809
00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:53.584
Really?

810
00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.083
(Even Jong Hyuk fails.)

811
00:30:55.084 --> 00:30:56.485
While there are shrimps,

812
00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:58.755
they continue to miss them.

813
00:30:59.694 --> 00:31:01.554
What is the problem?

814
00:31:01.555 --> 00:31:02.594
This is driving me crazy.

815
00:31:04.624 --> 00:31:05.735
Use both of your hands.

816
00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:08.904
- What?
- Use both of your hands.

817
00:31:09.465 --> 00:31:11.181
- Should I use both of my hands?
- That's right.

818
00:31:11.205 --> 00:31:13.305
I see.

819
00:31:14.535 --> 00:31:18.305
Byung Man, the master of hunting
without a tool catches shrimp...

820
00:31:18.705 --> 00:31:21.775
with both of his hands.

821
00:31:22.315 --> 00:31:25.184
To move his hands freely, he
puts the lantern in his mouth.

822
00:31:25.315 --> 00:31:27.485
He reaches his hands out in an instant.

823
00:31:28.184 --> 00:31:30.724
It's Byung Man's know-how
on catching shrimp...

824
00:31:30.725 --> 00:31:33.455
that requires a high level of
concentration and agility.

825
00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:37.324
You should use both of your hands
when we shine the light on water.

826
00:31:37.325 --> 00:31:38.524
- Really?
- Yes.

827
00:31:38.525 --> 00:31:40.594
- I should go like this.
- Yes.

828
00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:42.735
I want to catch one.

829
00:31:43.505 --> 00:31:44.604
I will catch one.

830
00:31:47.374 --> 00:31:49.245
I see its red eyes.

831
00:31:49.604 --> 00:31:50.604
Look.

832
00:31:51.205 --> 00:31:52.613
It's big.

833
00:31:52.614 --> 00:31:54.444
(He spots shrimp.)

834
00:31:54.745 --> 00:31:56.944
It's big. Let's be careful.

835
00:31:58.515 --> 00:32:00.515
(He puts down the container.)

836
00:32:01.384 --> 00:32:03.354
(He tries to catch it
with both of his hands.)

837
00:32:05.084 --> 00:32:07.153
I caught it.

838
00:32:07.154 --> 00:32:09.423
(Did he succeed this time?)

839
00:32:09.424 --> 00:32:11.565
I caught it. I caught it.

840
00:32:11.795 --> 00:32:14.295
Yoo Ha, Dad caught it.

841
00:32:14.894 --> 00:32:17.364
Sung Hoon. Sung Hoon.

842
00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:20.433
(Shouting)

843
00:32:20.434 --> 00:32:21.805
Did you catch it?

844
00:32:22.505 --> 00:32:25.005
- Yes, I did.
- What did you catch?

845
00:32:25.104 --> 00:32:26.114
Shrimp.

846
00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:29.215
Do you see it? It was very fast.

847
00:32:31.245 --> 00:32:33.684
Oh, yes. I caught it.

848
00:32:34.414 --> 00:32:35.414
I caught it.

849
00:32:36.325 --> 00:32:39.393
(His success gives energy to
the rest of the members.)

850
00:32:39.394 --> 00:32:40.424
Come on out.

851
00:32:41.555 --> 00:32:42.694
Come on out, shrimp.

852
00:32:44.424 --> 00:32:46.593
(They continue to use both hands.)

853
00:32:46.594 --> 00:32:48.294
(Empty)

854
00:32:48.295 --> 00:32:49.305
For goodness' sake.

855
00:32:50.164 --> 00:32:52.404
(Will she succeed this time?)

856
00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:54.104
No.

857
00:32:54.604 --> 00:32:55.705
It was quite big.

858
00:32:56.505 --> 00:32:57.575
There are no shrimps.

859
00:32:57.604 --> 00:32:58.914
- Right?
- Right?

860
00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:01.774
(As time goes by, it becomes
hard to find shrimp.)

861
00:33:01.775 --> 00:33:04.114
- It's cold.
- It's cold, right?

862
00:33:04.184 --> 00:33:05.485
It's really cold.

863
00:33:07.455 --> 00:33:10.054
(They can't hunt anymore
in this cold weather.)

864
00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:12.354
(They move upstream towards the base.)

865
00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:16.194
(Their footsteps are heavy.)

866
00:33:17.424 --> 00:33:18.424
It's an eel.

867
00:33:18.694 --> 00:33:19.794
My goodness.

868
00:33:19.795 --> 00:33:20.795
- Look.
- Where is it?

869
00:33:21.334 --> 00:33:22.964
(Suddenly, )

870
00:33:22.965 --> 00:33:25.465
(a big eel appears.)

871
00:33:27.575 --> 00:33:30.404
(It moves away from Sung Hoon and Woo Jin.)

872
00:33:30.604 --> 00:33:31.604
- Look.
- Where is it?

873
00:33:32.075 --> 00:33:33.114
Where is it?

874
00:33:33.174 --> 00:33:35.015
(Who is he?)

875
00:33:36.184 --> 00:33:37.184
Where is it?

876
00:33:37.644 --> 00:33:38.644
(Throwing)

877
00:33:38.645 --> 00:33:41.015
- Where did it go?
- Here it is. Catch it.

878
00:33:41.884 --> 00:33:43.984
Catch it. Catch it.

879
00:33:43.985 --> 00:33:45.794
- My goodness.
- Catch it.

880
00:33:45.795 --> 00:33:47.153
(They suddenly have a
battle against an eel.)

881
00:33:47.154 --> 00:33:48.193
Where did it go?

882
00:33:48.194 --> 00:33:49.894
- Here it is. Catch it.
- My goodness.

883
00:33:49.924 --> 00:33:51.363
- What is it?
- Catch it. Catch it.

884
00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:52.570
(Jong Hyuk is away from the group.)

885
00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:54.264
- Did you catch it?
- Catch it. Catch it.

886
00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:57.103
(Flapping)

887
00:33:57.104 --> 00:33:59.504
(The eel thrashes.)

888
00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:01.004
- Catch it.
- I caught it.

889
00:34:01.005 --> 00:34:03.403
Keep your hands on it.

890
00:34:03.404 --> 00:34:04.744
(Will they catch it or lose it?)

891
00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:05.814
Give me the net.

892
00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:07.173
- The net.
- Give me the net.

893
00:34:07.174 --> 00:34:09.813
(The strength of the eel makes
their mouths and hands move fast.)

894
00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:12.085
- Don't put it in there.
- Give me the net.

895
00:34:12.254 --> 00:34:14.555
- Here, here.
- No, not that one.

896
00:34:15.055 --> 00:34:16.055
Here.

897
00:34:16.884 --> 00:34:18.325
Put it in.

898
00:34:19.194 --> 00:34:20.994
It bites. Put it in.

899
00:34:20.995 --> 00:34:22.995
(Beware of its teeth.)

900
00:34:25.424 --> 00:34:26.434
I almost swore.

901
00:34:26.435 --> 00:34:29.104
(They work together frantically
to put the eel in the net.)

902
00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:30.205
Wait a minute.

903
00:34:31.535 --> 00:34:32.575
All right.

904
00:34:33.105 --> 00:34:34.105
Catch it.

905
00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:35.105
(Since they only have shrimp, )

906
00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:37.904
(they must catch this eel.)

907
00:34:37.975 --> 00:34:39.843
- Give me the net.
- The net.

908
00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:40.844
I almost swore.

909
00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.383
(Will they succeed...)

910
00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:43.543
(in catching the eel?)

911
00:34:43.544 --> 00:34:44.544
Wait a minute.

912
00:34:45.884 --> 00:34:46.884
We got it.

913
00:34:49.685 --> 00:34:51.284
We got it.

914
00:34:51.285 --> 00:34:52.554
(Finally, )

915
00:34:52.555 --> 00:34:55.593
(they caught...)

916
00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:57.994
(the eel.)

917
00:34:57.995 --> 00:34:59.834
(Nice catch.)

918
00:34:59.835 --> 00:35:01.434
We have an eel.

919
00:35:01.435 --> 00:35:02.464
Jong Hyuk, it's an eel.

920
00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:05.434
(This is incredible.)

921
00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:06.734
We caught it.

922
00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.374
(Are we dreaming?)

923
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:10.375
My goodness.

924
00:35:11.404 --> 00:35:14.173
(The eels appeared without a warning.)

925
00:35:14.174 --> 00:35:16.585
(They smile now that they caught it.)

926
00:35:20.055 --> 00:35:22.754
We are good. We are good.

927
00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:25.084
- We are good.
- We suddenly have food.

928
00:35:25.085 --> 00:35:26.355
We are good now.

929
00:35:26.794 --> 00:35:28.994
- We are good.
- It might eat the shrimp.

930
00:35:28.995 --> 00:35:31.495
- Is that okay?
- It's okay. It can eat the shrimp.

931
00:35:33.265 --> 00:35:34.265
It's cold.

932
00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:35.864
Roy and Dindin, watch this on TV.

933
00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:37.734
That was incredible.

934
00:35:37.734 --> 00:35:38.734
(You are envious, right?)

935
00:35:40.174 --> 00:35:41.234
We caught it well.

936
00:35:42.904 --> 00:35:44.544
Our hunt was a big success.

937
00:35:45.274 --> 00:35:48.314
We were moving upstream after
giving up on the hunt.

938
00:35:48.645 --> 00:35:52.044
Seeing the eel so suddenly
excited us very much.

939
00:35:52.714 --> 00:35:55.253
The eel suddenly appeared...

940
00:35:55.254 --> 00:35:57.725
and the cameraman threw it towards us.

941
00:35:57.984 --> 00:36:00.225
He fell down as he threw it towards us.

942
00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:05.165
He fell into the water.
We were very surprised.

943
00:36:06.594 --> 00:36:10.234
We didn't have time to
shout, "It's an eel!"

944
00:36:10.464 --> 00:36:13.205
Our hands moved first
because we had to catch it.

945
00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.744
At that moment, we didn't even think...

946
00:36:15.745 --> 00:36:17.575
about getting bitten.

947
00:36:17.705 --> 00:36:18.705
"We have to catch it."

948
00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:23.145
There is no distinction between the
guests and staff in the jungle.

949
00:36:23.185 --> 00:36:25.065
Everyone becomes a member
of Byung Man's Tribe.

950
00:36:25.245 --> 00:36:28.713
I think the cameraman scooped
it out without thinking.

951
00:36:28.714 --> 00:36:29.725
(We will enjoy the eel.)

952
00:36:31.725 --> 00:36:33.055
It's very strong.

953
00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:35.193
- It's very big.
- This is incredible.

954
00:36:35.194 --> 00:36:36.594
It's very big.

955
00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:38.593
We caught it very well.

956
00:36:38.594 --> 00:36:39.594
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

957
00:36:39.734 --> 00:36:41.734
I wondered how we should share...

958
00:36:41.964 --> 00:36:43.634
tiny shrimp.

959
00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:46.634
They say there are ups and downs in life.

960
00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:50.305
In an unexpected moment, they became lucky.

961
00:36:51.274 --> 00:36:54.813
Meanwhile, the men who continue
to improve, Dindin and Roy are...

962
00:36:54.814 --> 00:36:57.214
getting to go on a night hunt.

963
00:36:57.614 --> 00:36:59.154
- Get the tools.
- Okay.

964
00:37:00.055 --> 00:37:01.055
Let's take this.

965
00:37:01.055 --> 00:37:02.055
(Before the hunt, )

966
00:37:02.056 --> 00:37:03.954
(Dindin makes a harpoon.)

967
00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:06.193
(I will catch everything.)

968
00:37:06.194 --> 00:37:07.225
Let's get it.

969
00:37:08.194 --> 00:37:10.164
(Making a tool)

970
00:37:10.165 --> 00:37:11.193
This might work.

971
00:37:11.194 --> 00:37:12.995
(He makes a torch that
will light their way.)

972
00:37:14.964 --> 00:37:16.003
All right.

973
00:37:16.004 --> 00:37:17.205
I am the man of the sea.

974
00:37:17.404 --> 00:37:18.434
I have a torch.

975
00:37:18.435 --> 00:37:19.903
(Confident and cool)

976
00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:20.904
The descendants of Fiji.

977
00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.003
(The hunting duo, the descendants of Fiji)

978
00:37:22.004 --> 00:37:24.375
(Dindin is an ace marksman
when it comes to crabs.)

979
00:37:26.745 --> 00:37:29.813
(He has fought in many battles
against the crabs...)

980
00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:32.613
(and made contributions.)

981
00:37:32.614 --> 00:37:35.685
(The expert of crab hunting)

982
00:37:36.555 --> 00:37:37.585
I caught it.

983
00:37:38.185 --> 00:37:40.594
(Roy has two faces.)

984
00:37:42.125 --> 00:37:44.793
(Carefree)

985
00:37:44.794 --> 00:37:47.464
(He works diligently like a fool.)

986
00:37:48.904 --> 00:37:50.344
(The naturalist and hunter, Roy Kim)

987
00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:52.704
(They worry about their
style more than anything.)

988
00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:54.904
(They are the best hunting duo.)

989
00:37:57.274 --> 00:38:01.214
(The descendants of Fiji)

990
00:38:02.745 --> 00:38:04.344
The crabs' apartment is over there.

991
00:38:05.185 --> 00:38:06.185
Let's go over there.

992
00:38:07.614 --> 00:38:10.254
(They plan to attack the crabs'
apartment they spotted.)

993
00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:12.524
Be careful. It's very slippery.

994
00:38:15.495 --> 00:38:16.794
It was around here.

995
00:38:18.395 --> 00:38:21.165
(They smell life.)

996
00:38:21.395 --> 00:38:22.935
It's a crab. Dindin.

997
00:38:23.004 --> 00:38:25.363
Dindin. Dindin. Dindin.

998
00:38:25.364 --> 00:38:28.474
- Where? Just wait.
- Dindin, look over there.

999
00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:30.355
(Dindin chases after the
crab with hesitation.)

1000
00:38:31.305 --> 00:38:33.814
This crab wasn't very tasty.

1001
00:38:34.114 --> 00:38:35.114
Is that the crab?

1002
00:38:35.585 --> 00:38:36.883
This crab isn't very tasty.

1003
00:38:36.884 --> 00:38:38.983
The crab we saw earlier is the tasty one.

1004
00:38:38.984 --> 00:38:40.554
- Go away. We won't eat you.
- Go away.

1005
00:38:40.555 --> 00:38:42.115
- You aren't tasty.
- You aren't tasty.

1006
00:38:46.355 --> 00:38:48.835
- These crabs aren't tasty.
- We are only getting these crabs.

1007
00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:52.835
It's always the tasteless crabs
that want our attention.

1008
00:38:53.895 --> 00:38:57.165
(The descendant of Fiji
searches diligently.)

1009
00:38:58.705 --> 00:39:00.304
(The torch went out a long time ago.)

1010
00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:01.305
Look at the waves.

1011
00:39:04.645 --> 00:39:06.344
Where was the crabs' apartment?

1012
00:39:07.814 --> 00:39:10.444
There are a lot of fish.

1013
00:39:11.344 --> 00:39:13.254
There are so many creatures.

1014
00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:14.415
It's fish.

1015
00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:17.154
(They find a water park for fish.)

1016
00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:19.624
We need a fishing net. They are too fast.

1017
00:39:19.625 --> 00:39:21.454
(It will be hard to catch these fast fish.)

1018
00:39:21.455 --> 00:39:23.693
If you catch it, I'll
acknowledge you as chief.

1019
00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:24.924
(He holds a sharp harpoon.)

1020
00:39:26.134 --> 00:39:28.535
(It swims away.)

1021
00:39:29.205 --> 00:39:31.634
Now that I've been hunting for a few days,

1022
00:39:32.674 --> 00:39:35.375
I don't want to catch small ones anymore.

1023
00:39:37.044 --> 00:39:38.604
(It's a pie in the sky.)

1024
00:39:38.605 --> 00:39:40.475
We should've put a fish trap here.

1025
00:39:42.614 --> 00:39:43.884
Let's catch crabs instead.

1026
00:39:45.245 --> 00:39:46.653
(Staggering)

1027
00:39:46.654 --> 00:39:48.584
It's really slippery. Be careful.

1028
00:39:48.585 --> 00:39:49.753
(He's tired after using the harpoon.)

1029
00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:51.825
(Will he be able to catch a crab?)

1030
00:39:52.754 --> 00:39:54.024
Hey, is that it?

1031
00:39:55.524 --> 00:39:56.563
(Did they find prey?)

1032
00:39:56.564 --> 00:39:58.963
- Hey, Roy. Wait.
- What is it?

1033
00:39:58.964 --> 00:39:59.995
There's a huge fish.

1034
00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:04.404
(Did Dindin find a big one?)

1035
00:40:06.174 --> 00:40:08.204
(He's closing in on the prey.)

1036
00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.745
- It's over there.
- Where?

1037
00:40:09.805 --> 00:40:11.144
(Dropping)

1038
00:40:11.145 --> 00:40:14.214
What? My mosquito repellent.

1039
00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:16.785
That fish is gone. Wait. You're a genius.

1040
00:40:19.654 --> 00:40:21.113
We missed that fish.

1041
00:40:21.114 --> 00:40:22.724
(He saved his mosquito
repellent, but lost the fish.)

1042
00:40:22.725 --> 00:40:23.785
Wait a minute.

1043
00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:26.194
(He's dumbfounded.)

1044
00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:29.764
(The glory of the crab hunter is...)

1045
00:40:29.765 --> 00:40:30.824
Do you know where it went?

1046
00:40:30.825 --> 00:40:31.864
(all in the past.)

1047
00:40:33.234 --> 00:40:34.293
Everyone, let's go back.

1048
00:40:34.294 --> 00:40:35.335
(He's depressed.)

1049
00:40:37.904 --> 00:40:39.535
Will Da Rae catch something?

1050
00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:42.133
Do we have to count on Da Rae now?

1051
00:40:42.134 --> 00:40:43.934
(All they can count on
is the gold medalist.)

1052
00:40:44.645 --> 00:40:47.214
(Da Rae goes fishing alone in the sea.)

1053
00:40:48.174 --> 00:40:49.943
(She does everything on her own.)

1054
00:40:49.944 --> 00:40:52.254
(She puts on all the gears.)

1055
00:40:53.355 --> 00:40:55.114
(I'll take over the night sea of Fiji.)

1056
00:40:56.625 --> 00:40:58.753
(She can swim.)

1057
00:40:58.754 --> 00:41:01.395
(She can dive.)

1058
00:41:01.955 --> 00:41:04.624
(Last, time she showed off
her sea hunting skills.)

1059
00:41:04.625 --> 00:41:07.835
(She caught giant clams.)

1060
00:41:08.134 --> 00:41:09.165
- Amazing.
- Nice.

1061
00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:10.804
Be careful.

1062
00:41:10.805 --> 00:41:12.150
(Da Rae walks backward without hesitation.)

1063
00:41:12.174 --> 00:41:13.305
Good luck.

1064
00:41:13.774 --> 00:41:14.774
Thank you.

1065
00:41:15.435 --> 00:41:17.504
What's that? I can't see.

1066
00:41:18.844 --> 00:41:21.374
(Needlefish is jumping up and down.)

1067
00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:22.685
I see what's in here.

1068
00:41:22.944 --> 00:41:24.314
Okay. I got it.

1069
00:42:07.153 --> 00:42:10.852
I thought I should at
least catch some fish.

1070
00:42:10.853 --> 00:42:11.982
I felt like I could...

1071
00:42:11.983 --> 00:42:15.193
catch something if I went hunting at night.

1072
00:42:17.063 --> 00:42:18.991
(Guys, the gold medalist is here!)

1073
00:42:18.992 --> 00:42:20.733
(They swim away.)

1074
00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:23.662
(Looking around)

1075
00:42:26.472 --> 00:42:30.702
Actually I've never swum
in the ocean at night.

1076
00:42:31.202 --> 00:42:34.812
It was interesting to
swim with a flashlight.

1077
00:42:34.813 --> 00:42:36.742
(She feels awkward, but swims confidently.)

1078
00:42:37.112 --> 00:42:38.841
(Viewpoint of Da Rae's camera)

1079
00:42:38.842 --> 00:42:40.051
(She turns quickly.)

1080
00:42:40.052 --> 00:42:42.483
(She quickly changes direction
as if she found something.)

1081
00:42:45.253 --> 00:42:47.753
(She aims her harpoon.)

1082
00:42:50.662 --> 00:42:52.932
(A fish swims away from the harpoon.)

1083
00:42:54.193 --> 00:42:55.793
(That was so close.)

1084
00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:02.133
(She dives in again.)

1085
00:43:03.242 --> 00:43:05.403
(She finds another fish!)

1086
00:43:07.173 --> 00:43:09.543
(Approaching stealthily)

1087
00:43:12.142 --> 00:43:13.583
(Swimming away)

1088
00:43:15.682 --> 00:43:18.583
(She keeps chasing fish tails.)

1089
00:43:19.523 --> 00:43:21.753
(It's not going the way I want it to go.)

1090
00:43:23.793 --> 00:43:26.262
(She keeps searching for prey.)

1091
00:43:27.992 --> 00:43:32.262
(She gets her harpoon
ready and dives down.)

1092
00:43:32.972 --> 00:43:35.633
(What is it this time?)

1093
00:43:36.642 --> 00:43:38.873
(She found a big one!)

1094
00:43:41.373 --> 00:43:42.673
(Piercing)

1095
00:43:43.943 --> 00:43:46.182
(She misses it again.)

1096
00:43:47.213 --> 00:43:49.782
(Gosh, that was a huge one!)

1097
00:43:53.322 --> 00:43:57.722
(Da Rae doesn't give up.
She keeps diving in.)

1098
00:44:00.293 --> 00:44:02.792
(She aims at the fish.)

1099
00:44:02.793 --> 00:44:04.701
(She shoots...)

1100
00:44:04.702 --> 00:44:06.032
(and fails again.)

1101
00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:09.773
(Please get caught.)

1102
00:44:12.142 --> 00:44:14.571
I tried so many times.

1103
00:44:14.572 --> 00:44:17.182
I used the harpoon Roy made.

1104
00:44:17.512 --> 00:44:20.212
The tip came off. It became dull.

1105
00:44:20.213 --> 00:44:22.451
When you're in the water,
there is resistance.

1106
00:44:22.452 --> 00:44:24.922
You can't move as fast.

1107
00:44:24.923 --> 00:44:26.853
Even when I used force, it didn't work.

1108
00:44:28.353 --> 00:44:31.362
(The tip of the harpoon became dull.)

1109
00:44:33.262 --> 00:44:39.162
This... I can't pierce fish with this.

1110
00:44:40.233 --> 00:44:42.002
It's too dull.

1111
00:44:42.003 --> 00:44:43.003
(Gosh, I have to catch fish.)

1112
00:44:43.004 --> 00:44:45.472
I can't pierce fish with it.

1113
00:44:46.342 --> 00:44:49.011
(She recuperates and goes searching again.)

1114
00:44:49.012 --> 00:44:51.682
(I will never give up.)

1115
00:44:52.952 --> 00:44:55.112
(She finds something.)

1116
00:44:57.583 --> 00:45:01.793
(She throws the dull harpoon
down with all her strength.)

1117
00:45:03.063 --> 00:45:06.023
(Again, it's a big one!)

1118
00:45:07.592 --> 00:45:10.503
I have to catch this. I will catch it.

1119
00:45:12.202 --> 00:45:15.472
(But will it be possible
with this harpoon?)

1120
00:45:17.773 --> 00:45:20.872
(The fish swims away and
hides among the corals.)

1121
00:45:20.873 --> 00:45:23.083
(Stop right there!)

1122
00:45:24.842 --> 00:45:25.983
(Stabbing)

1123
00:45:28.483 --> 00:45:31.682
The harpoon was so dull to pierce anything.

1124
00:45:32.052 --> 00:45:33.423
So shoved it inside the corals.

1125
00:45:33.892 --> 00:45:36.891
I didn't want the fish to escape,
so I held the harpoon there.

1126
00:45:36.892 --> 00:45:37.962
(Her plan is to trap the fish.)

1127
00:45:37.963 --> 00:45:40.733
(She blocked the entrance
with the harpoon.)

1128
00:45:41.992 --> 00:45:43.103
There.

1129
00:45:43.862 --> 00:45:45.532
It's in there.

1130
00:45:45.833 --> 00:45:47.673
(Did her plan work?)

1131
00:45:49.472 --> 00:45:52.202
(The fish went inside the corals.)

1132
00:45:54.043 --> 00:45:56.612
(I don't want to miss it.
What am I going to do?)

1133
00:45:58.342 --> 00:46:00.313
(Hesitating)

1134
00:46:00.653 --> 00:46:01.653
Hold on.

1135
00:46:01.654 --> 00:46:04.222
(She pulls away to come up
with a different plan.)

1136
00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:06.923
(She's out of the water.)

1137
00:46:08.722 --> 00:46:10.023
Do you have anything sharp?

1138
00:46:11.623 --> 00:46:15.062
I can't stab it because I
don't have a sharp harpoon.

1139
00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:17.003
(Flustered)

1140
00:46:17.932 --> 00:46:19.003
Here.

1141
00:46:19.503 --> 00:46:24.802
(The cameraman hands her a tool.)

1142
00:46:25.773 --> 00:46:27.772
(Then she dives in deep.)

1143
00:46:27.773 --> 00:46:29.242
It's really huge.

1144
00:46:30.782 --> 00:46:32.641
(Fumbling)

1145
00:46:32.642 --> 00:46:35.781
(She's trying to get the
fish with her hand.)

1146
00:46:35.782 --> 00:46:37.383
(Good luck!)

1147
00:46:38.782 --> 00:46:39.892
I got it!

1148
00:46:40.193 --> 00:46:41.652
What?

1149
00:46:41.653 --> 00:46:44.192
- She got it.
- It's huge, isn't it?

1150
00:46:44.193 --> 00:46:46.833
- Gosh.
- She got it.

1151
00:46:48.262 --> 00:46:50.963
- Isn't it huge?
- Da Rae caught it.

1152
00:46:51.403 --> 00:46:52.562
She did it.

1153
00:46:52.563 --> 00:46:55.233
Yes! I'm so happy.

1154
00:46:56.003 --> 00:46:57.971
I almost missed it.

1155
00:46:57.972 --> 00:47:02.141
But the cameraman helped me.
So I could catch it.

1156
00:47:02.142 --> 00:47:03.912
- I'll put it here.
- Okay.

1157
00:47:04.412 --> 00:47:05.482
Isn't it big?

1158
00:47:05.483 --> 00:47:07.043
(Catching fish at night was a success!)

1159
00:47:07.853 --> 00:47:08.952
Gosh.

1160
00:47:09.753 --> 00:47:11.382
(I'm glad I caught at least one!)

1161
00:47:11.383 --> 00:47:12.551
- I'll help you.
- Seriously.

1162
00:47:12.552 --> 00:47:14.153
Climbing the boat is hard.

1163
00:47:15.092 --> 00:47:16.861
Da Rae, the gold medalist,

1164
00:47:16.862 --> 00:47:19.491
caught a fish with the experienced staff.

1165
00:47:19.492 --> 00:47:20.492
(They succeeded together.)

1166
00:47:20.493 --> 00:47:22.062
They help each other...

1167
00:47:22.063 --> 00:47:23.802
and share the happiness.

1168
00:47:24.262 --> 00:47:27.003
This is what makes surviving
in the jungle fun.

1169
00:47:27.673 --> 00:47:28.673
Did you catch something?

1170
00:47:29.603 --> 00:47:30.603
He's here.

1171
00:47:31.403 --> 00:47:33.072
- You worked so hard.
- Where's the eel?

1172
00:47:33.842 --> 00:47:35.971
- It's over here.
- Ta-da.

1173
00:47:35.972 --> 00:47:37.082
Amazing.

1174
00:47:37.083 --> 00:47:38.142
(Here's the eel.)

1175
00:47:39.552 --> 00:47:41.083
- Isn't it big?
- Isn't it awesome?

1176
00:47:41.782 --> 00:47:44.123
- Isn't it like an anaconda?
- Seriously.

1177
00:47:44.722 --> 00:47:47.192
This is where they shot "Anaconda".

1178
00:47:47.193 --> 00:47:49.322
- It looks like a snake.
- Is this really an eel?

1179
00:47:49.793 --> 00:47:50.922
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

1180
00:47:50.923 --> 00:47:52.361
(It's a giant mottled eel.)

1181
00:47:52.362 --> 00:47:54.062
Isn't it really thick?

1182
00:47:54.063 --> 00:47:56.092
- It tries to bite.
- It bites.

1183
00:47:56.963 --> 00:47:58.903
It's strong. It wriggles.

1184
00:48:00.133 --> 00:48:01.332
The problem is...

1185
00:48:01.333 --> 00:48:02.402
(The problem is...)

1186
00:48:02.403 --> 00:48:03.673
how to fillet this.

1187
00:48:04.403 --> 00:48:05.448
Jong Hyuk, have you done this before?

1188
00:48:05.472 --> 00:48:07.443
- No.
- You haven't?

1189
00:48:07.543 --> 00:48:08.911
I have never cleaned an eel.

1190
00:48:08.912 --> 00:48:09.943
(I don't know either.)

1191
00:48:11.813 --> 00:48:15.482
(No one has tried cleaning
and cooking an eel.)

1192
00:48:15.483 --> 00:48:17.551
We need to find a way to do it.

1193
00:48:17.552 --> 00:48:18.622
(They rack their brains.)

1194
00:48:18.623 --> 00:48:20.592
However, no one has a clue.

1195
00:48:21.052 --> 00:48:23.761
I know what we need.

1196
00:48:23.762 --> 00:48:25.721
We need bamboo.

1197
00:48:25.722 --> 00:48:28.092
In Madagascar, we cooked eels in bamboo.

1198
00:48:28.362 --> 00:48:29.732
Let's get a big bamboo...

1199
00:48:29.733 --> 00:48:30.761
(What is Sung Hoon's master
plan of cooking an eel?)

1200
00:48:30.762 --> 00:48:31.903
and cut it in half.

1201
00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:34.471
(In Madagascar, Chief Byung
Man grilled eels on bamboo.)

1202
00:48:34.472 --> 00:48:37.773
Chief Byung Man has made
grilled eels on bamboo.

1203
00:48:38.673 --> 00:48:41.043
Will they be able to make the dish?

1204
00:48:41.412 --> 00:48:43.442
- We need two sections.
- Should I cut these two sections?

1205
00:48:43.443 --> 00:48:45.912
Try cutting right there.

1206
00:48:46.512 --> 00:48:50.182
It needs to be big enough for the eel.

1207
00:48:53.822 --> 00:48:56.221
Did you come here to
avoid cleaning the eel?

1208
00:48:56.222 --> 00:48:57.891
Did you come here to
avoid cleaning the eel?

1209
00:48:57.892 --> 00:49:00.962
(He feigns innocence.)

1210
00:49:00.963 --> 00:49:02.563
This is the most important part.

1211
00:49:06.003 --> 00:49:08.772
(Breaking open)

1212
00:49:08.773 --> 00:49:09.773
(I will do everything
that requires muscles.)

1213
00:49:09.774 --> 00:49:10.903
You are the best.

1214
00:49:12.912 --> 00:49:16.111
(The descendant of Chief Byung Man
versus The descendant of anaconda)

1215
00:49:16.112 --> 00:49:19.552
(The eel is strong.)

1216
00:49:19.952 --> 00:49:20.983
(Let's do this.)

1217
00:49:21.952 --> 00:49:24.922
(He chases after the eel...)

1218
00:49:24.923 --> 00:49:27.152
(to clean it.)

1219
00:49:27.153 --> 00:49:29.192
(He is winning the battles.)

1220
00:49:29.193 --> 00:49:30.693
(Surprised)

1221
00:49:32.762 --> 00:49:34.032
(He is pretty impressive.)

1222
00:49:36.532 --> 00:49:38.603
(At the moment, the help arrives.)

1223
00:49:38.802 --> 00:49:41.701
(Put on the gloves...)

1224
00:49:41.702 --> 00:49:44.543
(and use a different knife.)

1225
00:49:45.072 --> 00:49:46.372
It's very slippery.

1226
00:49:46.373 --> 00:49:47.689
(She holds its tail so that it slips less.)

1227
00:49:47.713 --> 00:49:49.511
This is enough, right?

1228
00:49:49.512 --> 00:49:50.512
(He removes the gut and makes deep cuts.)

1229
00:49:50.513 --> 00:49:52.951
There is a lot of meat.

1230
00:49:52.952 --> 00:49:54.551
(He finished cleaning the eel
by rinsing it with water.)

1231
00:49:54.552 --> 00:49:55.653
It's very big.

1232
00:49:56.052 --> 00:49:58.583
- It was very strong.
- We did a good job.

1233
00:50:00.552 --> 00:50:02.222
I will be eating an eel here.

1234
00:50:04.162 --> 00:50:05.361
It's just right.

1235
00:50:05.362 --> 00:50:06.362
(They put the cleaned eel in bamboo.)

1236
00:50:06.362 --> 00:50:07.362
Let's put the lid on it.

1237
00:50:07.363 --> 00:50:10.402
(Put the lid to contain the heat.)

1238
00:50:10.403 --> 00:50:12.603
(Place it over the fire.)

1239
00:50:14.532 --> 00:50:16.741
(They can't help but exclaim...)

1240
00:50:16.742 --> 00:50:18.042
(and clap.)

1241
00:50:18.043 --> 00:50:20.571
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1242
00:50:20.572 --> 00:50:22.142
(The eel dish is going well so far.)

1243
00:50:22.842 --> 00:50:24.943
How long do you think it will take?

1244
00:50:25.043 --> 00:50:27.052
- It will take over an hour.
- Over an hour?

1245
00:50:27.153 --> 00:50:29.212
It's big fish.

1246
00:50:29.213 --> 00:50:32.451
(It will take a while for a
big fish to cook thoroughly.)

1247
00:50:32.452 --> 00:50:33.452
(The human kindling helps.)

1248
00:50:33.453 --> 00:50:34.721
I am so hungry.

1249
00:50:34.722 --> 00:50:35.753
(Please cook quickly.)

1250
00:50:36.992 --> 00:50:38.962
- It's hard to wait.
- I know.

1251
00:50:38.963 --> 00:50:41.261
(Now that they tended to the
fire, it's time to wait.)

1252
00:50:41.262 --> 00:50:43.833
The bamboo is splitting.
The eel is falling down.

1253
00:50:44.202 --> 00:50:45.233
(Is it falling down?)

1254
00:50:45.702 --> 00:50:46.872
My goodness.

1255
00:50:46.873 --> 00:50:48.272
- Is it okay?
- Wait a minute.

1256
00:50:48.273 --> 00:50:49.571
Wait a minute. What should we do?

1257
00:50:49.572 --> 00:50:51.772
(Flustered)

1258
00:50:51.773 --> 00:50:52.971
- My goodness.
- Wait a minute.

1259
00:50:52.972 --> 00:50:54.511
- Is it okay?
- In 1, 2, 3.

1260
00:50:54.512 --> 00:50:56.281
- Wait a minute. The bamboo is hot.
- It's hot.

1261
00:50:56.282 --> 00:50:57.641
(They fail to save the eel from the fire.)

1262
00:50:57.642 --> 00:50:58.642
(They overturn the bamboo.)

1263
00:50:58.643 --> 00:51:00.482
- Move your hand away from the fire.
- What should we do?

1264
00:51:00.483 --> 00:51:01.882
- Wait a minute.
- No, no.

1265
00:51:01.883 --> 00:51:03.198
(They are having a mental breakdown.)

1266
00:51:03.222 --> 00:51:05.152
(What should we do?)

1267
00:51:05.153 --> 00:51:07.652
- How should we flip it over?
- It's too heavy.

1268
00:51:07.653 --> 00:51:08.813
- Gosh, it's hot.
- It's hot.

1269
00:51:11.063 --> 00:51:12.091
What should we do?

1270
00:51:12.092 --> 00:51:13.431
(The eel is buried in fire.)

1271
00:51:13.432 --> 00:51:14.492
Hold it.

1272
00:51:15.532 --> 00:51:19.403
(Woo Jin rescues it with his bare hands.)

1273
00:51:19.873 --> 00:51:22.672
(They recover the eel.)

1274
00:51:22.673 --> 00:51:24.849
Since it's freshwater eel, we
should cook it thoroughly.

1275
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:27.342
I think everything is
cooked except for the head.

1276
00:51:27.943 --> 00:51:29.983
I think we should cook the
middle part for longer.

1277
00:51:30.142 --> 00:51:31.482
- The middle part?
- Yes.

1278
00:51:31.483 --> 00:51:33.051
(There are many opinions,
but no one knows for sure.)

1279
00:51:33.052 --> 00:51:34.753
We can put it up here.

1280
00:51:34.853 --> 00:51:37.982
(Will it be okay?)

1281
00:51:37.983 --> 00:51:39.423
Look at the juice.

1282
00:51:39.722 --> 00:51:41.622
This part looks incredible.

1283
00:51:41.623 --> 00:51:42.652
(It browns in no time.)

1284
00:51:42.653 --> 00:51:45.221
I eat eels very often in Korea.

1285
00:51:45.222 --> 00:51:46.261
- Do you like eels?
- Yes.

1286
00:51:46.262 --> 00:51:48.861
I order both seasoned eels and salted eels.

1287
00:51:48.862 --> 00:51:50.661
It looks incredible.

1288
00:51:50.662 --> 00:51:52.733
(I am confident when it comes to eating.)

1289
00:51:53.432 --> 00:51:54.772
There is a lot to eat.

1290
00:51:54.773 --> 00:51:55.773
(Eels protect the five viscera.)

1291
00:51:55.774 --> 00:51:56.842
Isn't it cooked?

1292
00:51:57.543 --> 00:51:58.903
I think it's cooked.

1293
00:51:59.503 --> 00:52:00.673
It's cooked.

1294
00:52:02.072 --> 00:52:04.483
(They waited a long time for the eel.)

1295
00:52:05.443 --> 00:52:06.452
There is a lot of meat.

1296
00:52:06.983 --> 00:52:08.052
This is incredible.

1297
00:52:08.452 --> 00:52:12.221
We are improving day by day...

1298
00:52:12.222 --> 00:52:13.692
- when it comes to food.
- That's right.

1299
00:52:13.693 --> 00:52:14.693
Today's meal is the best.

1300
00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:17.392
Did we have papaya or coconut?

1301
00:52:17.862 --> 00:52:20.491
- We had papaya.
- Then we had cassavas.

1302
00:52:20.492 --> 00:52:21.492
(They went from root
vegetables to crustaceans.)

1303
00:52:21.493 --> 00:52:24.633
Then we ate sugar cane and caught crabs.

1304
00:52:26.673 --> 00:52:28.602
- We are having a feast today.
- What do you think?

1305
00:52:28.603 --> 00:52:29.943
Is it not cooked yet?

1306
00:52:30.273 --> 00:52:31.543
- What is it?
- Is it okay?

1307
00:52:31.642 --> 00:52:33.912
- It smells amazing.
- Really?

1308
00:52:34.142 --> 00:52:36.511
- It doesn't smell fishy at all.
- Really?

1309
00:52:36.512 --> 00:52:37.583
(Everyone is expectant.)

1310
00:52:37.883 --> 00:52:39.312
- All right.
- Let's eat.

1311
00:52:39.313 --> 00:52:40.412
Let's eat.

1312
00:52:40.713 --> 00:52:43.822
The youngest member, Chae
Kyung can try it first.

1313
00:52:44.282 --> 00:52:45.782
Thank you for the food.

1314
00:52:47.552 --> 00:52:48.792
Be careful. It's hot.

1315
00:52:48.793 --> 00:52:51.123
(She takes a big piece.)

1316
00:52:51.362 --> 00:52:53.361
Tell us how it tastes.

1317
00:52:53.362 --> 00:52:54.463
(Eating)

1318
00:52:54.793 --> 00:52:55.793
How does it taste?

1319
00:52:55.794 --> 00:52:59.261
(Is it tasty?)

1320
00:52:59.262 --> 00:53:01.032
(Her eyes crinkle.)

1321
00:53:01.103 --> 00:53:02.232
(She answers with a cute
facial expression.)

1322
00:53:02.233 --> 00:53:04.141
- It's a salted eel.
- The taste made her act cute.

1323
00:53:04.142 --> 00:53:05.442
(It's a salted eel.)

1324
00:53:05.443 --> 00:53:07.213
- Hurry up and try it.
- Try it.

1325
00:53:10.612 --> 00:53:12.782
- Is it good?
- It's incredible.

1326
00:53:15.153 --> 00:53:16.853
- It's tasty.
- It's so tasty.

1327
00:53:16.983 --> 00:53:18.052
What is it?

1328
00:53:18.853 --> 00:53:21.352
- Is it incredible?
- I don't usually like eels.

1329
00:53:21.353 --> 00:53:22.353
(Jong Hyuk is speechless.)

1330
00:53:22.354 --> 00:53:23.362
It's tasty.

1331
00:53:24.963 --> 00:53:28.063
(Isn't it tasty?)

1332
00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:29.292
(His eyes shine.)

1333
00:53:29.293 --> 00:53:31.801
It's really chewy. When
you eat eels at Seoul,

1334
00:53:31.802 --> 00:53:33.632
it's not chewy,

1335
00:53:33.633 --> 00:53:36.602
but soft and hot.

1336
00:53:36.603 --> 00:53:37.603
(It's the class of a marbled
eel, which is rare in Korea.)

1337
00:53:37.604 --> 00:53:39.572
- It's chewy.
- Be careful with the bones.

1338
00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:43.712
(Grilled eel in bamboo was a big success.)

1339
00:53:43.713 --> 00:53:45.273
I didn't know an eel could be so tasty.

1340
00:53:45.813 --> 00:53:46.852
(They resume eating.)

1341
00:53:46.853 --> 00:53:49.182
- My goodness.
- It smells great.

1342
00:53:49.452 --> 00:53:51.652
(She doesn't even know she
has something on her mouth.)

1343
00:53:55.552 --> 00:53:57.063
It has a smoky flavor.

1344
00:53:57.693 --> 00:54:00.133
It tastes like smoked ham.

1345
00:54:01.133 --> 00:54:04.733
(He takes another bite of smoked ham.)

1346
00:54:05.202 --> 00:54:06.272
It's very tasty.

1347
00:54:06.273 --> 00:54:07.953
(He stands up every time he takes a bite.)

1348
00:54:08.472 --> 00:54:10.042
(They cross their hands in amazement.)

1349
00:54:10.043 --> 00:54:11.072
Good job.

1350
00:54:13.112 --> 00:54:14.112
It's tasty.

1351
00:54:16.282 --> 00:54:18.713
(After eating for a while...)

1352
00:54:21.782 --> 00:54:25.153
Why did they stop eating the eel?

1353
00:54:25.682 --> 00:54:27.892
The atmosphere turned serious.

1354
00:54:28.392 --> 00:54:31.192
They sigh and glance at each other.

1355
00:54:31.193 --> 00:54:32.491
(They glance...)

1356
00:54:32.492 --> 00:54:33.833
(at each other.)

1357
00:54:35.432 --> 00:54:37.502
(The fairy of eating grimaces.)

1358
00:54:37.503 --> 00:54:39.002
Turn it over.

1359
00:54:39.003 --> 00:54:40.532
- Turn it over.
- What happened?

1360
00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:42.971
Because the lid came off in the middle,

1361
00:54:42.972 --> 00:54:44.042
(This is the problem.)

1362
00:54:44.043 --> 00:54:47.212
there is a part that isn't cooked.

1363
00:54:47.213 --> 00:54:48.342
My goodness.

1364
00:54:48.512 --> 00:54:49.681
This part is practically raw.

1365
00:54:49.682 --> 00:54:50.742
(What happened?)

1366
00:54:51.642 --> 00:54:53.852
(Let's study Chief Byung Man's style.)

1367
00:54:53.853 --> 00:54:55.882
(He fillets the eel.)

1368
00:54:55.883 --> 00:54:58.583
(However, Jong Hyuk kept it thick.)

1369
00:54:59.793 --> 00:55:02.891
(Chief Byung Man cooks over a
low heat for a long time.)

1370
00:55:02.892 --> 00:55:05.623
(They cooked the eel over a
high heat for a short time.)

1371
00:55:06.862 --> 00:55:09.362
(That's why some parts are bloody.)

1372
00:55:09.903 --> 00:55:11.662
Don't eat the head.

1373
00:55:12.032 --> 00:55:13.772
You can't eat this part either.

1374
00:55:13.773 --> 00:55:14.801
(You can't eat this part either.)

1375
00:55:14.802 --> 00:55:16.741
Don't eat the head.

1376
00:55:16.742 --> 00:55:19.241
The middle part is uncooked.

1377
00:55:19.242 --> 00:55:20.341
Eat the outside.

1378
00:55:20.342 --> 00:55:21.342
(What is there to eat?)

1379
00:55:21.343 --> 00:55:22.712
(He searches for meat
that has been cooked.)

1380
00:55:22.713 --> 00:55:25.181
- It's very tasty.
- This piece is cooked nicely.

1381
00:55:25.182 --> 00:55:26.781
(I think this piece is cooked.)

1382
00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:28.452
(Eating)

1383
00:55:28.512 --> 00:55:30.853
It's not cooked thoroughly.

1384
00:55:32.923 --> 00:55:35.023
(Here and there, )

1385
00:55:35.193 --> 00:55:39.423
(the members spit out eel.)

1386
00:55:40.392 --> 00:55:42.861
I will eat the skin. It's edible, right?

1387
00:55:42.862 --> 00:55:45.632
(They only have burnt skin.)

1388
00:55:45.633 --> 00:55:47.833
(It's hard to eat an eel.)

1389
00:55:49.903 --> 00:55:52.002
We should take the rest of it to Byung Man.

1390
00:55:52.003 --> 00:55:53.042
(Chief Byung Man would know what to do.)

1391
00:55:53.043 --> 00:55:54.173
Shall we cook it a bit more?

1392
00:55:54.742 --> 00:55:57.342
We should cook it more. The
heat didn't reach the inside.

1393
00:55:57.983 --> 00:56:00.882
We could wrap it with a banana
leaf and put it in the fire.

1394
00:56:00.883 --> 00:56:03.051
- This one?
- Yes.

1395
00:56:03.052 --> 00:56:04.451
(At that moment, a moth attacks.)

1396
00:56:04.452 --> 00:56:08.091
Insects attack in this difficult situation.

1397
00:56:08.092 --> 00:56:11.693
It's hard to have a meal
without Chief Byung Man.

1398
00:56:12.492 --> 00:56:15.463
They decide to do their best
to save the rest of the eel.

1399
00:56:16.603 --> 00:56:18.683
It would have been nice to
share it with the others.

1400
00:56:18.963 --> 00:56:21.102
What did the other members eat?

1401
00:56:21.103 --> 00:56:22.633
(How is Dindin's Tribe doing?)

1402
00:56:23.202 --> 00:56:24.742
I am back.

1403
00:56:25.673 --> 00:56:27.473
(They welcome her with
their facial muscles.)

1404
00:56:27.972 --> 00:56:29.071
Look at these.

1405
00:56:29.072 --> 00:56:30.213
(Da Rae is the best.)

1406
00:56:30.383 --> 00:56:33.011
How did you catch this?

1407
00:56:33.012 --> 00:56:34.411
(There are a sea bream Da Rae caught
and other fish from the trap.)

1408
00:56:34.412 --> 00:56:36.083
Is it a sea bream?

1409
00:56:36.222 --> 00:56:37.382
Is it a sea bream?

1410
00:56:37.383 --> 00:56:39.181
- Isn't it a sea bream?
- How did you catch that?

1411
00:56:39.182 --> 00:56:40.451
You are cool.

1412
00:56:40.452 --> 00:56:43.091
- Da Rae, warm up your body.
- Warm up your body.

1413
00:56:43.092 --> 00:56:44.622
(They take Da Rae towards the fire.)

1414
00:56:44.623 --> 00:56:46.761
- Will we eat maeuntang today?
- What?

1415
00:56:46.762 --> 00:56:48.292
Will we eat maeuntang today?

1416
00:56:48.293 --> 00:56:49.962
She is so cool.

1417
00:56:49.963 --> 00:56:52.761
She caught these fish in
the coolest way and asked,

1418
00:56:52.762 --> 00:56:54.403
"Will we eat maeuntang today?"

1419
00:56:55.032 --> 00:56:56.443
(Mischievous)

1420
00:56:57.202 --> 00:56:58.942
- She is so cute.
- Hey.

1421
00:56:58.943 --> 00:57:02.512
Will we be able to put fish in this pot?

1422
00:57:02.842 --> 00:57:05.282
Will we be able to put fish in this pot?

1423
00:57:05.713 --> 00:57:07.653
(The pot is much smaller.)

1424
00:57:09.313 --> 00:57:10.352
- Let's grill the fish.
- Let's grill the fish.

1425
00:57:10.353 --> 00:57:11.853
Let's skewer and grill them.

1426
00:57:12.923 --> 00:57:14.752
Da Rae is the best. She did it.

1427
00:57:14.753 --> 00:57:17.063
- Da Rae is a gold medalist.
- She is.

1428
00:57:17.523 --> 00:57:19.023
Da Rae is our mom.

1429
00:57:19.092 --> 00:57:21.732
- Let's call her mom.
- Okay. Mom.

1430
00:57:21.733 --> 00:57:24.333
- Thank goodness we have Da Rae.
- Seriously.

1431
00:57:25.032 --> 00:57:26.273
Can you do it?

1432
00:57:26.773 --> 00:57:28.733
- I can do it.
- Are you sure you can do it?

1433
00:57:29.333 --> 00:57:31.043
(She sticks the knife in.)

1434
00:57:32.603 --> 00:57:33.942
(They are shocked by her knife skills.)

1435
00:57:33.943 --> 00:57:35.472
Da Rae, watch your hand.

1436
00:57:36.443 --> 00:57:37.882
(Without a flinch, )

1437
00:57:37.883 --> 00:57:39.482
(she begins to clean the fish.)

1438
00:57:39.483 --> 00:57:40.612
When you hold the knife...

1439
00:57:41.612 --> 00:57:43.483
(The two kindergartners begin to meddle.)

1440
00:57:44.452 --> 00:57:45.822
(She ignores them.)

1441
00:57:47.153 --> 00:57:48.652
That's right. You need
to take out that part.

1442
00:57:48.653 --> 00:57:50.761
Don't lay it flat.

1443
00:57:50.762 --> 00:57:51.962
- Do it like this.
- Do it the other way.

1444
00:57:51.963 --> 00:57:54.092
- That's how you do it.
- Use the back of the knife.

1445
00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:56.301
You don't have to do that.

1446
00:57:56.302 --> 00:57:57.332
(For goodness' sake.)

1447
00:57:57.333 --> 00:58:00.273
You should do it.

1448
00:58:00.833 --> 00:58:01.932
For goodness' sake.

1449
00:58:02.333 --> 00:58:05.302
- That's it.
- This woman has skills.

1450
00:58:05.472 --> 00:58:07.011
- She's good.
- Her restaurant is popular.

1451
00:58:07.012 --> 00:58:08.052
It's a popular restaurant.

1452
00:58:08.242 --> 00:58:10.681
- I heard you're a gold medalist.
- Do it again after you flip it.

1453
00:58:10.682 --> 00:58:12.582
Gosh, the chef of this
restaurant is so thorough.

1454
00:58:12.583 --> 00:58:14.951
Exactly. Her knife skills are great.

1455
00:58:14.952 --> 00:58:15.952
They are perfect.

1456
00:58:16.423 --> 00:58:18.052
Please clean the small ones.

1457
00:58:18.883 --> 00:58:20.991
I can do them. Da Rae, let me.

1458
00:58:20.992 --> 00:58:22.221
- Okay.
- I can do them.

1459
00:58:22.222 --> 00:58:23.222
Okay. Go ahead.

1460
00:58:23.623 --> 00:58:25.261
(He's the biggest coward
in the world though.)

1461
00:58:25.262 --> 00:58:26.292
I can smell the raw fish.

1462
00:58:26.293 --> 00:58:27.692
(He removes its head as he chops it off.)

1463
00:58:27.693 --> 00:58:30.053
- You should remove the intestines.
- I know that. Hold on.

1464
00:58:32.133 --> 00:58:34.173
- You're good, Roy.
- You're good.

1465
00:58:34.273 --> 00:58:35.913
You were just pretending to be bad at it.

1466
00:58:36.503 --> 00:58:38.019
(He's trying to manage while
clenching his teeth.)

1467
00:58:38.043 --> 00:58:39.071
There you go.

1468
00:58:39.072 --> 00:58:40.672
- You're amazing.
- Good thing you volunteered.

1469
00:58:40.673 --> 00:58:42.511
- You're so good.
- You're incredible.

1470
00:58:42.512 --> 00:58:45.181
Wait. This is Sangwoo Seafood
Restaurant, isn't it?

1471
00:58:45.182 --> 00:58:46.582
(Sangwoo Seafood Restaurant)

1472
00:58:46.583 --> 00:58:47.983
This is Sangwoo Seafood Restaurant.

1473
00:58:48.112 --> 00:58:49.411
- Isn't that one better?
- Am I done?

1474
00:58:49.412 --> 00:58:50.781
Can you see nothing is in it?

1475
00:58:50.782 --> 00:58:51.951
(The seafood market is dying to scout him.)

1476
00:58:51.952 --> 00:58:53.952
- You're good.
- Well done. You should've done it.

1477
00:58:54.423 --> 00:58:56.221
This is the first time cleaning a fish.

1478
00:58:56.222 --> 00:58:57.222
- Really?
- Yes.

1479
00:58:57.223 --> 00:58:58.892
- Why are you so good?
- I'm done.

1480
00:58:59.092 --> 00:59:00.232
- Are you done?
- Let's go.

1481
00:59:00.233 --> 00:59:02.473
(He has become stronger than
the beginning of the show.)

1482
00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:04.903
Gosh, Sang Woo is amazing.

1483
00:59:05.362 --> 00:59:06.733
I think we should start cooking.

1484
00:59:07.472 --> 00:59:08.472
Shall we begin?

1485
00:59:09.072 --> 00:59:10.112
Give me the chili peppers.

1486
00:59:10.373 --> 00:59:11.373
Here you go.

1487
00:59:12.673 --> 00:59:15.511
What if we can only taste
the mango from the fish?

1488
00:59:15.512 --> 00:59:16.512
That works too.

1489
00:59:16.943 --> 00:59:18.488
(He has overcome his fear of sea creature.)

1490
00:59:18.512 --> 00:59:20.272
This is my first time
doing this in my life.

1491
00:59:20.753 --> 00:59:22.612
Hey, we're smoking it over the fire.

1492
00:59:23.023 --> 00:59:24.583
Okay. Let's get it.

1493
00:59:25.282 --> 00:59:27.492
- Please make it tasty.
- Okay.

1494
00:59:28.353 --> 00:59:30.123
(Their teamwork is perfect.)

1495
00:59:31.023 --> 00:59:33.362
- I'll make the small ones crispy.
- Okay.

1496
00:59:33.662 --> 00:59:35.162
I'll cook longer for the small ones.

1497
00:59:36.403 --> 00:59:37.661
- This is the best.
- I agree.

1498
00:59:37.662 --> 00:59:38.732
(They smell...)

1499
00:59:38.733 --> 00:59:40.232
(the roasting smell of fish over the fire.)

1500
00:59:40.233 --> 00:59:43.071
Gosh, this is nice. I can't believe
this is actually happening to us.

1501
00:59:43.072 --> 00:59:44.301
(Feeling overwhelmed)

1502
00:59:44.302 --> 00:59:46.873
- I'm so happy.
- Da Rae, this is all thanks to you.

1503
00:59:46.912 --> 00:59:48.213
(But where is Roy?)

1504
00:59:49.313 --> 00:59:50.642
Nice.

1505
00:59:51.142 --> 00:59:53.653
Play Da Rae's song request.

1506
00:59:54.412 --> 00:59:55.982
(He's tuning the guitar as if
he's loosening his fingers.)

1507
00:59:55.983 --> 00:59:59.383
It's so romantic. We're listening
to this as we cook the fish...

1508
00:59:59.653 --> 01:00:01.293
with the members of our Tribe.

1509
01:00:02.492 --> 01:00:03.592
Which song should I sing?

1510
01:00:04.193 --> 01:00:05.262
Song you can sing well.

1511
01:00:05.992 --> 01:00:07.293
Is this "Super Star K"?

1512
01:00:07.793 --> 01:00:08.793
What should I do?

1513
01:00:09.162 --> 01:00:10.932
Pretend that you are back on the show.

1514
01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.953
A song that goes well with the vibe.
Can you sing "Yeosu Night Sea"?

1515
01:00:14.202 --> 01:00:15.333
"Yeosu Night Sea".

1516
01:00:16.972 --> 01:00:20.642
(Fiji night sea)

1517
01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:25.482
(He's singing as he's
lost in the atmosphere.)

1518
01:00:25.483 --> 01:00:27.653
(Feeling awkward)

1519
01:00:29.313 --> 01:00:32.181
(But they're already
engrossed in his song.)

1520
01:00:32.182 --> 01:00:33.951
(I make a call)

1521
01:00:33.952 --> 01:00:35.032
It's an international call.

1522
01:00:35.222 --> 01:00:37.192
(I ask what you're doing)

1523
01:00:37.193 --> 01:00:38.293
Data roaming.

1524
01:00:39.322 --> 01:00:43.002
(I'm at Fiji night sea)

1525
01:00:43.003 --> 01:00:44.063
Roy.

1526
01:00:44.202 --> 01:00:47.373
(Fiji night sea)

1527
01:00:48.673 --> 01:00:51.141
(Near a warming bonfire, )

1528
01:00:51.142 --> 01:00:53.212
(with the smell of their
food getting cooked, )

1529
01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:58.742
(they're enjoying the
beautiful voice of Roy.)

1530
01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:02.353
What is this?

1531
01:01:03.423 --> 01:01:05.181
- That's enough.
- What?

1532
01:01:05.182 --> 01:01:07.592
- That's enough. Sing another one.
- That was great.

1533
01:01:07.653 --> 01:01:08.968
- It was good.
- Sing one of your songs.

1534
01:01:08.992 --> 01:01:10.162
Sing your song.

1535
01:01:10.523 --> 01:01:11.692
Sing yours.

1536
01:01:11.693 --> 01:01:13.792
("Spring, Spring, Spring" by Roy)

1537
01:01:13.793 --> 01:01:16.301
(You still smell)

1538
01:01:16.302 --> 01:01:18.462
(like the first day we met)

1539
01:01:18.463 --> 01:01:19.463
You should turn it.

1540
01:01:19.464 --> 01:01:21.402
(The first day we met)

1541
01:01:21.403 --> 01:01:24.173
(We were awkward and
sloppy in the beginning.)

1542
01:01:24.503 --> 01:01:26.772
(Due to the harsh environment
and lack of experience, )

1543
01:01:26.773 --> 01:01:29.142
(it wasn't an easy survival.)

1544
01:01:29.512 --> 01:01:34.411
(In no time, we began to
improve little by little.)

1545
01:01:34.412 --> 01:01:38.422
(The reason I could be here despite
my lack of experience was...)

1546
01:01:38.423 --> 01:01:43.693
(you guys who joined me on this journey.)

1547
01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:49.193
(Spring also comes to the jungle.)

1548
01:01:50.202 --> 01:01:53.272
(He whistles to heighten the live show.)

1549
01:01:53.273 --> 01:01:54.273
Gosh, that's so mellow.

1550
01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:58.273
I got the goose bumps. You can't
see since my sleeves are long.

1551
01:01:58.302 --> 01:01:59.742
Gosh, that was a great song.

1552
01:02:02.373 --> 01:02:03.383
I'm satisfied.

1553
01:02:03.742 --> 01:02:05.488
- Your song was very satisfying.
- That was nice.

1554
01:02:05.512 --> 01:02:08.583
I feel sorry for you. I've
looked down on you a lot here.

1555
01:02:09.012 --> 01:02:11.051
- Apologize.
- I should. I...

1556
01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:12.281
(While they sang and enjoyed the moment, )

1557
01:02:12.282 --> 01:02:13.391
(the sea bream is cooked
to a golden brown.)

1558
01:02:13.392 --> 01:02:15.452
I've never seen the fish dripping with oil.

1559
01:02:16.392 --> 01:02:17.392
That looks good.

1560
01:02:19.293 --> 01:02:20.661
(Dindin tastes the appetizer first.)

1561
01:02:20.662 --> 01:02:21.693
Watch out for the bones.

1562
01:02:23.563 --> 01:02:24.563
(Pounding)

1563
01:02:27.833 --> 01:02:28.993
- Is it good?
- Is it cooked?

1564
01:02:29.302 --> 01:02:30.302
Really?

1565
01:02:30.303 --> 01:02:31.373
(Bursting into laughter)

1566
01:02:32.202 --> 01:02:34.342
This is so good. It's very tasty.

1567
01:02:34.572 --> 01:02:35.813
Is it that good?

1568
01:02:36.173 --> 01:02:38.181
- Is it delicious?
- Hey.

1569
01:02:38.182 --> 01:02:40.382
I've never tasted anything like this.

1570
01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:41.383
(It's a familiar taste.)

1571
01:02:43.253 --> 01:02:44.253
Isn't it good?

1572
01:02:44.423 --> 01:02:46.923
- It's like meat. It's a fish.
- This is so good.

1573
01:02:47.293 --> 01:02:51.292
(Roy takes a bite who had a long day.)

1574
01:02:51.293 --> 01:02:52.892
Hey, this is the tastiest fish ever.

1575
01:02:54.293 --> 01:02:56.173
This tastes just like the
fish we eat in Seoul.

1576
01:02:56.702 --> 01:02:57.761
Isn't it good?

1577
01:02:57.762 --> 01:02:59.442
(He feels like giving a standing ovation.)

1578
01:03:00.032 --> 01:03:01.972
It's good. It's really tasty.

1579
01:03:02.833 --> 01:03:04.649
- I might cry.
- It tastes like a mackerel pike.

1580
01:03:04.673 --> 01:03:06.411
It's just like...

1581
01:03:06.412 --> 01:03:09.471
the roasted fish moms feed us
with soy sauce on the side...

1582
01:03:09.472 --> 01:03:11.612
along with white rice and kimchi.

1583
01:03:12.483 --> 01:03:13.758
- This is the best.
- Doesn't this look amazing?

1584
01:03:13.782 --> 01:03:15.382
- I can't wait.
- This looks tasty.

1585
01:03:15.383 --> 01:03:17.022
- It does. Okay.
- Have a taste.

1586
01:03:17.023 --> 01:03:18.681
Chief, I have the chopsticks.

1587
01:03:18.682 --> 01:03:19.822
Really?

1588
01:03:21.293 --> 01:03:22.891
(He takes a piece of milky
chunk of the fish.)

1589
01:03:22.892 --> 01:03:25.022
He's giving you the best part.

1590
01:03:25.023 --> 01:03:28.292
(Dindin who went through a lot
physically and mentally eats first.)

1591
01:03:28.293 --> 01:03:29.293
How is it?

1592
01:03:30.302 --> 01:03:31.861
Is it good? Is it?

1593
01:03:31.862 --> 01:03:33.349
(They get the thrill just watching him.)

1594
01:03:33.373 --> 01:03:35.273
- Hey, this is delicious.
- Really?

1595
01:03:35.873 --> 01:03:37.502
- I'm serious.
- Let's try it.

1596
01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:40.042
This is different from
the fish we eat at home.

1597
01:03:40.043 --> 01:03:41.511
It looks like a fish from
a Japanese restaurant.

1598
01:03:41.512 --> 01:03:42.552
- Right.
- Aren't I right?

1599
01:03:43.043 --> 01:03:45.082
It tastes like the fish
from a Japanese restaurant.

1600
01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.853
(He feeds Da Rae, the
heroine of the day, next.)

1601
01:03:48.313 --> 01:03:49.953
- That was a bit strong.
- This is tasty.

1602
01:03:51.253 --> 01:03:53.123
This is so juicy.

1603
01:03:53.753 --> 01:03:54.852
(Savoring it)

1604
01:03:54.853 --> 01:03:56.392
This is good. It really is.

1605
01:03:57.423 --> 01:03:58.861
(Roy has learned to eat the fish...)

1606
01:03:58.862 --> 01:04:00.031
(taking the bone apart.)

1607
01:04:00.032 --> 01:04:01.733
Remove the bones.

1608
01:04:02.333 --> 01:04:03.402
(The bones are about to
pierce into his gums.)

1609
01:04:03.403 --> 01:04:04.503
Get rid of the bones first.

1610
01:04:06.373 --> 01:04:07.472
This is so greasy!

1611
01:04:07.673 --> 01:04:08.903
"This is so greasy"?

1612
01:04:09.133 --> 01:04:11.043
This is just like that fish.

1613
01:04:11.503 --> 01:04:13.713
You know the grilled toothfish?

1614
01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:16.483
We got to eat it thanks to Da Rae.

1615
01:04:17.412 --> 01:04:18.583
What a luxury we're enjoying.

1616
01:04:19.142 --> 01:04:21.353
This is an oily fish.

1617
01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:24.051
- But this is the tastiest food...
- This is so good.

1618
01:04:24.052 --> 01:04:25.622
I've had in the jungle. I'm serious.

1619
01:04:25.623 --> 01:04:26.853
- I agree.
- Right?

1620
01:04:27.253 --> 01:04:28.253
It's good.

1621
01:04:28.254 --> 01:04:29.891
(Now that he's eating off the stick...)

1622
01:04:29.892 --> 01:04:30.892
You look cool.

1623
01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:34.032
Try to look cool while eating it.

1624
01:04:35.293 --> 01:04:36.403
That's it.

1625
01:04:37.362 --> 01:04:38.463
There you go.

1626
01:04:39.403 --> 01:04:40.472
Hey, you might drop it.

1627
01:04:43.472 --> 01:04:44.842
Pretend it's hot.

1628
01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:48.572
(The roof of my mouth is going
crazy as it's on fire!)

1629
01:04:49.642 --> 01:04:51.043
(Reporting a fire)

1630
01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:54.383
This guy is a genius.

1631
01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:56.052
I can tell that he's a genius.

1632
01:04:56.112 --> 01:04:57.181
Can you pretend it's cold?

1633
01:04:57.182 --> 01:04:58.852
(Command: Eating cold food)

1634
01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.922
(The coldness freezes his
teeth to his brain.)

1635
01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:03.392
(He's having a heart attack.)

1636
01:05:03.992 --> 01:05:05.523
Pretend that it's sour.

1637
01:05:06.162 --> 01:05:08.132
(Command: Eating sour food)

1638
01:05:08.133 --> 01:05:10.103
(Feeling the tingling sensation)

1639
01:05:10.633 --> 01:05:12.232
He just looks ugly, no?

1640
01:05:12.233 --> 01:05:14.571
- No, when it's sour...
- This is it.

1641
01:05:14.572 --> 01:05:17.052
I've observed people, and this
is what they do when it's sour.

1642
01:05:17.773 --> 01:05:18.773
"Try it."

1643
01:05:18.774 --> 01:05:20.141
(Tossing to the person next to him)

1644
01:05:20.142 --> 01:05:21.142
(His acting skills are at another level.)

1645
01:05:21.143 --> 01:05:22.272
"Try this."
- We acted exactly the same.

1646
01:05:22.273 --> 01:05:24.393
- We did the same thing.
- That's what everyone does.

1647
01:05:25.112 --> 01:05:26.781
"Hey, this is so sour. Try it."

1648
01:05:26.782 --> 01:05:29.459
- Everyone does this all the time.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1649
01:05:29.483 --> 01:05:33.123
What about Team Captain who was
waiting the eels to be cooked more?

1650
01:05:33.392 --> 01:05:35.293
Hey, look. It fell.

1651
01:05:35.693 --> 01:05:37.122
Hold on. It fell.

1652
01:05:37.123 --> 01:05:38.692
(They try to rescue the eels in a hurry.)

1653
01:05:38.693 --> 01:05:40.032
It's completely burned.

1654
01:05:40.793 --> 01:05:42.492
They can't eat a chunk of charcoals.

1655
01:05:43.262 --> 01:05:46.273
They get ready for bed as they
put behind their disappointment.

1656
01:05:46.932 --> 01:05:50.373
(It's time for them to go to sleep.)

1657
01:05:50.503 --> 01:05:53.142
(Next morning)

1658
01:05:53.412 --> 01:05:56.682
(The sun is rising above the
fog with full of energy.)

1659
01:05:57.782 --> 01:06:01.153
Jong Hyuk, what are you
doing early in the morning?

1660
01:06:03.853 --> 01:06:06.523
If we had this when we
went to fish yesterday,

1661
01:06:07.523 --> 01:06:09.523
we could've caught them like this.

1662
01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:13.232
(He made the fishing net to catch
shrimps he didn't catch yesterday.)

1663
01:06:13.233 --> 01:06:14.292
It all depends on the tools.

1664
01:06:14.293 --> 01:06:16.232
(I'm going to catch them today
with the improved tool.)

1665
01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:17.261
Okay.

1666
01:06:17.262 --> 01:06:18.962
(We didn't even get to eat
the eels last night.)

1667
01:06:18.963 --> 01:06:20.203
I see it. It's here. It's here.

1668
01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:25.672
(He swings with the net for the
first time to catch shrimps.)

1669
01:06:25.673 --> 01:06:26.673
I can't see after the swing.

1670
01:06:26.674 --> 01:06:29.074
(The muddy water makes it hard
for him to spot the shrimps.)

1671
01:06:29.213 --> 01:06:31.181
(He's still frustrated.)

1672
01:06:31.182 --> 01:06:32.741
(Staggering)

1673
01:06:32.742 --> 01:06:35.753
(He gets nervous as time passes by more.)

1674
01:06:37.182 --> 01:06:38.462
I have a bad feeling about this.

1675
01:06:39.052 --> 01:06:42.721
(Jong Hyuk was searching
for food for a while.)

1676
01:06:42.722 --> 01:06:43.892
(What?)

1677
01:06:46.592 --> 01:06:48.333
Gosh. Oh, my!

1678
01:06:50.733 --> 01:06:52.971
(There's a hole!)

1679
01:06:52.972 --> 01:06:56.642
(His bad hunch turned out to be true.)

1680
01:06:56.943 --> 01:06:58.641
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

1681
01:06:58.642 --> 01:07:00.411
(What is happening? I can't
even catch shrimps.)

1682
01:07:00.412 --> 01:07:02.072
The net is completely ripped.

1683
01:07:03.513 --> 01:07:05.273
Do you have anything I
can sew this up with?

1684
01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:08.812
- Like threads?
- Why would we have threads?

1685
01:07:08.883 --> 01:07:10.452
Or do you have duct tapes?

1686
01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:12.183
What about Band-Aids?

1687
01:07:12.522 --> 01:07:14.393
Band-Aids? Hold on.

1688
01:07:14.492 --> 01:07:15.492
Do you have them?

1689
01:07:15.992 --> 01:07:17.963
Wait a second. You really have them?

1690
01:07:19.423 --> 01:07:20.492
No way.

1691
01:07:20.992 --> 01:07:23.032
People get hurt easily here.

1692
01:07:23.402 --> 01:07:24.463
So we keep them with us.

1693
01:07:24.732 --> 01:07:25.963
But are they really Band-Aids?

1694
01:07:26.803 --> 01:07:28.633
(Goodness, with this, I can...)

1695
01:07:29.942 --> 01:07:31.043
I can tie this up.

1696
01:07:31.742 --> 01:07:33.372
(Surgeon Oh is leading
the surgery himself.)

1697
01:07:33.373 --> 01:07:35.012
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1698
01:07:35.013 --> 01:07:36.512
(He's suturing the fishing
net with complete focus.)

1699
01:07:36.513 --> 01:07:38.782
The shrimps can't be infected by germs.

1700
01:07:39.583 --> 01:07:40.782
We are going to eat them.

1701
01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:42.782
You're good at it.

1702
01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:45.222
Just in case...

1703
01:07:45.223 --> 01:07:47.691
(Fishing net, you can get through this!)

1704
01:07:47.692 --> 01:07:49.992
(The surgery is over.)

1705
01:07:50.393 --> 01:07:51.491
This is amazing.

1706
01:07:51.492 --> 01:07:54.263
(The patient is in good condition.)

1707
01:07:54.393 --> 01:07:55.432
I sew up the hole.

1708
01:07:55.433 --> 01:07:58.503
(With just a Band-Aid, the
fishing net has revived.)

1709
01:08:01.032 --> 01:08:02.032
(He begins his search again.)

1710
01:08:02.033 --> 01:08:03.843
I bet they are somewhere over here.

1711
01:08:07.572 --> 01:08:09.643
It's here. It's really huge.

1712
01:08:10.343 --> 01:08:12.742
Here. Do you see it?

1713
01:08:13.612 --> 01:08:14.811
It's huge.

1714
01:08:14.812 --> 01:08:16.622
(He picks his target.)

1715
01:08:16.623 --> 01:08:18.682
Here I go.

1716
01:08:18.683 --> 01:08:19.722
I caught it.

1717
01:08:19.723 --> 01:08:21.723
(The shrimp goes in.)

1718
01:08:23.093 --> 01:08:26.061
(He gets it in one shot
with his repaired net.)

1719
01:08:26.062 --> 01:08:28.661
(He finally gets 1 after many trials.)

1720
01:08:28.662 --> 01:08:29.803
I caught it.

1721
01:08:31.833 --> 01:08:32.972
It's huge.

1722
01:08:32.973 --> 01:08:34.372
(It's quite big.)

1723
01:08:34.373 --> 01:08:36.071
(Flapping)

1724
01:08:36.072 --> 01:08:38.173
(It's very fresh.)

1725
01:08:38.742 --> 01:08:39.873
It's really huge.

1726
01:08:41.343 --> 01:08:43.742
(This is why you come to the jungle.)

1727
01:08:44.242 --> 01:08:47.583
Look at the color. My gosh.

1728
01:08:50.452 --> 01:08:51.951
There it is.

1729
01:08:51.952 --> 01:08:52.952
(He continues searching.)

1730
01:08:52.953 --> 01:08:55.553
(He finds another one.)

1731
01:08:56.923 --> 01:08:57.991
Okay.

1732
01:08:57.992 --> 01:09:00.332
(It goes into the net.)

1733
01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:01.333
Okay.

1734
01:09:01.334 --> 01:09:04.433
(He catches two shrimps with his net.)

1735
01:09:06.902 --> 01:09:07.973
This is huge.

1736
01:09:09.202 --> 01:09:12.272
While catching shrimps, he
reaches the gigantic fall.

1737
01:09:12.973 --> 01:09:15.441
This is Jong Hyuk's first time here.

1738
01:09:15.442 --> 01:09:17.843
It's my first time going under a fall.

1739
01:09:19.083 --> 01:09:22.682
I've only seen artificial falls before.

1740
01:09:22.683 --> 01:09:23.752
It's in Hwayang.

1741
01:09:23.753 --> 01:09:26.723
(He goes towards the 40m waterfall.)

1742
01:09:27.793 --> 01:09:32.521
(He spreads his arms
wide and hugs the fall.)

1743
01:09:32.522 --> 01:09:35.092
(He feels it with his whole body.)

1744
01:09:35.093 --> 01:09:38.701
(He gets through it and
enters a new space-time.)

1745
01:09:38.702 --> 01:09:42.333
I am a nature man!

1746
01:09:43.303 --> 01:09:46.043
(I am a nature man.)

1747
01:09:47.942 --> 01:09:50.183
Let's go, The Law of Jungle!

1748
01:09:51.183 --> 01:09:54.282
(He gets back to the
world after recharging.)

1749
01:09:54.553 --> 01:10:01.021
(It's like a scene from a movie
under the gushing waterfall.)

1750
01:10:01.022 --> 01:10:03.322
(I am a movie star.)

1751
01:10:06.362 --> 01:10:09.901
(He dances with his shoulders.)

1752
01:10:09.902 --> 01:10:11.532
I want to build a house and live here.

1753
01:10:13.003 --> 01:10:15.502
I can do this every morning.

1754
01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.423
(That's why you keep coming
back to the jungle.)

1755
01:10:19.343 --> 01:10:20.473
Let's get it.

1756
01:10:21.013 --> 01:10:22.142
(Is Team Dindin's survival like
a scene from a movie too?)

1757
01:10:22.143 --> 01:10:23.281
We are here.

1758
01:10:23.282 --> 01:10:25.212
(Is Team Dindin's survival like
a scene from a movie too?)

1759
01:10:25.213 --> 01:10:26.281
(His eyes open wide.)

1760
01:10:26.282 --> 01:10:27.412
What's this?

1761
01:10:28.513 --> 01:10:31.152
- What's this?
- This is almost like...

1762
01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:32.682
Isn't it dirty water?

1763
01:10:32.683 --> 01:10:33.691
(They're speechless.)

1764
01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:34.952
Isn't this a movie set?

1765
01:10:38.062 --> 01:10:43.102
(It's the mystic Sawa-I-Lau
Caves from "The Blue Lagoon".)

1766
01:10:44.433 --> 01:10:48.172
(The mysterious cave
embraces the emerald sea.)

1767
01:10:48.173 --> 01:10:49.771
- What's this?
- Do you see that on the wall?

1768
01:10:49.772 --> 01:10:50.941
(It's in front of their eyes.)

1769
01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:53.741
It's like somebody shaped
it out of concrete.

1770
01:10:53.742 --> 01:10:55.472
(This cave is the final spot
the characters survived in.)

1771
01:10:55.473 --> 01:10:57.012
This is where they had love.

1772
01:10:57.013 --> 01:10:58.183
I know that scene.

1773
01:10:58.812 --> 01:11:01.152
- Do you?
- Let's go down.

1774
01:11:01.753 --> 01:11:02.753
Can we go in the water?

1775
01:11:02.754 --> 01:11:04.352
(They get in the water.)

1776
01:11:06.652 --> 01:11:11.463
(The gold medalist is like
a fish in the water.)

1777
01:11:14.463 --> 01:11:16.602
It was Mother Nature.

1778
01:11:16.933 --> 01:11:18.202
It felt strange.

1779
01:11:19.572 --> 01:11:23.772
(She becomes one with the
sea and swims freely.)

1780
01:11:26.572 --> 01:11:30.111
I could have never imagined
that this was made naturally.

1781
01:11:30.112 --> 01:11:31.242
That's how beautiful it was.

1782
01:11:33.213 --> 01:11:35.312
If I come here...

1783
01:11:35.513 --> 01:11:38.382
with the woman I love,
with nobody else here,

1784
01:11:38.383 --> 01:11:41.452
it would be the most beautiful
and happiest thing ever.

1785
01:11:42.022 --> 01:11:43.592
It's beautiful up here too.

1786
01:11:43.593 --> 01:11:45.353
(She looks up after
swimming for some time.)

1787
01:11:47.732 --> 01:11:52.332
(Everything looks unreal.)

1788
01:11:52.333 --> 01:11:57.242
(It's surreal to see a
cave on top of the sea.)

1789
01:12:00.373 --> 01:12:04.411
(This is where Brooke Shields swam.)

1790
01:12:04.412 --> 01:12:07.713
(Da Rae roams through
Fiji's Mother Nature.)

1791
01:12:08.812 --> 01:12:10.782
Let's dive.

1792
01:12:10.982 --> 01:12:13.191
- Let's dive.
- Let's try.

1793
01:12:13.192 --> 01:12:14.253
We are allowed.

1794
01:12:14.753 --> 01:12:18.691
(Dindin climbs the cliff right away.)

1795
01:12:18.692 --> 01:12:19.992
Good job, Chief.

1796
01:12:20.463 --> 01:12:23.263
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1797
01:12:23.702 --> 01:12:24.702
Jump!

1798
01:12:27.102 --> 01:12:30.842
(This is the perfect ending
to surviving like a movie.)

1799
01:12:30.843 --> 01:12:33.311
With Chief Dindin's courageous dive,

1800
01:12:33.312 --> 01:12:36.043
their team concludes the survival.

1801
01:12:36.912 --> 01:12:37.912
And...

1802
01:12:38.683 --> 01:12:41.212
Team Sung Hoon starts their last feast...

1803
01:12:41.213 --> 01:12:42.952
with the shrimps Jong Hyuk caught.

1804
01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:44.981
I should have caught four.

1805
01:12:44.982 --> 01:12:47.852
Without Chief Byung Man,
they had a hard time...

1806
01:12:48.623 --> 01:12:51.061
but with the veteran members'
experience and the rookies' energy,

1807
01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:52.892
they ended their survival safely.

1808
01:12:52.893 --> 01:12:53.962
(They overcame with the veterans'
experience and the rookies' energy.)

1809
01:12:53.963 --> 01:12:56.633
Everybody, you did very well.

1810
01:12:57.562 --> 01:12:59.531
- Your survival...
- Is finished!

1811
01:12:59.532 --> 01:13:01.973
(They finally finish their
survival without the Chief.)

1812
01:13:04.873 --> 01:13:05.873
We did it.

1813
01:13:06.343 --> 01:13:07.412
(Next week)

1814
01:13:08.143 --> 01:13:12.582
(Taveuni Island is like an
island where the spirits walk.)

thrilling experience.)

1818
01:13:23.293 --> 01:13:25.822

1821
01:13:30.702 --> 01:13:32.133
(Jeong Jin Woon, and Lee Moon Sik.)

1822
01:13:32.362 --> 01:13:34.349
(Song Yun Hyeong of iKON
is a big fan of the show.)

1823
