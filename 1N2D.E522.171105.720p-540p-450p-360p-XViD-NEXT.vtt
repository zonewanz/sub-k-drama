00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.689
(One Night Two Days)

2
00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.445
(Four years ago)

3
00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:10.615
(These six separate streams...)

4
00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:13.455
(united for the first time.)

5
00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.225
(As we look back,)

6
00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:19.126
(there were only joyous memories.)

7
00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.225
(For Kim Joo Hyuck, our brother, our family)

8
00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.866
(One Night Two Days)

9
00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.505
- Hi, Defconn. - Joo Hyuck.

10
00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:35.105
- Yes? - What are you up to?

11
00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:36.346
I'm home.

12
00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:37.775
(The man at his home is...)

13
00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:39.546
(Kim Joo Hyuck.)

14
00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:40.946
Tell him to stay there.

15
00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:42.916
Stay there, all right?

16
00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:46.285
- I have to get going. - No, stay there.

17
00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.486
- Don't go. - Stay home.

18
00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:49.885
- We'll call you soon. - I have to go.

19
00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:50.985
Go where?

20
00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:53.284
There's an interview for my new movie.

21
00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:55.495
- We'll come to you then. - Where are you?

22
00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:58.095
Are you filming right now?

23
00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:01.795
We are. We wanted to wish you a happy New Year.

24
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.494
- I have to be out by 11. - Okay.

25
00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:05.905
- We'll see you at 11. - Got it.

26
00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:06.935
Over there.

27
00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:08.875
Where's Joo Hyuck?

28
00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:13.105
(They're here to see their big brother.)

29
00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.545
What are you wearing?

30
00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:17.315
What is this? Why are you dressed in that?

31
00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:20.444
My gosh.

32
00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.914
- What's wrong? - What is this?

33
00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.925
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year!

34
00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.955
- Unbelievable. - We loved your...

35
00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.955
New Year's interview.

36
00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:35.125
We read how you see the show every week.

37
00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.394
It's cold outside. Are you warm enough?

38
00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:40.705
See? We have to gather every year.

39
00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:43.105
The moment I saw who was calling...

40
00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:45.375
- "Don't answer it." - That's what I thought.

41
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:46.644
Of course.

42
00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:48.144
Still, you answered.

43
00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:49.715
I wasn't going to.

44
00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:52.315
I've been promoting the show in my interviews.

45
00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:56.185
They ask about you instead of my movie.

46
00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:58.084
There are so many articles about you...

47
00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.685
- and One Night Two Days. - Exactly.

48
00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.795
I need to tune in two days from now.

49
00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:03.994
You're battling it out in the sauna.

50
00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:05.325
(Joo Hyuck never missed an episode.)

51
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:09.434
I've tuned in every week since my departure.

52
00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:10.635
(I watched every episode.)

53
00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:14.404
We feel like you're with us every week.

54
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.274
You could always join us for once.

55
00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:19.804
Okay, I will with no strings attached.

56
00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:22.545
- I knew it. - You promised.

57
00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:23.774
- You'll join us sometime. - Right.

58
00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:25.545
We'll have your outfit ready.

59
00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.385
- All right? - What?

60
00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:29.114
Okay, fine.

61
00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:31.785
One Night...

62
00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.355
- Two Days. - Two Days.

63
00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:36.855
(Remember the members, we are one.)

64
00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:40.894
(He promised to join us again someday.)

65
00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.635
(Today, we keep that promise.)

66
00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:48.904
(November 22, 2013, first day of season 3)

67
00:02:48.904 --> 00:02:49.934
We're here.

68
00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:53.105
(They secretly enter the new member's house.)

69
00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.814
(Their first encounter)

70
00:02:58.915 --> 00:02:59.985
My gosh.

71
00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.445
(My gosh!)

72
00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:04.955
(Kim Joo Hyuck)

73
00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:06.955
What?

74
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:08.325
(Water is sprayed.)

75
00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.225
(Annoyed)

76
00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:12.825
- What... - Joo Hyuck.

77
00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:14.094
Hi.

78
00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:16.195
- What is this? - Hi.

79
00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.265
Hello.

80
00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:19.705
You should've immediately sprayed the water.

81
00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:20.705
Was this necessary?

82
00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:23.235
Unbelievable.

83
00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:26.075
I mean...

84
00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:27.075
(Grumbling)

85
00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:31.374
I wanted to make a good first impression.

86
00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:32.385
(Grumbling)

87
00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:36.584
- What's going on? - Hurry up.

88
00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:38.084
Joon Ho, quickly.

89
00:03:38.114 --> 00:03:39.154
Hi.

90
00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:40.985
- It's Kim Joo Hyuck. - I'm Kim Joo Hyuck.

91
00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:44.524
(Stammering)

92
00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:46.165
Here. Have some water.

93
00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:49.094
- What's this? - It's really nothing.

94
00:03:49.394 --> 00:03:51.265
(Sniggering)

95
00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.505
(What on earth is this?)

96
00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.344
(This is hilarious.)

97
00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:07.885
I smell a man living alone.

98
00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:13.054
(They tip-toe so that they don't wake him up.)

99
00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:21.764
Hi, I'm sorry to do this when we've just met.

100
00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:25.704
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:28.775
- I'm sorry. - Look at him.

102
00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:31.535
Are you kidding me?

103
00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:37.244
Hang on. Who are you?

104
00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:38.545
Nice to meet you.

105
00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:41.285
He's Joo Hyuck. Kim Joo Hyuck.

106
00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:42.655
Yes, hello.

107
00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:47.124
(His boxers are just as polite.)

108
00:04:49.324 --> 00:04:51.754
- He's awake now. - Hi.

109
00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:54.364
(Hi, little brother.)

110
00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:55.965
(We're here for you.)

111
00:05:12.184 --> 00:05:13.845
(Joo Hyuck holds him by the back of his neck.)

112
00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:15.855
More, more!

113
00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:18.285
- More. - Get at him!

114
00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:20.384
- There are students. - Let's head over to them.

115
00:05:20.384 --> 00:05:22.054
- Yes, let's. - We'll ask them.

116
00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:23.595
Kids love me.

117
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:25.694
- Not many kids know me. - Of course they do.

118
00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:26.694
Hi, guys.

119
00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:29.595
- Gather over here. - Hi!

120
00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.465
- That's right. - They're all excited.

121
00:05:32.535 --> 00:05:35.835
You'll be participating in a life-changing vote.

122
00:05:36.304 --> 00:05:37.504
Anyway, let's do a dry-run.

123
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.204
Don't turn around until we tell you to.

124
00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:41.304
Just stand behind...

125
00:05:41.304 --> 00:05:43.314
the person you like the most.

126
00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:45.545
- In 1, 2, 3, go. - Go!

127
00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:46.985
(Go!)

128
00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:49.614
No way.

129
00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:52.425
One needs to step up his game.

130
00:05:53.124 --> 00:05:54.684
There's one that really should.

131
00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:56.225
My goodness.

132
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:57.795
Two will be eliminated from this round.

133
00:05:58.864 --> 00:06:00.064
(Voting complete)

134
00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:02.194
I just hope that you won't...

135
00:06:02.364 --> 00:06:03.994
take this too personally.

136
00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:05.965
- All right? - Of course.

137
00:06:06.535 --> 00:06:07.864
Why is it so quiet?

138
00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:09.634
Especially you, Joon Young.

139
00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:11.074
- Joon Young... - It's so quiet.

140
00:06:11.074 --> 00:06:12.804
- Don't be too upset. - Did you set me up?

141
00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:15.204
Joon Ho, I bet you're not expecting many.

142
00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:18.345
Kids from 4 to 19 tend to adore me.

143
00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.215
- Really? - A lot are behind me.

144
00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:21.884
Is that what you think?

145
00:06:21.884 --> 00:06:24.355
You know how popular Joon Ho is these days.

146
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.585
(Meanwhile...)

147
00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.954
I feel somewhat lonely right now.

148
00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.295
- Really? - Don't worry.

149
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:30.454
You're actor Kim Joo Hyuck.

150
00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:32.364
- I feel lonely. - You're one of the best.

151
00:06:32.364 --> 00:06:34.494
- I can feel the cold air. - Once you turn around,

152
00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:37.694
you'll know you have to do better.

153
00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:39.605
(No one's behind him.)

154
00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:42.374
In 1, 2, 3.

155
00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:48.814
(Joo Hyuck)

156
00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:52.314
(Tell me that...)

157
00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:53.614
(this is a joke.)

158
00:06:55.655 --> 00:06:57.155
- Yes! - I knew it.

159
00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:58.454
Look how many stood behind me.

160
00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:00.684
- There's no one here. - No way.

161
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.655
- This is great. - Hi, guys.

162
00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:04.754
I'm going to do my best on this show.

163
00:07:05.395 --> 00:07:06.864
I'll pour my heart into it.

164
00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:09.095
- Thank you, guys. - Are you upset?

165
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.694
- Thank you. - I'm nothing but upset.

166
00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:13.105
The man who no one stood behind...

167
00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:15.204
is movie star Kim Joo Hyuck.

168
00:07:15.304 --> 00:07:16.975
- I'll have to do better. - He's very famous.

169
00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:18.134
Stop it!

170
00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:19.605
Stop it already.

171
00:07:22.744 --> 00:07:24.244
- I'm so lonely. - Gosh.

172
00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:26.285
I'm nothing but lonely.

173
00:07:26.285 --> 00:07:28.145
You look lonely from behind too.

174
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.025
Instead of forcing this, I need to be myself.

175
00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:38.225
It's my first day.

176
00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:40.295
As we grow closer,

177
00:07:42.134 --> 00:07:43.494
we'll become a family.

178
00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:44.895
(It's just the beginning.)

179
00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:46.165
That's how we'll be.

180
00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.204
(It's just the beginning.)

181
00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:50.304
(We didn't...)

182
00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:53.605
(quite know him well yet.)

183
00:07:55.105 --> 00:07:56.114
Let's eat.

184
00:07:58.014 --> 00:07:59.415
(A feast)

185
00:08:01.384 --> 00:08:03.355
I love every item of food over there.

186
00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:04.785
Now I'm going crazy.

187
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:05.884
Flip the meat.

188
00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:08.585
- A strip of kimchi. - Flip the meat.

189
00:08:08.585 --> 00:08:10.855
- Who cares? - The aged kimchi...

190
00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:12.864
- Aged kimchi? - Joo Hyuck,

191
00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:14.764
- let's not beg. - Why not?

192
00:08:14.764 --> 00:08:16.595
- We're on TV. - So?

193
00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:18.064
Just think about it.

194
00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:19.864
You need to be strong.

195
00:08:19.864 --> 00:08:22.735
Why should we share anyway?

196
00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:24.934
Let's keep our integrity intact.

197
00:08:25.335 --> 00:08:26.374
(Tae Hyun notices something.)

198
00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:28.375
Don't you find it weird...

199
00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:30.814
that there's a karaoke machine here?

200
00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:32.584
I know, right?

201
00:08:32.584 --> 00:08:33.584
(Oh, that?)

202
00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:35.854
- Does that work? - What?

203
00:08:35.854 --> 00:08:36.854
It appears to be.

204
00:08:36.854 --> 00:08:38.155
I'll check it out.

205
00:08:39.854 --> 00:08:41.684
You said you won't beg.

206
00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:43.995
- I'm bored, that's all. - Of course.

207
00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:46.224
- We're bored too. - We have plenty anyway.

208
00:08:46.224 --> 00:08:48.964
- A feast needs music. - Exactly.

209
00:08:49.594 --> 00:08:50.594
Of course.

210
00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:53.604
Joon Ho, who do you want to hear from the most?

211
00:08:53.604 --> 00:08:55.604
- How about Joo Hyuck? - Of course.

212
00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:57.505
Yes, Joo Hyuck.

213
00:08:57.535 --> 00:08:59.645
- What? - You should sing for us.

214
00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:01.474
I'd like to hear you sing.

215
00:09:03.814 --> 00:09:06.045
There are two things I hate the most.

216
00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.115
What are they?

217
00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:08.584
Singing in public...

218
00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:10.385
and going in a cold bath.

219
00:09:11.415 --> 00:09:12.655
I've been in one though.

220
00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:16.324
You'll now sing in public as well.

221
00:09:17.094 --> 00:09:18.964
(Are you saying you won't do it?)

222
00:09:18.964 --> 00:09:20.094
All right.

223
00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:23.365
(As if!)

224
00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:26.505
(No way!)

225
00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:29.304
(I'll liven up the mood.)

226
00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:31.734
Enjoy your meal.

227
00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.704
(He's in charge of the party.)

228
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.314
(Thumbs up!)

229
00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:39.214
(He rarely sings this at karaoke rooms.)

230
00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:43.184
(We're hearing him sing his favorite song.)

231
00:09:46.054 --> 00:09:48.184
(Have you lowered your inhibitions now?)

232
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:49.755
(Snorting)

233
00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:52.694
(He even breaks out some old moves.)

234
00:09:52.694 --> 00:09:54.765
Like that.

235
00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:56.964
(We didn't know you were this adorable.)

236
00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:00.865
(Thank you very much.)

237
00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:01.905
Thank you.

238
00:10:02.604 --> 00:10:04.505
- That was great. - Yes, it was.

239
00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:05.604
Did you see that?

240
00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:09.115
Do you think this'll affect my acting career?

241
00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:12.245
- No, it won't. - Not at all.

242
00:10:12.484 --> 00:10:14.314
It won't hurt you at all.

243
00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:16.084
It won't leave a dent in your career.

244
00:10:16.814 --> 00:10:18.684
(Could I have something in return then?)

245
00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:20.554
Hi, it's the youngest.

246
00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:22.895
- There you go. - Thank you.

247
00:10:22.895 --> 00:10:23.954
Thanks.

248
00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:26.625
He has been in the light before,

249
00:10:27.425 --> 00:10:29.665
which is why he could sing that song well.

250
00:10:29.665 --> 00:10:30.934
- My gosh. - We'll let you join us...

251
00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:32.405
if you sing some more.

252
00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:34.035
Look at that.

253
00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:36.375
- We should sing together. - Gosh.

254
00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:39.245
Didn't you say you hated singing in public?

255
00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:40.275
(This was something you hated.)

256
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.714
Unbelievable.

257
00:10:42.714 --> 00:10:45.275
(Slowly, they opened up to each other.)

258
00:10:49.184 --> 00:10:54.385
(South Jeolla Province, octopus skewer)

259
00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:56.995
Let's play a game of "One Bite".

260
00:10:56.995 --> 00:10:58.995
- I'm in. - Winner wins the chance.

261
00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:01.525
- This... - This I have to win.

262
00:11:01.525 --> 00:11:03.995
- Of course. - I need to eat this.

263
00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:05.934
So what game should we play?

264
00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:09.135
- I have an idea. - We'll lie facing down...

265
00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:12.304
and crawl with our hands behind our backs.

266
00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:14.175
(Crawl with our hands behind?)

267
00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:16.175
- What? - Are you good at that?

268
00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:17.415
- What? - Forward or backward?

269
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:18.885
- Forward. - Forward or backward?

270
00:11:18.885 --> 00:11:20.385
- Forward. - The room's too small.

271
00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:23.385
(While everyone finds it impossible...)

272
00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:25.184
(Even the staff is unsure.)

273
00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:28.554
(Joo Hyuck won't give up.)

274
00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:30.755
(I've never came up with a game before.)

275
00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:31.824
Like this.

276
00:11:32.054 --> 00:11:34.824
This is what I meant.

277
00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:37.765
(How pathetic.)

278
00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:41.704
That's quite tricky. It's hard to move forward.

279
00:11:43.405 --> 00:11:45.035
(Frosty responses)

280
00:11:45.545 --> 00:11:47.444
(What's up with him?)

281
00:11:48.344 --> 00:11:50.344
(I should've come prepared instead.)

282
00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:55.454
What if we used our feet?

283
00:11:55.454 --> 00:11:56.684
- To kick forward? - Yes, to kick.

284
00:11:56.684 --> 00:11:58.554
- We'll fly forward. - From over there.

285
00:11:58.554 --> 00:11:59.755
- Here. - We'll see who goes far.

286
00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:03.554
(What will they think this time?)

287
00:12:03.554 --> 00:12:04.594
- Okay. - Good.

288
00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:05.964
Let's do this.

289
00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.224
- That's better. - It's not that bad.

290
00:12:07.724 --> 00:12:09.564
(He's never been so proud before.)

291
00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:11.964
Let's see who goes first.

292
00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:14.135
The winner decides. Rock-paper-scissors.

293
00:12:14.204 --> 00:12:16.035
(They finally decided on an order.)

294
00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:17.574
- I'm going first. - He's first.

295
00:12:17.574 --> 00:12:20.104
("Octopus Catapult" by Kim Joo Hyuck)

296
00:12:20.104 --> 00:12:21.145
Push with your legs.

297
00:12:21.844 --> 00:12:23.275
- Not the hands. - No.

298
00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.344
- That's it. - Exactly.

299
00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:26.415
Let's go.

300
00:12:26.814 --> 00:12:29.184
- All right. - Let's do this.

301
00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:31.915
Octopus. This I have to eat.

302
00:12:33.684 --> 00:12:35.255
I only need one big push.

303
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.324
One...

304
00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:38.795
(He's the inventor of this game.)

305
00:12:38.795 --> 00:12:40.025
- Wait. - Gosh.

306
00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.865
(After collecting his thoughts,)

307
00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:45.035
(the octopus finally flies.)

308
00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:47.035
Okay, stop right there.

309
00:12:47.035 --> 00:12:48.405
- Here. - Write down his record.

310
00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:49.734
Right at his head.

311
00:12:49.734 --> 00:12:51.535
- He went quite far. - That's perfect.

312
00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:52.675
Look how far he went.

313
00:12:52.675 --> 00:12:54.304
- Good. - All right.

314
00:12:54.304 --> 00:12:55.344
Get me some tape.

315
00:12:55.515 --> 00:12:57.915
- All right. - Make sure you're right.

316
00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:00.385
You actually look like a mantis.

317
00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:01.684
(He resembles a certain insect.)

318
00:13:01.684 --> 00:13:04.785
Doesn't he look like an origami frog?

319
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:06.224
You're kind of right.

320
00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.454
(Laugh while you can.)

321
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.125
- Exactly. - See what I mean?

322
00:13:10.694 --> 00:13:13.125
- I'm ready. - He's tall so...

323
00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:23.834
(He easily beats Joo Hyuck's score.)

324
00:13:24.574 --> 00:13:26.005
(Amazing)

325
00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.204
- No way. - Joo Hyuck's out.

326
00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:29.974
(His excitement lasted a minute and 30 seconds.)

327
00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:31.645
The winner is Jung Joon Young.

328
00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:34.084
(Jung Joon Young, the luckiest man on earth)

329
00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:35.954
Why does he always win?

330
00:13:37.285 --> 00:13:40.054
(He wins a whole skewer of octopus.)

331
00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:42.194
- Here. - It's roasted well.

332
00:13:43.594 --> 00:13:45.594
(He tastes the octopus.)

333
00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.094
My gosh.

334
00:13:47.425 --> 00:13:50.564
(I'd give anything to be Jung Joon Young.)

335
00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:51.594
Look at him.

336
00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:53.535
Has he no compassion?

337
00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:55.064
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

338
00:13:55.064 --> 00:13:56.474
Look at him eat.

339
00:13:56.804 --> 00:13:57.875
I know.

340
00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.405
Let's throw this away.

341
00:13:59.944 --> 00:14:00.974
- Really? - Yes.

342
00:14:01.344 --> 00:14:02.344
Throw it away.

343
00:14:08.545 --> 00:14:09.584
Throw it away.

344
00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:15.724
(Swiftly)

345
00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:17.824
No way.

346
00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:20.165
- I can't believe you all. - It's delicious.

347
00:14:21.224 --> 00:14:22.234
It's really good.

348
00:14:22.234 --> 00:14:25.365
(He was humbler than we thought.)

349
00:14:26.304 --> 00:14:30.275
(No, he was even better than that.)

350
00:14:30.275 --> 00:14:35.474
(He was like the funny friend next door.)

351
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.944
That hurts!

352
00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:40.545
(Cramps!)

353
00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:42.454
(He got cramps too.)

354
00:14:43.054 --> 00:14:44.155
- Are you all right? - Hey!

355
00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:45.214
(He is ruined.)

356
00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:48.895
Shake it.

357
00:14:49.025 --> 00:14:51.925
Go on, shake it!

358
00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:54.064
- Spread out your leg. - He has a cramp.

359
00:14:54.365 --> 00:14:55.995
(The cramps cramped his style.)

360
00:14:57.734 --> 00:14:58.765
You're okay.

361
00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.964
(Then one day...)

362
00:15:00.964 --> 00:15:03.474
This'll be your last test.

363
00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:08.045
I'll give you the first half of an idiom.

364
00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:11.275
- No way. - You'll say the rest.

365
00:15:11.275 --> 00:15:13.015
- Oh no. - I can't do this.

366
00:15:13.015 --> 00:15:14.444
I can't do this.

367
00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:16.885
The game's over with one wrong answer.

368
00:15:17.655 --> 00:15:19.954
- Start with Joon Young. - Here we go.

369
00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:21.755
You can do this.

370
00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:22.824
And go.

371
00:15:22.824 --> 00:15:23.824
(Joon Young, the ace, kicks things off.)

372
00:15:24.295 --> 00:15:26.765
Childhood, 1, 2, 3.

373
00:15:26.765 --> 00:15:28.964
Childhood, 1, 2, 3.

374
00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:30.535
Hill.

375
00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:32.734
Hill.

376
00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:35.704
What?

377
00:15:36.074 --> 00:15:37.304
- Childhood... - Friend!

378
00:15:37.304 --> 00:15:39.204
There might be a hill by that name.

379
00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.204
(I remember now!)

380
00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:42.115
(There might be a hill by that name.)

381
00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:43.444
You never know.

382
00:15:43.444 --> 00:15:44.714
In your dreams.

383
00:15:44.714 --> 00:15:46.645
You never know though.

384
00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:48.854
- Anyway... - Childhood Hill.

385
00:15:48.854 --> 00:15:49.885
(We stood no chance.)

386
00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:52.625
(They pretend it never happened.)

387
00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:55.854
Your wisdom will be tested through idioms.

388
00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.554
- Okay. - Here we go.

389
00:15:57.554 --> 00:15:58.755
We start with Joon Young.

390
00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:01.724
- Bring it on. - Okay, let's go.

391
00:16:01.724 --> 00:16:03.094
- Childhood. - Friend.

392
00:16:03.094 --> 00:16:04.865
- Okay! - Is this for real?

393
00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:06.765
A three day, 1, 2, 3.

394
00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:09.304
- Resolution. - Kill the dog, 1, 2, 3.

395
00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:10.304
(Kill the dog after hunting is over.)

396
00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:11.574
After the corner.

397
00:16:12.775 --> 00:16:13.804
After the corner.

398
00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:15.074
After the corner.

399
00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:16.375
What?

400
00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.344
- Are you kidding me? - After hunting is over!

401
00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:21.115
- Joo Hyuck. - He's unbelievable.

402
00:16:21.115 --> 00:16:22.814
- Really? - I'm disappointed in you.

403
00:16:23.084 --> 00:16:24.515
- Are you for real? - What a disgrace.

404
00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:26.324
You brought this on yourself.

405
00:16:26.324 --> 00:16:28.755
How could you say the wrong answer?

406
00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:29.824
Unbelievable.

407
00:16:29.824 --> 00:16:32.365
I had no idea. My mind drew a blank.

408
00:16:32.365 --> 00:16:35.395
- Gosh. - You're not like us.

409
00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:37.665
You're supposed to be the smart one.

410
00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:40.505
Let's not do quizzes. It's embarrassing.

411
00:16:40.964 --> 00:16:43.804
You'll hurt your image by getting it wrong.

412
00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.604
- He's now Mr. Gutaeng. - Gosh.

413
00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:49.474
- Mr. Gutaeng. - Mr. Gutaeng.

414
00:16:49.474 --> 00:16:50.944
From time to time,

415
00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:52.844
I wonder why I joined this show.

416
00:16:52.844 --> 00:16:53.915
(Laughing)

417
00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.285
(To you who's left with only scars)

418
00:16:56.885 --> 00:16:59.224
(Special guest Joo Hyuck confesses.)

419
00:16:59.224 --> 00:17:00.784
From time to time,

420
00:17:00.784 --> 00:17:02.555
I wonder why I joined this show.

421
00:17:03.724 --> 00:17:05.294
That thought just pops in my head.

422
00:17:06.065 --> 00:17:07.694
I don't know what I should do.

423
00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:09.794
I'll tell you. Go and sit in the corner.

424
00:17:09.794 --> 00:17:12.504
(Sit in the corner.)

425
00:17:14.105 --> 00:17:15.305
The corner?

426
00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:17.774
He gets a new nickname every week.

427
00:17:18.004 --> 00:17:20.645
(He's greedy when it comes to nicknames.)

428
00:17:23.115 --> 00:17:28.784
(And like that, we met Mr. Gutaeng.)

429
00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:30.585
- Hello. - Not so close.

430
00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:31.655
Hi.

431
00:17:32.325 --> 00:17:33.325
(Trotting behind)

432
00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:35.754
- Goodness. - Hello.

433
00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:37.754
- The birthday party. - Let's do it now.

434
00:17:37.754 --> 00:17:38.794
Whose birthday is it?

435
00:17:38.895 --> 00:17:41.895
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

436
00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.635
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

437
00:17:43.635 --> 00:17:44.694
There you go.

438
00:17:45.704 --> 00:17:48.464
(A moving party!)

439
00:17:49.204 --> 00:17:51.474
Can I cuss on camera? Can I?

440
00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.274
Has anyone vomited on camera?

441
00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:55.474
I'm sorry to say this on TV,

442
00:17:56.014 --> 00:17:57.944
but smokes after meals are the bomb.

443
00:18:01.145 --> 00:18:04.684
(He entertained us more and more.)

444
00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:07.555
Next, you'll be breaking the ice.

445
00:18:07.555 --> 00:18:08.655
The ice?

446
00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:11.294
- We need hammers. - Is there a saw?

447
00:18:11.294 --> 00:18:13.325
Do whatever you can to break the ice...

448
00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:16.034
and free the three packets of instant rice.

449
00:18:16.034 --> 00:18:17.665
- Right away? - And go!

450
00:18:17.694 --> 00:18:18.694
(Everyone starts running.)

451
00:18:18.694 --> 00:18:19.764
All right.

452
00:18:20.605 --> 00:18:22.575
(Joo Hyuck comes to a halt.)

453
00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:27.444
- Two of us... - Move. Move over.

454
00:18:27.605 --> 00:18:29.175
Move over!

455
00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:31.774
(He tells Joon Ho to step aside.)

456
00:18:37.315 --> 00:18:38.355
This is it!

457
00:18:40.524 --> 00:18:43.024
- Move over. - He's doing it.

458
00:18:43.024 --> 00:18:45.095
Move over!

459
00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.694
(Only 12 seconds in)

460
00:18:46.964 --> 00:18:48.365
Did you see that?

461
00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:50.665
- It's over. - We did it.

462
00:18:50.665 --> 00:18:52.865
Over there. You target that side.

463
00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:54.434
(Next in line is...)

464
00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:55.434
Exactly!

465
00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:56.704
All right.

466
00:18:57.135 --> 00:18:58.335
- Defconn. - That's it.

467
00:18:58.335 --> 00:18:59.774
It's fine.

468
00:18:59.774 --> 00:19:01.575
- All right. - We're good.

469
00:19:02.004 --> 00:19:03.444
- That's it. - Get them out.

470
00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:05.585
- They're out. - All right.

471
00:19:06.085 --> 00:19:07.684
That's it. That's good.

472
00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:09.355
- We're done. - The end.

473
00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:11.315
(Who knew it'd be this easy?)

474
00:19:11.315 --> 00:19:12.925
Yes! We did it.

475
00:19:12.925 --> 00:19:14.254
(Who knew it'd be this easy?)

476
00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:16.425
We dug out all three of them.

477
00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:17.524
See?

478
00:19:17.694 --> 00:19:20.165
(I'm sorry, but we're wiser now.)

479
00:19:20.165 --> 00:19:22.565
- See? - Take that.

480
00:19:22.565 --> 00:19:23.694
Joo Hyuck.

481
00:19:23.694 --> 00:19:25.095
It's over.

482
00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:26.135
(We forgot...)

483
00:19:26.135 --> 00:19:27.135
Look.

484
00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:29.635
Some people just don't learn.

485
00:19:30.434 --> 00:19:31.934
- Gosh. - He won't learn.

486
00:19:31.934 --> 00:19:34.675
I don't know about everybody else,

487
00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:37.474
but Joo Hyuck has come a long way.

488
00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:39.645
He was a real macho man.

489
00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.784
- I wanted to do it. - You are our hero.

490
00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:44.684
Being flustered, I came back with a shovel.

491
00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:48.385
But then a man with a rock told me to move over,

492
00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:49.425
so I did.

493
00:19:49.724 --> 00:19:51.125
The rock flew, the ice broke,

494
00:19:51.125 --> 00:19:52.494
and the rice came out.

495
00:19:52.494 --> 00:19:54.024
Out came the rice.

496
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.794
He is our hero.

497
00:19:56.494 --> 00:19:59.165
(The story of Joo Hyuck's growth)

498
00:20:01.065 --> 00:20:04.274
(It would've been impossible by himself.)

499
00:20:05.774 --> 00:20:07.444
- 1G. - 2G.

500
00:20:07.444 --> 00:20:08.444
3G.

501
00:20:08.444 --> 00:20:10.415
- We're 3G. - We're 3G.

502
00:20:10.415 --> 00:20:11.645
(His colleagues changed him for the good.)

503
00:20:13.284 --> 00:20:15.754
Are the members different?

504
00:20:15.754 --> 00:20:16.984
That's right.

505
00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:18.514
It's a brand new team.

506
00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:21.684
The first team was the funniest though.

507
00:20:21.684 --> 00:20:23.794
Yes, when it was led by Kang Ho Dong.

508
00:20:23.794 --> 00:20:24.954
The show was very popular then.

509
00:20:24.954 --> 00:20:26.625
We're not doing so bad though.

510
00:20:26.665 --> 00:20:28.665
(We're not doing so bad though.)

511
00:20:29.034 --> 00:20:32.635
(No, please don't say that.)

512
00:20:33.504 --> 00:20:34.504
The new team, I mean.

513
00:20:35.305 --> 00:20:37.204
From what I can tell,

514
00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:40.375
- that's not the case. - It is.

515
00:20:42.244 --> 00:20:43.315
People adore us too.

516
00:20:43.915 --> 00:20:46.315
I don't watch it that much these days.

517
00:20:46.915 --> 00:20:48.244
We'll do better then.

518
00:20:48.544 --> 00:20:51.615
We'll do better so that you'll watch often again.

519
00:20:53.425 --> 00:20:58.024
(More and more people climb onto the bus.)

520
00:21:01.224 --> 00:21:03.365
(Joo Hyuck discovers something important.)

521
00:21:03.934 --> 00:21:05.865
The camera is visible,

522
00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:07.835
and I'm sitting at the front...

523
00:21:08.204 --> 00:21:09.774
while people get on the bus.

524
00:21:09.934 --> 00:21:11.875
No one seems to recognize me.

525
00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:13.875
- I know. - They don't.

526
00:21:14.944 --> 00:21:16.474
They just walk right past you.

527
00:21:17.315 --> 00:21:18.544
Did you see that?

528
00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:20.784
Excuse me. Aren't you Kim Joo Hyuck?

529
00:21:20.784 --> 00:21:22.714
- It's him. - From One Night Two Days.

530
00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:26.385
(The grateful ones)

531
00:21:27.425 --> 00:21:28.825
I'm here to film an episode.

532
00:21:29.555 --> 00:21:30.825
Look.

533
00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:33.395
(He even shakes their hands.)

534
00:21:33.395 --> 00:21:35.264
We're headed to the market.

535
00:21:35.635 --> 00:21:37.395
- My gosh. Hello. - Hello.

536
00:21:37.395 --> 00:21:39.704
Can I shake your hand? It's nice to meet you.

537
00:21:40.204 --> 00:21:41.865
You look better in person.

538
00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:43.704
Don't I? It's really a shame.

539
00:21:46.075 --> 00:21:49.274
Joo Hyuck, could you say hello back here?

540
00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:50.444
Hi!

541
00:21:50.444 --> 00:21:53.315
(Is this "Meet the Celebrity"?)

542
00:21:53.744 --> 00:21:55.115
Nice to meet you.

543
00:21:56.254 --> 00:21:59.684
Hold on. Let me wipe off my tears.

544
00:22:00.555 --> 00:22:01.855
My goodness.

545
00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:03.954
I'm so touched.

546
00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:07.595
(He even poses for them.)

547
00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:11.264
(He's their superstar.)

548
00:22:11.264 --> 00:22:12.865
- Thank you and bye. - Bye.

549
00:22:13.504 --> 00:22:14.865
- Let me shake your hand. - Bye.

550
00:22:14.865 --> 00:22:16.434
- Can we shake hands? - Thank you.

551
00:22:16.434 --> 00:22:17.805
- Take care. - You too.

552
00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:20.444
(That wasn't bad.)

553
00:22:22.244 --> 00:22:23.645
(Joo Hyuck!)

554
00:22:27.784 --> 00:22:29.655
(You...)

555
00:22:30.585 --> 00:22:31.754
(Yes, it's me.)

556
00:22:31.815 --> 00:22:32.885
Hello.

557
00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:34.784
(The ladies love him.)

558
00:22:36.925 --> 00:22:38.655
(An A-list celebrity)

559
00:22:40.294 --> 00:22:42.165
Could you join us for a moment?

560
00:22:42.165 --> 00:22:43.865
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

561
00:22:43.865 --> 00:22:45.865
I'll do my best. I'm Kim Joo Hyuck.

562
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.234
(Is this a presidential election?)

563
00:22:47.234 --> 00:22:48.565
I'm here for you.

564
00:22:48.565 --> 00:22:50.504
- Hello. - Wait a minute.

565
00:22:50.504 --> 00:22:52.444
- Here, here. - It's so cold out here.

566
00:22:52.645 --> 00:22:54.504
It's me, Jong Min.

567
00:22:54.504 --> 00:22:55.815
It's so cold.

568
00:22:57.044 --> 00:22:59.415
Whatever. I'm 43 years old!

569
00:22:59.784 --> 00:23:00.984
Please think kindly of me.

570
00:23:00.984 --> 00:23:02.484
(His servile attitude captivates them.)

571
00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:04.855
- I can't believe him. - Please, everyone.

572
00:23:04.855 --> 00:23:06.085
That's so pathetic.

573
00:23:06.825 --> 00:23:10.125
A year ago, no one stood behind Joo Hyuck.

574
00:23:10.395 --> 00:23:13.325
Will the outcome be different today?

575
00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:15.964
You'll turn around in 1, 2, 3.

576
00:23:15.964 --> 00:23:17.434
Please!

577
00:23:17.434 --> 00:23:19.065
Please!

578
00:23:21.764 --> 00:23:24.635
(It's a party!)

579
00:23:28.274 --> 00:23:32.075
(People started to realize just how amazing he is.)

580
00:23:32.075 --> 00:23:33.885
Thank you. Thank you so much.

581
00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:34.915
Unbelievable.

582
00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:38.014
(To us...)

583
00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.425
(For some reason...)

584
00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:44.254
You were all in on this, weren't you?

585
00:23:44.254 --> 00:23:46.264
- You were. - No way.

586
00:23:46.264 --> 00:23:48.524
- Why would we be? - I knew it!

587
00:23:48.524 --> 00:23:51.635
(To us, Kim Joo Hyuck was...)

588
00:23:52.734 --> 00:23:54.764
(a friend and a brother.)

589
00:23:55.675 --> 00:23:57.905
Comfortable, adorable and sweet.

590
00:23:58.434 --> 00:24:01.004
You'll find him funny too.

591
00:24:01.244 --> 00:24:03.675
That's what I want the viewers to see.

592
00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.244
See who he is inside.

593
00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.484
He's also very considerate.

594
00:24:08.244 --> 00:24:09.655
He puts others first.

595
00:24:09.655 --> 00:24:12.684
Putting others first is actually a flaw of his.

596
00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:16.254
(The oldest but odd brother...)

597
00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:19.095
(who'd be the rock but never demand authority.)

598
00:24:20.165 --> 00:24:23.794
(June 15, 2014, Backpacking Special)

599
00:24:26.434 --> 00:24:27.504
Are they coming?

600
00:24:28.464 --> 00:24:29.534
Where are the others?

601
00:24:30.575 --> 00:24:31.905
They're coming.

602
00:24:31.905 --> 00:24:32.974
(He's looking out for those fallen behind.)

603
00:24:34.405 --> 00:24:35.615
Watch your step.

604
00:24:37.514 --> 00:24:38.915
Be careful.

605
00:24:39.684 --> 00:24:41.014
Watch your step coming up.

606
00:24:44.155 --> 00:24:45.984
It's very steep.

607
00:24:47.024 --> 00:24:50.155
(The afternoon hiking is coming to an end.)

608
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:51.224
That's better.

609
00:24:51.224 --> 00:24:52.264
(The afternoon hiking is coming to an end.)

610
00:24:53.565 --> 00:24:54.724
It's pretty high.

611
00:24:54.724 --> 00:24:56.194
(They are drained of energy.)

612
00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:57.234
We're not done yet.

613
00:24:57.764 --> 00:24:58.905
There's another corner.

614
00:24:59.635 --> 00:25:00.805
Over there.

615
00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:02.034
This must be it.

616
00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:04.274
(The last stop before reaching the top)

617
00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:10.714
(A mysterious tarp is blocking their way.)

618
00:25:19.984 --> 00:25:20.984
What is it?

619
00:25:20.984 --> 00:25:24.294
Under the tarp over there, you'll come in for...

620
00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:26.395
an individual interview.

621
00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:28.125
Joo Hyuck, you're first.

622
00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:30.734
(Joo Hyuck's first to have the talk.)

623
00:25:30.734 --> 00:25:32.365
Whatever it is, be nice to us.

624
00:25:32.365 --> 00:25:33.964
- You got it. - Sure.

625
00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:43.645
Can't I be sitting somewhere less awkward?

626
00:25:44.944 --> 00:25:46.815
(His own slapstick comedy)

627
00:25:48.244 --> 00:25:50.085
There's a good 30 minutes left.

628
00:25:50.085 --> 00:25:52.224
- Until we reach the top? - Yes.

629
00:25:52.954 --> 00:25:54.625
Please take a look at the sign.

630
00:25:55.385 --> 00:25:58.055
The path we've been on was the easy one.

631
00:25:58.055 --> 00:26:00.365
The other one is relatively harder.

632
00:26:00.365 --> 00:26:02.565
It's known as the Gasping Hill.

633
00:26:02.565 --> 00:26:04.194
- It must be tricky. - Exactly.

634
00:26:04.194 --> 00:26:06.365
It gets steeper at the last minute.

635
00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:08.734
What you need to do...

636
00:26:09.675 --> 00:26:11.835
is think of what you'll discard.

637
00:26:12.474 --> 00:26:13.645
What I'll discard?

638
00:26:14.274 --> 00:26:16.875
Tents were made to share anyway,

639
00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.115
so you could always share someone else's.

640
00:26:19.115 --> 00:26:20.915
(It may be cramped, but you could share.)

641
00:26:22.284 --> 00:26:24.014
Is there something we can eat?

642
00:26:24.284 --> 00:26:25.954
- Should I take a look? - Sure.

643
00:26:25.954 --> 00:26:27.024
(It's snack time again.)

644
00:26:27.024 --> 00:26:28.555
I think you'll have something.

645
00:26:29.425 --> 00:26:31.794
Why do I have all the ham?

646
00:26:32.565 --> 00:26:34.994
- Is it okay to eat this? - Sure.

647
00:26:37.494 --> 00:26:39.905
I think it's a game to empty our bags.

648
00:26:41.034 --> 00:26:43.175
- I think you're right. - What?

649
00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:45.405
(His interview is over.)

650
00:26:46.845 --> 00:26:48.575
You won't believe how heavy it is.

651
00:26:50.214 --> 00:26:51.714
Why didn't you discard anything?

652
00:26:51.714 --> 00:26:54.415
What's the point when we're almost there?

653
00:26:56.454 --> 00:26:58.385
There's nothing I want to discard.

654
00:27:00.655 --> 00:27:01.954
- Are you sure? - Yes.

655
00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:05.294
The other's might discard their things,

656
00:27:06.264 --> 00:27:07.724
but I should keep mine.

657
00:27:08.764 --> 00:27:10.694
Is it because you don't trust them?

658
00:27:11.065 --> 00:27:14.264
I can't discard mine and use theirs.

659
00:27:14.264 --> 00:27:15.534
I'd rather they use mine instead.

660
00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.704
That's why I should keep mine.

661
00:27:18.675 --> 00:27:19.805
There's no other way.

662

organize the International Comedy Festival...

666
00:27:32.954 --> 00:27:34.155
in Pyongyang.

667
00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:37.355
You wrote some really nice things.

668
00:27:37.855 --> 00:27:38.925
Defconn will...

669
00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:41.125
take on rappers from North Korea...

670
00:27:41.395 --> 00:27:43.395
in an intense rap battle.

671
00:27:43.994 --> 00:27:45.034
(He's moved by that.)

672
00:27:45.034 --> 00:27:46.734
Let me freestyle.

673
00:27:46.734 --> 00:27:48.264
It'll be too rough to air...

674
00:27:48.264 --> 00:27:50.274
in both North and South Korea.

675
00:27:50.274 --> 00:27:52.034
(Banned in both countries)

676
00:27:52.474 --> 00:27:53.744
- "Jong Min." - Yes?

677
00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:55.244
"How's your cart bar doing?"

678
00:27:55.244 --> 00:27:56.474
(Out of the blue)

679
00:27:57.315 --> 00:27:58.514
Why do I own a cart bar?

680
00:27:58.514 --> 00:28:00.315
"I'm always in tears just thinking of you."

681
00:28:01.885 --> 00:28:03.514
"Was it 2017?"

682
00:28:04.284 --> 00:28:05.825
"If it had not been for that incident..."

683
00:28:05.825 --> 00:28:07.125
(If it had not been for that incident...)

684
00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:09.325
What incident?

685
00:28:09.794 --> 00:28:11.494
"You'd still be on One Night Two Days."

686
00:28:11.494 --> 00:28:13.264
What on earth did I do?

687
00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:17.565
"The toy hammer turned out to be made of steel,"

688
00:28:19.534 --> 00:28:21.504
"and that made you a complete moron."

689
00:28:21.504 --> 00:28:22.805
(A single blow made him a moron.)

690
00:28:23.934 --> 00:28:25.504
So I became a moron?

691
00:28:26.744 --> 00:28:27.974
Let's not lose hope.

692
00:28:29.514 --> 00:28:31.415
Now let's hear what Joo Hyuck wrote.

693
00:28:31.415 --> 00:28:35.315
"We just met for drinks yesterday,"

694
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:38.885
"so it's awkward to read this letter we wrote..."

695
00:28:38.885 --> 00:28:41.425
"10 years ago. You all have aged."

696
00:28:41.655 --> 00:28:43.454
"Tae Hyun, congratulations on your son..."

697
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.254
"getting into Seoul University."

698
00:28:47.224 --> 00:28:48.524
(Affectionate predictions)

699
00:28:48.524 --> 00:28:50.095
"Joon Ho, I wish you'd stop..."

700
00:28:50.165 --> 00:28:52.165
"starting your own business."

701
00:28:53.034 --> 00:28:54.704
"It's already your fifth attempt."

702
00:28:55.774 --> 00:28:56.835
He's being sincere.

703
00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.474
"I hope it works out this time."

704
00:28:58.875 --> 00:29:02.444
"Defconn, stop worrying and do what you want."

705
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:04.714
"Joon Young, now that you're older,"

706
00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:05.944
"live a more normal life."

707
00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:07.044
He's like a father.

708
00:29:07.044 --> 00:29:08.184
My gosh.

709
00:29:08.855 --> 00:29:12.014
"My second child started school this year."

710
00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:15.855
- Really? - After 10 years?

711
00:29:15.855 --> 00:29:18.494
"My wife is also pregnant with my third child."

712
00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:20.964
That means he's seeing someone now.

713
00:29:21.325 --> 00:29:23.694
"I should make big bucks for my family,"

714
00:29:23.694 --> 00:29:27.305
"so I'm lucky to be cast in a Brad Pitt movie."

715
00:29:28.264 --> 00:29:30.034
"After its success, I'll treat you to a meal."

716
00:29:30.734 --> 00:29:31.905
Only his life has turned out great.

717
00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:35.004
- I know. - Tell me about it!

718
00:29:37.274 --> 00:29:39.984
(July 12, 2015, To Your House)

719
00:29:41.184 --> 00:29:42.415
Next,

720
00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:43.984
we're heading to Jong Min's house.

721
00:29:43.984 --> 00:29:45.155
- What? - What?

722
00:29:45.155 --> 00:29:47.925
(They'll be staying there for the night.)

723
00:29:48.024 --> 00:29:49.494
Are we sleeping at Jong Min's?

724
00:29:49.494 --> 00:29:50.494
At my house?

725
00:29:50.494 --> 00:29:51.524
(Even Jong Min didn't know.)

726
00:29:51.524 --> 00:29:54.194
What will we do all day then?

727
00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:57.565
- Are we sleeping there? - The place we're going...

728
00:29:57.635 --> 00:30:01.305
now is where he spent his childhood.

729
00:30:01.305 --> 00:30:02.805
So not his house?

730
00:30:02.805 --> 00:30:04.305
I remember this smell.

731
00:30:04.675 --> 00:30:06.274
- I missed this smell. - I understand.

732
00:30:06.375 --> 00:30:10.115
There is a mountain behind the village.

733
00:30:10.115 --> 00:30:11.474
- Hello. - Hello.

734
00:30:11.474 --> 00:30:13.484
- Hello. - Hello.

735
00:30:13.915 --> 00:30:14.984
Jong Min is here.

736
00:30:15.284 --> 00:30:17.885
- Hello. - You look adorable.

737
00:30:17.885 --> 00:30:20.184
- Hello. - Jong Min.

738
00:30:20.184 --> 00:30:22.294
- Is she your aunt? - Yes.

739
00:30:22.294 --> 00:30:24.194
- She's his aunt. - Don't we look alike?

740
00:30:24.194 --> 00:30:25.994
They do look alike.

741
00:30:25.994 --> 00:30:27.694
I take after my mom.

742
00:30:28.095 --> 00:30:31.034
Does Jong Min visit here often?

743
00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:33.305
Not very often. Only when he visits his dad's grave.

744
00:30:33.305 --> 00:30:35.934
I see. It must be because he's busy.

745
00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:39.805
As you know, Jong Min's father passed away.

746
00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:41.405
Even so,

747
00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:43.944
- he is really... - He's become a good man.

748
00:30:43.944 --> 00:30:46.845
Exactly. I really appreciate him.

749
00:30:47.184 --> 00:30:48.284
Gosh, it's dark.

750
00:30:48.415 --> 00:30:52.284
When I was young, walking here at night...

751
00:30:52.655 --> 00:30:54.284
was so terrifying.

752
00:30:55.155 --> 00:30:57.825
I sang songs while walking because I was so scared.

753
00:30:58.925 --> 00:30:59.994
(Meanwhile, the members are...)

754
00:31:00.125 --> 00:31:01.264
Where is Jong Min?

755
00:31:01.365 --> 00:31:03.065
- Is he outside? - No.

756
00:31:03.065 --> 00:31:06.534
Jong Min is taking his aunt to her house.

757
00:31:07.964 --> 00:31:09.474
Do we have a morning mission tomorrow?

758
00:31:09.805 --> 00:31:11.905
- A morning mission? - Yes.

759
00:31:12.305 --> 00:31:13.305
Yes, we do.

760
00:31:13.544 --> 00:31:17.815
Since Jong Min's father's grave is here...

761
00:31:17.815 --> 00:31:19.585
- He said it's near here. - Yes.

762
00:31:19.684 --> 00:31:22.155
Are you saying you want to visit his grave...

763
00:31:22.155 --> 00:31:23.655
instead of doing the morning mission?

764
00:31:23.655 --> 00:31:25.315
You were thinking of another morning mission?

765
00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:26.885
Yes, there is one.

766
00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:31.254
Can we visit the grave after the morning mission?

767
00:31:32.464 --> 00:31:34.895
I don't think you can do both.

768
00:31:34.895 --> 00:31:36.494
Then how about...

769
00:31:41.105 --> 00:31:43.805
(It's the 2nd day of the trip.)

770
00:31:49.944 --> 00:31:51.815
(Is everyone awake yet?)

771
00:31:54.885 --> 00:31:58.184
(Today, they all got up early to get ready.)

772
00:32:03.194 --> 00:32:05.524
(Under the lead of Joo Hyuck,)

773
00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:08.264
(the members get ready to visit the grave.)

774
00:32:12.665 --> 00:32:13.835
Let's go.

775
00:32:14.004 --> 00:32:16.504
I've never gone to his grave with anyone else...

776
00:32:16.805 --> 00:32:19.204
- other than my family. - Really?

777
00:32:19.544 --> 00:32:22.675
It was really nice to talk about this idea.

778
00:32:22.675 --> 00:32:23.714
- Was it? - Yes.

779
00:32:24.014 --> 00:32:26.514
Joo Hyuck came up with this idea.

780
00:32:27.044 --> 00:32:28.915
- Is it here? - It's over there.

781
00:32:28.915 --> 00:32:29.915
(They are here to visit Jong Min's father.)

782
00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:42.934
- Is it here? - Are we there?

783
00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:45.194
The left one is my grandfather's grave.

784
00:32:45.934 --> 00:32:48.065
And the right one is your father's?

785
00:32:49.704 --> 00:32:51.405
Hello, Jong Min's father and grandfather.

786
00:32:51.405 --> 00:32:53.075
- Hello. - My paternal grandfather.

787
00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:55.974
- This is my father's. - Hello.

788
00:32:57.274 --> 00:32:59.184
It looks very well-trimmed.

789
00:32:59.184 --> 00:33:00.885
He said his mother was here yesterday.

790
00:33:00.885 --> 00:33:04.315
She must have thought Jong Min would come.

791
00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:06.325
That must be why she cut all the weeds.

792
00:33:08.085 --> 00:33:10.895
The sickle is sharp. I was told to be careful.

793
00:33:11.095 --> 00:33:12.524
Is this how you do it?

794
00:33:12.994 --> 00:33:14.565
Yes, that's how you get rid of the weeds.

795
00:33:14.565 --> 00:33:16.395
I'm not sure if this is the correct way.

796
00:33:16.635 --> 00:33:18.194
I can't step on it.

797
00:33:18.734 --> 00:33:20.704
- Is this enough? - That's enough.

798
00:33:20.704 --> 00:33:22.805
Joon Young, here.

799
00:33:22.805 --> 00:33:25.274
(They carefully cut the weeds.)

800
00:33:25.274 --> 00:33:26.645
- Isn't it cold? - Shall we begin?

801
00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:28.474
- Okay. - Let's begin.

802
00:33:28.944 --> 00:33:30.274
Should we put them here?

803
00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:33.044
Yes. We need to peel the fruits.

804
00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:36.355
- Peel the top part only. - Very good.

805
00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.224
- And... - Peel the opposite side.

806
00:33:41.684 --> 00:33:43.395
- What about rice cake? - Rice cake...

807
00:33:43.395 --> 00:33:45.425
Let's put a piece of rice cake over there.

808
00:33:45.425 --> 00:33:46.665
The rice cake is sent by Joon Ho's mother.

809
00:33:46.665 --> 00:33:48.294
It's from my mother.

810
00:33:48.794 --> 00:33:50.635
There must be sikhye too.

811
00:33:50.635 --> 00:33:52.665
We should serve him a cup of sikhye too.

812
00:33:52.665 --> 00:33:53.805
What else do we need?

813
00:33:54.264 --> 00:33:55.365
Chopsticks. Chopsticks.

814
00:33:57.004 --> 00:33:59.105
Do we have chopsticks?

815
00:33:59.105 --> 00:34:01.105
- Fill it up please. - Did he like alcohol?

816
00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:03.714
- Yes, he did. - Let me fill it too.

817
00:34:04.314 --> 00:34:07.584
(They fill the glass with alcohol he used to like.)

818
00:34:08.544 --> 00:34:10.584
Jong Min, you can bow alone first.

819
00:34:10.584 --> 00:34:12.984
Let me start then.

820
00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:16.694
(Jong Min bows to his father first.)

821
00:34:33.175 --> 00:34:35.944
Pour it on the grave.

822
00:34:36.745 --> 00:34:37.774
Good.

823
00:34:41.044 --> 00:34:42.044
(Followed by him,)

824
00:34:42.044 --> 00:34:44.655
Let me fill it up so that he can drink a lot.

825
00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:46.084
(Joo Hyuck fills up the glass.)

826
00:34:59.405 --> 00:35:00.464
Let me do it too.

827
00:35:00.464 --> 00:35:02.475
I think it's enough.

828
00:35:02.475 --> 00:35:03.635
He shouldn't drink too much.

829
00:35:04.504 --> 00:35:06.705
He has a bad drinking habit.

830
00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:07.975
Have you seen it?

831
00:35:08.205 --> 00:35:09.214
I've seen it a lot.

832
00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:11.214
(He makes a silly joke.)

833
00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:12.484
That's enough.

834
00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:13.785
If you've seen it a lot, what can I say?

835
00:35:13.785 --> 00:35:18.385
Sir, Jong Min will do fine.

836
00:35:18.984 --> 00:35:19.984
Sir.

837
00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.685
We are...

838
00:35:23.194 --> 00:35:24.655
One Night Two Days.

839
00:35:25.725 --> 00:35:29.064
Jong Min is the most senior member among us.

840
00:35:29.535 --> 00:35:31.964
I learn a lot from him.

841
00:35:32.604 --> 00:35:36.205
We feel comfortable here all thanks to him.

842
00:35:37.004 --> 00:35:39.305
Please don't worry about him and rest in peace.

843
00:35:39.675 --> 00:35:42.374
We will have a good time here during the stay.

844
00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:43.414
Don't worry.

845
00:35:45.075 --> 00:35:48.084
Jong Min is doing well these days.

846
00:35:48.084 --> 00:35:50.214
Don't worry about him.

847
00:35:53.524 --> 00:35:54.885
- I'll tidy up the rest. - All right.

848
00:35:54.885 --> 00:35:56.024
- All right. - Okay.

849
00:35:56.894 --> 00:36:01.024
I'll visit you again someday. Take care.

850
00:36:02.294 --> 00:36:04.595
- Take care. - Take care.

851
00:36:04.794 --> 00:36:05.834
Goodbye.

852
00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:09.075
(He's embarrassed to show appreciation...)

853
00:36:10.274 --> 00:36:12.905
(so he just let them leave first.)

854
00:36:17.845 --> 00:36:21.814
(Left alone, he stays there for quite a while.)

855
00:36:25.254 --> 00:36:27.785
(Goodbye, Father.)

856
00:36:29.155 --> 00:36:31.894
(Joo Hyuck's heartwarming comment made him...)

857
00:36:33.265 --> 00:36:36.435
(miss his dad even more on this summer day.)

858
00:36:38.464 --> 00:36:40.405
Give me the water.

859
00:36:40.405 --> 00:36:42.175
(He was as innocent as a boy.)

860
00:36:42.705 --> 00:36:45.104
- Kim Joo Hyuck! - Kim Joo Hyuck!

861
00:36:45.405 --> 00:36:48.004
This is all my fault.

862
00:36:48.475 --> 00:36:51.714
(He was a warm-hearted person.)

863
00:36:55.814 --> 00:36:56.854
Hello.

864
00:36:57.685 --> 00:36:59.555
I'm delivering your mail.

865
00:37:00.055 --> 00:37:01.655
- Bye. - Thank you.

866
00:37:01.655 --> 00:37:03.754
- Thank you. - You're welcome. Bye.

867
00:37:04.294 --> 00:37:08.294
(Kim Joo Hyuck was a nice person.)

868
00:37:09.035 --> 00:37:12.365
Ma'am, I miss you.

869
00:37:12.664 --> 00:37:14.705
So now we'll go ahead...

870
00:37:14.705 --> 00:37:18.175
and let them decide on who they want as workers.

871
00:37:18.504 --> 00:37:21.905
I'm choosing the one in the red shirt.

872
00:37:21.905 --> 00:37:23.374
- What? - Ma'am!

873
00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:25.584
- Me? - No way.

874
00:37:25.584 --> 00:37:27.515
- You can't do this to us. - Ma'am.

875
00:37:27.515 --> 00:37:29.655
I'm wearing a red shirt as well.

876
00:37:29.655 --> 00:37:32.785
The moment I walked in and saw you all,

877
00:37:33.024 --> 00:37:34.354
I immediately grew fond of him.

878
00:37:34.655 --> 00:37:36.254
- That's impossible. - Please, ma'am.

879
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.394
They're making decisions based on looks.

880
00:37:38.394 --> 00:37:40.564
This isn't about who they fancy.

881
00:37:40.624 --> 00:37:42.265
He looks like my son.

882
00:37:43.664 --> 00:37:46.064
(Joo Hyuck will go to the market.)

883
00:37:47.405 --> 00:37:48.564
(Joo Hyuck heads downtown.)

884
00:37:48.564 --> 00:37:50.975
Why did you pick me?

885
00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:54.245
When all six of you were standing in front of me,

886
00:37:54.374 --> 00:37:58.075
I wanted to pick you. You reminded me of my son.

887
00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:00.885
Then I will call you Mom...

888
00:38:01.285 --> 00:38:04.285
the whole day today.

889
00:38:04.354 --> 00:38:06.325
Mom. I will call you Mom.

890
00:38:08.254 --> 00:38:10.425
Actually, I saw a photo studio.

891
00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:13.794
I wanted to take a picture with her.

892
00:38:14.064 --> 00:38:16.734
(Anyhow,)

893
00:38:16.734 --> 00:38:18.694
(he starts to freshen up.)

894
00:38:19.935 --> 00:38:22.874
You should comb your hair before taking the picture.

895
00:38:24.205 --> 00:38:26.245
You should look pretty in the picture.

896
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:30.274
Which position should we take?

897
00:38:30.414 --> 00:38:32.515
It'd be good if you sit close to each other.

898
00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:33.714
Put your hand around her.

899
00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:38.984
- Please print two. - Okay.

900
00:38:43.455 --> 00:38:46.095
- You look great in it. - Do I?

901
00:38:47.164 --> 00:38:48.194
(Satisfied)

902
00:38:48.194 --> 00:38:51.894
- Thank you. - I wanted to do this.

903
00:38:51.894 --> 00:38:53.064
He's like my son.

904
00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:55.705
(A picture of good memories)

905
00:38:56.305 --> 00:39:00.274
Come on out, my juniors!

906
00:39:00.405 --> 00:39:02.714
Excuse me. Hello.

907
00:39:04.814 --> 00:39:05.914
(Joo Hyuck came to visit his juniors.)

908
00:39:07.414 --> 00:39:10.055
- Hello. - My gosh.

909
00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:12.385
- It's One Night Two Days. - My gosh.

910
00:39:12.825 --> 00:39:14.825
- Unbelievable. - Hello.

911
00:39:15.084 --> 00:39:17.254
I'm your senior. Please say hello back to me.

912
00:39:17.254 --> 00:39:18.325
- Hello. - Hello.

913
00:39:19.394 --> 00:39:21.265
- What year are you in? - We'll be the 41st...

914
00:39:21.265 --> 00:39:22.734
- graduates. - 40th?

915
00:39:22.734 --> 00:39:24.064
- 41st. - 41st?

916
00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:25.734
I'm a 16th graduate.

917
00:39:27.305 --> 00:39:28.604
(Nice to meet you, Joo Hyuck.)

918
00:39:28.834 --> 00:39:29.834
Hello!

919
00:39:30.205 --> 00:39:32.874
- Kim Joo Hyuck! - Kim Joo Hyuck!

920
00:39:33.075 --> 00:39:35.205
You guys are for sure my juniors!

921
00:39:35.444 --> 00:39:36.675
You guys are the best!

922
00:39:38.015 --> 00:39:39.785
(Let's go, Youngdong High!)

923
00:39:41.745 --> 00:39:43.214
Two bowls of rice cake ramen...

924
00:39:44.285 --> 00:39:45.885
- 3 bowls of rice. - and 3 bowls of rice.

925
00:39:45.885 --> 00:39:47.425
- It's 10 dollars. - All right.

926
00:39:47.555 --> 00:39:50.155
Please give us enough soup to eat with rice.

927
00:39:50.155 --> 00:39:51.194
Thank you.

928
00:39:53.495 --> 00:39:54.995
Gosh, it's hard. What are we doing?

929
00:39:56.635 --> 00:40:01.135
(He spent precious time with his juniors.)

930
00:40:01.135 --> 00:40:03.075
(One Night Two Days Field Trip Talent Show)

931
00:40:07.874 --> 00:40:08.874
This is good.

932
00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:10.675
I know. It's big, isn't it?

933
00:40:11.774 --> 00:40:14.044
It's uncomfortable in a sleeping bag.

934
00:40:14.885 --> 00:40:17.414
(The wild variety professional is kind.)

935
00:40:17.754 --> 00:40:21.825
This is my first time to sleep in a tent.

936
00:40:21.825 --> 00:40:23.754
This is fun. It'll be a nice memory for me.

937
00:40:23.925 --> 00:40:25.095
In 1, 2, and 3.

938
00:40:27.294 --> 00:40:29.964
(Sometimes he was a mentor in life.)

939
00:40:30.334 --> 00:40:32.664
People say we're smart,

940
00:40:32.664 --> 00:40:35.935
but there's a lot of competition in school.

941
00:40:35.935 --> 00:40:38.874
We keep comparing ourselves to others here.

942
00:40:38.874 --> 00:40:41.245
It makes us suffer from low self-esteem...

943
00:40:41.245 --> 00:40:43.044
while other people praise us.

944
00:40:43.675 --> 00:40:45.314
I was just told to go to Seoul National University.

945
00:40:45.584 --> 00:40:47.515
I thought everything would be okay if I did.

946
00:40:47.515 --> 00:40:50.955
I thought I'd be a hero or something once I go there.

947
00:40:51.955 --> 00:40:54.785
But now that I entered the school, it was nothing.

948
00:40:55.354 --> 00:40:58.124
- I understand. - I just got a student ID.

949
00:40:59.064 --> 00:41:02.394
For the first two years, I just drank...

950
00:41:02.394 --> 00:41:05.394
and played rugby every day.

951
00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:09.935
In fact, entering Seoul National University...

952
00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:11.975
wasn't his goal.

953
00:41:12.705 --> 00:41:14.845
It's just that he just tried...

954
00:41:14.845 --> 00:41:17.575
to come up to the expectations...

955
00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:20.785
of people around him.

956
00:41:20.785 --> 00:41:23.084
He wasn't in his decision.

957
00:41:23.084 --> 00:41:25.854
"What do I really like?"

958
00:41:25.854 --> 00:41:27.555
That's what he is thinking right now.

959
00:41:27.555 --> 00:41:29.294
If you're not sure whether you like it or not,

960
00:41:29.694 --> 00:41:30.725
you should go further on your way.

961
00:41:31.794 --> 00:41:33.064
Then you can think about it again.

962
00:41:33.394 --> 00:41:36.135
You don't have to feel afraid and step back yet.

963
00:41:36.135 --> 00:41:37.734
Just keep going.

964
00:41:38.064 --> 00:41:39.865
You're still young.

965
00:41:39.865 --> 00:41:40.865
(You're still at the beginning of the game.)

966
00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.334
You still have plenty of chances.

967
00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.644
Whatever you do, things can get hard.

968
00:41:45.644 --> 00:41:47.604
Even when you do something you like,

969
00:41:47.604 --> 00:41:49.774
you will go through hardships...

970
00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:52.914
and get exhausted from time to time.

971
00:41:52.914 --> 00:41:57.015
But there'd be one thing that makes you not quit.

972
00:41:57.455 --> 00:41:59.325
There'd be a lot of bad things,

973
00:41:59.325 --> 00:42:01.385
but this one thing would make you very happy.

974
00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:05.055
And it'd give you the power not to give up.

975
00:42:05.464 --> 00:42:06.765
You should choose something like that.

976
00:42:07.064 --> 00:42:09.595
Then you'll love what you do your whole life.

977
00:42:10.664 --> 00:42:13.164
You can't like everything about your job.

978
00:42:15.774 --> 00:42:17.175
(Hello)

979
00:42:17.575 --> 00:42:18.635
Hello.

980
00:42:19.144 --> 00:42:20.475
Look at him.

981
00:42:20.944 --> 00:42:23.175
It kind of looks like Defconn.

982
00:42:23.745 --> 00:42:25.175
Defconn.

983
00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:27.444
(It looks just like him.)

984
00:42:28.044 --> 00:42:29.115
It looks peaceful.

985
00:42:30.185 --> 00:42:32.484
Go fight it.

986
00:42:32.484 --> 00:42:34.124
Look. She knows it's a camera.

987
00:42:36.495 --> 00:42:37.555
Here.

988
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:40.024
(He was an emotionally warm person.)

989
00:42:41.694 --> 00:42:45.095
(He was a warm-hearted friend.)

990
00:42:45.294 --> 00:42:47.604
I met Geun Young when she was in middle school.

991
00:42:48.135 --> 00:42:49.975
- In middle school? - That's when I met her.

992
00:42:49.975 --> 00:42:52.405
- She was so pretty then. - What about now?

993
00:42:52.405 --> 00:42:55.405
You're still pretty. She still has the eyes.

994
00:42:55.405 --> 00:42:58.675
I can't believe a girl can have such beautiful eyes.

995
00:42:59.214 --> 00:43:00.685
Whenever I see her,

996
00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.914
I'm surprised by how honest she is.

997
00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:03.984
Honest.

998
00:43:04.155 --> 00:43:06.185
She's a girl of sound mind.

999
00:43:06.185 --> 00:43:08.455
- She's so good. - I see.

1000
00:43:08.455 --> 00:43:09.995
I heard people saying that.

1001
00:43:09.995 --> 00:43:11.995
What kind of man would take her?

1002
00:43:12.595 --> 00:43:14.964
- He's worried. - I feel like her brother.

1003
00:43:14.964 --> 00:43:17.035
What kind of man do you want her to date?

1004
00:43:17.135 --> 00:43:19.464
- Pick one person. - Among the members.

1005
00:43:19.564 --> 00:43:20.664
Among the members of One Night Two Days?

1006
00:43:22.305 --> 00:43:24.205
(Don't be ridiculous.)

1007
00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:26.374
I can't answer that.

1008
00:43:26.374 --> 00:43:27.644
She deserves a better man.

1009
00:43:27.745 --> 00:43:29.975
She needs a man with a similar character.

1010
00:43:29.975 --> 00:43:31.044
What's her hobby?

1011
00:43:31.044 --> 00:43:32.044
She's a homebody.

1012
00:43:32.814 --> 00:43:34.544
- Really? - She likes to be home.

1013
00:43:34.544 --> 00:43:35.984
Geun Young even told me...

1014
00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:38.584
she barely goes to a cafe near her house.

1015
00:43:39.685 --> 00:43:41.524
It must've been hard for her to decide to be here.

1016
00:43:41.854 --> 00:43:43.995
That's right. It was hard.

1017
00:43:43.995 --> 00:43:44.995
Do you watch TV at home?

1018
00:43:44.995 --> 00:43:47.865
Congratulations. You just got 11 new friends.

1019
00:43:47.865 --> 00:43:48.935
You're right.

1020
00:43:48.935 --> 00:43:50.095
(I just got 11 new friends.)

1021
00:43:50.664 --> 00:43:52.405
(This is so exciting.)

1022
00:43:52.664 --> 00:43:54.805
Please help Geun Young have a good time today.

1023
00:43:55.805 --> 00:43:56.834
(He's like her big brother.)

1024
00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:57.905
- Welcome. - Thank you.

1025
00:43:57.905 --> 00:43:59.944
In 1, 2, and 3. Hit me!

1026
00:44:02.575 --> 00:44:04.374
- Look at Geun Young. - She's good.

1027
00:44:04.845 --> 00:44:07.214
(You're good enough to be a singer.)

1028
00:44:07.214 --> 00:44:09.115
- Look at the score. - Yes!

1029
00:44:09.115 --> 00:44:10.914
- I can't believe this. - 95?

1030
00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:12.655
That's unbelievable.

1031
00:44:12.655 --> 00:44:14.185
- We did a good job. - I know.

1032
00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:15.425
I thought that.

1033
00:44:15.425 --> 00:44:19.495
I wanted to thank you for inviting me here.

1034
00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.834
She's so nice.

1035
00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:26.004
Spending some time with you yesterday,

1036
00:44:26.004 --> 00:44:29.734
I found myself thinking I feel so comfortable...

1037
00:44:29.734 --> 00:44:31.175
around you.

1038
00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:35.144
Now that we appeared in a TV show together,

1039
00:44:35.575 --> 00:44:37.245
people wouldn't get suspicious...

1040
00:44:37.245 --> 00:44:38.885
even if I bought you dinner or something.

1041
00:44:38.914 --> 00:44:40.015
You're right.

1042
00:44:40.885 --> 00:44:44.584
I don't want anything from you.

1043
00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.084
Whenever I'm with you,

1044
00:44:48.024 --> 00:44:51.095
you can think I'm always on your side.

1045
00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:52.964
- All the time. - You too.

1046
00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:56.734
He has a warm heart.

1047
00:44:57.734 --> 00:45:01.104
That's why I've worked with him the whole time.

1048
00:45:01.935 --> 00:45:02.975
He's humane.

1049
00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:06.745
(He's here to surprise his friend.)

1050
00:45:08.104 --> 00:45:09.115
(Bursting open)

1051
00:45:10.314 --> 00:45:11.414
What's going on?

1052
00:45:11.414 --> 00:45:13.144
- One Night... - What are you doing?

1053
00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:14.785
- One Night... - What's going on?

1054
00:45:14.785 --> 00:45:16.955
- Say it. One Night... - I can't believe this.

1055
00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:18.854
- Say it. One Night... - Don't do this.

1056
00:45:18.854 --> 00:45:19.984
(He's panicking.)

1057
00:45:19.984 --> 00:45:21.854
(He's the CEO of a famous agency.)

1058
00:45:22.354 --> 00:45:23.495
Just say it.

1059
00:45:26.194 --> 00:45:27.495
Right. We have this.

1060
00:45:27.495 --> 00:45:29.464
(He keeps Joo Hyuck's videos in his office.)

1061
00:45:29.464 --> 00:45:30.464
It's his first film.

1062
00:45:30.464 --> 00:45:33.265
I've collected Joo Hyuck's videos.

1063
00:45:33.504 --> 00:45:36.004
I used to bring these video tapes...

1064
00:45:36.004 --> 00:45:37.374
to a meeting with film companies.

1065
00:45:38.334 --> 00:45:40.475
(Joo Hyuck's first film, "Say Yes")

1066
00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:46.185
(Since his debut, he's appeared in many films...)

1067
00:45:46.785 --> 00:45:48.685
(to become the top actor in the country.)

1068
00:45:48.685 --> 00:45:50.484
(And Jong Do has been with him the whole time.)

1069
00:45:50.484 --> 00:45:51.984
It's faded.

1070
00:45:52.385 --> 00:45:55.385
- I know. - It's turned yellow.

1071
00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:56.524
(The faded labels show how old the tapes are.)

1072
00:45:57.624 --> 00:45:58.754
I've worked...

1073
00:45:59.964 --> 00:46:02.495
with him for the past 17 years.

1074
00:46:04.865 --> 00:46:10.175
I've always wanted to go on a trip with Jong Do.

1075
00:46:10.575 --> 00:46:13.075
But I couldn't do that alone with him.

1076
00:46:14.845 --> 00:46:16.314
But now, here we are.

1077
00:46:19.115 --> 00:46:22.714
To me, he's like...

1078
00:46:24.555 --> 00:46:26.254
my real brother.

1079
00:46:27.455 --> 00:46:28.524
I'm serious.

1080
00:46:29.055 --> 00:46:32.495
The happiest moment of my life was...

1081
00:46:33.024 --> 00:46:35.535
when Joo Hyuck shot a TV commercial with his dad.

1082
00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:38.135
His father didn't feel well back then.

1083
00:46:38.135 --> 00:46:39.234
At that time,

1084
00:46:40.035 --> 00:46:42.234
he called me to his car.

1085
00:46:42.935 --> 00:46:44.504
And he asked me...

1086
00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:49.745
to take good care of Joo Hyuck.

1087
00:46:49.745 --> 00:46:52.075
That memory just came back to me.

1088
00:46:52.745 --> 00:46:55.084
If I could be Joo Hyuck's pace maker,

1089
00:46:55.615 --> 00:46:58.055
it'd mean a lot to me.

1090
00:46:58.055 --> 00:46:59.984
(He decided to become Joo Hyuck's pace maker.)

1091
00:47:00.325 --> 00:47:02.524
(To Joo Hyuck, his father is...)

1092
00:47:03.294 --> 00:47:06.194
It's my first time to tear up as soon as I wake up.

1093
00:47:06.194 --> 00:47:07.225
Why?

1094
00:47:07.495 --> 00:47:08.564
The second I woke up,
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1095
00:47:09.294 --> 00:47:12.365
I heard the word "father" and burst into tears.

1096
00:47:12.365 --> 00:47:14.305
- I'm serious. - I see.

1097
00:47:14.305 --> 00:47:16.705
But I tried hard to hold back the tears.

1098
00:47:16.705 --> 00:47:19.245
You had no idea until I told you about it, right?

1099
00:47:19.245 --> 00:47:21.675
- He had no idea. - As soon as I heard...

1100
00:47:21.675 --> 00:47:23.544
he's your father,

1101
00:47:24.214 --> 00:47:26.015
I saw his benevolent smile.

1102
00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:28.885
Suddenly tears welled up in my eyes.

1103
00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:31.955
Three things came to my mind.

1104
00:47:31.955 --> 00:47:33.024
(Three things came to his mind.)

1105
00:47:34.155 --> 00:47:36.354
I was envious. It felt warm.

1106
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:38.825
And I missed my father.

1107
00:47:40.265 --> 00:47:41.425
I was so envious.

1108
00:47:42.365 --> 00:47:44.595
My second son is in the military.

1109
00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:45.765
- In the military? - Yes.

1110
00:47:45.865 --> 00:47:48.435
The man standing behind me is my second son.

1111
00:47:48.435 --> 00:47:51.635
He's in the military now.

1112
00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:54.245
You're such a happy family.

1113
00:47:54.245 --> 00:47:56.675
How did you feel when you sent him off...

1114
00:47:56.675 --> 00:47:57.944
- to the military? - How did I feel?

1115
00:47:58.644 --> 00:48:01.444
What is it like being a parent?

1116
00:48:01.444 --> 00:48:03.685
Actually I...

1117
00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:06.955
I barely cry, to be honest.

1118
00:48:06.955 --> 00:48:09.325
I'm kind of a cold-hearted person.

1119
00:48:10.294 --> 00:48:12.325
But I cried when my son joined the army.

1120
00:48:13.225 --> 00:48:14.765
What term was he on?

1121
00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:16.564
He couldn't even call me Dad.

1122
00:48:16.564 --> 00:48:21.234
He just shed big drops of tears without calling me.

1123
00:48:22.175 --> 00:48:23.635
He's a grown man though.

1124
00:48:24.205 --> 00:48:26.075
I couldn't hold back tears looking at him.

1125
00:48:27.245 --> 00:48:29.914
So we cried together.

1126
00:48:30.444 --> 00:48:32.245
That's when I realized...

1127
00:48:33.084 --> 00:48:35.084
I was very proud of him.

1128
00:48:36.385 --> 00:48:38.925
He shouted, "Salute!" And before I knew it,

1129
00:48:38.925 --> 00:48:41.785
I was taking the salute.

1130
00:48:42.254 --> 00:48:46.425
(A photo with his family)

1131
00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:51.794
(At Myeongdong Cathedral in 2014)

1132
00:48:54.464 --> 00:49:01.044
(At Myeongdong Cathedral in 1967)

1133
00:49:09.515 --> 00:49:10.584
Where did you get this picture?

1134
00:49:11.484 --> 00:49:13.425
- Why? Who are they? - Is he your father?

1135
00:49:13.425 --> 00:49:14.425
Yes.

1136
00:49:16.294 --> 00:49:17.354
Joo Hyuck.

1137
00:49:21.624 --> 00:49:26.964
(The late Kim Mu Saeng and his wife)

1138
00:49:30.705 --> 00:49:32.604
Is it Myeongdong Cathedral?

1139
00:49:33.874 --> 00:49:35.374
Did you take the picture knowing about this?

1140
00:49:37.044 --> 00:49:39.314
So are they your mother and father?

1141
00:49:40.544 --> 00:49:41.615
Oh my goodness.

1142
00:49:44.885 --> 00:49:52.595
(It's his first time to meet his parents' youth.)

1143
00:49:53.265 --> 00:49:57.765
(And)

1144
00:50:02.035 --> 00:50:06.345
(Samsung-dong home in 1976)

1145
00:50:08.475 --> 00:50:09.745
(Where are you, Joo Hyuck?)

1146
00:50:09.745 --> 00:50:11.544
- Where are you? - He's on the right.

1147
00:50:12.484 --> 00:50:13.944
- There. - On the right.

1148
00:50:16.155 --> 00:50:21.425
(They hold off on what they want to say.)

1149
00:50:22.754 --> 00:50:26.325
(First day of middle school in 1985)

1150
00:50:27.164 --> 00:50:28.394
Is that your graduation?

1151
00:50:30.294 --> 00:50:35.334
(Joo Hyuck's Seoul)

1152
00:50:36.935 --> 00:50:40.444
(Outskirts of Seoul in 1984)

1153
00:50:53.325 --> 00:50:57.854
(The pictures make them shed tears.)

1154
00:50:58.394 --> 00:51:01.725
The places you visited today are...

1155
00:51:03.564 --> 00:51:08.164
the places people we know...

1156
00:51:08.834 --> 00:51:13.745
had seen and visited.

1157
00:51:17.814 --> 00:51:21.185
This picture was taken in 1967.

1158
00:51:21.185 --> 00:51:22.354
(Myeong-dong, in the spring of 1967)

1159
00:51:23.084 --> 00:51:24.155
As you can see,

1160
00:51:25.385 --> 00:51:26.754
it's Kim Mu Saeng.

1161
00:51:27.254 --> 00:51:28.794
That's when they were dating.

1162
00:51:29.294 --> 00:51:31.325
That's from when your mom and dad were dating.

1163
00:51:31.325 --> 00:51:32.564
Have you seen this picture?

1164
00:51:33.294 --> 00:51:34.564
I don't remember.

1165
00:51:34.664 --> 00:51:36.234
I've never seen this picture before.

1166
00:51:36.234 --> 00:51:37.834
He told me that...

1167
00:51:38.294 --> 00:51:41.064
that picture is very precious to him.

1168
00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.104
(It's a very precious photograph.)

1169
00:51:42.104 --> 00:51:43.575
So he didn't show it to anyone,

1170
00:51:43.575 --> 00:51:45.004
and kept it for a long time.

1171
00:51:45.004 --> 00:51:46.144
(He kept it to himself.)

1172
00:51:46.144 --> 00:51:47.604
That's Myeongdong Cathedral.

1173
00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.044
You've never seen it before.

1174
00:51:49.044 --> 00:51:50.144
This is my first time seeing it.

1175
00:51:50.914 --> 00:51:53.214
Your dad is so stylish.

1176
00:51:53.385 --> 00:51:54.785
- Really? - Your mom as well.

1177
00:51:55.584 --> 00:51:57.155
- They're both cool. - They're young.

1178
00:51:57.854 --> 00:52:00.725
People didn't wear sunglasses like that then.

1179
00:52:00.725 --> 00:52:02.894
- They look great. - They're stylish.

1180
00:52:02.894 --> 00:52:04.694
Look at the scarf she's wearing.

1181
00:52:05.354 --> 00:52:07.624
(1967 style date)

1182
00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:11.495
My mom was Sejong University queen.

1183
00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.905
(She was Miss Sejong University.)

1184
00:52:13.004 --> 00:52:14.765
My dad snatched her.

1185
00:52:15.834 --> 00:52:16.834
Because she was the queen.

1186
00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:18.504
(The brave Kim Mu Saeng)

1187
00:52:20.104 --> 00:52:21.245
When was this?

1188
00:52:21.644 --> 00:52:24.414
I think I was 4 or 5 years old.

1189
00:52:24.845 --> 00:52:26.814
I'm on the right and that's my brother.

1190
00:52:26.814 --> 00:52:27.914
(His older brother is on the left.)

1191
00:52:28.584 --> 00:52:30.354
Was he a kind dad?

1192
00:52:31.084 --> 00:52:33.785
He was when I was young. But he was strict.

1193
00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:36.325
He was stern.

1194
00:52:38.194 --> 00:52:39.464
- Is it you? - Yes.

1195
00:52:39.464 --> 00:52:41.524
(Traveling together)

1196
00:52:41.524 --> 00:52:44.595
My dad liked viewing stones.

1197
00:52:44.865 --> 00:52:47.064
Do you see the stones by the riverside?

1198
00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:50.405
Collecting stones was a game we played.

1199
00:52:50.635 --> 00:52:53.205
The car trunk is opened to put the stones in.

1200
00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:57.044
I'm serious. We still have those stones at home.

1201
00:52:57.044 --> 00:52:58.785
You collected viewing stones.

1202
00:52:58.785 --> 00:52:59.814
(He must've been a difficult dad then.)

1203
00:53:00.444 --> 00:53:01.615
My dad was strict.

1204
00:53:01.615 --> 00:53:02.655
He was very strict.

1205
00:53:02.655 --> 00:53:04.655
Dads are strict when their kids are young.

1206
00:53:05.455 --> 00:53:06.455
By the time...

1207
00:53:07.155 --> 00:53:10.095
I saw his lonely side, he passed away.

1208
00:53:10.095 --> 00:53:11.394
I see.

1209
00:53:11.394 --> 00:53:14.425
I realized that my dad looked lonely.

1210
00:53:15.265 --> 00:53:17.464
He was not the stern dad he used to be.

1211
00:53:18.164 --> 00:53:19.635
I have so many regrets.

1212
00:53:19.635 --> 00:53:20.734
(Things he regret)

1213
00:53:20.734 --> 00:53:22.374
I never expressed my affection.

1214
00:53:23.675 --> 00:53:27.405
When I watch TV at night, when I see...

1215
00:53:28.504 --> 00:53:31.845
a heartwarming father and son moment,

1216
00:53:32.644 --> 00:53:34.214
I feel envious.

1217
00:53:35.285 --> 00:53:38.754
That's why I want to get married soon.

1218
00:53:39.084 --> 00:53:41.825
I want to become a dad and understand Dad.

1219
00:53:42.555 --> 00:53:43.754
Yes.

1220
00:53:46.024 --> 00:53:48.865
(No place is special from the beginning.)

1221
00:53:49.664 --> 00:53:53.564
(Memories make them special.)

1222
00:53:56.504 --> 00:54:01.745
(Do we have a special space?)

1223
00:54:03.644 --> 00:54:07.745
(Trips we took together)

1224
00:54:09.555 --> 00:54:12.084
I feel drowsy and sluggish.

1225
00:54:12.084 --> 00:54:14.024
Really? You shouldn't.

1226
00:54:14.754 --> 00:54:16.325
It's because I feel so at ease.

1227
00:54:16.655 --> 00:54:18.055
Let's start working hard.

1228
00:54:18.055 --> 00:54:19.064
(It's a feel good type of sluggish.)

1229
00:54:19.064 --> 00:54:20.124
My mind...

1230
00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:23.265
is very much at ease.

1231
00:54:23.464 --> 00:54:25.234
- Because you're here. - Yes.

1232
00:54:26.004 --> 00:54:29.175
I saw old men sitting in their chairs.

1233
00:54:29.175 --> 00:54:30.475
I understand them completely.

1234
00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:32.374
Sitting down and doing nothing.

1235
00:54:32.675 --> 00:54:34.774
Is this your first time visiting an island?

1236
00:54:34.975 --> 00:54:36.444
My grandparents live on an island.

1237
00:54:36.444 --> 00:54:38.245
- Right. - Geoje Island.

1238
00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:39.644
So...

1239
00:54:40.385 --> 00:54:43.814
my mom's dad ran a fishery.

1240
00:54:44.555 --> 00:54:47.825
There are a lot of photos taken on the island.

1241
00:54:47.825 --> 00:54:49.194
(Childhood photos with memories)

1242
00:54:49.194 --> 00:54:52.964
I was so tanned except for my butt.

1243
00:54:52.964 --> 00:54:53.964
(If only he could...)

1244
00:54:53.964 --> 00:54:55.064
It was wonderful.

1245
00:54:55.064 --> 00:54:56.464
(look back on our memories like this.)

1246
00:54:57.935 --> 00:54:59.164
What's the next song?

1247
00:54:59.164 --> 00:55:00.535
(The weather was really great.)

1248
00:55:00.535 --> 00:55:03.604
(The scenery was beautiful.)

1249
00:55:06.274 --> 00:55:07.305
(The guys traveling with me are funny.)

1250
00:55:07.305 --> 00:55:08.814
- Yes. - Back then.

1251
00:55:09.975 --> 00:55:11.515
(October 25, 2015, Emotional Fall Trip)

1252
00:55:11.515 --> 00:55:13.444
- Watching baseball? - When I'm dreaming?

1253
00:55:13.914 --> 00:55:15.455
- It's nice. - Some kids?

1254
00:55:15.655 --> 00:55:17.354
This music is like restaurant music.

1255
00:55:19.185 --> 00:55:20.955
- Gosh. - What do you like?

1256
00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.455
- I like pork cutlet. - The song is nice.

1257
00:55:23.425 --> 00:55:24.555
It's romantic.

1258
00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:26.325
Warm up the rolls please.

1259
00:55:30.595 --> 00:55:31.935
Order a parfait.

1260
00:55:32.535 --> 00:55:34.305
- Parfait. - Parfait.

1261
00:55:34.734 --> 00:55:36.705
- Gosh. - Parfait.

1262
00:55:36.705 --> 00:55:39.374
Every table had a phone.

1263
00:55:40.075 --> 00:55:42.615
You call table number three and they'd pick up.

1264
00:55:42.845 --> 00:55:44.544
You see a girl sitting in a cafe.

1265
00:55:44.544 --> 00:55:45.745
You go inside...

1266
00:55:45.745 --> 00:55:47.544
and call the cafe.

1267
00:55:47.615 --> 00:55:51.084
You ask for the girl who's sitting there.

1268
00:55:52.155 --> 00:55:53.225
Jong Min.

1269
00:55:55.825 --> 00:55:58.124
(How gentle is the rain)

1270
00:56:01.294 --> 00:56:02.935
(Softly on the meadow)

1271
00:56:04.035 --> 00:56:06.234
(They sing in gibberish.)

1272
00:56:08.305 --> 00:56:10.035
I thought at least one of us would remember.

1273
00:56:10.035 --> 00:56:11.135
Nobody knows the lyrics.

1274
00:56:14.845 --> 00:56:16.044
How could I memorize them?

1275
00:56:16.044 --> 00:56:17.575
(Not all the days were sunny like this.)

1276
00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:19.544
- It's nice. - It's great.

1277
00:56:21.885 --> 00:56:23.084
I feel like traveling today.

1278
00:56:23.084 --> 00:56:24.814
Yes, it's nice outside.

1279
00:56:25.084 --> 00:56:26.624
This is perfect.

1280
00:56:26.624 --> 00:56:29.294
(Looking back, all the days were perfect.)

1281
00:56:30.495 --> 00:56:32.294
(Winter mountain)

1282
00:56:32.294 --> 00:56:33.325
It's beautiful.

1283
00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:37.734
(The snowy landscape leaves them in awe.)

1284
00:56:38.805 --> 00:56:40.664
(Spring sea)

1285
00:56:42.774 --> 00:56:45.075
- Gosh. - Right now!

1286
00:56:45.374 --> 00:56:47.245
- They're migrating. - Yes.

1287
00:56:47.245 --> 00:56:49.075
(They see the change of seasons.)

1288
00:56:50.444 --> 00:56:52.144
(Summer island)

1289
00:56:54.084 --> 00:56:55.885
(Childish memories)

1290
00:56:55.885 --> 00:56:56.914
Get ready.

1291
00:56:58.185 --> 00:57:00.685
(Fall river)

1292
00:57:02.854 --> 00:57:03.925
It's stronger than you think.

1293
00:57:04.555 --> 00:57:05.725
Don't pull.

1294
00:57:05.725 --> 00:57:07.164
(Careful)

1295
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:12.405
(Sometimes they were a bit risky.)

1296
00:57:12.405 --> 00:57:14.035
- Joo Hyuck! - My shoe!

1297
00:57:14.265 --> 00:57:15.675
It's all wet.

1298
00:57:16.075 --> 00:57:17.774
(When hiking a rough path,)

1299
00:57:19.004 --> 00:57:22.544
(Joo Hyuck was always leading the way.)

1300
00:57:23.015 --> 00:57:24.345
- Come quickly. - Hey.

1301
00:57:24.345 --> 00:57:25.845
Hello!

1302
00:57:26.185 --> 00:57:27.214
Is this it?

1303
00:57:28.854 --> 00:57:29.885
It's nice.

1304
00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:31.555
It's beautiful.

1305
00:57:31.555 --> 00:57:32.854
(He was always humble before nature.)

1306
00:57:34.124 --> 00:57:35.595
(They visited beautiful cities.)

1307
00:57:35.595 --> 00:57:37.524
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I see 5.

1308
00:57:39.664 --> 00:57:44.135
(The memories of experiencing the wild)

1309
00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:46.535
Just run. Keep running.

1310
00:57:53.705 --> 00:57:57.944
(The five naughty guys got an older brother.)

1311
00:57:57.944 --> 00:57:59.515
- Good job. - No.

1312
00:58:00.484 --> 00:58:03.714
(On the road they walked together,)

1313
00:58:03.714 --> 00:58:05.655
- It's windy. - We're here.

1314
00:58:06.785 --> 00:58:08.425
- What's that? - Look.

1315
00:58:08.425 --> 00:58:10.555
- Look at that. - Gosh.

1316
00:58:10.555 --> 00:58:12.524
(they saw the nature's wonder.)

1317
00:58:12.524 --> 00:58:13.564
Look at them.

1318
00:58:17.064 --> 00:58:18.664
- They're splitting. - Gosh.

1319
00:58:19.135 --> 00:58:20.504
Look at that.

1320
00:58:20.504 --> 00:58:23.374
(The first day of a new year)

1321
00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.874
(Midsummer nights)

1322
00:58:34.084 --> 00:58:37.115
(He said he wanted to see the world.)

1323
00:58:38.155 --> 00:58:40.484
(He adopted quickly.)

1324
00:58:40.725 --> 00:58:42.155
(Yummy)

1325
00:58:43.794 --> 00:58:47.425
(So there had been a lot of incidents.)

1326
00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:52.435
I can't believe this.

1327
00:58:52.435 --> 00:58:55.365
(At times he was like a boy.)

1328
00:58:56.035 --> 00:58:57.104
Did you eat it?

1329
00:59:03.544 --> 00:59:06.544
(He did his best...)

1330
00:59:07.385 --> 00:59:09.354
(on an unfamiliar variety show.)

1331
00:59:09.455 --> 00:59:11.214
You said it'd be easy today.

1332
00:59:12.925 --> 00:59:14.984
- That's it! - I got it!

1333
00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:17.354
(He gave us the gift of knowing...)

1334
00:59:17.354 --> 00:59:19.365
(the cheerfulness only those who knew him know.)

1335
00:59:22.294 --> 00:59:23.635
I'm getting tired.

1336
00:59:23.635 --> 00:59:25.194
(Every day was new.)

1337
00:59:25.194 --> 00:59:26.265
She's excited.

1338
00:59:27.435 --> 00:59:30.805
(Good people we got to meet through him)

1339
00:59:32.745 --> 00:59:33.745
(Laughing)

1340
00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:41.414
(Someone who was and wasn't talkative)

1341
00:59:41.414 --> 00:59:43.854
(Someone we couldn't know)

1342
00:59:48.354 --> 00:59:51.524
- One Night! - Two Days!

1343
00:59:58.805 --> 01:00:01.004
(On every road they walked on together)

1344
01:00:01.004 --> 01:00:02.675
- Gosh. - Look at that.

1345
01:00:02.675 --> 01:00:04.234
I should take a panorama shot.

1346
01:00:04.575 --> 01:00:06.675
- Can we sit here? - Yes.

1347
01:00:06.675 --> 01:00:07.805
Here on the center.

1348
01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:08.814
Why don't we...

1349
01:00:09.714 --> 01:00:11.944
take a nice picture together here?

1350
01:00:11.944 --> 01:00:14.084
When we look at it in our 60s or 70s later,

1351
01:00:14.285 --> 01:00:16.814
it will remind us of today.

1352
01:00:17.185 --> 01:00:19.754
- Something like this? - We should gather up.

1353
01:00:19.754 --> 01:00:22.155
- Make the happiest face. - Yes.

1354
01:00:23.194 --> 01:00:25.624
- I'll take it now. 1, 2. - A moment to remember.

1355
01:00:26.365 --> 01:00:27.595
One Night,

1356
01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:29.164
- Two Days! - Two Days!

1357
01:00:29.365 --> 01:00:30.894
- Two Days! - Two Days!

1358
01:00:36.205 --> 01:00:38.905
(Thanks to the memories we made with him,)

1359
01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:41.205
- One Night... - Two Days!

1360
01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.374
(in this wide world,)

1361
01:00:42.544 --> 01:00:44.414
- Gosh, thank you. - Great work.

1362
01:00:44.414 --> 01:00:46.745
(we have special places now.)

1363
01:00:48.714 --> 01:00:49.955
(A long time ago,)

1364
01:00:49.955 --> 01:00:51.785
Joo Hyuck. Hurry up, and get ready now.

1365
01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.024
(we met unexpectedly.)

1366
01:00:54.024 --> 01:00:56.655
Why are you still talking? Hurry up.

1367
01:00:57.055 --> 01:01:00.825
(Six men who were awkward around each other...)

1368
01:01:02.024 --> 01:01:04.834
(became good friends,)

1369
01:01:05.234 --> 01:01:06.234
Nice to meet you.

1370
01:01:08.135 --> 01:01:10.705
(and 2 years have passed.)

1371
01:01:12.905 --> 01:01:15.104
(His mischievous friends...)

1372
01:01:16.044 --> 01:01:18.115
(who now know him so well visited him again.)

1373
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.245
We came because we miss the old days.

1374
01:01:20.245 --> 01:01:21.245
You're as annoying as then.

1375
01:01:22.555 --> 01:01:24.285
You haven't changed at all.

1376
01:01:24.285 --> 01:01:25.955
(The last trip)

1377
01:01:29.825 --> 01:01:32.725
(The trip began as usual.)

1378
01:01:35.194 --> 01:01:36.834
(He knew Jong Min's fear of heights.)

1379
01:01:37.964 --> 01:01:39.004
Jump!

1380
01:01:40.905 --> 01:01:43.374
(He always let others win and made people laugh.)

1381
01:01:44.305 --> 01:01:46.075
(A hard worker)

1382
01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:49.475
It's delicious.

1383
01:01:49.475 --> 01:01:50.475
(Lying)

1384
01:01:51.214 --> 01:01:52.214
(Throwing up citron)

1385
01:01:52.515 --> 01:01:53.914
- Go. - One more turn.

1386
01:01:53.914 --> 01:01:57.314
(They played like boys for food and place to sleep.)

1387
01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:58.314
There you go.

1388
01:01:59.455 --> 01:02:02.555
(Even when those times were ending,)

1389
01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:04.095
1, 2, 3.

1390
01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:08.464
(he acted as usual until the end.)

1391
01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:13.604
(Perhaps,)

1392
01:02:15.975 --> 01:02:20.975
(he never showed his feelings that day...)

1393
01:02:23.814 --> 01:02:26.214
(because of his thoughtful character.)

1394
01:02:28.185 --> 01:02:30.685
I should take a picture to remember this.

1395
01:02:39.095 --> 01:02:40.095
I took it.

1396
01:02:41.664 --> 01:02:42.694
You seem to be having fun.

1397
01:02:42.935 --> 01:02:43.995
It's a nice picture.

1398
01:02:46.104 --> 01:02:47.305
They're all sleeping.

1399
01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:48.664
(He only took a picture in secret.)

1400
01:02:49.374 --> 01:02:52.504
It's our second anniversary today.

1401
01:02:52.504 --> 01:02:55.305
Also, this is the last trip with Joo Hyuck.

1402
01:02:55.475 --> 01:02:57.345
- Let's hear... - I'm jealous.

1403
01:02:58.914 --> 01:03:00.984
- how he feels. - I'm jealous of him.

1404
01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:05.115
First of all, time passed so quickly.

1405
01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:06.955
It feels like it's only been a year,

1406
01:03:06.955 --> 01:03:08.624
but two years have passed already.

1407
01:03:09.894 --> 01:03:13.365
When I first came here, I was afraid.

1408
01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:16.495
But after the 1st and the 2nd filming,

1409
01:03:16.564 --> 01:03:18.765
I was glad I joined this show...

1410
01:03:18.765 --> 01:03:19.964
because of these guys.

1411
01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:21.004
(It's because of the members.)

1412
01:03:21.004 --> 01:03:23.834
It didn't feel like work.

1413
01:03:24.205 --> 01:03:25.675
I came here to have big laughter...

1414
01:03:26.745 --> 01:03:27.944
once in every two weeks.

1415
01:03:28.745 --> 01:03:31.615
I came here to be happy. That's how it felt.

1416
01:03:31.944 --> 01:03:34.314
(Why are you leaving?)

1417
01:03:34.314 --> 01:03:35.555
Why are you leaving?

1418
01:03:35.555 --> 01:03:37.584
(Stop talking nonsense.)

1419
01:03:37.584 --> 01:03:39.885
- Why all of a sudden? - That's right.

1420
01:03:40.124 --> 01:03:42.655
Tell us the reason why you're leaving.

1421
01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:44.394
- Joo Hyuck. - Be honest.

1422
01:03:44.394 --> 01:03:45.995
He said it made him happy.

1423
01:03:45.995 --> 01:03:48.664
- Many would be curious. - Listen. Earlier,

1424
01:03:48.664 --> 01:03:51.095
Joon Ho and others said, "Why are you leaving?"

1425
01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:53.964
"We came all the way here because of you."

1426
01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:57.374
I was happy to hear those things.

1427
01:03:57.905 --> 01:04:01.475
If they had been sad and solemn...

1428
01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:03.214
because of me,

1429
01:04:04.015 --> 01:04:07.444
I would've thought that I'm not...

1430
01:04:07.885 --> 01:04:08.955
their true friend yet.

1431
01:04:08.955 --> 01:04:10.814
So why are you leaving?

1432
01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:14.455
Why are you leaving? I've been asking since morning.

1433
01:04:15.354 --> 01:04:17.655
Why aren't you telling us the reason?

1434
01:04:18.194 --> 01:04:19.865
- Why am I leaving? - Yes.

1435
01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:21.694
- Be honest. - Really?

1436
01:04:21.694 --> 01:04:23.135
- Yes. - You should be honest.

1437
01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:26.104
To be honest, this isn't my main job.

1438
01:04:26.104 --> 01:04:28.104
(This isn't my main job.)

1439
01:04:28.104 --> 01:04:29.604
I'm a singer too.

1440
01:04:30.205 --> 01:04:32.144
- Hey. - Jong Min.

1441
01:04:33.004 --> 01:04:35.714
- Hey. - This is your main job.

1442
01:04:35.714 --> 01:04:36.814
I've mentioned this a lot.

1443
01:04:37.845 --> 01:04:39.084
I'm not helpful to this team.

1444
01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:44.615
I often want to do funnier things and be more active.

1445
01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.885
I want to, and I think I can,

1446
01:04:47.285 --> 01:04:48.325
but I hold myself back.

1447
01:04:49.354 --> 01:04:50.694
At that moment,

1448
01:04:51.095 --> 01:04:54.725
it makes me think I'm not helpful to you.

1449
01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:57.664
I was going to quit after only a year.

1450
01:04:57.664 --> 01:04:58.834
We know.

1451
01:04:58.834 --> 01:05:00.865
But I couldn't do it because of you guys.

1452
01:05:01.834 --> 01:05:02.935
Thank you.

1453
01:05:05.175 --> 01:05:06.805
That doesn't sound so sincere.

1454
01:05:06.805 --> 01:05:07.905
Are you sleeping?

1455
01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:09.115
- You're sleepy, right? - Are you sleepy?

1456
01:05:09.115 --> 01:05:10.615
I listened to him with my heart.

1457
01:05:10.814 --> 01:05:13.414
It's the last trip, and look what he's wearing.

1458
01:05:13.414 --> 01:05:15.115
- What is that? - What were you thinking?

1459
01:05:15.484 --> 01:05:16.914
Girls love it.

1460
01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.015
(Is it for the viewers?)

1461
01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.524
Aren't we doing this for the viewers?

1462
01:05:21.024 --> 01:05:23.294
I also want to say something to the viewers.

1463
01:05:23.854 --> 01:05:25.564
- Now? - Seniors watch it too.

1464
01:05:25.564 --> 01:05:26.995
- I know. - To him right there?

1465
01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:30.535
I've been on this show for two years,

1466
01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:35.705
and I learned that the members and the staff...

1467
01:05:37.004 --> 01:05:39.305
are the best people I've ever met...

1468
01:05:40.405 --> 01:05:42.774
on any shows or movies.

1469
01:05:44.044 --> 01:05:47.144
I mean it. These boys are...

1470
01:05:47.345 --> 01:05:49.155
- These boys are... - She's crying.

1471
01:05:49.185 --> 01:05:50.885
It has begun.

1472
01:05:51.285 --> 01:05:53.124
- She's crying. - There she goes.

1473
01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:54.825
I'm talking right now.

1474
01:05:55.794 --> 01:05:57.995
- Come on. - Don't interrupt me.

1475
01:05:57.995 --> 01:05:59.595
It's because he complimented the staff.

1476
01:06:00.124 --> 01:06:01.664
- Please continue. - May I?

1477
01:06:01.664 --> 01:06:03.834
- Sure. Go on. - Please understand.

1478
01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:06.305
Some people would be glad that I'm leaving,

1479
01:06:06.734 --> 01:06:09.475
and some people wouldn't want me to leave.

1480
01:06:09.604 --> 01:06:10.734
I think...

1481
01:06:11.104 --> 01:06:13.944
it'd feel weird to be home on Friday and Saturday.

1482
01:06:15.575 --> 01:06:18.444
What if I set up a tent and sleep in it at home?

1483
01:06:19.214 --> 01:06:20.644
But we only meet every other week.

1484
01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:21.745
Yes.

1485
01:06:22.185 --> 01:06:23.984
You're right. I'm sorry.

1486
01:06:24.655 --> 01:06:25.685
That's right.

1487
01:06:27.685 --> 01:06:28.685
(The day grows darker.)

1488
01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:30.294
Great work, everyone.

1489
01:06:30.294 --> 01:06:32.225
- Thanks. - Thank you all.

1490
01:06:32.225 --> 01:06:34.095
I'm glad all of us are sleeping together tonight.

1491
01:06:34.095 --> 01:06:36.495
- Good night. - Thank you, Joo Hyuck.

1492
01:06:36.495 --> 01:06:39.405
- Good night. - Thank you.

1493
01:06:39.564 --> 01:06:43.004
It's our last night with Joo Hyuck.

1494
01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:44.734
It is.

1495
01:06:44.774 --> 01:06:47.245
It's sad that we can no longer see you...

1496
01:06:47.745 --> 01:06:50.944
run off happily when the filming ends.

1497
01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.944
That's true.

1498
01:06:53.015 --> 01:06:54.084
Joo Hyuck.

1499
01:06:54.084 --> 01:06:56.714
Give us good advice before we go to sleep.

1500
01:06:57.285 --> 01:07:00.124
You don't need any. You're already doing good.

1501
01:07:00.785 --> 01:07:02.555
Just keep it up.

1502
01:07:04.794 --> 01:07:06.294
(They can't imagine...)

1503
01:07:06.294 --> 01:07:07.995
(his absence yet.)

1504
01:07:08.694 --> 01:07:11.294
I can imagine what you'd say on the next episode.

1505
01:07:11.765 --> 01:07:13.805
"I don't feel like we're missing anything."

1506
01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.104
How did you know that?

1507
01:07:15.504 --> 01:07:17.975
- We won't feel it at all. - When Joon Ho was out,

1508
01:07:17.975 --> 01:07:19.175
you already saw what happened.

1509
01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:22.214
No one would notice it even if one of us is gone.

1510
01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:24.214
We had so much fun when Joon Ho wasn't here.

1511
01:07:24.214 --> 01:07:26.285
- Was it fun? - He's right.

1512
01:07:26.414 --> 01:07:27.515
It was awesome.

1513
01:07:28.385 --> 01:07:30.115
It's already end of the day.

1514
01:07:30.584 --> 01:07:32.885
(The last day breaks.)

1515
01:07:36.995 --> 01:07:39.794
(It seems Joo Hyuck can't really sleep.)

1516
01:07:47.205 --> 01:07:49.504
(He watches the others sleep.)

1517
01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:51.675
(Chuckling)

1518
01:07:53.104 --> 01:07:56.644
I wonder if I'll ever sleep in a room...

1519
01:07:57.675 --> 01:07:58.845
with other guys again.

1520
01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:02.185
(Sound asleep)

1521
01:08:03.414 --> 01:08:07.385
I usually can't sleep if someone snores.

1522
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.225
(He was sensitive,)

1523
01:08:09.225 --> 01:08:10.225
But I slept fine with them.

1524
01:08:10.225 --> 01:08:11.954
(but he got used to their sleeping habits.)

1525
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:15.935
They look like babies.

1526
01:08:17.735 --> 01:08:18.904
(Gazing)

1527
01:08:19.034 --> 01:08:20.504
I should join them on a trip later.

1528
01:08:20.504 --> 01:08:22.834
(It feels sadder as the parting comes closer.)

1529
01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:23.874
That's enough for me.

1530
01:08:27.105 --> 01:08:29.945
(One Night Two Days is a travel show.)

1531
01:08:31.515 --> 01:08:33.114
(We need to get used to meeting new people,)

1532
01:08:34.185 --> 01:08:36.754
(and we need to get used to parting a little more.)

1533
01:08:37.584 --> 01:08:39.284
(Today,)

1534
01:08:39.284 --> 01:08:40.784
(another parting awaits.)

1535
01:08:44.294 --> 01:08:46.395
(They go to see Joo Hyuck off.)

1536
01:08:46.494 --> 01:08:47.494
Are you leaving now?

1537
01:08:47.494 --> 01:08:49.065
- Are you leaving? - He should.

1538
01:08:50.034 --> 01:08:52.105
(He walks slowly.)

1539
01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:56.034
It was nice working with you all.

1540
01:08:56.404 --> 01:08:59.345
I don't know what to say. Keep working hard.

1541
01:08:59.975 --> 01:09:01.605
(He makes a joke to avoid the awkwardness.)

1542
01:09:01.605 --> 01:09:02.675
You should work hard.

1543
01:09:03.044 --> 01:09:04.914
- Bye, Joo Hyuck. - That's your car.

1544
01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:06.645
Did you say goodbye to the directors?

1545
01:09:06.645 --> 01:09:07.645
Not yet.

1546
01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:08.645
Guys.

1547
01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:11.515
They're uncomfortable because of the cameras.

1548
01:09:12.485 --> 01:09:15.385
- Eun Ji and... - I have to work tomorrow,

1549
01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:17.425
- but let's set a date. - Yes.

1550
01:09:17.855 --> 01:09:19.294
- Sure. - For a team dinner.

1551
01:09:19.294 --> 01:09:20.895
- Thank you. - I can't leave like this.

1552
01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.834
- I've had a great time. - Me too.

1553
01:09:22.834 --> 01:09:24.834
No, this will make me feel awkward again.

1554
01:09:26.565 --> 01:09:29.074
- Thank you. - I'm not good at this.

1555
01:09:29.074 --> 01:09:31.404
- He's crying. - What?

1556
01:09:31.404 --> 01:09:33.004
I saw his eyes filled with tears.

1557
01:09:33.004 --> 01:09:35.074
- What is this? - Come on.

1558
01:09:35.074 --> 01:09:36.874
These people are ridiculous.

1559
01:09:36.975 --> 01:09:39.845
- Is someone crying again? - You cry so easily.

1560
01:09:40.185 --> 01:09:41.544
(If you guys cry...)

1561
01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:45.114
Hey. You're making us look bad for not crying.

1562
01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:47.055
You're making me look bad too.

1563
01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:50.124
- Don't worry. - My gosh.

1564
01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:52.994
You worked the hardest.

1565
01:09:53.695 --> 01:09:55.294
You had a hard time during every shoot.

1566
01:09:55.765 --> 01:09:58.565
- Joo Hyuck seems stiff. - He's about to cry.

1567
01:09:58.565 --> 01:10:01.164
- Why? - Your face seems stiff.

1568
01:10:01.605 --> 01:10:02.775
You aren't your usual self.

1569
01:10:02.775 --> 01:10:03.935
- Is that so? - Yes.

1570
01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:05.544
I should get going.

1571
01:10:08.845 --> 01:10:09.845
I'm leaving.

1572
01:10:09.845 --> 01:10:10.914
Bye.

1573
01:10:10.914 --> 01:10:11.945
I'm leaving.

1574
01:10:13.145 --> 01:10:14.645
Goodbye.

1575
01:10:15.914 --> 01:10:17.485
(They might as well walk him home.)

1576
01:10:17.485 --> 01:10:18.485
Go away.

1577
01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:21.925
Thank you.

1578
01:10:23.395 --> 01:10:24.454
Goodness.

1579
01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:27.695
(They started together but finish differently.)

1580
01:10:27.695 --> 01:10:30.095
He's crying again.

1581
01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:32.034
(It feels more realistic.)

1582
01:10:32.135 --> 01:10:35.204
- Goodness. - Thank you, everyone.

1583
01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.904
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1584
01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:42.074
Goodbye.

1585
01:10:43.445 --> 01:10:46.284
(As they enjoyed their time together,)

1586
01:10:47.445 --> 01:10:51.414
(it's more difficult to say goodbye.)

1587
01:10:54.485 --> 01:10:55.494
Goodness.

1588
01:10:55.494 --> 01:10:58.925
(He tries to remain strong.)

1589
01:10:59.294 --> 01:11:00.294
It feels strange.

1590
01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:04.364
- What's going on? - Lock the door.

1591
01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:07.305
- Lock the door. - Lock the door.

1592
01:11:09.534 --> 01:11:12.574
- The door is unlocked. - What's going on?

1593
01:11:13.044 --> 01:11:15.345
- Joo Hyuck. - Yes?

1594
01:11:15.345 --> 01:11:16.445
Take off the microphone before you go.

1595
01:11:16.445 --> 01:11:17.574
Okay.

1596
01:11:18.985 --> 01:11:20.214
Are you taking the microphone?

1597
01:11:20.685 --> 01:11:22.555
Let him take it.

1598
01:11:22.555 --> 01:11:24.084
(They want to laugh until the end.)

1599
01:11:24.084 --> 01:11:26.654
(The other members say goodbye.)

1600
01:11:26.654 --> 01:11:27.725
Take off the microphone.

1601
01:11:27.725 --> 01:11:28.725
(The other members say goodbye.)

1602
01:11:30.294 --> 01:11:32.895
(They support each other more than anyone.)

1603
01:11:32.895 --> 01:11:34.225
- Goodbye. - Take care.

1604
01:11:34.695 --> 01:11:35.964
Take care.

1605
01:11:35.964 --> 01:11:37.534
See you soon.

1606
01:11:37.534 --> 01:11:39.164
(It seems like they'll see each other soon.)

1607
01:11:39.334 --> 01:11:40.864
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1608
01:11:41.805 --> 01:11:43.504
Why are we staying so far away from him?

1609
01:11:43.504 --> 01:11:45.204
Why are we so far away?

1610
01:11:45.574 --> 01:11:46.775
- Joo Hyuck. - In case he cries.

1611
01:11:47.975 --> 01:11:49.015
Goodbye.

1612
01:11:52.284 --> 01:11:53.385
His manager is here.

1613
01:11:54.145 --> 01:11:55.654
What is he doing when his manager is here?

1614
01:11:55.954 --> 01:11:57.885
Can you stay here?

1615
01:11:57.885 --> 01:12:00.284
- Aren't you taking him? - Don't go.

1616
01:12:00.284 --> 01:12:01.754
What are you going to do?

1617
01:12:02.355 --> 01:12:03.794
He got in the car alone.

1618
01:12:04.095 --> 01:12:05.864
- What's the point? - Give me the key.

1619
01:12:06.025 --> 01:12:07.164
I'll drive.

1620
01:12:07.864 --> 01:12:08.895
This is so weird.

1621
01:12:10.235 --> 01:12:11.294
(He makes them laugh until the end.)

1622
01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:12.664
They have to leave too.

1623
01:12:12.664 --> 01:12:14.904
(Joo Hyuck makes them laugh until the end.)

1624
01:12:19.504 --> 01:12:23.574
(He promised to go on a surprise trip together,)

1625
01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.845
(but we received sudden tragic news.)

1626
01:12:29.555 --> 01:12:32.754
(Joo Hyuck left without saying farewell.)

1627
01:12:34.525 --> 01:12:38.754
(They'd like to say goodbye somehow.)

1628
01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:49.704
(However,)

1629
01:12:52.775 --> 01:12:55.204
(to express their feelings...)

1630
01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.345
Joo Hyuck.

1631
01:12:56.345 --> 01:12:58.044
(to express their feelings...)

1632
01:12:58.044 --> 01:12:59.114
I...

1633
01:13:00.315 --> 01:13:06.654
(this way,)

1634
01:13:08.185 --> 01:13:12.124
(they continued to think and hesitate.)

1635
01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:17.635
Joo Hyuck was always...

1636
01:13:19.534 --> 01:13:21.334
an amazing brother to us.

1637
01:13:21.334 --> 01:13:23.334
(He was amazing.)

1638
01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:25.544
He was more precious than anyone.

1639
01:13:25.544 --> 01:13:27.775
(He was an amazing and precious friend.)

1640
01:13:29.544 --> 01:13:32.985
When I was taking a break from One Night Two Days,

1641
01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:37.885
I contacted the members when I returned to Korea.

1642
01:13:37.885 --> 01:13:39.055
Joo Hyuck...

1643
01:13:42.294 --> 01:13:45.055
He didn't want to give me a hard time.

1644
01:13:45.525 --> 01:13:49.695
When I returned, we had a meeting.

1645
01:13:51.164 --> 01:13:52.704
He was worried for me,

1646
01:13:53.235 --> 01:13:55.135
so he came to see me.

1647
01:13:57.605 --> 01:13:59.175
Joo Hyuck is having a hard time now,

1648
01:14:00.004 --> 01:14:02.614
but I can't be with him.

1649
01:14:02.614 --> 01:14:04.574
I feel so bad.

1650
01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.515
(I'm sorry, Joo Hyuck.)

1651
01:14:06.784 --> 01:14:08.855
I want to go and see him soon.

1652
01:14:08.855 --> 01:14:10.954
(I want to go and see him soon.)

1653
01:14:16.195 --> 01:14:18.454
We'll never forget you.

1654
01:14:19.864 --> 01:14:21.025
Our Joo Hyuck.

1655
01:14:21.025 --> 01:14:23.164
(We won't ever forget you.)

1656
01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:24.164
I hope...

1657
01:14:27.164 --> 01:14:28.664
you're at a good place.

1658
01:14:29.975 --> 01:14:31.034
Rest in peace.

1659
01:14:35.975 --> 01:14:37.074
Joo Hyuck.

1660
01:14:42.015 --> 01:14:43.114
What shall I say?

1661
01:14:45.584 --> 01:14:46.754
Somehow...

1662
01:14:47.485 --> 01:14:49.824
I always wanted to...

1663
01:14:51.025 --> 01:14:53.195
show this place to you.

1664
01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:55.364
That's why I came here.

1665
01:14:57.964 --> 01:14:59.964
For your last episode,

1666
01:14:59.964 --> 01:15:05.105
we filmed ourselves with a camera.

1667
01:15:05.105 --> 01:15:09.074
We went to places where we spent time...

1668
01:15:09.074 --> 01:15:10.845
with you.

1669
01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:12.744
In that episode,

1670
01:15:12.744 --> 01:15:14.214
(It's a precious place that Joo Hyuck remembers.)

1671
01:15:14.214 --> 01:15:15.685
you mentioned this place.

1672
01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:19.485
You probably thought...

1673
01:15:20.954 --> 01:15:23.154
that someone would come here.

1674
01:15:23.154 --> 01:15:25.055
That's what I think.

1675
01:15:26.864 --> 01:15:27.864
Here it is.

1676
01:15:30.834 --> 01:15:32.034
Ta-da.

1677
01:15:34.735 --> 01:15:35.735
Do you see it?

1678
01:15:35.735 --> 01:15:37.034
(Myeongdong Cathedral)

1679
01:15:37.034 --> 01:15:38.105
Can you see it well?

1680
01:15:42.775 --> 01:15:45.584
You and your parents were together...

1681
01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:48.685
as we put your photos together.

1682
01:15:49.784 --> 01:15:51.784
I wanted to show you this place.

1683
01:15:52.425 --> 01:15:53.485
Yes.

1684
01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:58.864
Of course you may see it better where you are now.

1685
01:15:59.565 --> 01:16:02.265
I still wanted to show it to you once more.

1686
01:16:05.605 --> 01:16:10.074
(2 weeks ago)

1687
01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:17.074
(A congratulatory message for 10-year anniversary)

1688
01:16:19.685 --> 01:16:21.214
Hello, this is Kim Joo Hyuck.

1689
01:16:21.685 --> 01:16:24.954
Congratulations on 10-year anniversary of the show.

1690
01:16:25.385 --> 01:16:28.485
Continuing a show for 10 years is impressive.

1691
01:16:28.485 --> 01:16:31.124
From the audience perspective,

1692
01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:34.794
I feel a great deal of respect.

1693
01:16:35.294 --> 01:16:36.794
It's quite impressive.

1694
01:16:37.435 --> 01:16:41.334
I hope that the members continue to work hard...

1695
01:16:41.334 --> 01:16:45.504
so there is no end to...

1696
01:16:45.504 --> 01:16:47.044
One Night Two Days.

1697
01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:49.074
Also...

1698
01:16:50.114 --> 01:16:52.784
I say this every time, but I always miss you.

1699
01:16:53.044 --> 01:16:54.744
I wish great things for One Night Two Days.

1700
01:16:55.214 --> 01:16:59.225
I hope it's loved more by the viewers.

1701
01:16:59.855 --> 01:17:02.754
I wish luck to all the members.

1702
01:17:10.664 --> 01:17:12.964
(He smiled like a passing season.)

1703
01:17:12.964 --> 01:17:16.105
(We'll always miss him.)

1704
01:17:17.135 --> 01:17:21.874
(Even if you smile for me)

1705
01:17:22.475 --> 01:17:29.614
(You can't hide your dispirited face)

1706
01:17:30.315 --> 01:17:36.525
(Looking weak, you turn away)

1707
01:17:37.895 --> 01:17:45.034
(I can only watch you in a hazy view)

1708
01:17:46.635 --> 01:17:52.975
(I know that for our love)

1709
01:17:52.975 --> 01:17:59.744
(This is the last time)

1710
01:17:59.744 --> 01:18:06.284
(Even if we both wanted, it can't last forever)

1711
01:18:06.284 --> 01:18:11.855
(In the passing of time)

1712
01:18:13.025 --> 01:18:19.765
(After time passes and we forget nostalgia)

1713
01:18:19.765 --> 01:18:25.704
(That makes us hurt so much inside)

1714
01:18:26.504 --> 01:18:32.485
(The fact that we were in precious love)

1715
01:18:32.485 --> 01:18:38.015
(Don't forget and remember it)

1716
01:18:39.385 --> 01:18:46.624
(After time passes and we forget nostalgia)

1717
01:18:46.624 --> 01:18:52.935
(That makes us hurt so much inside)

1718
01:18:52.935 --> 01:18:59.645
(The fact that we were in precious love)

1719
01:18:59.645 --> 01:19:04.114
(Don't forget and remember it)

1720
01:19:05.645 --> 01:19:13.525
(Don't forget and remember it)

1721
01:19:13.525 --> 01:19:15.555
(Don't forget and remember it)

1722
01:19:18.225 --> 01:19:22.065
(Kim Joo Hyuck will be remembered with love.)
