00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:20.461
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:35.988
- Hey, pull over for a second. - What's going on?

3
00:00:35.988 --> 00:00:37.348
- Pull over for a second. - Do you need to relieve yourself?

4
00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.949
No, just pull over.

5
00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:41.488
Gwang Gyun, where are you going?

6
00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:43.229
- Gosh... - Hey!

7
00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.059
Gwang Gyun, where are you going? Why... What?

8
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.598
What?

9
00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.498
Woo Byung Sik is still alive?

10
00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:58.708
Hang on.

11
00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.578
Could it be that Woo Byung Sik was the killer of Han Jin Sook?

12
00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:34.878
What?

13
00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.878
What just happened? Where did he go?

14
00:01:58.328 --> 00:02:00.268
(Honey, you must've resented me a lot.)

15
00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:02.339
(I'm sorry. I couldn't believe that Woo Byung Sik died.)

16
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.609
What is that?

17
00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:11.579
When Moojin Time Mart collapsed,

18
00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:14.649
were you there too?

19
00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.489
Of course.

20
00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.258
300 people died.

21
00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.288
All of us were there back then.

22
00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:24.329
Everyone was exhausted after that job.

23
00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:28.059
Collecting that many souls at once...

24
00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.228
is definitely not an easy job.

25
00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.299
Plus, most of the souls were kids.

26
00:02:36.968 --> 00:02:39.978
Kids who didn't know why they had to die.

27
00:02:42.438 --> 00:02:44.908
Kids who had so many days to live ahead.

28
00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.718
Collecting souls of kids,

29
00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:51.348
who were full of dreams about their future,

30
00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.459
obviously couldn't have been easy.

31
00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:06.669
But not a single person took responsibility for their deaths?

32
00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.538
Why are you asking about Moojin Time Mart out of the blue?

33
00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:13.179
Were you at the place that was on the news earlier?

34
00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:14.839
Did the loser show up there?

35
00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:17.278
No.

36
00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.878
Ha Ram tried to save someone's life again.

37
00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:22.649
Does that mean...

38
00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.258
she tried to save that man and woman's lives?

39
00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:29.829
So...

40
00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.698
they died because you interfered.

41
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.498
- I just did my job. - Then...

42
00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:43.709
why do you look so upset?

43
00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.679
Like you said, you just did your job.

44
00:03:56.848 --> 00:03:58.589
What... What's wrong with him?

45
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.088
I told you. We didn't run any tests.

46
00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:34.388
Someone took her and said it was for some tests.

47
00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:37.128
The man. The man who took her...

48
00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.659
had dark skin and blond hair.

49
00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:40.929
Blond hair?

50
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.128
We don't have such person among our staff.

51
00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:44.969
- What? - There isn't someone like that.

52
00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:00.248
That means...

53
00:05:00.878 --> 00:05:03.219
he's the one who switched Ms. Kim and Steven.

54
00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.748
There has been a commotion about Woo Byung Sik.

55
00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.588
As his picture turned out to be genuine,

56
00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:11.258
the authorities decided that he is still alive.

57
00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:13.859
They put him on the wanted list and asked...

58
00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:15.458
for Interpol's cooperation.

59
00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:18.498
They're directing all their strength to arrest Woo Byung Sik.

60
00:05:19.698 --> 00:05:21.398
Woo Byung Sik did all this.

61
00:05:21.438 --> 00:05:23.809
He killed Ms. Kim on purpose.

62
00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:35.219
- Where is 416? - He left by himself to watch TV.

63
00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:38.648
That mean brat who doesn't have any sense of loyalty.

64
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.229
By the way, you really look upset today.

65
00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.198
What's wrong?

66
00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.229
The man who died today.

67
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.838
When he got shot, I shouted "No" without realizing.

68
00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:54.539
"No"?

69
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.869
Did you really do that?

70
00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.109
Yes.

71
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:03.109
I don't know. I don't understand why I did it either.

72
00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:06.349
But at that moment, I didn't want him to die.

73
00:06:06.748 --> 00:06:11.188
No. I didn't want him to die in vain so unfairly like that.

74
00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:14.619
I think I thought like that at that moment.

75
00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.258
Humans sometimes say they feel lousy.

76
00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:19.289
I guess this is how that feels.

77
00:06:20.628 --> 00:06:22.159
I feel so lousy.

78
00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:29.169
It feels so heavy inside that it's driving me crazy.

79
00:06:30.068 --> 00:06:32.469
Why did I think like that at that moment?

80
00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:35.039
It's not anyone else but you.

81
00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:37.578
The coldblooded and heartless grim reaper, 444.

82
00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:39.818
You had such thoughts.

83
00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:42.578
I can't believe it myself.

84
00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:44.248
I'm dumbfounded.

85
00:06:44.518 --> 00:06:45.989
I can't believe it either.

86
00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:50.359
I'm having petty feelings that only those who used to be humans feel.

87
00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.128
Why should I care if a human...

88
00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:56.869
catches someone who killed his son?

89
00:07:06.508 --> 00:07:08.479
- Hi. - You saw the news, right?

90
00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:09.909
Woo Byung Sik is alive.

91
00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:12.109
That man isn't the one who killed Seung Chul's mom.

92
00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:13.419
Woo Byung Sik killed her.

93
00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.018
It's true. A man disguised himself as an orderly and took Ms. Kim.

94
00:07:17.049 --> 00:07:19.088
We have to catch that jerk now. If we do,

95
00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:20.958
we'll be able to find Woo Byung Sik.

96
00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.159
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

97
00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.429
I've never seen such a bothersome human like her.

98
00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:29.628
Does she think I'm here to satisfy people's grudges?

99
00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:37.909
- Where are you going? - To catch Woo Byung Sik.

100
00:07:37.938 --> 00:07:38.938
What?

101
00:07:40.078 --> 00:07:41.878
I can't get him out of my head.

102
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.279
It's too unfair for that couple who died.

103
00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:47.248
I'm not saving someone's life, so it's okay, right?

104
00:07:48.078 --> 00:07:49.078
Right.

105
00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.188
It's not against the rules.

106
00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.559
Did you find out why I can't get out of this body?

107
00:07:57.088 --> 00:08:00.898
I'm looking into it, but I haven't found out the reason.

108
00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:02.498
Find it out quickly.

109
00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:08.469
(Seoun Police Station)

110
00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:11.109
- Woo Byung Sik's picture... - Captain Bong.

111
00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:12.208
- Captain Bong! - We're back.

112
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:15.609
I know that Woo Byung Sik is alive. It's on the news.

113
00:08:15.609 --> 00:08:18.648
More importantly, look at this. This watch.

114
00:08:18.878 --> 00:08:19.878
Here.

115
00:08:20.448 --> 00:08:24.648
Take a look. It's the same watch this man is wearing here, right?

116
00:08:24.648 --> 00:08:27.518
People are expecting that this will reveal the truth...

117
00:08:27.518 --> 00:08:29.429
about the Moojin Time Mart collapse after 20 years.

118
00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:30.888
- You're right. - Right?

119
00:08:31.858 --> 00:08:34.929
Gui Nam. Go ask them to verify if they're the same watches.

120
00:08:35.228 --> 00:08:37.169
- Keep it confidential, okay? - Yes, sir.

121
00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.539
- Hurry up, you brat. - See you.

122
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.098
It's on the news.

123
00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:46.978
Him. He's the one.

124
00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:09.799
- Yes! - I got lucky.

125
00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:11.868
All right.

126
00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:16.009
You.

127
00:09:16.738 --> 00:09:17.838
Come here.

128
00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:19.438
Who is that punk?

129
00:09:25.309 --> 00:09:26.318
Hey.

130
00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:27.818
Where is Woo Byung Sik?

131
00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:30.488
Let go. Let go of me. Who are you?

132
00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.588
What are you doing? Kill him.

133
00:09:59.948 --> 00:10:00.948
(Don't litter in the toilet!)

134
00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:17.029
Gosh, that jerk.

135
00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:25.238
Hey. What are you doing over there?

136
00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:28.208
What? Jump over here.

137
00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:31.948
Come on, jump over. It's easy, isn't it?

138
00:10:32.718 --> 00:10:34.218
I told you to jump over.

139
00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.218
You can't, right? Okay then.

140
00:10:37.348 --> 00:10:40.588
You worked hard today. I'll be going now. See you.

141
00:10:50.598 --> 00:10:53.999
Gosh, what's going on? You said nobody would know.

142
00:10:55.938 --> 00:10:57.539
A police officer dropped in on me.

143
00:10:58.169 --> 00:11:00.179
- A police officer? Who? - I don't know.

144
00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:03.578
I had to run, so I couldn't check. I somehow managed to ditch him.

145
00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:06.618
This complicates things. Even if you get caught,

146
00:11:06.848 --> 00:11:08.649
just tell them the story we came up with, okay?

147
00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:11.348
You'd better do as I say if you wish to live.

148
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:32.468
You punk. Okay, come here. Come here.

149
00:11:41.078 --> 00:11:42.578
Please... Please don't kill me.

150
00:11:42.578 --> 00:11:44.948
- Where is Woo Byung Sik? - Please don't kill me.

151
00:11:48.789 --> 00:11:50.429
Where is Woo Byung Sik?

152
00:11:50.429 --> 00:11:51.588
I don't know...

153
00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:55.029
Geocheon... Geocheon Port.

154
00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:56.068
Geocheon Port?

155
00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:59.269
I overheard him talking on the phone when I was moving that woman.

156
00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:03.068
He told his wife to bring their kid to Geocheon Port.

157
00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:04.238
Why?

158
00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:07.608
They can stow away there. The police don't know about it yet.

159
00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.039
Stow away?

160
00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:14.718
I was going to let you eat your fill today.

161
00:12:15.578 --> 00:12:17.188
Don't be so disappointed.

162
00:12:19.858 --> 00:12:22.289
If she doesn't tell me where the tape is soon,

163
00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:25.059
I will chop her body into pieces and let you eat it.

164
00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:53.458
Where is this rat hiding?

165
00:12:53.688 --> 00:12:55.559
I can't believe this.

166
00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:57.759
- Oh, goodness. - Who would do this?

167
00:12:58.328 --> 00:12:59.858
Oh, dear.

168
00:12:59.858 --> 00:13:01.698
- Gosh. - Who did this?

169
00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:04.228
- What happened to him? - Goodness.

170
00:13:04.728 --> 00:13:05.968
Who is it?

171
00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:07.598
This is outrageous.

172
00:13:07.598 --> 00:13:09.409
What on earth happened to him?

173
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:12.608
- My goodness. - How did this happen?

174
00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:13.879
Woo Byung Sik?

175
00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:24.249
Yes.

176
00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:26.519
People found it as planned.

177
00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:28.159
Okay.

178
00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:38.169
(Last Will, Woo Byung Sik)

179
00:13:40.368 --> 00:13:43.238
Why do I keep making mistakes about the moment of their deaths?

180
00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:45.708
I clearly saw Mr. Park...

181
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.708
being stabbed to death by a man...

182
00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:50.679
wearing a watch with a butterfly design.

183
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:52.509
Why?

184
00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:56.488
From what I saw, Steven died from the explosion, not Mr. Park's wife.

185
00:13:57.188 --> 00:13:58.848
Why did everything change?

186
00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:08.328
Mr. Park and Ms. Kim.

187
00:14:10.098 --> 00:14:11.269
Joon...

188
00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:16.039
will surely catch that jerk, Woo Byung Sik.

189
00:14:21.708 --> 00:14:22.848
(Loser)

190
00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:25.909
Hello?

191
00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.149
What happened? Did you catch him?

192
00:14:29.448 --> 00:14:30.448
What?

193
00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:35.358
He... He's dead?

194
00:14:37.988 --> 00:14:39.659
You... You mean Woo Byung Sik?

195
00:14:45.598 --> 00:14:47.799
Can somebody call the police?

196
00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:51.809
Do you know what I went through...

197
00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:55.078
because your daughter reported me to the police?

198
00:14:55.738 --> 00:14:58.309
- Dad, stop! - Let go!

199
00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:01.379
Gosh, Hoon Seok.

200
00:15:03.118 --> 00:15:06.618
You and your daughter are two peas in a pod.

201
00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:09.828
How can she report me to the police?

202
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.289
- Gosh. - Answer me.

203
00:15:12.588 --> 00:15:14.698
You should die for everyone's sake!

204
00:15:18.198 --> 00:15:19.539
Speak of the devil.

205
00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:21.198
How dare you...

206
00:15:21.938 --> 00:15:24.838
report me to the police for domestic violence?

207
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:27.309
You should thank me for raising you.

208
00:15:27.438 --> 00:15:29.348
You're such an ingrate.

209
00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:30.978
- You little... - Stop right there!

210
00:15:30.978 --> 00:15:32.409
Please stop!

211
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:33.848
How did you get out?

212
00:15:34.948 --> 00:15:36.188
Your mom told them...

213
00:15:36.588 --> 00:15:39.759
that she doesn't want me punished, so they let me go.

214
00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:41.759
What are you going to do now?

215
00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:46.029
Some parents put their lives on the line to avenge their child's death.

216
00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:47.759
Soon,

217
00:15:49.328 --> 00:15:50.828
you'll receive the punishment you deserve.

218
00:15:53.098 --> 00:15:56.409
Stop putting on a show, you crazy wench.

219
00:15:57.009 --> 00:15:58.068
Fine!

220
00:15:58.738 --> 00:16:01.338
Bring it on again and make me go all crazy!

221
00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:03.208
- Bring it on! - Honey, stop!

222
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:04.348
Do whatever you want.

223
00:16:05.478 --> 00:16:07.019
I don't care whether you die or not.

224
00:16:08.618 --> 00:16:11.749
Gosh, that rude brat.

225
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:13.358
- Gosh! What's wrong with him? - Oh, no.

226
00:16:14.118 --> 00:16:15.958
Hey, kid. Wake up.

227
00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.889
Hoon Seok! Hoon Seok!

228
00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:39.149
No!

229
00:16:39.618 --> 00:16:41.049
Help!

230
00:16:46.858 --> 00:16:48.659
Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

231
00:16:48.688 --> 00:16:50.759
Is... Is the injury serious?

232
00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:54.728
No, I just got a few mild scrapes,

233
00:16:54.728 --> 00:16:56.899
but I asked the doctor to bandage me up like this.

234
00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:00.139
Even bandages are a fashion to me, you know.

235
00:17:02.368 --> 00:17:04.338
I'm sorry. You got injured because of me.

236
00:17:04.638 --> 00:17:06.279
Why are you sorry?

237
00:17:06.638 --> 00:17:09.779
I'm saying this just in case you got the wrong idea.

238
00:17:10.078 --> 00:17:11.709
I hope you're not thinking...

239
00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:14.779
that I got injured while trying to save your life.

240
00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:18.418
There was a jagged stone, so I happened to...

241
00:17:18.418 --> 00:17:21.519
trip and fall right at that moment.

242
00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:22.888
That's why I fell on you.

243
00:17:23.428 --> 00:17:26.759
I wasn't trying to protect you or anything like that.

244
00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:29.799
Don't think that it was like those scenes you see in movies. Gosh.

245
00:17:32.628 --> 00:17:33.638
My gosh.

246
00:17:34.168 --> 00:17:35.699
Your hand got all scraped too.

247
00:17:35.739 --> 00:17:37.338
Let's get you treated first.

248
00:17:37.568 --> 00:17:39.269
Well, and...

249
00:17:40.209 --> 00:17:42.638
Woo Byung Sik died.

250
00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:44.749
- What? - I think he committed suicide.

251
00:17:44.749 --> 00:17:45.749
Really?

252
00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:49.949
If he's dead, doesn't that mean my dad is safe now?

253
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:52.789
Right. That is true,

254
00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:55.158
but I think I need to check again.

255
00:17:55.318 --> 00:17:57.189
Even Seung Chul's mom and dad...

256
00:17:57.888 --> 00:17:59.898
died differently from what I saw.

257
00:18:01.229 --> 00:18:03.999
- I'll see you later. - Wait, you must get treated first.

258
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:06.539
I'll get treated when I get back.

259
00:18:06.699 --> 00:18:07.699
All right.

260
00:18:14.338 --> 00:18:16.678
If what she said is true,

261
00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:19.818
that means Woo Byung Sik was the one who was trying to kill my dad.

262
00:18:21.878 --> 00:18:23.049
That's strange.

263
00:18:24.618 --> 00:18:26.489
The two of them have nothing to do with each other.

264
00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:29.259
Who are you?

265
00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:30.559
Please let me in for a second.

266
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.559
No, we can't.

267
00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:33.459
Our CEO will be here any minute now. You can't go in.

268
00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:35.499
- Please. I just need a second. - Stop!

269
00:18:35.499 --> 00:18:36.769
Just a second, please.

270
00:18:47.809 --> 00:18:48.838
It's gone.

271
00:18:48.838 --> 00:18:50.908
Your father won't die now.

272
00:18:50.908 --> 00:18:53.418
Really? Is the shadow really gone?

273
00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:57.118
Gosh, thank you so much, Ms. Fortune-teller. Thanks a lot.

274
00:18:57.118 --> 00:18:58.519
- My gosh. - Well, could you...

275
00:19:03.628 --> 00:19:04.628
Well...

276
00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:07.059
Go get your hand treated now.

277
00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:09.299
I'll get it treated before I leave.

278
00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:11.469
Get some rest now. You must recover soon.

279
00:19:11.529 --> 00:19:13.638
Sip Gyeon is waiting for you at home alone.

280
00:19:13.638 --> 00:19:14.799
All right.

281
00:19:15.368 --> 00:19:17.368
- Get some rest. - Okay, thanks.

Woo Byung Sik's body was found at Geocheon Port.

284

His body was found between anchored boats at the port.

285

It was discovered by fishermen who were getting ready for work,

286

and it's said that he was found with a deep wound on his neck...

inflicted by a sharp weapon.

carried out to determine the cause of death.

292

A number of your old acquaintances passed away recently.

of the seven-story shopping mall, Moojin Time Mart.

297
00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:17.928
Almost 300 people have been found dead.

298
00:20:18.328 --> 00:20:21.068
The rescue authorities speculate that at least dozens of bodies...

299
00:20:21.068 --> 00:20:24.269
are still buried underneath the remains of the building.

Everyone on the board including me was so against it,

303
00:20:31.979 --> 00:20:33.418
but you conspired with Woo Byung Sik...

304
00:20:33.418 --> 00:20:35.949
and pushed ahead with the 30 million dollar contract for Time Mart.

Today is the fourth day after the Moojin Time Mart collapse,

and Woo Byung Sik's whereabouts have remained unknown.

However, he was just found in a burnt-out car.

317
00:21:08.678 --> 00:21:11.549
Woo Byung Sik was held accountable for the collapse...

318
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:13.489
because he's the owner of Moojin Time Mart...

319
00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:15.888
and the CEO of the construction company.

320

were found burnt in the fire as well.

325

It seems that it'll be difficult to determine the cause of the accident,

00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:36.809
isn't dead, right?

330
00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:41.118
I told you not to worry, didn't I?

331
00:21:42.418 --> 00:21:44.689
Their contract has been burnt to ashes.

332
00:21:46.358 --> 00:21:47.759
Our contract...

333
00:21:48.459 --> 00:21:49.729
is burnt like this too.

334
00:21:50.729 --> 00:21:53.729
Chunsu Insurance and Moojin Time Mart...

335
00:21:54.658 --> 00:21:56.668
never had a contract.

336
00:21:59.969 --> 00:22:01.269
Time Mart...

337
00:22:02.368 --> 00:22:04.239
is an uninsured building now.

338
00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:18.449
Is what's written there true?

339
00:22:18.489 --> 00:22:21.189
I'm asking if Clara's claims are really true.

340
00:22:21.689 --> 00:22:24.658
She's insisting that you received sexual favors. Is that true?

341
00:22:25.229 --> 00:22:27.658
Why on earth did you do that? Have you lost your mind?

342
00:22:27.658 --> 00:22:29.898
If they investigate this... Gosh.

343
00:22:29.898 --> 00:22:31.068
Goodness, calm down.

344
00:22:31.398 --> 00:22:34.039
I must've lost my mind momentarily.

345
00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:35.799
Well, just call me crazy.

346
00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:38.568
If people find out about this, it'll ruin my company and my family.

347
00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:41.939
It will destroy everything I've built.

348
00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:44.709
Look, Jae Geun. Please let this slide just once.

349
00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:49.719
That hostess of the bar. Please silence her, would you?

350
00:22:49.749 --> 00:22:52.519
Even if I do,

351
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:56.128
if that teenage girl tells the truth, it will end me too.

352
00:22:56.128 --> 00:22:58.828
I heard she ran away. She will never show up again.

353
00:22:58.828 --> 00:23:00.158
So please help me.

354
00:23:06.739 --> 00:23:09.269
Man... Man Ho.

355
00:23:10.709 --> 00:23:11.939
Hey, pretend that it was nothing.

356
00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:22.689
Was this it?

357
00:23:24.318 --> 00:23:27.789
Did you sign that ridiculous 30 million-dollar contract...

358
00:23:28.818 --> 00:23:32.328
in return for the sexual favors Woo Byung Sik arranged for you?

359
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:33.828
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:34.999 --> 00:23:36.269
An apology won't cut it.

361
00:23:36.368 --> 00:23:39.769
Your filthy act almost ruined our company!

362
00:23:39.999 --> 00:23:41.668
Do you think an apology is enough for that?

363
00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:45.439
Man Ho. Please... Please stop, okay?

364
00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:49.408
Calm down, Man Ho.

365
00:23:53.148 --> 00:23:54.818
What are you going to do?

366
00:23:55.989 --> 00:23:58.418
You came to my dad without reporting it.

367
00:23:58.418 --> 00:23:59.858
That means you want something.

368
00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:01.118
What are you...

369
00:24:01.118 --> 00:24:02.118
You know what?

370
00:24:04.689 --> 00:24:07.658
I will grease your superiors' palms.

371
00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:10.299
- What? - Money can buy you anything, right?

372
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:13.668
I can promise you the post of a commissioner general.

373
00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:14.769
You little...

374
00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:21.809
Okay then.

375
00:24:30.318 --> 00:24:31.949
It is a bit disappointing though.

376
00:24:32.189 --> 00:24:35.358
If Woo Byung Sik had been captured alive and told the truth,

377
00:24:35.918 --> 00:24:39.999
how would Man Soo, your biggest admirer, look at you?

378
00:24:40.898 --> 00:24:42.898
I wanted to see that.

379
00:24:44.598 --> 00:24:46.939
As Mr. Jung, who moved Mr. Park Nam Soon's wife to the building...

380
00:24:46.939 --> 00:24:49.838
with a bomb at the instigation of Woo Byung Sik, was arrested,

381
00:24:49.908 --> 00:24:52.638
Mr. Park Soon Nam was cleared from the murder of his wife.

382
00:24:53.009 --> 00:24:54.838
His wife, Ms. Kim Soon Hee,

383
00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:57.408
lost her son, Mr. Park Seung Chul, 20 years ago...

384
00:24:57.408 --> 00:25:00.878
when he was in middle school at the Moojin Time Mart disaster.

385
00:25:01.078 --> 00:25:03.348
It's been revealed that she has been tracing...

386
00:25:03.348 --> 00:25:05.749
Woo Byung Sik for 20 years to find the truth.

387
00:25:06.189 --> 00:25:08.618
Meanwhile, Mr. Park Seung Chul...

388
00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:11.759
is still classified as a missing person...

389
00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:13.898
since only a part of his body was found at the scene.

390
00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:17.499
(Moojin Hospital Emergency Room, 20 years ago)

391
00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.098
Doctor, take a look at this patient.

392
00:25:22.098 --> 00:25:24.108
Where is his hand? Did you bring it?

393
00:25:24.108 --> 00:25:25.439
- We should hurry and attach it... - He's dead.

394
00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:33.118
(Park Seung Chul)

395
00:25:40.418 --> 00:25:42.759
You were in a surgery all night. Aren't you going to go home?

396
00:25:45.189 --> 00:25:46.999
What are you so immersed in again?

397
00:25:48.658 --> 00:25:49.668
Do you know him?

398
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:51.269
It's...

399
00:25:52.328 --> 00:25:53.338
that boy.

400
00:25:55.469 --> 00:25:56.638
What do you mean, "That boy"?

401
00:25:59.168 --> 00:26:00.479
(Woo Byung Sik instigated the bombing)

402
00:26:07.979 --> 00:26:10.348
(Son)

403
00:26:21.352 --> 00:26:22.352
Joon.

404
00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:30.723
It's certain this time, right?

405
00:26:31.322 --> 00:26:32.622
He didn't...

406
00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:35.763
disguise his own death again, right?

407
00:26:36.132 --> 00:26:38.832
Don't worry. I confirmed it myself.

408
00:26:41.003 --> 00:26:42.473
That's a relief.

409
00:26:43.172 --> 00:26:45.172
But when Ms. Kim was lying on the bed,

410
00:26:46.473 --> 00:26:49.342
if I had taken a careful look at the shadow again,

411
00:26:50.743 --> 00:26:53.652
she wouldn't have died such a horrible death.

412
00:26:56.223 --> 00:26:57.422
I was a fool.

413
00:26:59.152 --> 00:27:01.493
I should've realized sooner that the nurse was a fake.

414
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.783
"Die hard, never die".

415
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.612
Dying is hard?

416
00:27:29.082 --> 00:27:30.822
She will never die?

417
00:27:31.882 --> 00:27:33.023
I don't get what it means.

418
00:27:33.223 --> 00:27:36.793
Anyhow, I guess she has a very strong will to live.

419
00:27:52.842 --> 00:27:55.943
I can't understand women.

420
00:27:57.142 --> 00:28:00.152
Why would they like a guy with a weasel-face like this?

421
00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:03.152
We would never choose to have this kind of face.

422
00:28:03.523 --> 00:28:04.852
I don't like him.

423
00:28:19.402 --> 00:28:20.402
Joon.

424
00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:23.043
What are you doing over there?

425
00:28:25.443 --> 00:28:26.443
Nothing.

426
00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:31.412
- Let's sit down. - Move. Move.

427
00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:35.713
Oh, my gosh. Leo!

428
00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:37.483
Leo! This is a limited edition.

429
00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.652
Have you lost your mind?

430
00:28:40.122 --> 00:28:41.122
My goodness.

431
00:28:42.122 --> 00:28:45.062
It was so hard to get this limited-edition poster.

432
00:28:45.062 --> 00:28:46.433
- What have you done? - Come here.

433
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:49.662
What is that? Why did you draw on his face? That's childish.

434
00:28:49.662 --> 00:28:50.662
Sit.

435
00:28:56.572 --> 00:28:57.602
Stop looking at it.

436
00:28:59.243 --> 00:29:00.372
Now, give me your hand.

437
00:29:02.412 --> 00:29:03.412
Your hand.

438
00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:04.783
Now.

439
00:29:06.713 --> 00:29:07.713
Let's see.

440
00:29:10.953 --> 00:29:13.092
Gosh, be gentle. Be gentle.

441
00:29:30.142 --> 00:29:32.773
Your hands are always a mess.

442
00:29:33.013 --> 00:29:35.543
Why do you always get hurt when you wish to live long?

443
00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:44.582
You even taped that note on the fridge. You should be more careful.

444
00:29:48.693 --> 00:29:52.023
Also, you must know when you'll die since you can see those shadows.

445
00:29:52.392 --> 00:29:54.362
So why did you bother to tape that?

446
00:29:55.592 --> 00:29:57.662
I can't see my own shadow of death.

447
00:29:59.473 --> 00:30:01.503
I almost got killed when I was little.

448
00:30:01.773 --> 00:30:04.602
- What? - And that was by my own mom.

449
00:30:14.213 --> 00:30:17.253
Ha Ram. Let's take this one pill, okay?

450
00:30:17.723 --> 00:30:19.322
- Mom. - Just one.

451
00:30:21.622 --> 00:30:24.092
- No. - Ha Ram, you're a good girl.

452
00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:25.193
- Listen to mommy. - No!

453
00:30:25.193 --> 00:30:27.562
- You should listen to mommy. - No!

454
00:30:27.562 --> 00:30:30.562
Take it! Ha Ram. You're a good girl, right?

455
00:30:33.602 --> 00:30:35.273
Take it. Take it!

456
00:30:35.703 --> 00:30:38.642
- Take it, and die! Take it! - Dad!

457
00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:39.773
Take it!

458
00:30:40.013 --> 00:30:42.072
Dad!

459
00:30:46.812 --> 00:30:48.483
You don't know...

460
00:30:49.183 --> 00:30:51.422
how terrible it is to see your own death, right?

461
00:30:55.023 --> 00:30:56.193
(Die hard! Never die!)

462
00:30:56.892 --> 00:31:00.892
Since that day, I have decided to never die.

463
00:31:02.703 --> 00:31:04.062
I decided to survive...

464
00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:07.033
no matter what happens.

465
00:31:12.973 --> 00:31:14.013
I will...

466
00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:16.882
live a long, quiet life.

467
00:31:17.283 --> 00:31:20.713
I will live until I become an old lady.

468
00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:26.822
It hurts.

469
00:31:26.822 --> 00:31:28.023
Don't be such a crybaby.

470
00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:29.092
I'm going now.

471
00:31:29.493 --> 00:31:32.562
Wait, Joon. Wait just for a second.

472
00:31:42.473 --> 00:31:43.473
Here.

473
00:31:44.142 --> 00:31:45.572
It's your bracelet.

474
00:31:46.943 --> 00:31:50.483
I stayed up all night to make it when you moved to Seoul.

475
00:31:52.812 --> 00:31:56.783
You may not remember, but you always wore it.

476
00:31:58.352 --> 00:31:59.352
Here.

477
00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:01.652
It doesn't look so good.

478
00:32:03.662 --> 00:32:04.662
It doesn't look good?

479
00:32:05.322 --> 00:32:06.493
Get... Get home safely.

480
00:32:07.533 --> 00:32:08.693
Get home safely.

481
00:32:16.342 --> 00:32:19.203
He's a detective. Didn't he learn how to wrap bandages?

482
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:26.213
It looks so tacky.

483
00:32:28.953 --> 00:32:31.683
I'm going to live a long life.

484
00:32:32.152 --> 00:32:35.622
I'm going to live until I become an old lady.

485
00:32:40.033 --> 00:32:43.402
Why do I keep caring about whether some petty human lives or dies?

486
00:32:44.102 --> 00:32:46.132
She's such an annoying person.

487
00:32:50.303 --> 00:32:52.102
Just wait for your turn.

488
00:32:52.102 --> 00:32:54.572
I'll take you with me as soon as I catch that loser.

489
00:33:17.833 --> 00:33:18.833
You.

490
00:33:20.103 --> 00:33:22.772
Why didn't you answer your phone the entire day?

491
00:33:25.973 --> 00:33:27.772
What happened between you and Soo Wan?

492
00:33:28.413 --> 00:33:29.442
Did you two have a fight?

493
00:33:29.482 --> 00:33:32.513
Why did she hand in a resignation letter, and why can't I reach her?

494
00:33:32.683 --> 00:33:33.982
She's going to go to the US.

495
00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:35.982
She said she's going to study.

496
00:33:36.553 --> 00:33:38.353
The US? And you didn't stop her?

497
00:33:38.353 --> 00:33:40.252
Did you just let her leave like that?

498
00:33:56.703 --> 00:33:58.442
I made some beef bone soup for you.

499
00:33:59.772 --> 00:34:01.243
So don't skip your meals.

500
00:34:02.982 --> 00:34:04.112
I'll go now.

501
00:34:10.723 --> 00:34:12.583
When you get your memory back,

502
00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:15.822
you'll regret letting Soo Wan leave like that.

503
00:34:16.862 --> 00:34:19.462
Do you know how much you loved her?

504
00:34:19.493 --> 00:34:21.692
You're the one who kept following her around.

505
00:34:50.792 --> 00:34:53.192
Why did that doctor just leave?

506
00:34:54.393 --> 00:34:57.462
My heart beat so strong whenever I saw her.

507
00:34:58.433 --> 00:35:01.232
But now, it even hurts just hearing her name.

508
00:35:19.223 --> 00:35:21.353
I should've caught him myself.

509
00:35:22.822 --> 00:35:25.993
My gosh, he's dead anyway.

510
00:35:25.993 --> 00:35:28.563
Stop caring about him. It's not like you.

511
00:35:28.632 --> 00:35:32.603
"If you do not fill your mind, it will be empty with worries."

512
00:35:33.772 --> 00:35:36.542
It's "If you do not empty your mind, it will be filled with worries."

513
00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:39.272
Gosh, stop talking as if you're an actor in a historical drama.

514
00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:40.712
It's really annoying.

515
00:35:40.712 --> 00:35:42.313
You're right. It's not like me.

516
00:35:42.882 --> 00:35:45.643
These are side effects from staying too long in a human body.

517
00:35:45.942 --> 00:35:47.913
I keep dreaming like a human does.

518
00:35:47.913 --> 00:35:49.683
I can't teleport anymore.

519
00:35:49.683 --> 00:35:51.953
On top of that, I'm starting to pity other humans.

520
00:35:54.053 --> 00:35:56.092
This is all because of that loser.

521
00:35:58.292 --> 00:35:59.493
That loser.

522
00:36:02.063 --> 00:36:04.132
I'm going to kill you when I find you.

523
00:36:19.183 --> 00:36:21.083
Hello, sir. Yes.

524
00:36:21.252 --> 00:36:23.083
Did you see the photo I sent you?

525
00:36:24.183 --> 00:36:25.183
Yes.

526
00:36:25.652 --> 00:36:27.522
Okay, just a second. The back?

527
00:36:30.223 --> 00:36:32.292
It says "SE".

528
00:36:33.893 --> 00:36:34.962
Really?

529
00:36:35.933 --> 00:36:39.002
Yes, okay. I'll bring it to you right now.

530
00:36:40.572 --> 00:36:43.973
So is Woo Byung Sik the original owner of this watch?

531
00:36:43.973 --> 00:36:47.942
Yes. Woo Byung Sik gave this watch to his son.

532
00:36:47.942 --> 00:36:50.042
Park Soon Nam kept this with him so that he could use it...

533
00:36:50.042 --> 00:36:53.553
to lure Woo Byung Sik, and Pastor Kang stole it from him.

534
00:36:54.112 --> 00:36:56.853
Then Moo Gang found it in Pastor Kang's house.

535
00:36:56.922 --> 00:36:57.982
I see.

536
00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.822
But now that Byung Sik's dead,

537
00:37:03.822 --> 00:37:06.333
we can't ask him if he killed Han Jin Sook.

538
00:37:06.563 --> 00:37:08.763
Well, I just talked to a craftsman regarding watches.

539
00:37:08.763 --> 00:37:09.933
- Yes. - And he said...

540
00:37:09.933 --> 00:37:12.203
that there might not be another watch like this.

541
00:37:12.203 --> 00:37:13.672
So I'm going to go check on that.

542
00:37:13.672 --> 00:37:14.672
What?

543
00:37:15.172 --> 00:37:19.103
So if we prove that this is the only watch with this kind of design,

544
00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:21.143
that'll prove that Woo Byung Sik is the culprit...

545
00:37:21.143 --> 00:37:23.112
who gave orders to kill Han Jin Sook.

546
00:37:23.112 --> 00:37:24.583
That's right. Can I go now?

547
00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:26.212
Yes, you can go. Bye.

548
00:37:26.212 --> 00:37:27.212
Bye.

549
00:37:36.192 --> 00:37:38.292
Mr. Oh got hurt because of me.

550
00:37:39.063 --> 00:37:41.632
I should work hard starting today.

551
00:37:41.632 --> 00:37:44.263
Then I'll be able to get my dad's files sooner.

552
00:37:45.203 --> 00:37:47.803
And Mr. Oh will be able to become a proper CEO.

553
00:37:59.953 --> 00:38:00.953
Hello?

554
00:38:02.583 --> 00:38:04.252
Yes, I'm Kang Ha Ram.

Joon.

557
00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.632
What? I didn't trip.

558
00:38:15.232 --> 00:38:16.232
The rock...

559
00:38:17.132 --> 00:38:18.563
Where did that rock go?

560
00:38:18.603 --> 00:38:20.272
Get in the car quickly. We need to go somewhere.

561
00:38:21.172 --> 00:38:22.502
Where did the rock go?

562
00:38:23.502 --> 00:38:26.272
You didn't have to pick me up. I could've gone on my own.

563
00:38:26.342 --> 00:38:28.243
But what should I say when I get investigated as a witness?

564
00:38:28.243 --> 00:38:30.013
It's not like I can tell them the truth.

565
00:38:30.083 --> 00:38:32.712
What? A witness investigation?

566

(Certified Brand Watches)

567
00:38:41.453 --> 00:38:42.453
It's just as I thought.

568
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.893
This watch was made by Henry Schneider.

569
00:38:47.993 --> 00:38:50.263
Can you see his initials right here?

570
00:38:50.263 --> 00:38:51.732
I've become far sighted with age.

571
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:54.803
What did you say his name was again?

572
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:57.703
He's the best craftsman of watches in Switzerland.

573
00:38:58.143 --> 00:39:00.212
This is probably worth more than 300,000 dollars.

574
00:39:00.473 --> 00:39:03.413
Plus, he died last year because of cancer.

575
00:39:03.413 --> 00:39:05.083
So I'm sure it'll cost a lot more now.

576
00:39:05.083 --> 00:39:07.453
A single watch can cost 300,000 dollars?

577
00:39:07.453 --> 00:39:11.283
Yes. You should think of it as a piece of art instead.

578
00:39:11.553 --> 00:39:14.292
Henry Schneider designs and makes...

579
00:39:14.292 --> 00:39:16.322
every single component for his watch.

580
00:39:16.322 --> 00:39:17.322
Even the components?

581
00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:19.223
Yes. That's why I called it a piece of art.

582
00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:22.902
This guy never makes the same watch twice.

583
00:39:22.902 --> 00:39:25.502
So I'm pretty sure this is the only watch there is in this design.

584
00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:29.502
On top of that, this butterfly is a part of his Chaos series.

585
00:39:29.502 --> 00:39:30.942
So there can only be one.

586
00:39:32.072 --> 00:39:35.112
My gosh, I can't believe I'm actually seeing one of his works.

587
00:39:35.643 --> 00:39:39.083
Sir, are you sure that this was made by a master craftsman?

588
00:39:39.083 --> 00:39:40.783
Gosh, of course.

589
00:39:40.953 --> 00:39:44.922
But I guess I should check to be sure, so I'll call you...

590
00:39:44.922 --> 00:39:46.223
after I take a closer look.

591
00:39:46.223 --> 00:39:48.893
Sometimes, the components turn out to be fake.

592
00:39:49.192 --> 00:39:51.522
Okay. Please do me a favor.

593
00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:55.962
Moo Gang, long time no see.

594
00:39:55.962 --> 00:39:57.902
I heard you found Woo Byung Sik's watch.

595
00:39:57.902 --> 00:40:00.232
This might lead to a major breakthrough.

596
00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:03.042
But if someone finds out that you broke into his house...

597
00:40:03.042 --> 00:40:05.743
and took that watch, it'll all end up going to waste.

598
00:40:05.743 --> 00:40:07.243
You shouldn't do that next time.

599
00:40:07.243 --> 00:40:10.442
You should be grateful that Pastor Kang didn't babble about you.

600
00:40:11.913 --> 00:40:14.612
Hey, Crazy Dog. Yes?

601
00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:15.813
- Captain Bong. - Yes?

602
00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:17.322
- The chief is looking for you. - Yes.

603
00:40:17.322 --> 00:40:18.422
- Hurry. - Okay.

604
00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:21.692
Yes, okay. Let's talk at the office.

605
00:40:22.922 --> 00:40:25.763
I knew you'd be different since you studied in the States.

606
00:40:26.732 --> 00:40:27.792
You punk.

607
00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:29.763
What was that?

608
00:40:38.572 --> 00:40:39.572
So are you saying...

609
00:40:40.042 --> 00:40:42.342
you were there for your own business and just happened to come across...

610
00:40:42.342 --> 00:40:45.382
the crime site without knowing that the bomb was going to go off?

611
00:40:47.313 --> 00:40:50.482
And you're also saying that you saw a fake nurse,

612
00:40:50.482 --> 00:40:52.223
bribed by Woo Byung Sik,

613
00:40:52.692 --> 00:40:57.522
switching Mr. Park's wife when you were at the hospice ward...

614
00:40:57.522 --> 00:41:00.933
just by coincidence, right?

615
00:41:02.263 --> 00:41:03.803
Yes, that's right.

616
00:41:03.803 --> 00:41:08.433
My mom works in that hospital.

617
00:41:09.542 --> 00:41:12.143
Well, it happened when I was there to see my mom.

618
00:41:16.913 --> 00:41:20.313
All these coincidences do not seem coincidental at all.

619
00:41:22.482 --> 00:41:23.522
That's enough.

620
00:41:23.522 --> 00:41:27.592
We'll call you if there's anything more we'd like to ask.

621
00:41:28.092 --> 00:41:29.362
- Okay. - Let's go.

622
00:41:31.292 --> 00:41:34.533
Go home safely, and call me when you find out about anything.

623
00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:35.862
Bye.

624
00:41:40.572 --> 00:41:42.703
Does that mean Park Soon Nam was able to prove his innocence?

625
00:41:42.703 --> 00:41:44.002
I guess so.

626
00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:57.053
Joon, are Seung Chul's parents no longer being doubted...

627
00:41:57.053 --> 00:41:59.152
for something they didn't do?

628
00:41:59.752 --> 00:42:02.022
Yes. Follow me.

629
00:42:02.022 --> 00:42:04.292
I don't know who threw all those photos of Woo Byung Sik,

630
00:42:04.292 --> 00:42:06.862
but I thank him so much.

631
00:42:09.362 --> 00:42:10.362
Right.

632
00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:17.203
Now, let's go back to focusing on finding...

633
00:42:17.203 --> 00:42:20.313
that mean jerk who's trying to harm Leo, shall we?

634
00:42:22.243 --> 00:42:23.313
Just a moment.

635
00:42:25.612 --> 00:42:26.683
Yes, Mr. Oh.

636
00:42:27.152 --> 00:42:28.453
How do you feel?

637
00:42:28.982 --> 00:42:31.183
I'm a lot better. I even got rid of my cast.

638
00:42:31.783 --> 00:42:32.822
Where are you?

639
00:42:34.993 --> 00:42:37.563
What? You're at the police station?

640
00:42:40.563 --> 00:42:41.732
Oh, I see.

641
00:42:42.362 --> 00:42:45.263
I also got a call saying that I needed to get investigated.

642
00:42:46.072 --> 00:42:47.373
I'm going to go after work.

643
00:42:50.502 --> 00:42:54.143
Don't worry. I'll just make something up.

644
00:42:55.643 --> 00:42:58.542
Okay, I'll go to your office...

645
00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:00.013
and give you a business report.

646
00:43:00.553 --> 00:43:02.513
Okay. Bye.

647
00:43:05.953 --> 00:43:08.522
Where's Sang Min? I haven't seen him around lately.

648
00:43:08.692 --> 00:43:11.763
He went to the States to meet his mother.

649
00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:14.632
He must've gone to go shopping with his mother.

650
00:43:17.402 --> 00:43:20.672
My goodness. Sip Gyeon, chew well.

651
00:43:20.902 --> 00:43:22.333
I'll go now, Joon.

652
00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.002
Thank you for picking me up.

653
00:43:24.973 --> 00:43:28.013
Did you forget? Leo's in danger right now.

654
00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:30.942
That's true.

655
00:43:31.612 --> 00:43:33.313
But you'll need to go alone today.

656
00:43:33.313 --> 00:43:35.382
I really need to work starting from today.

657
00:43:35.382 --> 00:43:37.683
Mr. Oh got hurt instead of me.

658
00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:40.353
Let's go see him tomorrow.

659
00:43:40.453 --> 00:43:44.223
No, no. I'm the one in a hurry. I have no time.

660
00:43:44.223 --> 00:43:47.393
I don't have time either. I need to get those documents...

661
00:43:47.632 --> 00:43:49.362
in order to catch my dad's murderer.

662
00:43:51.103 --> 00:43:53.272
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

663
00:43:58.873 --> 00:44:00.473
Joon.

664
00:44:02.712 --> 00:44:05.783
She'll try to save that woman's life if she sees her.

665
00:44:07.152 --> 00:44:10.183
Why... Why are you suddenly doing this?

666
00:44:10.422 --> 00:44:12.853
I can't just let you leave like this.

667
00:44:14.422 --> 00:44:16.223
I should've been more considerate. I'm sorry.

668
00:44:17.922 --> 00:44:21.833
I was too selfish. I'm sorry. So please don't be angry, okay?

669
00:44:23.533 --> 00:44:25.333
It's okay, Joon.

670
00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:29.402
I'm the one who's sorry.

671
00:44:37.583 --> 00:44:38.643
A shadow...

672
00:44:43.152 --> 00:44:45.283
What are you doing here?

673
00:44:45.623 --> 00:44:48.053
Where's your mom? Where is she?

674
00:44:53.592 --> 00:44:56.103
Where's your mom? Why are you here all by yourself?

675
00:44:56.862 --> 00:44:58.103
Hyo Jin.

676
00:45:01.603 --> 00:45:02.942
Mom.

677
00:45:03.042 --> 00:45:05.902
Where were you? I've been looking for you for ages.

678
00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:07.813
I needed to go to the bathroom.

679
00:45:18.152 --> 00:45:19.393
What's your problem?

680
00:45:25.417 --> 00:45:28.649
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E08 Black "Falsely Accused"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

681
00:45:33.632 --> 00:45:35.172
Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

682
00:45:40.212 --> 00:45:41.612
You jerk.

683
00:45:43.942 --> 00:45:45.342
You piece of trash.

684
00:45:50.123 --> 00:45:51.953
You were at the Halloween party, weren't you?

685
00:45:53.353 --> 00:45:54.493
What?

686
00:45:54.922 --> 00:45:56.962
Yes, I was. But who...

687
00:45:56.962 --> 00:45:59.893
You better be careful of Oh Man Soo.

688
00:46:00.592 --> 00:46:02.292
Don't ever trust him.

689
00:46:02.962 --> 00:46:04.663
What do you mean?

690
00:46:09.502 --> 00:46:11.402
He's the one who made me look like this.

691
00:46:16.313 --> 00:46:18.283
(Exclusive! Royeol Group's youngest son, Oh Man Soo, faces a lawsuit.)

692
00:46:18.683 --> 00:46:19.783
What?

693
00:46:21.382 --> 00:46:23.752
Let's go. You should go and tell her that you're sorry.

694
00:46:24.783 --> 00:46:26.592
You should beg her for forgiveness.

695
00:46:26.993 --> 00:46:29.522
No, let me go. I didn't do it.

696
00:46:29.522 --> 00:46:30.763
What are you talking about?

697
00:46:31.123 --> 00:46:32.322
She's going to kill herself and her daughter...

698
00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:33.893
after being falsely accused as a con artist.

699
00:46:34.263 --> 00:46:36.703
Ask her for forgiveness, and just turn yourself in.

700
00:46:36.703 --> 00:46:37.803
Hurry up.

701
00:46:37.803 --> 00:46:38.902
Let me go.

702
00:46:39.002 --> 00:46:40.072
Let me go now.

703
00:46:40.333 --> 00:46:42.402
Go see her right now.

704
00:46:42.672 --> 00:46:44.002
I said, let me go!

705
00:46:46.313 --> 00:46:47.743
Can't you trust me either?

706
00:47:00.292 --> 00:47:03.822
She's going to try to save the mother and daughter this time.

707
00:47:09.803 --> 00:47:11.632
When will I be able to catch that loser?

708
00:47:17.542 --> 00:47:20.013
Oh Man Soo is the youngest son of Royeol Group's Oh Chun Soo.

709
00:47:20.013 --> 00:47:21.672
And he's also the CEO of Royeol Insurance.

710
00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.482
He's facing charges for having attempted to rape a woman...

711
00:47:24.482 --> 00:47:27.683
and for inflicting injuries on her that will take...

712
00:47:27.683 --> 00:47:29.623
seven weeks to fully recover.

713
00:47:30.053 --> 00:47:33.322
The police have started investigating the case.

714
00:47:33.692 --> 00:47:36.563
- The receiver's phone is off. - And according to the victim,

715
00:47:36.563 --> 00:47:39.022
- Please leave a message after... - she wishes Mr. Oh to...

716
00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.292
My gosh!

717
00:47:40.663 --> 00:47:44.103
Royeol Insurance's CEO, Mr. Oh Man Soo, is facing charges...

718
00:47:44.103 --> 00:47:46.002
for attempted rape and assault.

719
00:47:46.002 --> 00:47:49.402
It also turns out that he has a criminal record.

720
00:47:49.743 --> 00:47:52.203
We don't know what that criminal record is yet.

721
00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:55.413
And we can't be sure if he really tried to rape the victim or not.

722
00:47:55.643 --> 00:47:58.482
- However... - How irresponsible can you get?

723
00:47:59.913 --> 00:48:01.853
We've confirmed that he was once taken to...

724
00:48:01.913 --> 00:48:04.882
the police station for having gotten in a fight with a bartender.

725
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.292
I didn't do it.

726
00:48:06.353 --> 00:48:09.192
Then why did she sue you?

727
00:48:09.192 --> 00:48:10.263
Hey.

728
00:48:10.692 --> 00:48:11.723
Look at this.

729
00:48:13.993 --> 00:48:16.333
Even your friend's a witness. Don't try to lie to me.

730
00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:20.833
(Written Statement, Name: Lee Young Hee)

731
00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:27.473
Look into her background, and release it to the press.

732
00:48:27.473 --> 00:48:29.072
Find anything that could become a weakness.

733
00:48:31.112 --> 00:48:32.313
Who's that?

734
00:48:33.313 --> 00:48:35.413
- It's you. - Really?

735
00:48:42.723 --> 00:48:44.763
Hyo Jin, you should wash up and sleep now.

736
00:48:45.092 --> 00:48:46.333
Wash up, okay?

737
00:49:09.752 --> 00:49:11.283
- Who are you? - My gosh.

738
00:49:25.632 --> 00:49:27.203
(Sip Gyeon)

739
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:29.402
I said, let me go!

740
00:49:30.973 --> 00:49:32.303
Can't you trust me either?

741
00:49:33.373 --> 00:49:35.942
Mr. Oh really is not the type to do such a thing.

742
00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:38.283
But the will...

743
00:49:52.263 --> 00:49:53.533
Why did you come here?

744
00:49:53.862 --> 00:49:57.163
I just wanted to see if you were doing okay.

745
00:49:58.303 --> 00:50:00.172
By the way,

746
00:50:00.672 --> 00:50:02.603
are you sure it was...

747
00:50:03.502 --> 00:50:04.902
Mr. Oh?

748
00:50:05.542 --> 00:50:07.172
Did Man Soo send you?

749
00:50:07.873 --> 00:50:09.272
Does he want me to settle?

750
00:50:09.382 --> 00:50:11.643
No. That's not why I'm here.

751
00:50:14.252 --> 00:50:15.813
I want you to tell him that...

752
00:50:16.183 --> 00:50:18.422
I'm not going to settle for even a trillion dollars.

753
00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:22.252
I'm going to make him pay for doing this to me.

754
00:50:22.393 --> 00:50:24.292
No, that's not why I'm here. I...

755
00:50:24.292 --> 00:50:26.333
Get out! Get out of here!

756
00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:28.232
- Go away! - I... I'm sorry.

757
00:50:28.232 --> 00:50:30.333
- My gosh. - Get out of here!

758
00:50:31.563 --> 00:50:33.072
You're mistaken!

759
00:50:35.172 --> 00:50:36.342
Excuse me.

760
00:50:39.743 --> 00:50:42.342
You're so easy to predict.

761
00:50:42.982 --> 00:50:45.942
What are you doing here, Joon?

762
00:50:47.982 --> 00:50:50.223
I followed you here because I thought you'd get yourself...

763
00:50:50.223 --> 00:50:52.382
in trouble again after seeing a shadow in that little girl's body.

764
00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:54.353
Her mom...

765
00:50:55.123 --> 00:50:57.993
is going to carry her to a really high building and jump from there.

766
00:50:59.592 --> 00:51:02.092
She commits suicide after she writes a will...

767
00:51:04.002 --> 00:51:06.632
because she gets upset for people mistaking her as a con artist.

768
00:51:08.433 --> 00:51:12.442
Then that puppet CEO really must've done that to her.

769
00:51:13.172 --> 00:51:16.313
Then she won't have to die because he is guilty.

770
00:51:16.313 --> 00:51:17.542
I guess so.

771
00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:21.482
But Mr. Oh...

772
00:51:21.813 --> 00:51:23.752
isn't the type to do such a thing.

773
00:51:27.493 --> 00:51:29.893
How can you be so sure of that?

774
00:51:31.592 --> 00:51:32.962
Exactly.

775
00:51:35.493 --> 00:51:36.763
She ends up putting...

776
00:51:37.002 --> 00:51:39.203
her life and her daughter's life on the line because of him.

777
00:51:39.902 --> 00:51:42.232
And that makes me wonder if Mr. Oh really is guilty.

778
00:51:42.502 --> 00:51:45.342
I never trust any human being.

779
00:51:46.473 --> 00:51:48.013
I don't want you trusting anyone either.

780
00:51:50.183 --> 00:51:51.413
Let's go now.

781
00:52:01.893 --> 00:52:04.022
Why is she so down?

782
00:52:05.393 --> 00:52:06.663
It's bothering me.

783
00:52:06.962 --> 00:52:08.232
- He's coming. - His car's coming.

784
00:52:08.232 --> 00:52:09.462
- There he is. - He's coming.

785
00:52:14.973 --> 00:52:16.103
He's here.

786
00:52:16.272 --> 00:52:18.072
Did you see her face and body condition?

787
00:52:18.072 --> 00:52:20.172
Why did you invite a woman who works at a bar to your party?

788
00:52:20.172 --> 00:52:21.842
Did you have ulterior motives when you invited her?

789
00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:25.083
She must think of calumny very lightly...

790
00:52:25.813 --> 00:52:28.212
just because I'm a son of a conglomerate.

791
00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:30.083
Falsely accusing someone is a serious crime.

792
00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:32.623
I'll surely make her pay for what she did.

793
00:52:33.493 --> 00:52:36.022
- Please tell us more! - Give us more details!

794
00:52:36.022 --> 00:52:37.592
- Please say a few more words! - Please tell us more!

795
00:52:49.033 --> 00:52:52.603
We think that she's a typical gold digger who blackmails men.

796
00:52:52.813 --> 00:52:55.212
We believe that what she's doing is completely illegal...

797
00:52:55.212 --> 00:52:57.542
and will take strong legal actions against her.

798
00:52:57.542 --> 00:53:00.313
The accuser who's pressing charges against Royeol Insurance's Mr. Oh...

799
00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:03.482
does work at an adult entertainment establishment,

800
00:53:03.482 --> 00:53:07.322
and she was even arrested for taking Ecstasy 10 years ago.

801
00:53:07.322 --> 00:53:09.462
She also has a daughter who was born out of wedlock.

802
00:53:09.592 --> 00:53:10.792
So she has a criminal record.

803
00:53:10.792 --> 00:53:14.232
A barmaid is insisting that she almost got raped...

804
00:53:14.232 --> 00:53:17.462
and that she got seriously assaulted because she refused.

805
00:53:17.462 --> 00:53:20.203
Well... I guess it's possible, but it's a little...

806
00:53:20.232 --> 00:53:22.803
Gosh, this is crazy. Those shameless reporters...

807
00:53:22.803 --> 00:53:24.243
Is that considered sexual assault?

808
00:53:27.013 --> 00:53:28.643
Where's the evidence?

809
00:53:28.712 --> 00:53:31.382
It's not like Mr. Oh Man Soo's DNA was found inside her body.

810
00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:33.083
But she needs to be hospitalized for six weeks...

811
00:53:33.083 --> 00:53:35.152
It's possible that she tried to hurt herself.

812
00:53:35.152 --> 00:53:38.353
If she says that she got assaulted and settles with the accused,

813
00:53:38.353 --> 00:53:41.322
- it'll greatly affect Royeol Group. - Mom, what's a gold digger?

814
00:53:41.322 --> 00:53:43.022
- What? - It's obvious...

815
00:53:43.022 --> 00:53:44.493
that she's a typical gold digger.

816
00:53:45.263 --> 00:53:47.192
- Go. You'll be late for school. - Okay.

817
00:53:58.143 --> 00:54:01.313
She's clearly trying to extract money from the corporate heir.

818
00:54:01.313 --> 00:54:02.313
You said she even has a daughter.

819
00:54:02.313 --> 00:54:05.683
That girl should be calling me any minute now.

820
00:54:09.353 --> 00:54:11.882
But you won't have it your way this time.

821
00:54:12.993 --> 00:54:14.853
I won't let that happen.

826
00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:27.833
in the CCTV footage...

827
00:54:28.072 --> 00:54:30.402
is the same one as Woo Byung Sik's watch,

828
00:54:30.402 --> 00:54:34.243
but the craftsman never makes more than one of the same design.

829
00:54:34.473 --> 00:54:37.042
Then it must've been Woo Byung Sik's doing.

Right, but we don't have enough evidence.

831

so we're utilizing our informants at the moment...

832

833
00:54:46.192 --> 00:54:48.493
and received the killing orders.

834
00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:49.692
If we can get him to admit...

835

that Woo Byung Sik instigated to commit the murder...

00:56:10.473 --> 00:56:12.643
to be Oh Man Soo's best friend, and the professional baseball player,

849

Hey, look. You need to watch that.

That's the reality of this country.

854
00:56:27.292 --> 00:56:28.792
Just to bury the Woo Byung Sik case,

855
00:56:28.792 --> 00:56:30.862
they intentionally made that scandal break out.

856
00:56:30.862 --> 00:56:32.623
This is a conspiracy.

Why should we connect the two cases together and wrap them up?

869
00:57:11.203 --> 00:57:13.603
Gosh, we don't have enough evidence yet.

You're well aware of it.

You said that watch is one of a kind.

We haven't checked the parts in it yet.

All right, fine. Let's say that it is one of a kind.

874
00:57:24.382 --> 00:57:28.513
But what if Woo Byung Sik lent it to the person who killed Han Jin Sook?

875
00:57:29.013 --> 00:57:33.152
And how would Han Jin Sook have known about him being alive?

876

Even if she had known about it, why would that jerk, who ran away...

Is there evidence to prove that Han Jin Sook didn't kill Woo Byung Sik?

Is there? Answer me.

01:03:53.172 --> 01:03:55.803
How dare you press charges? I own Royeol Electronics' stock,

974
01:03:55.803 --> 01:03:58.402
but the price has hit the bottom because of what you did.

975
01:03:58.442 --> 01:04:00.243
What will you do about it? How will you fix it?

976
01:04:00.243 --> 01:04:01.743
Let's go and eat something, Yoon Seok.

977
01:04:02.112 --> 01:04:05.183
You're a barmaid with a child. You almost got raped?

978
01:04:05.743 --> 01:04:07.382
Even a dog would sneer at you.

979
01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:10.982
What did you just say? You little...

980
01:04:11.422 --> 01:04:14.092
- How rude. - What are you doing now?

981
01:04:14.092 --> 01:04:15.692
- Let go of her! - I said, let go!

982
01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:16.792
What? Why you...

983
01:04:16.792 --> 01:04:19.862
- You started it! - Enough. Break it up!

984
01:04:19.862 --> 01:04:23.002
Mister, please help my mom.

985
01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:24.433
Go away.

986
01:04:24.433 --> 01:04:27.502
- Just go. - Mister, please help my mom.

987
01:04:28.002 --> 01:04:29.002
Go away.

988
01:04:29.572 --> 01:04:31.172
And don't call me mister, okay?

989
01:04:31.603 --> 01:04:33.672
Mister, please.

990
01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.942
I'll give you something delicious.

991
01:04:37.283 --> 01:04:40.053
- Mister, please. - What?

992
01:04:41.053 --> 01:04:42.183
What's this?

993
01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:44.783
Leave me alone. Go away!

994
01:04:46.353 --> 01:04:47.652
Mister.

995
01:05:03.402 --> 01:05:04.603
Here. Try to hit right here.

996
01:05:09.882 --> 01:05:10.882
It doesn't hurt at all.

997
01:05:26.263 --> 01:05:27.433
Hyo Jin.

998
01:05:43.882 --> 01:05:45.643
That little rascal.

999
01:06:11.873 --> 01:06:13.072
We could eat together.

1000
01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:18.442
Why are you crying? What's wrong?

1001
01:06:18.982 --> 01:06:20.313
Are you feeling better now?

1002
01:06:22.822 --> 01:06:25.022
Oh, would you like some food?

1003
01:06:34.592 --> 01:06:35.592
Now, the next one.

1004
01:06:40.732 --> 01:06:41.933
You're so good at this.

1005
01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:46.342
Young Hee.

1006
01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.942
It's me, Madam Hwang.

1007
01:06:51.042 --> 01:06:54.652
You look terrible. Have you eaten yet?

1008
01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:01.453
What brings you here?

1009
01:07:12.203 --> 01:07:13.603
(Agreement)

1010
01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:19.412
If you sign it, we'll send you a million dollars right away.

1011
01:07:19.613 --> 01:07:20.613
A million dollars?

1012
01:07:24.282 --> 01:07:25.412
(Accuser Lee Young Hee)

1013
01:07:25.412 --> 01:07:26.582
(Accused Oh Man Soo)

1014
01:07:26.582 --> 01:07:27.683
(Mr. Oh never assaulted me on October 30, 2017.)

1015
01:07:27.683 --> 01:07:28.813
What is this?

1016
01:07:29.683 --> 01:07:30.782
I hurt myself...

1017
01:07:31.653 --> 01:07:33.023
and blackmailed him?

1018
01:07:34.292 --> 01:07:37.563
You're basically saying that I should admit being a gold digger.

1019
01:07:38.863 --> 01:07:40.162
You jerks.

1020
01:07:40.592 --> 01:07:42.263
Gosh, what are you doing now?

1021
01:07:42.363 --> 01:07:45.032
Do you know how hard it is to earn a million dollars?

1022
01:07:45.032 --> 01:07:46.202
Madam Hwang!

1023
01:07:46.202 --> 01:07:47.773
Women like us...

1024
01:07:47.872 --> 01:07:50.542
will never even get to see a million dollars in our lifetime.

1025
01:07:50.542 --> 01:07:53.013
Then what about my sufferings? What about the unfairness?

1026
01:07:53.113 --> 01:07:55.643
Everyone in the country thinks that I'm a gold digger now!

1027
01:07:55.643 --> 01:07:58.683
Do you think that people will stop thinking of you that way...

1028
01:07:58.683 --> 01:08:00.813
if you don't sign this agreement?

1029
01:08:02.483 --> 01:08:05.582
Do you actually think that people will believe women like us?

1030
01:08:05.853 --> 01:08:08.592
And until when will you work as a bar girl...

1031
01:08:08.592 --> 01:08:10.122
to raise Hyo Jin?

1032
01:08:10.122 --> 01:08:13.193
Do you only care about how you feel? You don't think about Hyo Jin?

1033
01:08:14.733 --> 01:08:16.502
If you don't sign the agreement,

1034
01:08:16.662 --> 01:08:18.403
you'll get arrested for making false accusations,

1035
01:08:18.403 --> 01:08:21.073
blackmailing, defamation, and so on.

1036
01:08:21.502 --> 01:08:22.502
Then...

1037
01:08:23.603 --> 01:08:26.113
what do you think will happen to your daughter...

1038
01:08:27.412 --> 01:08:28.712
who will be left alone?

1039
01:08:30.113 --> 01:08:31.513
It really isn't a difficult decision.

1040
01:08:32.342 --> 01:08:34.782
Will you sign it and keep your lips sealed,

1041
01:08:34.782 --> 01:08:37.353
or will you go to jail?

1042
01:08:37.353 --> 01:08:41.122
Please think about it. Call me when you make up your mind.

1043
01:08:46.393 --> 01:08:47.393
Hey.

1044
01:08:48.162 --> 01:08:50.103
Just think about Hyo Jin.

1045
01:08:50.532 --> 01:08:52.563
Only Hyo Jin, okay?

1046
01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:08.183
You poor thing.

1047
01:09:41.124 --> 01:09:42.124
What was that just now?

1048
01:09:43.094 --> 01:09:46.034
Ha Ram said that two people will die together.

1049
01:10:16.034 --> 01:10:17.235
Well, sir.

1050
01:10:17.235 --> 01:10:18.664
I told you not to interrupt.

1051
01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:22.704
Hyo Jin.

1052
01:10:22.704 --> 01:10:25.305
Gosh, this kid was being so stubborn.

1053
01:10:27.344 --> 01:10:30.515
Mister, please don't send my mom to jail.

1054
01:10:30.714 --> 01:10:31.714
What?

1055
01:10:34.744 --> 01:10:37.754
I brought this. So please...

1056
01:10:38.254 --> 01:10:41.855
don't put my mom behind bars, okay?

1057
01:10:42.084 --> 01:10:43.555
Mister!

1058
01:10:45.254 --> 01:10:48.525
Mister, please.

1059
01:10:48.525 --> 01:10:49.794
Why are you being like this?

1060
01:10:50.235 --> 01:10:51.464
- Come on. - Please...

1061
01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:52.865
- Mister! - Let's go.

1062
01:10:52.865 --> 01:10:54.435
Help my mom.

1063
01:10:54.664 --> 01:10:57.204
Mister, please help my mom.

1064
01:10:58.075 --> 01:10:59.605
Please!

1065
01:11:00.475 --> 01:11:02.914
Mister, please help her.

1066
01:11:07.685 --> 01:11:09.615
(Agreement)

1067
01:11:12.315 --> 01:11:14.485
(Accuser Lee Young Hee: My mom)

1068
01:11:23.534 --> 01:11:24.865
Yes, Lawyer Park.

1069
01:11:26.065 --> 01:11:27.405
What is this agreement?

1070
01:11:27.765 --> 01:11:29.435
Did you threaten Tiffany with this?

1071
01:11:29.435 --> 01:11:32.575
You could've just gone to court. Why did you have to do this?

1072
01:11:36.275 --> 01:11:39.084
She'll be charged as a gold digger and commit suicide with her kid.

1073
01:11:41.744 --> 01:11:43.315
Come with me.

1074
01:11:45.355 --> 01:11:47.624
Where's your mom?

1075
01:11:47.884 --> 01:11:49.294
You know your mom's phone number, right?

1076
01:11:50.355 --> 01:11:51.594
Tell me!

1077
01:11:52.994 --> 01:11:54.924
I'm taking you to the police!

1078
01:11:55.025 --> 01:11:56.034
You'll be in big trouble!

1079
01:11:56.034 --> 01:11:58.235
- Got it? - No. Let me go!

1080
01:11:58.594 --> 01:12:00.204
Follow me!

1081
01:12:00.204 --> 01:12:01.964
Stop it.

1082
01:12:03.305 --> 01:12:04.475
Go back to work.

1083
01:12:04.735 --> 01:12:06.145
Mister.

1084
01:12:06.145 --> 01:12:08.145
Don't come close.

1085
01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:11.544
- Don't cling on to me. - Mister.

1086
01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:12.784
Joon.

1087
01:12:13.714 --> 01:12:14.945
What are you doing here?

1088
01:12:14.945 --> 01:12:17.655
Oh, you told me to keep watch.

1089
01:12:18.214 --> 01:12:21.055
This kid was wandering by herself, so I was keeping an eye on her.

1090
01:12:23.355 --> 01:12:25.865
Wait, what are you doing here?

1091
01:12:26.725 --> 01:12:28.094
I came to see Mr. Oh.

1092
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:29.594
What?

1093
01:12:30.494 --> 01:12:32.534
It's nothing. Let's go.

1094
01:12:32.704 --> 01:12:34.334
Hyo Jin, let's go to your mom.

1095
01:12:35.805 --> 01:12:36.805
Hold on.

1096
01:12:38.204 --> 01:12:39.344
Yes, Mr. Oh.

1097
01:12:40.905 --> 01:12:43.544
Yes. I understand. Okay.

1098
01:12:44.275 --> 01:12:45.344
Wait.

1099
01:12:47.084 --> 01:12:49.084
Go first.

1100
01:12:49.084 --> 01:12:51.284
I need to talk to Mr. Oh. I'll be right out.

1101
01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.384
Go first.

1102
01:12:53.655 --> 01:12:54.725
Wait.

1103
01:13:00.895 --> 01:13:03.464
What are you doing? Get off of me.

1104
01:13:08.365 --> 01:13:10.034
The shadow you saw in Tiffany...

1105
01:13:10.704 --> 01:13:12.744
Tell me everything about it. Don't leave anything out.

1106
01:13:13.044 --> 01:13:14.844
Well... The thing is...

1107
01:13:17.344 --> 01:13:18.714
I saw...

1108
01:13:19.384 --> 01:13:21.844
Tiffany and her daughter by chance at the police station.

1109
01:13:25.015 --> 01:13:27.454
I saw the same video for both people.

1110
01:13:28.124 --> 01:13:30.294
I'm not sure where it was.

1111
01:13:30.555 --> 01:13:33.195
I saw the honeymoon car at the amusement park.

1112
01:13:34.395 --> 01:13:35.395
Anyway.

1113
01:13:36.565 --> 01:13:39.334
She took her daughter to a high place and jumped.

1114
01:13:41.634 --> 01:13:43.704
There was a will too.

1115
01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.044
A will?

1116
01:13:54.214 --> 01:13:56.754
Okay. You can go now.

1117
01:13:57.754 --> 01:13:58.815
Mr. Oh.

1118
01:13:58.815 --> 01:13:59.985
I said, go.

1119
01:14:09.435 --> 01:14:10.534
Mr. Oh!

1120
01:14:10.994 --> 01:14:12.634
Say something.

1121
01:14:13.935 --> 01:14:15.704
I'm confused too.

1122
01:14:16.905 --> 01:14:18.504
If I stay still,

1123
01:14:18.905 --> 01:14:21.204
Tiffany and her daughter will die.

1124
01:14:22.174 --> 01:14:23.315
Mr. Oh!

1125
01:14:24.174 --> 01:14:25.374
Mr. Oh!

1126
01:14:32.084 --> 01:14:33.655
(Statement)

1127
01:14:33.655 --> 01:14:36.325
(She broke the second-floor window and jumped out.)

1128
01:15:05.155 --> 01:15:06.725
(Witness Statement)

1129
01:15:06.725 --> 01:15:08.954
(Witness, Son Byung Ho)

1130
01:15:21.765 --> 01:15:23.075
What are you doing?

1131
01:15:23.204 --> 01:15:25.034
Why did you take my child without saying anything?

1132
01:15:25.174 --> 01:15:26.645
I didn't take...

1133
01:15:26.645 --> 01:15:27.744
Come with me.

1134
01:15:28.145 --> 01:15:30.645
Mom, don't worry, I just...

1135
01:15:30.645 --> 01:15:33.714
I'm upset as it is. Why are you making me feel worse?

1136
01:15:33.714 --> 01:15:35.855
Why are you doing this? Why won't you listen?

1137
01:15:35.855 --> 01:15:37.155
Why?

1138
01:15:37.155 --> 01:15:39.015
I hate you, Mom!

1139
01:15:39.015 --> 01:15:40.624
Why are you crying?

1140
01:15:40.624 --> 01:15:41.924
Why are you crying?

1141
01:15:41.924 --> 01:15:45.494
I begged Uncle Man Soo to forgive you.

1142
01:15:46.565 --> 01:15:47.594
What?

1143
01:15:47.865 --> 01:15:51.265
I got on my knees and asked Uncle Man Soo to forgive you.

1144
01:15:51.265 --> 01:15:53.034
To forgive you just this once.

1145
01:15:53.634 --> 01:15:56.634
I begged him like this.

1146
01:15:59.174 --> 01:16:01.704
Why did you beg him?

1147
01:16:01.945 --> 01:16:03.714
My daughter, why did you beg him?

1148
01:16:05.315 --> 01:16:08.214
I'm sorry. Mommy's sorry.

1149
01:16:08.445 --> 01:16:10.384
Why did you beg him?

1150
01:16:12.754 --> 01:16:14.384
Punish those obsessed with money!

1151
01:16:14.384 --> 01:16:16.355
- Punish them! - Punish them!

1152
01:16:16.355 --> 01:16:18.094
A man isn't a women's wallet!

1153
01:16:18.094 --> 01:16:19.594
- They're not! - They're not!

1154
01:16:19.594 --> 01:16:21.094
Victims shouldn't be punished!

1155
01:16:21.094 --> 01:16:22.395
- They shouldn't be punished! - They shouldn't be punished!

1156
01:16:22.395 --> 01:16:25.464
Leo's best friend, Oh Man Soo, is innocent!

1157
01:16:25.464 --> 01:16:27.435
- He's innocent! - He's innocent!

1158
01:16:27.435 --> 01:16:30.235
- Die, you gold digger! - Die!

1159
01:16:30.305 --> 01:16:32.645
What did I do wrong?

1160
01:16:32.874 --> 01:16:34.905
Why are you doing this to me?

1161
01:16:40.244 --> 01:16:41.485
What on earth happened?

1162
01:16:42.344 --> 01:16:45.185
I told you to bring Tiffany to my room?

1163
01:16:45.185 --> 01:16:47.754
You don't remember anything when you black out from drinking.

1164
01:16:47.754 --> 01:16:49.924
I told you not to drink too much that night.

1165
01:16:51.325 --> 01:16:53.124
You were acting up and being a jerk.

1166
01:16:53.225 --> 01:16:56.695
I don't know what happened, but you drank until you were drunk.

1167
01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.464
Then you told me to bring Tiffany to your room.

1168
01:16:58.464 --> 01:17:00.964
I did? To my room?

1169
01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:03.935
Yes. You were stumbling around and...

1170
01:17:06.504 --> 01:17:08.775
Hey. Hey!

1171
01:17:09.515 --> 01:17:10.714
Did you see Tiffany?

1172
01:17:10.714 --> 01:17:12.445
Who? Tiffany?

1173
01:17:12.445 --> 01:17:13.445
Yes.

1174
01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:17.784
I bought a video game for her daughter, so tell her to get it.

1175
01:17:18.515 --> 01:17:20.084
- Hurry. - What's he saying?

1176
01:17:24.225 --> 01:17:26.065
I had a hard time writing my statement.

1177
01:17:26.195 --> 01:17:28.725
But what can I do? I can't lie.

1178
01:17:29.494 --> 01:17:31.664
Leo and I are in trouble because of you.

1179
01:17:31.664 --> 01:17:33.204
Don't contact me for the time being.

1180
01:17:33.964 --> 01:17:34.964
I'll get going now.

1181
01:17:39.544 --> 01:17:40.844
Was it really me?

1182
01:17:43.515 --> 01:17:44.945
No way.

1183
01:17:48.714 --> 01:17:51.214
No. It can't be.

1184
01:18:01.265 --> 01:18:02.365
It was you, right?

1185
01:18:03.265 --> 01:18:04.464
Go out.

1186
01:18:09.874 --> 01:18:11.004
What's wrong?

1187
01:18:11.235 --> 01:18:13.645
That day, you were in my room.

1188
01:18:20.115 --> 01:18:22.655
Gosh, why is he in my room?

1189
01:18:22.914 --> 01:18:23.914
Leo!

1190
01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:27.225
Wake up! Get up right now!

1191
01:18:28.924 --> 01:18:30.655
Darn it.

1192
01:18:32.865 --> 01:18:34.265
You were sleeping on the sofa in my room.

1193
01:18:34.265 --> 01:18:35.964
I remember clearly, but...

1194
01:18:36.435 --> 01:18:39.034
they're saying that Tiffany almost got raped in that room.

1195
01:18:39.134 --> 01:18:40.504
I looked into it,

1196
01:18:40.805 --> 01:18:43.305
and during the time Tiffany claims to have gotten raped,

1197
01:18:43.534 --> 01:18:45.945
no one saw you at the party.

1198
01:18:46.204 --> 01:18:47.975
You were in that room.

1199
01:18:48.174 --> 01:18:50.874
If Tiffany had gotten raped in that room by me or someone else,

1200
01:18:50.874 --> 01:18:52.615
there is no way you wouldn't have known.

1201
01:18:52.985 --> 01:18:54.985
Even if you were passed out,

1202
01:18:55.384 --> 01:18:57.784
Tiffany got beat half to death in that room.

1203
01:18:57.784 --> 01:18:59.254
There's no way you wouldn't know.

1204
01:18:59.954 --> 01:19:03.055
You tried to drag her into a hotel with you in the past too.

1205
01:19:04.424 --> 01:19:05.525
It was you, right?

1206
01:19:07.164 --> 01:19:08.725
You jerk!

1207
01:19:09.695 --> 01:19:10.695
Goodness.

1208
01:19:11.195 --> 01:19:13.065
You really don't remember anything?

1209
01:19:15.105 --> 01:19:17.605
You're right. I was in your room then.

1210
01:19:18.805 --> 01:19:20.945
So it was you, you jerk!

1211
01:19:22.344 --> 01:19:23.374
No.

1212
01:19:24.075 --> 01:19:26.145
I didn't hit Tiffany.

1213
01:19:32.985 --> 01:19:34.924
I woke up from my nap,

1214
01:19:51.305 --> 01:19:53.744
so I went out to the back garden to sober up.

1215
01:19:55.945 --> 01:19:59.044
It was dark, so I couldn't see his face,

1216
01:19:59.145 --> 01:20:01.044
but the person I saw in the window...

1217
01:20:03.214 --> 01:20:05.254
was someone with glow-in-the-dark face paint on.

1218
01:20:07.725 --> 01:20:09.454
It was you, Oh Man Soo.

1219
01:20:12.594 --> 01:20:14.865
Leo, it's time. Come out.

1220
01:20:33.445 --> 01:20:35.315
What on earth did I do?

1221
01:20:35.445 --> 01:20:36.615
What should I do?

1222
01:20:36.655 --> 01:20:38.355
If I admit to my crime now...

1223
01:20:47.594 --> 01:20:50.565
All right, I just need to keep my mouth shut.

1224
01:20:50.895 --> 01:20:52.634
Leo will pretend not to know.

1225
01:20:54.204 --> 01:20:55.664
I just need to stay quiet.

1226
01:20:57.204 --> 01:20:59.004
Then it will pass over quietly.

1227
01:21:02.945 --> 01:21:04.445
It will float

1228
01:21:14.025 --> 01:21:15.055
I'm sorry,

1229
01:21:16.355 --> 01:21:17.355
Hyo Jin.

1230
01:21:17.825 --> 01:21:19.794
I'm sorry you had to...

1231
01:21:22.094 --> 01:21:23.964
get on your knees and beg...

1232
01:21:24.935 --> 01:21:26.204
because of me.

1233
01:21:31.235 --> 01:21:32.235
All right.

1234
01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:34.704
I'll do as you all wish...

1235
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:37.674
and die.

1236
01:21:40.685 --> 01:21:42.015
Where are we going?

1237
01:21:43.084 --> 01:21:44.454
To the amusement park.

1238
01:21:44.685 --> 01:21:47.384
The amusement park? But it's dark.

1239
01:21:50.954 --> 01:21:52.565
It's open at night too.

1240
01:22:16.055 --> 01:22:17.055
(Sunglasses)

1241
01:22:35.775 --> 01:22:39.004
On the pond

1242
01:22:39.244 --> 01:22:42.515
Softly, softly

1243
01:22:43.515 --> 01:22:48.145
It will float

1244
01:22:48.145 --> 01:22:51.084
On the pond

1245
01:22:51.355 --> 01:22:54.685
Softly, softly

1246
01:22:55.185 --> 01:22:59.765
- It will float - Mister, please save my mom.

1247
01:22:59.765 --> 01:23:03.664
- Go away. - Mister, please save my mom.

1248
01:23:07.034 --> 01:23:08.235
- Why are you crying? - Mommy!

1249
01:23:12.544 --> 01:23:14.105
All humans die.

1250
01:23:14.704 --> 01:23:16.174
Dying isn't a big deal.

1251
01:23:16.874 --> 01:23:19.985
I'm the Grim Reaper. I'm 444, the best there is in this business.

1252
01:23:20.645 --> 01:23:22.985
It doesn't make sense that I'm being swayed by this.

1253
01:23:25.884 --> 01:23:26.985
What is this?

1254
01:23:27.884 --> 01:23:29.924
Am I really become human?

1255
01:23:49.315 --> 01:23:50.475
Hyo Jin.

1256
01:23:54.844 --> 01:23:57.015
You said you wanted to fly, right?

1257
01:23:57.884 --> 01:23:59.155
Like a bird?

1258
01:24:03.855 --> 01:24:05.225
Let's fly magnificently...

1259
01:24:07.924 --> 01:24:09.594
here today.

1260
01:24:10.494 --> 01:24:12.164
We're going to close our eyes tightly...

1261
01:24:15.605 --> 01:24:17.075
and fly.

1262
01:24:18.775 --> 01:24:20.204
Together. You and me.

1263
01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:37.494
It's their destiny to die. It's none of my business.

1264
01:24:40.265 --> 01:24:43.334
Those punks come and go whenever they want. Where are they today?

1265
01:24:55.145 --> 01:24:57.044
It should be done by now, right?

1266
01:25:27.504 --> 01:25:29.615
(Will)

1267
01:25:33.145 --> 01:25:35.855
(911 Emergency Rescue)

1268
01:25:53.164 --> 01:25:55.164
What are you doing here?

1269
01:25:58.935 --> 01:26:01.204
Those two humans died because of you.

1270
01:26:02.775 --> 01:26:05.475
Go to the police right now, and tell them everything, you punk!

1271
01:26:08.084 --> 01:26:10.284
I need to at least free them from their injustice.

1272
01:26:18.494 --> 01:26:20.094
Who is that human?

1273
01:26:20.325 --> 01:26:21.865
He has a strong force.

1274
01:26:25.235 --> 01:26:26.365
What is this?

1275
01:26:27.134 --> 01:26:28.565
This punk dies too?

1276
01:26:50.525 --> 01:26:51.825
(Black)

1277
01:26:51.924 --> 01:26:54.794
Why do I keep making mistakes about the moment of their deaths?

1278
01:26:54.794 --> 01:26:57.395
I never trust humans.

1279
01:26:57.865 --> 01:26:59.435
Where's Woo Byung Sik?

1280
01:26:59.504 --> 01:27:03.174
I don't know who released all those photos, but I'm very grateful.

1281
01:27:03.475 --> 01:27:04.935
You shouldn't trust anyone either.

1282
01:27:04.935 --> 01:27:07.105
You should be careful of Oh Man Soo.

1283
01:27:07.105 --> 01:27:09.044
Yes. It'll be fine as long as I keep quiet.

1284
01:27:09.615 --> 01:27:12.015
I'll die as you wish.

1285
01:27:12.374 --> 01:27:13.615
You're going to die?

1286
01:27:13.685 --> 01:27:15.315
You won't have it your way.
