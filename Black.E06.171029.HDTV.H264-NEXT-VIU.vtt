1
00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.088
Say it!

2
00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:20.358
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:21.489
Tell me now.

4
00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.799
I... I don't know.

5
00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.628
You don't know? Then I shall make you remember it.

6
00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.928
Raise your head.

7
00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.198
Where is the tape?

8
00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.509
I'm asking you where it is!

9
00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.179
The tape! The tape!

10
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.478
Say it! Tell me where it is!

11
00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.359
Why do I keep dreaming as Han Moo Gang?

12
00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:00.268
Tape?

13
00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.139
Could it be that one?

14
00:01:30.928 --> 00:01:31.928
What?

15
00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.229
Who emptied out this place?

16
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.148
Catch that wench, and bring her here.

17
00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:48.809
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:07.768
I don't want to do this.

19
00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.099
Why?

20
00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:15.639
I can't do it.

21
00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:18.509
I won't do it.

22
00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:21.949
Don't you want to get into medical school?

23
00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.618
Don't you?

24
00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:29.319
I heard that your parents died without getting any treatment...

25
00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:30.759
because they had no money...

26
00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.088
when they got injured by the car accident.

27
00:02:33.558 --> 00:02:35.259
Isn't that when you made up your mind...

28
00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.159
to become a doctor?

29
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.099
Who will pay the expensive tuition fees for your medical school?

30
00:02:41.898 --> 00:02:42.938
Who?

31
00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.509
Joon's mom said she'd pay for your university education.

32
00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:52.109
But what are you going to do now?

33
00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:54.808
She's behind bars now.

34
00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:56.379
And even when she's released,

35
00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.678
there's no guarantee that she'll help you out financially.

36
00:03:00.248 --> 00:03:01.648
Forget it if you don't want to do it.

37
00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.159
Just work as a kitchen helper at bars for the rest of your life.

38
00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.458
Wait!

39
00:03:17.438 --> 00:03:18.539
I'll do it.

40
00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.368
Good.

41
00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:23.238
I'm glad to hear that.

42
00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:49.669
What happened?

43
00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.468
He tried to threaten a girl with a knife to rape her...

44
00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:52.909
but ended up getting stabbed by his own knife.

45
00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.169
Doctor!

46
00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.808
What are you doing now?

47
00:04:08.188 --> 00:04:09.789
- How did he get injured? - You don't know?

48
00:04:11.088 --> 00:04:13.688
Bring gauzes and compression bandages over here. Hurry up.

49
00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:14.958
- Hold this. - Yes, doctor.

50
00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:39.818
Moo Gang, what brings you here at this hour...

51
00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:41.789
Did... Did you get hurt or something?

52
00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:43.419
Did you take those things?

53
00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:46.328
- What things? - Everything in the basement room.

54
00:04:46.988 --> 00:04:49.089
I saw you walking out of that room a while back.

55
00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:52.058
They're gone? Everything in that room is gone?

56
00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.899
It wasn't this woman's doing.

57
00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:02.339
By any chance,

58
00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.178
is there anything you know about a tape?

59
00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:09.419
Tape... Tape? What are you talking about?

60
00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.049
I keep having dreams...

61
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:13.188
where someone keeps asking for a tape.

62
00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.519
Dreams?

63
00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:16.488
No, I don't know anything about it.

64
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:18.919
Could that mean...

65
00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.058
you're regaining your memory?

66
00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.998
Those dreams are very unpleasant.

67
00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.609
That... That jerk must've taken it.

68
00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:45.419
Who did it if it wasn't the doctor's doing?

69
00:06:05.568 --> 00:06:08.308
Did that man try to carve out Han Moo Gang's eyeballs...

70
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:12.709
to open this door?

71
00:06:18.618 --> 00:06:19.748
It must've been him.

72
00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.868
Detective, what brings you to my place at this early hour?

73
00:06:32.868 --> 00:06:34.969
This. What is this?

74
00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.368
Oh, that. It's my business card.

75
00:06:37.368 --> 00:06:40.539
My dream is to become a famous trot singer.

76
00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:42.438
My nickname is Singing Pumpkin.

77
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.979
My wife drew this herself.

78
00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.109
- This is your wife's drawing? - Yes.

79
00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:51.578
Did she come up with the idea for the drawing herself?

80
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.049
Well... She said that she got the idea from a drawing...

81
00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:55.818
on a sign of a store where she worked for when she was young.

82
00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.159
But why do you ask?

83
00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:02.229
Is Ms. Han's hometown Moojin by any chance?

84
00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:05.498
Yes, I told the detective who visited me the other day.

85
00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:08.229
He took Jin Sook's childhood photo as well...

86
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:09.599
and said it's needed for the investigation.

87
00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:11.969
You mean this photo?

88
00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:13.138
Yes.

89
00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.368
Jin Sook...

90
00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.428
Yes. I sent Han Jin Sook's call history.

91
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.378
Han Jin Sook? That's our case.

92
00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:52.748
Gosh, I'm so tired. Oh, boy.

93
00:07:57.748 --> 00:07:59.549
(Lee Min Joon, Yoon Soo Wan)

94
00:08:12.698 --> 00:08:15.599
Kim Sun Young must've been Han Moo Gang's girlfriend.

95
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:24.979
You look dashing.

96
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.049
- My goodness. - Your face

97
00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:31.779
Is filled with worries and concerns

98
00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:33.948
You can't let go of your countless regrets

99
00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:36.889
You poor Grim Reaper

100
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:39.159
About dreams that humans have...

101
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.759
Dreams? Please have mercy on us.

102
00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:41.958
I keep having those dreams.

103
00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.858
What are they about?

104
00:08:46.598 --> 00:08:49.098
They feel so real.

105
00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:51.938
I think they're about Han Moo Gang's childhood.

106
00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:56.838
They're probably just his memories left in his brain...

107
00:08:56.838 --> 00:08:59.208
being expressed through his body.

108
00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:00.948
They mean nothing more.

109
00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:02.578
Memories left in his brain?

110
00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:09.249
That's right.

111
00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:12.358
They say that the brain leaves afterimages even after humans die.

112
00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:17.098
The human brain is such a complex and fascinating thing.

113
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.098
- 007. - Yes.

114
00:09:19.098 --> 00:09:22.428
My mom told me that you're a total liar

115
00:09:22.698 --> 00:09:24.169
You rude brat.

116
00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:26.639
I'm old enough to be your ancestor. How dare you cut me off?

117
00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:30.838
Anyway, I'm worried.

118
00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:34.509
You may have side effects soon.

119
00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:38.818
Please have mercy on us. All is vanity.

120
00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:40.519
- Side effects? - That's right.

121
00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:43.858
You might not be able to teleport as you please.

122
00:09:43.858 --> 00:09:45.419
I can't teleport? Why not?

123
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.889
You have dreams now.

124
00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:49.558
That means you're becoming more and more human.

125
00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:52.428
Humans cannot teleport, can they?

126
00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:54.529
- So you may also... - Becoming a human?

127
00:09:55.098 --> 00:09:57.399
I'm becoming like those uncivilized humans?

128
00:09:57.968 --> 00:10:00.739
My gosh. This is so humiliating and unpleasant.

129
00:10:02.808 --> 00:10:03.978
I can't stand this anymore.

130
00:10:04.678 --> 00:10:07.578
I should find that loser today and get out of this body.

131
00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:16.119
Ha Ram. Where are you now?

132
00:10:16.789 --> 00:10:17.818
Yes.

133
00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:20.828
Joon!

134
00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:26.669
She has to help me so I can get this done quickly.

135
00:10:26.968 --> 00:10:29.869
Becoming a human? That's nonsense.

136
00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:35.808
Let's go.

137
00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:43.379
How clumsy you are.

138
00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:45.678
Gosh, it hurts. It really hurts.

139
00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.218
It won't kill you. Come with me.

140
00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:52.519
You should've caught me. He wasn't like that before.

141
00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:55.029
I know he lost his memories, but how could he change so much?

142
00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:57.598
- It hurts. - What are you doing?

143
00:10:59.369 --> 00:11:01.669
Here. Grab me.

144
00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:07.208
Not my hand.

145
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:09.938
Here. Grab the end of my sleeve.

146
00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:13.808
You let some woman touch your chest.

147
00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:16.119
- You don't want to? - No, wait. Gosh.

148
00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:18.318
Okay.

149
00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:23.519
Goodness.

150
00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:35.299
But why do I have to find shadows inside of people who approach her?

151
00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:39.708
Well, she's a suspect of a serial murder case.

152
00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:42.708
A suspect of a serial murder case?

153
00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:44.208
Yes.

154
00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.948
But she looks like a person who couldn't even hurt a fly.

155
00:11:47.978 --> 00:11:49.049
Right?

156
00:11:50.478 --> 00:11:51.718
However,

157
00:11:51.718 --> 00:11:53.318
the more brutal the murderer is,

158
00:11:53.318 --> 00:11:56.058
they usually have a face of an ordinary person, okay?

159
00:11:56.289 --> 00:11:59.489
So stay sharp, and watch people carefully.

160
00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:06.869
Not me but over there. Watch people over there.

161
00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:13.838
That person. Look at that person.

162
00:12:13.838 --> 00:12:15.838
- Look inside of his body. - Okay.

163
00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:19.578
Do you see anything?

164
00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:22.108
No, he doesn't have a shadow around him.

165
00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:24.218
Not around him. Look inside of his body. Inside.

166
00:12:24.218 --> 00:12:26.789
I can't really see it because he's facing the other way.

167
00:12:27.318 --> 00:12:29.188
Go check then. Hurry.

168
00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:31.289
Be more enthusiastic. Come on.

169
00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:35.688
It's already tiring to help him, and now he wants me to be enthusiastic.

170
00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:37.759
That hurts.

171
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:52.338
Excuse me! Excuse me.

172
00:12:53.178 --> 00:12:54.249
Wait!

173
00:12:54.478 --> 00:12:55.649
What is it? Does he have it?

174
00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:56.718
He does.

175
00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:58.279
- He does? - He does.

176
00:13:01.718 --> 00:13:03.789
- Gosh, how much is this? - It's not much.

177
00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:06.129
Stop! Stop!

178
00:13:08.428 --> 00:13:10.399
- Loser! - Joon!

179
00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.399
Darn it. Hey!

180
00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:12.428
- Hey, you! - Get off me.

181
00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:14.068
Let go of me!

182
00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.799
Come on. You can't just get away like that.

183
00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:19.169
Hey, you should pay for my boys' injuries.

184
00:13:19.338 --> 00:13:20.409
What?

185
00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:22.938
You're that crazy jerk from before.

186
00:13:22.938 --> 00:13:24.338
He... He's a detective.

187
00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:26.249
Yes, he's that crazy detective.

188
00:13:26.249 --> 00:13:30.019
- Yes. - You've become quite stylish.

189
00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:31.348
Move, Baldy.

190
00:13:31.348 --> 00:13:33.019
No, I won't.

191
00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:35.588
You little...

192
00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:40.688
Hey!

193
00:13:44.328 --> 00:13:45.328
Stop him!

194
00:13:55.239 --> 00:13:56.379
I almost caught him!

195
00:13:58.608 --> 00:14:01.978
Joon, are you okay? Are... Are you hurt?

196
00:14:01.978 --> 00:14:03.678
Are you sure he had a shadow inside him?

197
00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:05.119
Yes, I saw it.

198
00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:08.948
- Do you remember his face? - No. He was wearing a big helmet.

199
00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:10.989
I told you to be more enthusiastic!

200
00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:12.858
Darn it!

201
00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:23.838
That customer is my late son's friend.

202
00:14:23.838 --> 00:14:26.869
He comes and buys a lot of my carp bread from time to time.

203
00:14:27.068 --> 00:14:28.739
What's his name? What does he do?

204
00:14:29.409 --> 00:14:30.539
I don't know.

205
00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:31.608
How old is he?

206
00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:34.409
He's in his mid 40s.

207
00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:37.318
Anyway, he's a swindler.

208
00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:40.289
- If he comes again, call me. - A swindler?

209
00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:43.318
He wouldn't be able to get anything from me.

210
00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:47.659
By the way, you look very familiar.

211
00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:50.159
Oh, it's you, right?

212
00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:54.068
You're the one who wandered around in a hospital gown, right?

213
00:14:54.968 --> 00:14:56.399
What are you talking about?

214
00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:58.769
You must have terrible eyesight, don't you?

215
00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:00.169
Call me.

216
00:15:03.478 --> 00:15:05.379
Joon. Joon!

217
00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:07.078
Darn it. I almost had him.

218
00:15:07.578 --> 00:15:10.249
Why did that fool have to tumble there and ruin everything?

219
00:15:12.688 --> 00:15:15.149
You said she was a suspect of a serial murder case.

220
00:15:15.188 --> 00:15:17.119
Why is she involved with a swindler?

221
00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:19.958
No detective tells someone confidential information.

222
00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:22.458
This is top secret. Top secret.

223
00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:26.598
Top secret? What are you talking about?

224
00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:28.468
It's literally top secret!

225
00:15:29.068 --> 00:15:31.499
Stop asking questions. Just stay by my side,

226
00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:33.509
and do a proper job as my eyes...

227
00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.369
if you want to save people's lives.

228
00:15:37.409 --> 00:15:38.409
Goodness.

229
00:15:40.848 --> 00:15:41.978
What was all that about?

230
00:15:43.448 --> 00:15:46.119
Those are all side effects of his head injury, right?

231
00:15:49.789 --> 00:15:51.519
Joon, wait for me.

232
00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:53.458
What should we do after this?

233
00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:54.789
Let's put this in too.

234
00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:56.858
Welcome.

235
00:15:58.728 --> 00:15:59.799
It's so good.

236
00:16:12.478 --> 00:16:13.608
That's right.

237
00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:16.619
I knew you'd come here, Loser.

238
00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:19.948
How dare you put me into trouble?

239
00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:21.289
What? Who are you?

240
00:16:21.289 --> 00:16:23.458
Come here. Move it!

241
00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:25.718
You can't just leave me behind. You walk so fast.

242
00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.389
- Seriously. - I got him. He has it, right?

243
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:28.928
Has what?

244
00:16:28.928 --> 00:16:30.698
You know. A shadow.

245
00:16:30.828 --> 00:16:32.129
No, he doesn't.

246
00:16:32.129 --> 00:16:34.598
Are you okay? Let him go. What's going on here?

247
00:16:34.598 --> 00:16:35.669
He doesn't have it?

248
00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.838
Look closely. He must have it inside his body.

249
00:16:37.838 --> 00:16:39.269
I said he doesn't.

250
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:41.269
Let him go already.

251
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:42.468
You said he had it earlier.

252
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:45.539
At the market? That guy had it.

253
00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:49.619
By any chance, did you think this man was him?

254
00:16:54.218 --> 00:16:57.858
His helmet looks totally different from the one that guy was wearing.

255
00:16:57.858 --> 00:17:00.289
Let him go. Let go of him first.

256
00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:03.358
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.759
- I'm sorry. - What's your problem, you jerk?

258
00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:07.398
You all saw it, right?

259
00:17:07.398 --> 00:17:08.969
The police... Call the police!

260
00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:10.969
- What did he do that for? - I'm so sorry.

261
00:17:11.068 --> 00:17:12.338
- Darn it. - Oh, dear.

262
00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:14.608
- I can't open my eyes. - I'm sorry.

263
00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:15.668
My eyes.

264
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:23.519
I'm starving.

265
00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.418
Take a look around,

266
00:17:27.388 --> 00:17:29.049
and see if anyone has a shadow inside.

267
00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.318
Gosh, that's enough.

268
00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:35.628
I'm thankful that you're helping me save people's lives,

269
00:17:36.128 --> 00:17:38.429
but you seem to be obsessed with it.

270
00:17:38.429 --> 00:17:40.128
Take a closer look, okay?

271
00:17:40.699 --> 00:17:42.429
We don't have time to eat this. Don't you understand?

272
00:17:43.469 --> 00:17:44.999
Look, they're leaving.

273
00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:46.068
Everyone is leaving.

274
00:17:46.068 --> 00:17:48.108
- They have all left! - They don't have it!

275
00:17:49.308 --> 00:17:50.578
I've looked at them all.

276
00:17:50.838 --> 00:17:52.039
Are you sure?

277
00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:54.148
That's strange.

278
00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:57.279
Why wouldn't he show up around his sister either?

279
00:18:01.848 --> 00:18:04.618
Why do humans like this red thing that much?

280
00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:06.828
It doesn't look good at all.

281
00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.358
It's really delicious. Do you want to try it?

282
00:18:14.769 --> 00:18:16.699
- Try just one bite. - No.

283
00:18:17.338 --> 00:18:19.668
- It's good. Just try... - No.

284
00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:22.838
Forget it then.

285
00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:02.578
What's wrong with this food?

286
00:19:03.719 --> 00:19:04.918
It's a bit spicy, right?

287
00:19:05.418 --> 00:19:06.989
They make it quite spicy here.

288
00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:09.459
But it's still tasty and addictive.

289
00:19:29.578 --> 00:19:30.808
It tastes peculiar.

290
00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:32.239
Don't you think?

291
00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:36.078
Are they shooting a romance film or what?

292
00:19:36.648 --> 00:19:38.878
Do they think they're Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won?

293
00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:40.848
Even Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won...

294
00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:43.219
can't make the soup in tteokbokki look romantic.

295
00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:44.388
That's true.

296
00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:46.558
Thanks for the food, Soo Young.

297
00:19:47.058 --> 00:19:50.098
Did the man riding the scooter give you pocket money again?

298
00:19:50.598 --> 00:19:52.199
Who is he anyway?

299
00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:53.729
He said he's my brother's friend.

300
00:19:53.898 --> 00:19:56.568
I'll go to the bathroom for a moment, Joon.

301
00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:09.078
Gosh, that made me lose my appetite.

302
00:20:09.618 --> 00:20:11.449
That obnoxious jerk.

303
00:20:11.648 --> 00:20:13.189
Are the rumors true?

304
00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:16.088
I heard your brother took his own life because Leo bullied him.

305
00:20:16.088 --> 00:20:17.519
He didn't just bully him.

306
00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.459
That jerk practically killed my brother.

307
00:20:20.459 --> 00:20:23.729
He probably can't even rest in peace because it's so unfair.

308
00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:27.598
I bet he became a ghost and latched onto him.

309
00:20:27.729 --> 00:20:28.898
What a jerk.

310
00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:39.679
Hey, Leo! If you have any decency,

311
00:20:39.949 --> 00:20:42.249
you can't steal my girlfriend like that!

312
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:46.418
Did I look like a total idiot and pushover to you?

313
00:20:48.689 --> 00:20:51.489
Gosh, that punk. Why does he have to talk so much?

314
00:20:51.618 --> 00:20:53.189
Just jump already, will you?

315
00:20:53.828 --> 00:20:56.058
I'll become a ghost...

316
00:20:56.229 --> 00:20:59.259
and latch onto you to take my revenge!

317
00:21:06.338 --> 00:21:08.068
Why did I remember it just now?

318
00:21:08.239 --> 00:21:11.939
Yes, he must've gone into a human body to get back at that jerk.

319
00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:14.199
- Leo! - Leo!

320
00:21:14.199 --> 00:21:16.098
- Leo! - Leo, I love you!

321
00:21:16.098 --> 00:21:18.608
- Leo! - Leo, please look at me!

322
00:21:20.608 --> 00:21:22.709
- Leo! - Leo!

323
00:21:25.348 --> 00:21:27.679
- Look at me, Leo! - I love you, Leo!

324
00:21:38.937 --> 00:21:39.947
You're back.

325
00:21:39.947 --> 00:21:41.447
Oh, hey. Do you want some?

326
00:21:41.447 --> 00:21:42.848
Your fan must've left this here for you.

327
00:21:42.878 --> 00:21:44.147
No, I hate things like that.

328
00:21:45.977 --> 00:21:46.987
What are these?

329
00:21:53.258 --> 00:21:54.487
Isn't this blood?

330
00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:57.358
Blood?

331
00:21:58.058 --> 00:21:59.397
There's no post stamp either.

332
00:21:59.397 --> 00:22:01.897
Gosh, you're giving me the creeps. Hey, don't open it.

333
00:22:06.808 --> 00:22:09.368
(You'll end up regretting your past deeds to the bone.)

334
00:22:09.368 --> 00:22:11.737
(I'll make you fall into the fiery pit, so brace yourself.)

335
00:22:14.707 --> 00:22:16.917
What's wrong? What does it say?

336
00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:27.128
What brings a detective to my place?

337
00:22:29.697 --> 00:22:31.697
Have you seen any suspicious people around?

338
00:22:31.697 --> 00:22:33.697
- Oh, actually... - No.

339
00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:38.598
You haven't?

340
00:22:39.768 --> 00:22:41.008
I'm sure you have.

341
00:22:41.608 --> 00:22:44.137
Try to remember. I'm sure...

342
00:22:44.137 --> 00:22:46.147
I told you not to let riffraff into my house.

343
00:22:48.407 --> 00:22:51.578
- Me? Are you talking about... - What time is the live show today?

344
00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:53.247
Oh, it starts at 8pm.

345
00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:55.217
But you must participate in the rehearsal,

346
00:22:55.217 --> 00:22:57.318
so we should get there by around 3pm.

347
00:22:57.318 --> 00:22:59.157
Since when did I participate in rehearsals?

348
00:22:59.657 --> 00:23:00.828
Wake me up at 6pm.

349
00:23:05.558 --> 00:23:06.697
That rude punk.

350
00:23:07.727 --> 00:23:08.868
How obnoxious.

351
00:23:18.338 --> 00:23:19.447
Wait, sir.

352
00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:23.177
- What is it? - Actually, there's...

353
00:23:24.878 --> 00:23:25.878
Here.

354
00:23:26.647 --> 00:23:27.647
What is that?

355
00:23:35.927 --> 00:23:37.197
Who sent this?

356
00:23:37.628 --> 00:23:38.897
I have no idea either.

357
00:23:39.628 --> 00:23:43.167
Leo doesn't think it's a big deal. He told me not to tell anyone.

358
00:23:43.197 --> 00:23:44.397
But I'm worried.

359
00:23:45.598 --> 00:23:46.907
It's blood, isn't it?

360
00:23:53.147 --> 00:23:54.747
As you know, Leo is a top star.

361
00:23:54.747 --> 00:23:56.947
He's always had all sorts of crazy, obsessive fans,

362
00:23:56.947 --> 00:23:59.078
but I personally think that's out of line.

363
00:24:00.088 --> 00:24:03.258
Please catch whoever did this, but don't disclose it to the media.

364
00:24:09.758 --> 00:24:11.927
Help... Help me.

365
00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:22.207
Ambulance... Please call an ambulance for me.

366
00:24:34.947 --> 00:24:38.417
He took off like that. How can he pretend not to know me?

367
00:24:39.657 --> 00:24:42.088
Gosh, why did he bring me here?

368
00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:45.628
He should've let me come with him. How could he go in alone?

369
00:24:52.068 --> 00:24:53.538
Why on earth are we here?

370
00:24:53.538 --> 00:24:54.737
I received a report.

371
00:24:56.177 --> 00:24:57.737
Someone is after Leo.

372
00:25:00.078 --> 00:25:01.808
Who'd dare do this to our dear Leo?

373
00:25:02.177 --> 00:25:03.778
This person should just die alone.

374
00:25:03.848 --> 00:25:06.147
What? "You and your most precious treasures..."

375
00:25:06.947 --> 00:25:09.887
All right. Leo is in danger now,

376
00:25:10.358 --> 00:25:13.088
so you must keep a watchful eye on everyone around him.

377
00:25:13.528 --> 00:25:14.528
Got it?

378
00:25:26.538 --> 00:25:28.167
Did you take those things?

379
00:25:28.707 --> 00:25:30.737
- What things? - Everything in the basement room.

380
00:25:31.078 --> 00:25:34.008
If he took all the documents from Moo Gang' investigation,

381
00:25:34.008 --> 00:25:35.947
it means he got his hands on that tape too.

382
00:25:36.477 --> 00:25:38.578
He must've seen my face in it as well.

383
00:25:39.348 --> 00:25:41.687
Then it's only a matter of time before he finds out who I really am.

384
00:25:45.917 --> 00:25:47.727
He'll kill me like that too.

385
00:25:53.828 --> 00:25:55.467
(Letter of Resignation)

386
00:26:23.828 --> 00:26:25.897
Is there a person named Yoon Soo Wan here?

387
00:26:26.997 --> 00:26:28.628
Doctor Yoon, are you leaving for the day?

388
00:26:37.177 --> 00:26:39.008
- What should we do? - Excuse me. Doctor!

389
00:26:39.008 --> 00:26:40.747
- Call a doctor for this patient. - Gosh!

390
00:26:42.548 --> 00:26:43.618
Are you all right?

391
00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:09.308
Move out of the way! This patient needs urgent treatment.

392
00:27:10.237 --> 00:27:12.338
Please be careful. Doctor.

393
00:27:14.048 --> 00:27:15.348
What happened to him?

394
00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:16.747
He got injured in a traffic accident.

395
00:27:32.558 --> 00:27:35.727
Santorini... Singing Pumpkin.

396
00:27:37.997 --> 00:27:39.437
I can't figure this out.

397
00:27:40.308 --> 00:27:44.538
If Han Jin Sook worked at Pumpkin Singer 20 years ago...

398
00:27:45.237 --> 00:27:48.707
She's 34 years old now, so back then,

399
00:27:48.977 --> 00:27:50.917
she must've been 13 years old.

400
00:27:52.788 --> 00:27:54.818
Can she have been involved in prostitution?

401
00:27:57.288 --> 00:28:00.588
I see. This jerk must have bought sexual services from her.

402
00:28:02.427 --> 00:28:06.497
And she used that fact to threaten him.

403
00:28:09.838 --> 00:28:12.197
Is the victim's name Han Jin Sook?

404
00:28:13.167 --> 00:28:16.137
Darn it. The resolution is too low.

405
00:28:20.907 --> 00:28:23.717
Jae Geun must've recognized her when he saw that.

406
00:28:24.318 --> 00:28:26.447
That must've been why he went to her place...

407
00:28:28.288 --> 00:28:31.358
and checked her childhood photo.

408
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:35.457
Jae Geun said he had something to tell me.

409
00:28:37.897 --> 00:28:41.697
He must've wanted to tell me who this man is, right?

410
00:28:43.768 --> 00:28:44.838
Gwang Gyun.

411
00:28:46.237 --> 00:28:48.437
They've restored the security camera footage of Han Jin Sook's case.

412
00:28:48.437 --> 00:28:50.308
- What? - It's unbelievable.

413
00:28:51.278 --> 00:28:52.578
Like I said,

414
00:28:53.008 --> 00:28:54.647
the man wearing a watch here...

415
00:28:55.308 --> 00:28:57.278
ordered this man with a missing finger...

416
00:28:57.278 --> 00:28:59.548
to kill Han Jin Sook.

417
00:28:59.747 --> 00:29:01.548
A million dollars is a big amount indeed.

418
00:29:01.618 --> 00:29:03.717
No, I don't think it was about money.

419
00:29:03.717 --> 00:29:06.427
They tortured her, killed her, and just left the body as it is.

420
00:29:06.427 --> 00:29:08.088
There must be some other reason.

421
00:29:08.088 --> 00:29:10.028
If the teenage prostitution occurred...

422
00:29:10.028 --> 00:29:12.227
in that bar named Pumpkin Singer or something,

423
00:29:12.227 --> 00:29:14.897
its owner must have been involved in it, right?

424
00:29:14.897 --> 00:29:16.868
What kind of a scum would do that?

425
00:29:16.868 --> 00:29:18.937
It was a 13-year-old girl.

426
00:29:18.937 --> 00:29:22.467
That woman who owned that place is just as bad.

427
00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:23.608
Tell me about it.

428
00:29:23.778 --> 00:29:26.038
Let's find that bar owner first.

429
00:29:26.038 --> 00:29:27.907
Okay. I asked Moojin Regional Police Agency...

430
00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:30.717
for data on the arrested hostesses...

431
00:29:30.717 --> 00:29:33.417
when they cracked down on those hostess bars.

432
00:29:33.447 --> 00:29:35.818
If we ask around them,

433
00:29:35.818 --> 00:29:38.358
we'll be able to find the owner of Pumpkin Singer.

434
00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:39.788
Let's be careful.

435
00:29:39.788 --> 00:29:42.628
He killed someone to cover up the fact that he was involved in...

436
00:29:42.628 --> 00:29:44.058
teenage prostitution 20 years ago.

437
00:29:44.058 --> 00:29:46.598
It doesn't look like he's an ordinary man.

438
00:29:48.197 --> 00:29:49.227
Darn it.

439
00:30:00.778 --> 00:30:02.078
Detective Na Gwang Gyun?

440
00:30:02.947 --> 00:30:03.977
Yes?

441
00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:07.917
It's an express delivery from Moojin Regional Police Agency.

442
00:30:13.887 --> 00:30:15.028
Dad.

443
00:30:16.098 --> 00:30:17.697
When did you get so old?

444
00:30:25.737 --> 00:30:26.808
Hi, Mr. Hwang.

445
00:30:27.368 --> 00:30:28.637
I'm visiting my dad.

446
00:30:30.508 --> 00:30:31.508
What?

447
00:30:32.878 --> 00:30:36.177
Is... Is that true?

448
00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:42.018
Okay.

449
00:30:44.858 --> 00:30:46.058
What's going on?

450
00:30:47.227 --> 00:30:49.128
She said Mr. Song wasn't going to die.

451
00:30:59.197 --> 00:31:00.308
Man Ho will be here soon.

452
00:31:01.008 --> 00:31:02.108
Dad, I'll come back later.

453
00:31:22.457 --> 00:31:23.798
Did you hear?

454
00:31:24.157 --> 00:31:28.298
Mr. Song Jae Geun, the commissioner general and your close friend.

455
00:31:28.467 --> 00:31:29.598
You know him well, right?

456
00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:32.838
He died in a sudden car accident last night.

457
00:31:40.508 --> 00:31:41.747
(I love you, Leo)

458
00:31:41.747 --> 00:31:44.078
- Leo! - Here, Leo!

459
00:31:44.078 --> 00:31:45.947
- Leo! - I love you!

460
00:31:46.788 --> 00:31:48.187
Take a close look.

461
00:31:49.118 --> 00:31:51.387
Someone around Leo must have...

462
00:31:54.088 --> 00:31:55.088
Hey.

463
00:31:55.987 --> 00:31:57.758
Hey, Ha Ram. Look.

464
00:31:57.758 --> 00:32:00.497
Don't touch me. You're distracting me.

465
00:32:02.598 --> 00:32:04.538
What do you like about that rude brat?

466
00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:10.038
- Leo! - Leo!

467
00:32:30.798 --> 00:32:31.997
Are you in a bad mood?

468
00:32:37.197 --> 00:32:38.397
Meet me here after work.

469
00:32:39.338 --> 00:32:40.937
I will make you feel better.

470
00:32:46.808 --> 00:32:47.907
- Hello. - Hello.

471
00:32:47.907 --> 00:32:49.447
- Hello. - Hello.

472
00:32:52.647 --> 00:32:53.788
You're new.

473
00:32:55.247 --> 00:32:57.917
I'm the new member. It's a pleasure to work with you.

474
00:32:57.917 --> 00:32:58.957
You're cute.

475
00:33:01.758 --> 00:33:03.258
Wait for me there after this.

476
00:33:04.397 --> 00:33:05.427
I'm sorry?

477
00:33:08.227 --> 00:33:10.838
What are you doing? Wait outside if you're done.

478
00:33:22.977 --> 00:33:24.077
What is it?

479
00:33:24.178 --> 00:33:26.347
It's about the threatening letter.

480
00:33:26.347 --> 00:33:28.888
I just couldn't get it off my mind...

481
00:33:34.128 --> 00:33:35.158
What do you think?

482
00:33:35.758 --> 00:33:38.057
He has an overwhelming aura in person.

483
00:33:38.758 --> 00:33:41.528
This is the first time I saw him in person.

484
00:33:42.327 --> 00:33:44.568
Do you think I asked you how he looked in person?

485
00:33:44.997 --> 00:33:46.867
Why are you yelling all of a sudden?

486
00:33:48.608 --> 00:33:51.178
No one here has a shadow.

487
00:33:53.108 --> 00:33:54.108
Come here.

488
00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.917
(Dressing Room)

489
00:34:06.057 --> 00:34:07.227
That witch.

490
00:34:07.557 --> 00:34:09.397
She always comes on to Leo.

491
00:34:09.397 --> 00:34:11.658
She tries so hard to be seen in public with Leo.

492
00:34:13.698 --> 00:34:14.798
Who's Mi Soon?

493
00:34:15.997 --> 00:34:17.037
She's over there.

494
00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:22.167
What do you think? Take a look.

495
00:34:23.207 --> 00:34:24.378
She doesn't have it.

496
00:34:26.647 --> 00:34:28.747
- She doesn't? - No.

497
00:34:32.378 --> 00:34:34.187
It's 10 minutes before the live broadcast!

498
00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:36.517
Please do the final check!

499
00:34:46.628 --> 00:34:48.667
I didn't wait three hours for this.

500
00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:49.798
Are you looking at them closely?

501
00:34:51.267 --> 00:34:53.138
Don't miss a single person. Check all of them.

502
00:34:53.738 --> 00:34:57.077
Here. Drink this, and be more enthusiastic.

503
00:34:57.077 --> 00:34:59.207
Keep your eyes wide open, okay?

504
00:35:04.278 --> 00:35:06.117
You punk. Are you kidding me?

505
00:35:06.318 --> 00:35:08.287
This is a serious problem!

506
00:35:08.718 --> 00:35:10.158
You're on drugs, aren't you?

507
00:35:10.158 --> 00:35:12.258
What did you just say? Drugs?

508
00:35:12.258 --> 00:35:14.988
You're the one who begged us to have him here.

509
00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:16.827
How dare you. You think you're a big man now.

510
00:35:16.928 --> 00:35:20.097
You used to give out bread to the staff every morning!

511
00:35:20.097 --> 00:35:21.468
Where do you think you're going?

512
00:35:21.468 --> 00:35:23.568
- Hey! Stop right there! - Please stop.

513
00:35:23.568 --> 00:35:25.238
Where do you think you're going?

514
00:35:31.307 --> 00:35:32.338
(Leo from the Star)

515
00:35:37.347 --> 00:35:39.517
I feel like my eyes will fall out soon. No one has it.

516
00:35:40.548 --> 00:35:42.347
They're okay. They haven't fallen out yet.

517
00:35:43.187 --> 00:35:45.617
Take a good look even inside of their bodies.

518
00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:51.227
I've looked at all of them. Maybe...

519
00:35:52.028 --> 00:35:53.767
the letter was just a prank.

520
00:35:55.568 --> 00:35:56.638
Detective!

521
00:35:57.138 --> 00:35:59.298
We have a problem. Leo disappeared.

522
00:35:59.707 --> 00:36:02.037
He disappeared while I was arguing with the director.

523
00:36:02.037 --> 00:36:04.307
He wasn't in the dressing room or the restroom either.

524
00:36:05.378 --> 00:36:06.778
That letter...

525
00:36:09.108 --> 00:36:11.017
That crazy jerk.

526
00:36:11.247 --> 00:36:12.718
How dare he tries to hurt my dear Leo?

527
00:36:13.517 --> 00:36:16.117
Joon, check that side. I'll check this side.

528
00:36:16.117 --> 00:36:18.588
If you find him, call me right away.

529
00:36:18.588 --> 00:36:20.888
Backup. Call for backup right away.

530
00:36:20.888 --> 00:36:23.327
Do it right now. Do you understand?

531
00:36:24.628 --> 00:36:26.068
Leo...

532
00:36:26.798 --> 00:36:30.097
How dare she order me around?

533
00:36:31.338 --> 00:36:32.437
My gosh.

534
00:36:33.037 --> 00:36:34.238
Goodness.

535
00:36:42.678 --> 00:36:44.847
Sir. Excuse me.

536
00:36:44.847 --> 00:36:46.948
Have you seen Leo...

537
00:36:55.488 --> 00:36:57.428
You can't be here. You'll die if you stay here.

538
00:36:57.428 --> 00:36:58.897
Move over there now.

539
00:37:08.838 --> 00:37:10.338
It'll be too late at this rate.

540
00:37:40.362 --> 00:37:43.594
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E06 Black "Side Effects"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

541
00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:11.338
No!

542
00:38:18.508 --> 00:38:19.948
No...

543
00:38:20.147 --> 00:38:22.818
No. No!

544
00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:31.488
Come here, and hold her hand!

545
00:38:45.097 --> 00:38:47.468
Give me your hand. Give it to me.

546
00:38:47.638 --> 00:38:50.638
Hurry up. Come on! Give me your hand.

547
00:38:50.738 --> 00:38:53.077
Hurry up. Hurry.

548
00:38:53.077 --> 00:38:55.778
Hold my hand. Come on. Hurry up.

549
00:38:56.178 --> 00:38:57.218
Hurry up.

550
00:38:58.417 --> 00:38:59.488
Give me your hand.

551
00:39:01.417 --> 00:39:02.588
I got you.

552
00:39:03.088 --> 00:39:05.888
Hold on tight. Don't let go.

553
00:39:05.888 --> 00:39:07.858
Hold onto my hand.

554
00:39:11.597 --> 00:39:12.997
She's coming up.

555
00:39:13.528 --> 00:39:14.568
No.

556
00:39:19.097 --> 00:39:21.338
My gosh. My goodness.

557
00:39:24.378 --> 00:39:25.508
Are you okay?

558
00:39:34.117 --> 00:39:35.117
My gosh.

559
00:39:39.687 --> 00:39:41.057
I can't believe you did that.

560
00:39:41.687 --> 00:39:43.298
Why would you try to kill yourself?

561
00:39:43.858 --> 00:39:46.497
I don't know what you're going through.

562
00:39:46.767 --> 00:39:49.698
But how do you think your family would feel after you die?

563
00:39:50.238 --> 00:39:52.298
You should think about your mom and dad.

564
00:39:53.238 --> 00:39:54.437
Mom.

565
00:39:56.307 --> 00:39:57.378
Dad.

566
00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:01.147
Mom.

567
00:40:01.608 --> 00:40:05.077
Mom.

568
00:40:06.787 --> 00:40:10.117
Mom.

569
00:40:11.187 --> 00:40:12.888
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:15.488 --> 00:40:18.128
I'm sorry.

571
00:40:19.128 --> 00:40:22.597
Mom.

572
00:40:23.568 --> 00:40:25.767
What a bunch of worthless people...

573
00:40:25.767 --> 00:40:28.508
who deserve to have their heads stuck in the toilet.

574
00:40:29.437 --> 00:40:31.838
Are you saying that the writer and the director...

575
00:40:31.838 --> 00:40:34.908
stole the script that you worked on for years?

576
00:40:37.117 --> 00:40:38.147
Yes.

577
00:40:39.718 --> 00:40:41.417
And you just let them get away with that?

578
00:40:42.287 --> 00:40:45.057
You should've dragged them to the broadcasting station...

579
00:40:45.057 --> 00:40:46.888
and revealed everything to the staff.

580
00:40:47.128 --> 00:40:50.557
The broadcasting station's on their side anyway.

581
00:40:51.397 --> 00:40:54.128
That drama's already been scheduled to air on TV.

582
00:40:54.128 --> 00:40:56.968
So they're scared that I might ruin their drama's reputation.

583
00:40:57.397 --> 00:40:59.298
Because of that, they won't even meet me.

584
00:41:00.008 --> 00:41:02.908
On top of that, they even released an article saying that...

585
00:41:02.908 --> 00:41:04.508
I'm purposely trying to ruin the drama.

586
00:41:05.178 --> 00:41:08.678
They said a rookie writer's trying to get her share by acting up.

587
00:41:10.017 --> 00:41:12.787
And they told me that ruining a nameless writer's career...

588
00:41:12.787 --> 00:41:14.147
is going to be a piece of cake.

589
00:41:14.687 --> 00:41:17.687
In the end, I'll be the only one who's gone crazy.

590
00:41:18.388 --> 00:41:20.787
And things just ended like that.

591
00:41:25.198 --> 00:41:27.298
Still, you shouldn't have tried to kill yourself.

592
00:41:27.928 --> 00:41:29.167
What would you get out of that?

593
00:41:31.568 --> 00:41:33.167
You should fight until the end.

594
00:41:33.608 --> 00:41:34.968
I'm exhausted.

595
00:41:35.738 --> 00:41:37.178
I'm so exhausted.

596
00:41:38.278 --> 00:41:40.108
I don't have the strength to fight anymore.

597
00:41:43.647 --> 00:41:45.747
Then you should sue them.

598
00:41:49.988 --> 00:41:51.718
Where am I going to get the money to pay for a lawsuit?

599
00:41:53.388 --> 00:41:56.997
I can barely earn enough money to pay for this month's food and rent.

600
00:42:02.568 --> 00:42:05.698
But you shouldn't have tried to commit suicide.

601
00:42:05.698 --> 00:42:08.108
I thought they'd at least feel guilty for what they did...

602
00:42:08.937 --> 00:42:12.678
if I fell and died from the rooftop of this broadcasting station.

603
00:42:13.707 --> 00:42:14.878
I thought maybe...

604
00:42:15.548 --> 00:42:18.218
someone might acknowledge how upset I must've felt.

605
00:42:18.218 --> 00:42:19.378
How naive of you.

606
00:42:20.147 --> 00:42:23.888
If they were going to care about you just because you died,

607
00:42:24.088 --> 00:42:25.517
no one would've stolen your drama,

608
00:42:25.517 --> 00:42:27.388
and no one would've taken their sides in the first place.

609
00:42:27.388 --> 00:42:28.388
He's right.

610
00:42:28.787 --> 00:42:30.957
Yes, Leo's right.

611
00:42:31.227 --> 00:42:33.798
If you die like this, you'll end up having died for nothing.

612
00:42:50.878 --> 00:42:52.647
- Hello? - Where are you?

613
00:42:53.588 --> 00:42:54.888
I found Leo.

614
00:42:54.888 --> 00:42:56.658
Okay, I'll be right down.

615
00:42:58.617 --> 00:43:02.758
My gosh, I got worried thinking that you got attacked by the terrorist.

616
00:43:03.897 --> 00:43:05.158
Thank you.

617
00:43:06.727 --> 00:43:07.997
- Let's go. - This way.

618
00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:11.338
Thank you.

619
00:43:16.238 --> 00:43:18.178
Try to hang in there.

620
00:43:18.707 --> 00:43:20.448
You may be lonely and exhausted right now.

621
00:43:20.448 --> 00:43:23.178
But I'm sure someone will be there to take your side one day.

622
00:43:23.378 --> 00:43:25.678
I'm on your side too.

623
00:43:27.548 --> 00:43:28.818
Thank you.

624
00:43:35.287 --> 00:43:36.397
What does that mean?

625
00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:39.327
By any chance, did you...

626
00:43:39.468 --> 00:43:42.167
Yes. She had a shadow.

627
00:43:44.138 --> 00:43:45.597
Did you save her?

628
00:43:45.597 --> 00:43:46.667
No.

629
00:43:47.267 --> 00:43:48.738
I was one step too late.

630
00:43:48.867 --> 00:43:50.477
Leo saved her.

631
00:43:51.577 --> 00:43:53.577
- Leo saved her? - I told you, didn't I?

632
00:43:54.508 --> 00:43:56.378
I told you that he must be a good guy.

633
00:43:58.448 --> 00:44:00.488
I'm glad you weren't the one who saved her.

634
00:44:01.988 --> 00:44:03.057
What?

635
00:44:04.258 --> 00:44:05.258
Whatever.

636
00:44:10.457 --> 00:44:12.628
My gosh, you surprised me. What are you doing here?

637
00:44:15.068 --> 00:44:17.437
I was waiting for you, but then I got hungry.

638
00:44:17.437 --> 00:44:18.738
So I was going to eat only a little bit.

639
00:44:18.738 --> 00:44:20.108
Don't act like I'm your sister.

640
00:44:20.108 --> 00:44:21.608
You and I aren't even related by blood.

641
00:44:23.508 --> 00:44:24.608
What are you doing here?

642
00:44:26.037 --> 00:44:27.678
Mom told me to give you this.

643
00:44:30.577 --> 00:44:31.718
What's this?

644
00:44:34.787 --> 00:44:36.818
What? Why did she give me money?

645
00:44:36.818 --> 00:44:38.488
I told Mom...

646
00:44:38.488 --> 00:44:40.128
that Dad stole money from you.

647
00:44:40.128 --> 00:44:42.957
Then they started fighting with each other.

648
00:44:42.957 --> 00:44:45.397
Mom told me to give this to you.

649
00:44:45.397 --> 00:44:48.028
But I was worried that a thief might take it if I just left it there.

650
00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:50.437
So I waited for you to come, but I became really hungry.

651
00:44:50.997 --> 00:44:52.167
Is this all you have for me?

652
00:44:52.367 --> 00:44:54.468
She said she'll give you the rest as soon as she gets paid this month.

653
00:44:57.477 --> 00:45:00.878
Ha Ram, Mom spent the entire day making these.

654
00:45:05.117 --> 00:45:06.988
You can eat the whole thing, you pig.

655
00:45:07.388 --> 00:45:10.417
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

656
00:45:10.417 --> 00:45:12.588
Come on, Ha Ram.

657
00:45:13.187 --> 00:45:14.787
Don't be like that.

658
00:45:16.128 --> 00:45:19.468
My gosh, why did you try to stop the door?

659
00:45:19.468 --> 00:45:21.097
Let me see. Show me where it hurts.

660
00:45:22.767 --> 00:45:24.568
Don't overreact. I didn't even close it that hard.

661
00:45:24.568 --> 00:45:25.667
Come over here.

662
00:45:27.468 --> 00:45:29.908
What's this? What is this?

663
00:45:31.508 --> 00:45:34.147
I don't know. I just got it.

664
00:45:34.147 --> 00:45:35.577
You don't get bruises for no reason.

665
00:45:36.077 --> 00:45:37.218
Let me see.

666
00:45:40.318 --> 00:45:42.017
Do you think I'm stupid?

667
00:45:42.147 --> 00:45:43.158
(Royeol Hospital)

668
00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:45.218
Are you really going to be like this?

669
00:45:45.358 --> 00:45:47.488
She's going to die soon.

670
00:45:47.488 --> 00:45:50.158
You should at least see her face before she dies.

671
00:45:52.198 --> 00:45:55.367
I know you've been living like strangers for about 20 years.

672
00:45:55.597 --> 00:45:58.437
But you're going to regret it if you just let her die like this.

673
00:45:59.097 --> 00:46:01.568
Why are you swearing at me?

674
00:46:01.568 --> 00:46:03.878
I can't even feed my own child properly these days...

675
00:46:03.878 --> 00:46:05.577
because I need to take care of her.

676
00:46:06.707 --> 00:46:09.678
Whatever. I really did my best.

677
00:46:09.678 --> 00:46:11.017
So you can do whatever you want now.

678
00:46:17.557 --> 00:46:19.428
I guess she's not your real sister.

679
00:46:20.227 --> 00:46:22.897
No. She's my cousin.

680
00:46:22.897 --> 00:46:25.727
But what happened to her?

681
00:46:26.097 --> 00:46:27.798
- Did she get into an accident? - Yes.

682
00:46:28.698 --> 00:46:30.537
She lived in the Philippines for a long time.

683
00:46:30.897 --> 00:46:32.968
And she apparently fell into the sea from a cliff.

684
00:46:34.968 --> 00:46:36.908
She was transferred here from the Philippines...

685
00:46:36.908 --> 00:46:38.278
because the doctors there said she had no hope.

686
00:46:39.178 --> 00:46:42.147
But the doctors here just say the same thing.

687
00:46:42.147 --> 00:46:44.178
My goodness.

688
00:46:46.088 --> 00:46:49.617
But it seems like she isn't in good terms with her husband.

689
00:46:49.787 --> 00:46:51.517
It's a long story.

690
00:46:52.557 --> 00:46:56.198
Come on. Follow me. Hurry up, and come inside.

691
00:46:56.198 --> 00:46:57.597
What are you doing here?

692
00:47:00.997 --> 00:47:02.367
Was I not enough?

693
00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:05.097
Did you have to make him get beaten up like this as well?

694
00:47:05.238 --> 00:47:07.108
What did you do to make him get beaten up like this?

695
00:47:07.108 --> 00:47:08.807
Be quiet. Let's go outside.

696
00:47:08.807 --> 00:47:10.408
I asked you a question!

697
00:47:18.517 --> 00:47:21.787
If you ran away, you should've at least gotten yourself a better man.

698
00:47:21.787 --> 00:47:24.517
Why must you always meet such reckless jerks?

699
00:47:24.858 --> 00:47:27.057
And while you may be responsible for making that decision,

700
00:47:27.057 --> 00:47:29.258
what about Hoon Seok or me?

701
00:47:31.097 --> 00:47:34.597
You're worse than the guys who abuse us.

702
00:47:34.597 --> 00:47:36.367
Don't get angry at Mom.

703
00:47:36.367 --> 00:47:38.867
I hate you. You're so mean.

704
00:47:38.867 --> 00:47:40.108
Let's go. Follow me.

705
00:47:40.108 --> 00:47:42.738
No, I'm going to stay with Mom.

706
00:47:43.077 --> 00:47:46.207
It's okay. It'll be okay. Don't cry.

707
00:47:46.747 --> 00:47:49.077
- It's okay. - How touching.

708
00:47:49.977 --> 00:47:52.617
People might mistake you guys as real mother and son.

709
00:47:54.347 --> 00:47:55.488
Do whatever you want!

710
00:48:04.528 --> 00:48:05.698
Is this the police station?

711
00:48:06.198 --> 00:48:07.767
I'd like to make a report on domestic violence.

712
00:48:14.568 --> 00:48:16.338
Are you still alive?

713
00:48:16.738 --> 00:48:19.577
Please just die.

714
00:48:19.608 --> 00:48:21.608
Stop tormenting me!

715
00:48:21.608 --> 00:48:24.977
Please just die!

716
00:48:24.977 --> 00:48:27.417
- Get off me! Let go! - My gosh.

717
00:48:27.847 --> 00:48:30.917
Please just die!

718
00:48:30.917 --> 00:48:32.658
Yes, I'd like to make a report on domestic violence.

719
00:48:33.158 --> 00:48:34.658
The address is...

720
00:48:36.097 --> 00:48:39.258
Hyo Jin, I told you not to call me during working hours.

721
00:48:40.628 --> 00:48:41.798
Your birthday present?

722
00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:45.798
Okay. Send me the photo. I'm going to hang up now.

723
00:48:48.568 --> 00:48:49.638
My gosh.

724
00:48:53.408 --> 00:48:54.477
Man Soo.

725
00:48:54.747 --> 00:48:56.378
He must have something to say to you.

726
00:48:56.378 --> 00:48:58.917
- Hey. - What?

727
00:48:58.917 --> 00:49:01.048
You were staring at him because you have something to say to him.

728
00:49:01.747 --> 00:49:02.818
Mr. Pumpkin.

729
00:49:03.818 --> 00:49:06.428
Did the murderer of your wife get caught yet?

730
00:49:06.827 --> 00:49:08.227
I hope they catch him soon.

731
00:49:08.557 --> 00:49:10.758
Forget that. Just don't come here if you can.

732
00:49:11.158 --> 00:49:12.727
There's no good in seeing each other like this.

733
00:49:17.767 --> 00:49:20.108
- Something must be on your mind. - What?

734
00:49:21.267 --> 00:49:22.738
Whenever something's on your mind,

735
00:49:22.738 --> 00:49:25.077
you come to this shabby place to drink...

736
00:49:25.378 --> 00:49:26.807
because people bother you if you go to other bars.

737
00:49:26.807 --> 00:49:29.747
My gosh, you're good.

738
00:49:30.178 --> 00:49:31.847
Try working at a bar for 10 years.

739
00:49:31.847 --> 00:49:33.647
It'll only be a matter of time before you become a fortune teller.

740
00:49:35.287 --> 00:49:37.488
That reminds me of Ms. Fortune-teller.

741
00:49:37.557 --> 00:49:38.718
"Ms. Fortune-teller"?

742
00:49:40.827 --> 00:49:42.128
Who's that?

743
00:49:42.128 --> 00:49:43.758
She's just this person I know.

744
00:49:45.557 --> 00:49:47.227
You must like her.

745
00:49:48.097 --> 00:49:50.767
No, it's not what you think. It seriously isn't.

746
00:49:51.198 --> 00:49:52.497
I, Oh Man Soo,

747
00:49:53.207 --> 00:49:55.138
like women who are sexy.

748
00:49:55.608 --> 00:49:58.577
Okay, okay. She must be the complete opposite of sexy.

749
00:49:58.908 --> 00:50:00.408
My gosh.

750
00:50:01.008 --> 00:50:03.278
I was completely relying on Ms. Fortune-teller.

751
00:50:03.647 --> 00:50:05.048
I lost so much money on him.

752
00:50:06.048 --> 00:50:07.948
I wonder where a policeman...

753
00:50:07.948 --> 00:50:10.858
got that much money to buy so much insurance.

754
00:50:12.287 --> 00:50:15.488
I should make up for the loss by attracting a lot of clients...

755
00:50:15.758 --> 00:50:16.897
during this year's Halloween party.

756
00:50:17.198 --> 00:50:19.198
- A Halloween party? - Yes.

757
00:50:19.198 --> 00:50:21.367
It's to keep a good relationship with our VVIP clients,

758
00:50:21.367 --> 00:50:23.568
and we're also going to attract new clients.

759
00:50:24.367 --> 00:50:26.508
If it's a Halloween party,

760
00:50:26.508 --> 00:50:29.608
are people going to be wearing masks and stuff like they do in movies?

761
00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:31.908
That sounds like fun.

762
00:50:32.138 --> 00:50:33.247
You should come too, Tiffany.

763
00:50:33.778 --> 00:50:36.077
How can I? You said it's just for VVIP clients.

764
00:50:36.077 --> 00:50:38.117
Come on. All my friends are coming too.

765
00:50:39.048 --> 00:50:40.847
We're friends. Don't you remember?

766
00:50:41.448 --> 00:50:43.718
When you drove me home from the police station that day,

767
00:50:43.718 --> 00:50:45.088
you and I agreed to be friends.

768
00:50:45.088 --> 00:50:49.428
- "Friends"? Can I really go? - Sure.

769
00:50:50.057 --> 00:50:52.428
I've always wanted to attend those kinds of parties.

770
00:50:52.767 --> 00:50:54.068
Nice.

771
00:50:58.867 --> 00:51:00.707
She wants an expensive game machine.

772
00:51:00.867 --> 00:51:01.908
What is it?

773
00:51:03.008 --> 00:51:05.977
It's my daughter. She's asking me to buy her a birthday present.

774
00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:11.548
When can you get me the address for the remaining list of people?

775
00:51:11.548 --> 00:51:13.687
Detective Park's looking into it.

776
00:51:13.687 --> 00:51:17.517
So I think we'll be able to get everything within a day or two.

777
00:51:19.187 --> 00:51:21.057
We're here.

778
00:51:24.997 --> 00:51:27.667
Let me see. Whose house is this?

779
00:51:27.667 --> 00:51:30.338
It's her house. She used to work at Pumpkin Singer.

780
00:51:30.597 --> 00:51:31.937
Her real name is Hwang Mi Ja.

781
00:51:32.238 --> 00:51:33.338
"Hwang Mi Ja"?

782
00:51:36.207 --> 00:51:37.537
"Santorini"?

783
00:51:39.178 --> 00:51:41.977
Wait. Let me see. Santorini.

784
00:51:42.108 --> 00:51:44.318
This is where Han Jin Sook's husband works.

785
00:51:44.318 --> 00:51:45.318
Yes.

786
00:51:47.747 --> 00:51:50.287
Hello. Welcome.

787
00:51:50.287 --> 00:51:51.457
We're the police.

788
00:51:51.687 --> 00:51:53.428
Is there a woman named Hwang Mi Ja here?

789
00:51:53.628 --> 00:51:54.628
Mi Ja?

790
00:51:55.158 --> 00:51:57.758
She's our boss. Why are you looking for her?

791
00:51:57.758 --> 00:52:00.298
We had something to ask her about.

792
00:52:00.298 --> 00:52:02.227
So can you tell her that we'd like to meet her?

793
00:52:02.227 --> 00:52:05.767
She's not here right now. She's in Japan.

794
00:52:06.267 --> 00:52:08.468
Really? When is she coming back?

795
00:52:09.537 --> 00:52:12.108
She said she'll start coming to work again by next week.

796
00:52:12.537 --> 00:52:14.477
Okay, we'll come back.

797
00:52:14.977 --> 00:52:16.378
Thank you.

798
00:52:23.088 --> 00:52:25.117
I wonder why the police are looking for Mi Ja.

799
00:52:27.388 --> 00:52:29.128
- Hey. - Hello.

800
00:52:29.758 --> 00:52:30.827
What brings you here?

801
00:52:31.358 --> 00:52:32.528
Do you have more questions for me?

802
00:52:32.557 --> 00:52:34.298
I was just wondering...

803
00:52:34.528 --> 00:52:37.367
if Ms. Hwang Mi Ja was acquainted to your wife.

804
00:52:37.468 --> 00:52:39.937
Yes, she's the woman I told you about. They used to...

805
00:52:40.238 --> 00:52:42.167
work together back in their hometown.

806
00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:44.838
I was able to get a job here because I had met her through my wife.

807
00:52:45.037 --> 00:52:48.008
Then out of all the guys that your wife was close to,

808
00:52:48.008 --> 00:52:50.818
have you ever seen a guy wearing a watch that looks like this?

809
00:52:51.617 --> 00:52:52.617
No.

810
00:52:53.448 --> 00:52:54.588
I've never seen that watch before.

811
00:52:58.988 --> 00:53:00.088
(Royeol Insurance)

812
00:53:06.068 --> 00:53:08.867
My gosh, what is this?

813
00:53:08.867 --> 00:53:10.568
These people are throwing money everywhere.

814
00:53:10.568 --> 00:53:11.897
Do they think this is the US or something?

815
00:53:12.537 --> 00:53:14.638
If they want to celebrate a holiday, they should celebrate...

816
00:53:14.638 --> 00:53:16.307
something that's more traditional.

817
00:53:17.138 --> 00:53:18.678
- These people are so weird. - Hey, Ms. Fortune-teller.

818
00:53:18.678 --> 00:53:21.508
People with low income are starving, and they're holding a party.

819
00:53:21.508 --> 00:53:23.577
- Ms. Fortune-teller. - Yes?

820
00:53:24.378 --> 00:53:25.548
You said...

821
00:53:26.588 --> 00:53:27.948
Mr. Song won't die.

822
00:53:28.548 --> 00:53:30.117
He passed away a couple of days ago from a car accident.

823
00:53:30.117 --> 00:53:31.158
Really?

824
00:53:31.588 --> 00:53:32.928
Did he really pass away?

825
00:53:32.928 --> 00:53:33.928
Yes.

826
00:53:34.588 --> 00:53:35.957
But he didn't have a shadow.

827
00:53:36.698 --> 00:53:39.468
There's nothing I can do about sudden car accidents...

828
00:53:39.468 --> 00:53:43.138
because I can't be around everyone for 24 hours straight.

829
00:53:44.667 --> 00:53:46.207
What about Lee Jung Bae's files?

830
00:53:47.707 --> 00:53:50.378
I won't say anything more since he's already dead.

831
00:53:50.378 --> 00:53:52.948
But please look more carefully from now on. Okay?

832
00:53:53.977 --> 00:53:54.977
And here.

833
00:53:55.577 --> 00:53:57.117
Leo's also coming to this party.

834
00:53:57.117 --> 00:53:58.647
You can prepare your own costume.

835
00:53:59.488 --> 00:54:02.088
Wait. Why would I attend this party?

836
00:54:02.088 --> 00:54:04.818
I'm not free to go to a party that's made for Western ghosts.

837
00:54:04.818 --> 00:54:06.327
I'm not asking you to come and have fun.

838
00:54:06.327 --> 00:54:07.988
I'm asking you to come and work.

839
00:54:08.428 --> 00:54:10.698
Every single young VVIP client of our company...

840
00:54:10.698 --> 00:54:12.128
will be attending this party.

841
00:54:12.457 --> 00:54:15.028
You won't have to go here and there by wasting money on transportation.

842
00:54:15.028 --> 00:54:17.138
You'll be able to see if people are going to die or not in one spot.

843
00:54:17.597 --> 00:54:18.638
So why would you not come?

844
00:54:19.537 --> 00:54:21.307
This is also part of your work.

845
00:54:21.307 --> 00:54:23.738
If you don't come to this party, I'm going to fire you.

846
00:54:23.738 --> 00:54:25.077
You're going to get fired.

847
00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:27.408
I'm also going to burn all those files.

848
00:54:27.908 --> 00:54:30.477
You're asking an awful lot for a single document.

849
00:54:31.617 --> 00:54:32.818
Fine, I'll go.

850
00:54:33.448 --> 00:54:36.057
My goodness. You're just a puppet CEO.

851
00:54:36.557 --> 00:54:37.617
What?

852
00:54:39.287 --> 00:54:40.457
What did you just say?

853
00:54:40.928 --> 00:54:42.827
- I said you're just a puppet CEO. - What...

854
00:54:42.827 --> 00:54:45.798
- You puppet CEO. - What... What... Hey!

855
00:54:45.957 --> 00:54:48.628
I'm going to fire you right now. I'm going to let you go.

856
00:54:48.628 --> 00:54:49.667
You're fired!

857
00:54:50.867 --> 00:54:52.838
- My gosh. - I love you.

858
00:54:52.867 --> 00:54:54.238
I love you!

859
00:54:54.338 --> 00:54:55.667
- My gosh. - He's so handsome.

860
00:55:00.608 --> 00:55:02.608
Why are they all so young?

861
00:55:03.948 --> 00:55:05.917
That person is supposed to be in his 40s.

862
00:55:07.247 --> 00:55:08.948
Joon. Joon.

863
00:55:09.287 --> 00:55:10.687
What took you so long?

864
00:55:10.687 --> 00:55:12.218
I had to take care of something at work.

865
00:55:12.617 --> 00:55:13.727
Nothing happened, right?

866
00:55:15.888 --> 00:55:18.128
My gosh, he's so good-looking.

867
00:55:19.258 --> 00:55:21.867
He's unbelievably handsome.

868
00:55:22.068 --> 00:55:23.198
He's not handsome.

869
00:55:25.838 --> 00:55:28.468
No one even lines up like this for the king of the underworld.

870
00:55:28.707 --> 00:55:29.937
How pathetic.

871
00:55:31.437 --> 00:55:34.347
Why do they bother to come here so early in the morning?

872
00:55:35.678 --> 00:55:36.778
Look around carefully.

873
00:55:46.057 --> 00:55:48.858
Why isn't he showing up after having sent that letter?

874
00:55:50.428 --> 00:55:52.968
Why would he show up at such a public area?

875
00:55:52.968 --> 00:55:54.767
If it were me, I'd kill him secretly.

876
00:55:54.767 --> 00:55:56.468
Or he could also try to kill him...

877
00:55:56.468 --> 00:55:59.138
in a dark place like a nightclub, so that his face won't get revealed.

878
00:56:00.068 --> 00:56:01.068
That's right.

879
00:56:02.008 --> 00:56:03.037
Joon.

880
00:56:04.477 --> 00:56:06.037
He said Leo's going to be there too.

881
00:56:06.477 --> 00:56:09.548
Wait. Here. Don't you think he'll come to this party?

882
00:56:09.718 --> 00:56:11.318
What's this? "Halloween"?

883
00:56:12.347 --> 00:56:13.347
What's this?

884
00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:15.417
Isn't it obvious?

885
00:56:15.417 --> 00:56:17.557
It's the Grim Reaper.

886
00:56:17.658 --> 00:56:18.787
The Grim Reaper?

887
00:56:20.327 --> 00:56:21.557
No way.

888
00:56:22.187 --> 00:56:23.758
Your imaginations are unbelievable.

889
00:56:24.597 --> 00:56:26.667
This is not what Grim Reapers look like.

890
00:56:27.068 --> 00:56:28.867
They look very gentle on the outside, you know.

891
00:56:29.767 --> 00:56:32.198
And what's this black cloak? It's so tacky.

892
00:56:33.008 --> 00:56:34.867
Humans are so pathetic.

893
00:56:35.437 --> 00:56:37.577
They don't even know anything, but they act like they do.

894
00:56:41.678 --> 00:56:42.678
What?

895
00:56:43.448 --> 00:56:44.448
What?

896
00:56:46.517 --> 00:56:47.818
Where did he go?

897
00:56:49.858 --> 00:56:51.787
Oh, right. Tomorrow's the day of the party.

898
00:56:52.517 --> 00:56:54.258
He told me to prepare my own costume.

899
00:56:54.957 --> 00:56:56.327
Joon. Joon.

900
00:57:02.057 --> 00:57:03.167
How does this look?

901
00:57:03.397 --> 00:57:05.667
I look quite elegant,

902
00:57:05.667 --> 00:57:07.136
so I think I should dress up as a princess.

903
00:57:07.136 --> 00:57:08.196
It doesn't suit you.

904
00:57:09.736 --> 00:57:10.807
Really?

905
00:57:11.537 --> 00:57:12.667
Then...

906
00:57:12.667 --> 00:57:15.136
Here. What do you think about this?

907
00:57:18.147 --> 00:57:19.207
What about this?

908
00:57:22.446 --> 00:57:23.847
Why do you have so many stuff in your hands?

909
00:57:24.747 --> 00:57:26.756
- This is for you. - Me?

910
00:57:26.756 --> 00:57:28.886
Yes. I want you to wear this for tomorrow's party.

911
00:57:28.886 --> 00:57:30.957
And don't forget to bring the props inside.

912
00:57:31.256 --> 00:57:32.827
- I don't want to. - Gosh, wait!

913
00:57:33.756 --> 00:57:37.526
They won't let us in if we're not wearing Halloween costumes.

914
00:57:37.827 --> 00:57:39.466
We must guard Leo, you know.

915
00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:43.406
Take it. Here. Let's go now.

916
00:57:45.307 --> 00:57:48.006
I must say, humans do all sorts of ridiculous things.

917
00:57:49.946 --> 00:57:52.546
She'll eventually show up where Han Moo Gang is.

918
00:57:54.816 --> 00:57:56.886
I'd like to know about the flights to Chicago.

919
00:57:57.446 --> 00:57:58.616
For tomorrow.

920
00:58:18.506 --> 00:58:20.377
I can't believe Joon picked this out of all the costumes.

921
00:58:21.807 --> 00:58:24.847
Well, it's not too bad. I mean, I'm still a princess.

922
00:58:46.366 --> 00:58:47.566
What is this?

923
00:58:47.836 --> 00:58:50.037
I can't tell who anyone is if I can't see their faces.

924
00:58:54.676 --> 00:58:56.046
(List of Royeol Hospital's VVIP Clients)

925
00:58:57.107 --> 00:58:58.807
Is Joon not here yet?

926
00:59:04.486 --> 00:59:05.816
Ms. Fortune-teller?

927
00:59:05.816 --> 00:59:07.156
Oh, Boss!

928
00:59:07.316 --> 00:59:08.787
How much did you pay for your costume?

929
00:59:08.787 --> 00:59:12.156
Mine was 50 dollars, but I haggled and got it down to 20 dollars.

930
00:59:12.287 --> 00:59:13.957
20 dollars? My goodness.

931
00:59:14.156 --> 00:59:15.957
Mine was 2,000 dollars. 2,000 dollars.

932
00:59:15.957 --> 00:59:17.727
Look at this lovely couple!

933
00:59:17.727 --> 00:59:19.636
You two look so cute together.

934
00:59:19.636 --> 00:59:22.167
- Stand here. Let me take a picture. - Goodness.

935
00:59:22.167 --> 00:59:24.406
- Stop it! - Really? Sure, do it.

936
00:59:24.406 --> 00:59:25.767
All right. There.

937
00:59:26.506 --> 00:59:28.037
Try to look more affectionate towards each other. Okay?

938
00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:29.847
Affectionate?

939
00:59:29.847 --> 00:59:31.506
1, 2.

940
00:59:36.446 --> 00:59:37.946
Joon.

941
00:59:39.287 --> 00:59:40.716
Joon.

942
00:59:41.417 --> 00:59:43.156
I'm wearing the outfit you picked.

943
00:59:43.187 --> 00:59:44.287
Are we good now?

944
00:59:44.687 --> 00:59:46.397
You look incredible.

945
00:59:47.227 --> 00:59:50.696
You'd definitely outshine Brad Pitt if he were here.

946
01:00:00.636 --> 01:00:02.877
What was that glare about? Goodness.

947
01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:05.147
Is he dressed as Joe Black? That movie is ancient.

948
01:00:05.147 --> 01:00:07.046
Who is that man?

949
01:00:07.316 --> 01:00:09.147
He's so stylish.

950
01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:14.116
Gosh, what on earth are you wearing? I can't help but compare you two.

951
01:00:14.517 --> 01:00:15.917
Who put this outfit together for you?

952
01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:17.327
I paid 2,000...

953
01:00:18.756 --> 01:00:20.227
For goodness' sake.

954
01:00:23.627 --> 01:00:25.526
- That guy is so dashing. - He's really handsome.

955
01:00:25.526 --> 01:00:27.736
- What's that girl doing with him? - Who's that frog?

956
01:00:33.577 --> 01:00:35.506
By the way, why did you want me to hold this?

957
01:00:36.906 --> 01:00:39.747
Joon, Joe Black isn't complete without this.

958
01:00:39.747 --> 01:00:41.946
Hold the jar like this...

959
01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:43.647
and take a spoonful.

960
01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:46.156
Then suck on it.

961
01:00:46.156 --> 01:00:47.616
Here, open your mouth.

962
01:00:55.196 --> 01:00:56.397
It's sweet.

963
01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.097
I like this. It's good.

964
01:01:01.566 --> 01:01:03.307
- Where's that rude jerk? - Leo?

965
01:01:03.807 --> 01:01:06.437
- I don't think he's here yet. - Is that why...

966
01:01:06.437 --> 01:01:09.236
you were hanging out with that green monster over there?

967
01:01:17.046 --> 01:01:20.287
Goodness. How can a detective be so good-looking?

968
01:01:20.287 --> 01:01:21.486
How annoying.

969
01:01:23.156 --> 01:01:24.256
Hang on.

970
01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:28.057
Did I invite him?

971
01:01:29.497 --> 01:01:30.497
Gosh, you startled me.

972
01:01:32.066 --> 01:01:35.167
Hey, I'll have a nightmare about this.

973
01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:37.736
Are you observing everyone for the shadow that might be inside?

974
01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:38.836
Don't you worry.

975
01:01:38.836 --> 01:01:41.736
I'm watching everyone with eyes like a hawk.

976
01:01:41.736 --> 01:01:44.347
Why are so many people dressed in black?

977
01:01:44.977 --> 01:01:46.546
How can we search in this place?

978
01:01:46.546 --> 01:01:48.316
Sorry? What did you say?

979
01:01:49.046 --> 01:01:50.386
You don't need to know.

980
01:01:51.247 --> 01:01:53.586
You're not here to play. Keep looking for him, okay?

981
01:02:07.397 --> 01:02:09.537
This is Philip... I mean, Steven Yoo.

982
01:02:09.607 --> 01:02:12.006
His parents helped me out a lot when I was studying abroad.

983
01:02:13.207 --> 01:02:14.207
Hi, man.

984
01:02:14.207 --> 01:02:17.477
I'm not having a good day, so don't talk to me. Just go have fun.

985
01:02:17.477 --> 01:02:18.647
Let's go, Steven.

986
01:02:19.176 --> 01:02:21.776
Hey, you absolutely cannot drink. You better stick to soda.

987
01:02:22.716 --> 01:02:23.917
Who is he?

988
01:02:26.256 --> 01:02:27.357
My nephew.

989
01:02:28.687 --> 01:02:32.026
I see. By the way, this party must've cost you a fortune.

990
01:02:32.026 --> 01:02:35.727
Don't worry about such things. Just focus on observing our clients.

991
01:02:35.897 --> 01:02:38.167
I didn't invite you here for you to have fun.

992
01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:39.796
I'm not playing around.

993
01:02:40.037 --> 01:02:42.836
I'm observing everyone with eyes like a hawk right now.

994
01:02:44.066 --> 01:02:48.006
Go over there. Go there, and get some work done. Seriously.

995
01:02:52.847 --> 01:02:54.816
What an oddball.

996
01:03:01.187 --> 01:03:02.417
Why that little...

997
01:03:10.566 --> 01:03:11.627
Moo Gang.

998
01:03:13.037 --> 01:03:15.336
A position became available at a hospital in the States.

999
01:03:15.997 --> 01:03:18.636
I had to leave in a hurry. I'm sorry.

1000
01:03:19.707 --> 01:03:21.736
I couldn't even say goodbye to you in person.

1001
01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:40.497
Kim Sun Young.

1002
01:03:46.066 --> 01:03:47.466
Why are you calling me just now?

1003
01:03:48.497 --> 01:03:49.707
You kept me waiting for so long.

1004
01:03:50.307 --> 01:03:51.767
How could you...

1005
01:03:52.136 --> 01:03:53.537
It's easy to miss what's right in front of you.

1006
01:03:56.446 --> 01:03:59.517
Come here immediately if you want to save your boyfriend's life.

1007
01:04:05.247 --> 01:04:07.316
- It's Leo. - Oh, my gosh!

1008
01:04:07.457 --> 01:04:08.716
- He's so hot. - I know, right?

1009
01:04:08.716 --> 01:04:10.026
Look who's here.

1010
01:04:10.287 --> 01:04:11.526
Long time no see.

1011
01:04:17.997 --> 01:04:19.897
The one in the witch costume... Isn't she that girl?

1012
01:04:20.136 --> 01:04:22.736
From the bar where we got into a fight after making a prank call...

1013
01:04:22.736 --> 01:04:24.167
about bombing the National Assembly Proceeding Hall.

1014
01:04:25.207 --> 01:04:27.176
Didn't she go to the police station with us?

1015
01:04:28.276 --> 01:04:30.446
But how did that wench get into this party?

1016
01:04:31.477 --> 01:04:32.607
I invited her.

1017
01:04:33.446 --> 01:04:35.477
You did? Why?

1018
01:04:35.877 --> 01:04:36.986
Because we're friends.

1019
01:04:38.316 --> 01:04:39.347
Friends?

1020
01:04:39.816 --> 01:04:42.616
Hey, why are you even friends with a bar girl?

1021
01:04:42.616 --> 01:04:45.357
Byung Ho. Watch your language, will you?

1022
01:04:45.886 --> 01:04:48.827
And you better not address my friends disrespectfully.

1023
01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:50.827
You're disrespecting me as well.

1024
01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:53.537
All right.

1025
01:04:54.537 --> 01:04:56.866
Don't get worked up over something so petty.

1026
01:05:01.077 --> 01:05:02.577
Don't smoke, okay?

1027
01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:07.546
Sang Min.

1028
01:05:09.616 --> 01:05:10.616
Do you want one?

1029
01:05:12.187 --> 01:05:15.216
Do I look like a kid? I quit a long time ago.

1030
01:05:16.156 --> 01:05:17.557
But these aren't cigarettes.

1031
01:05:30.267 --> 01:05:31.366
Hey, you made it.

1032
01:05:31.506 --> 01:05:32.566
Yes.

1033
01:05:38.577 --> 01:05:40.977
Please don't cause any trouble today, okay?

1034
01:05:41.276 --> 01:05:42.417
I'll be right back.

1035
01:05:44.716 --> 01:05:45.886
That jerk...

1036
01:05:49.926 --> 01:05:53.156
I don't spend time with customers outside the bar.

1037
01:05:54.357 --> 01:05:56.866
Gosh, that petty wench is provoking me.

1038
01:05:57.196 --> 01:05:59.597
- Gosh! You can't be doing this. - Let go of her!

1039
01:05:59.597 --> 01:06:01.937
- You really shouldn't do this. - Let go!

1040
01:06:04.466 --> 01:06:07.477
- I'll apologize on his behalf. - He's usually not like that.

1041
01:06:07.477 --> 01:06:08.776
Don't side with him.

1042
01:06:08.776 --> 01:06:09.906
All right.

1043
01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:13.816
What do you think? You said you've never been to a place like this.

1044
01:06:15.376 --> 01:06:17.216
I feel as if I'm in a completely different world.

1045
01:06:18.786 --> 01:06:20.357
I thought it'd be exciting,

1046
01:06:22.557 --> 01:06:23.756
but I'm uncomfortable.

1047
01:06:24.057 --> 01:06:25.886
I don't feel like I belong here.

1048
01:06:26.326 --> 01:06:27.796
That's not true.

1049
01:06:28.826 --> 01:06:31.727
Can I take this home?

1050
01:06:31.727 --> 01:06:34.336
Hyo Jin loves carrot cake.

1051
01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:37.966
Sure thing.

1052
01:06:39.576 --> 01:06:41.407
I'll tell my kitchen staff to pack a few things for you...

1053
01:06:41.477 --> 01:06:43.006
before you leave.

1054
01:06:43.706 --> 01:06:45.546
Hyo Jin will get to pig out today.

1055
01:06:46.046 --> 01:06:49.317
Oh, right. I left her birthday gift in my room upstairs.

1056
01:06:49.447 --> 01:06:51.086
- Don't forget to take it. - A gift?

1057
01:06:51.886 --> 01:06:54.557
I peeped on her text message on your phone.

1058
01:06:56.027 --> 01:06:57.126
The game machine?

1059
01:06:58.227 --> 01:07:01.597
Thank you so much, Man Soo. Gosh, every time...

1060
01:07:01.597 --> 01:07:04.496
Don't mention it. Don't forget to take it when you leave.

1061
01:07:21.046 --> 01:07:25.347
Microphone check. The couple for today's main stage.

1062
01:07:25.347 --> 01:07:29.987
It's the green prince and the green princess show!

1063
01:07:34.697 --> 01:07:35.697
It's dance time.

1064
01:07:35.697 --> 01:07:37.426
Boss, come on. The insurance payouts.

1065
01:07:37.426 --> 01:07:39.966
We need to make up for all the insurance payouts. Come on.

1066
01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:41.197
Let's do this.

1067
01:07:57.987 --> 01:07:59.147
A lovely couple?

1068
01:08:00.117 --> 01:08:01.716
They don't suit each other at all.

1069
01:08:17.737 --> 01:08:18.937
Moo Gang.

1070
01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:28.447
You look dashing today.

1071
01:08:30.317 --> 01:08:32.216
I've never seen you dressed like this.

1072
01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:33.786
Why am I feeling this way again?

1073
01:08:34.886 --> 01:08:37.586
Why do I get like this every time I see this doctor?

1074
01:08:37.586 --> 01:08:40.197
I've decided to move to the States and study more.

1075
01:08:41.897 --> 01:08:43.496
I had to leave in a hurry.

1076
01:08:44.796 --> 01:08:46.597
So I came to say goodbye to you.

1077
01:08:48.496 --> 01:08:51.706
You could at least try to look sad.

1078
01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.857
What on earth are you doing now?

1079
01:09:14.597 --> 01:09:15.897
Moo Gang.

1080
01:09:32.246 --> 01:09:34.046
Take care, Moo Gang.

1081
01:09:36.786 --> 01:09:37.817
What is this now?

1082
01:09:38.546 --> 01:09:40.317
Why does my heart ache?

1083
01:09:41.057 --> 01:09:43.657
I'm really sorry, Moo Gang.

1084
01:09:43.826 --> 01:09:45.626
But I'll repent for the rest of my life.

1085
01:09:47.256 --> 01:09:48.456
Repent?

1086
01:09:48.456 --> 01:09:50.697
Don't try too hard to regain your memory.

1087
01:09:51.227 --> 01:09:53.197
That's probably better for your sake.

1088
01:10:06.947 --> 01:10:08.076
Hey, isn't this when people kiss?

1089
01:10:08.076 --> 01:10:09.246
- Yes! - Yes!

1090
01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:10.947
Look! Look at this.

1091
01:10:10.947 --> 01:10:13.187
I paid 2,000 dollars for this glow-in-the-dark paint.

1092
01:10:13.617 --> 01:10:14.786
Yours doesn't glow in the dark, right?

1093
01:10:25.227 --> 01:10:27.166
What's this? What's going on?

1094
01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:28.937
Please turn on the lights. The lights!

1095
01:10:28.937 --> 01:10:32.067
The lights must be turned back on. Please turn on the lights!

1096
01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.136
The lights must go back on!

1097
01:10:36.546 --> 01:10:37.576
Who was it?

1098
01:10:41.317 --> 01:10:42.947
Who was it? I clearly saw...

1099
01:10:43.916 --> 01:10:46.256
Where did he go? Where did he disappear to?

1100
01:10:49.426 --> 01:10:50.926
Where did that doctor go?

1101
01:10:59.597 --> 01:11:00.767
What's your problem?

1102
01:11:07.076 --> 01:11:09.447
It's him. Yes.

1103
01:11:10.147 --> 01:11:12.916
I must make sure that jerk doesn't bother me anymore.

1104
01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:29.256
(World Drink)

1105
01:11:30.496 --> 01:11:31.567
What do you want?

1106
01:11:39.876 --> 01:11:41.836
I should've killed him.

1107
01:12:28.517 --> 01:12:29.557
Kim Sun Young.

1108
01:13:16.307 --> 01:13:17.407
Get off, you jerk.

1109
01:13:17.466 --> 01:13:19.676
Pull over. Pull over!

1110
01:13:20.676 --> 01:13:21.836
I said, pull over!

1111
01:13:40.657 --> 01:13:41.657
Moo Gang!

1112
01:14:00.147 --> 01:14:02.046
How dare you, human.

1113
01:14:38.647 --> 01:14:41.716
Things will get complicated for me if you kill Han Moo Gang.

1114
01:14:42.086 --> 01:14:44.187
If you ever try to kill him again...

1115
01:14:53.836 --> 01:14:56.407
You should've laid low and behaved yourself when I let you live.

1116
01:15:11.786 --> 01:15:13.487
No. Joon, no!

1117
01:15:14.357 --> 01:15:15.756
That woman...

1118
01:15:17.286 --> 01:15:19.326
will be so sad.

1119
01:15:21.326 --> 01:15:23.267
Moo Gang! No!

1120
01:15:23.597 --> 01:15:24.926
Moo Gang!

1121
01:15:26.296 --> 01:15:27.336
Moo Gang!

1122
01:15:30.367 --> 01:15:31.367
Moo Gang.

1123
01:15:32.567 --> 01:15:33.977
Moo Gang!

1124
01:15:56.867 --> 01:15:57.926
What's happening?

1125
01:15:58.767 --> 01:16:00.166
Why can't I get out of here?

1126
01:16:20.416 --> 01:16:21.987
(Black)

1127
01:16:22.256 --> 01:16:24.157
He kills someone else...

1128
01:16:24.157 --> 01:16:25.756
- before he kills your father. - Hurry up!

1129
01:16:25.786 --> 01:16:27.557
Why didn't I think of that?

1130
01:16:27.557 --> 01:16:28.697
That's...

1131
01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.966
- That shadow back then... - No!

1132
01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:33.166
Who is it?

1133
01:16:33.296 --> 01:16:34.496
Where is that tape?

1134
01:16:34.597 --> 01:16:37.567
What is going on? Have I really becoming a human?

1135
01:16:37.567 --> 01:16:39.807
He'll die very soon.

1136
01:16:40.676 --> 01:16:41.737
Why are you lying?

1137
01:16:41.737 --> 01:16:43.176
You must tell me honestly.

1138
01:16:43.176 --> 01:16:45.277
How is this possible?
