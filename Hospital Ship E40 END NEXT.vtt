00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:10.127
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:11.658
(Letter of Resignation)

3
00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:15.948
I can't say I'm not disappointed,

4
00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:19.958
but this is a good opportunity for you,

5
00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.118
so I can't stop you.

6
00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:26.188
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

7
00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:27.528
Sure.

8
00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:29.658
Take care of yourself.

9
00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.118
Doctor Song.

10
00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:54.959
You're quitting?

11
00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:58.058
Yes.

12
00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:00.859
And you'll quit your job at the hospital ship soon as well?

13
00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.099
Yes.

14
00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.699
Is there anything you want to tell me?

15
00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:31.389
I had a feeling...

16
00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:33.999
it wouldn't last.

17
00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:36.628
What wouldn't?

18
00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:39.729
The secret.

19
00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:41.568
I thought...

20
00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:44.908
Mr. Chu would tell you.

21
00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.809
Even if he didn't,

22
00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:52.348
you should have. That's the right thing to do.

23
00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.219
Keep it to yourself.

24
00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:03.389
No one else can know.

25
00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:11.599
Where will you go?

26
00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.669
To the UK.

27
00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:17.768
- Doctor Song. - That's where I want you...

28
00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:19.639
to think I went.

29
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.338
Why are you doing this?

30
00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:24.009
Why are you being so stubborn?

31
00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:27.518
You're right.

32
00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.148
Love is everything.

33
00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:36.189
Love is everything.

34
00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:38.829
It's everything.

35
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.738
There's this man I like.

36
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.338
Just thinking of him...

37
00:02:51.808 --> 00:02:53.579
makes my hand and feet curl.

38
00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.178
This beats out of my chest all the time.

39
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:09.159
The sky is so blue, the sea is so beautiful,

40
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.359
and every plant I see on the ground is pretty...

41
00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:18.599
because he is there.

42
00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.759
The cancer that grows in my body...

43
00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.229
is virulent.

44
00:03:46.028 --> 00:03:48.498
If it spread to my lungs, I could die.

45
00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:51.229
Even if I don't die,

46
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.268
I most likely will become disabled.

47
00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.069
Doctor Song...

48
00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.708
I think I want that guy...

49
00:04:04.148 --> 00:04:06.449
to think highly of me.

50
00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.248
Unless I'm healthy and beautiful,

51
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.819
I don't want to be with him.

52
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:16.528
I don't want him to see me...

53
00:04:17.728 --> 00:04:19.629
when I'm suffering and low.

54
00:04:22.098 --> 00:04:23.869
Don't do that.

55
00:04:24.968 --> 00:04:26.329
More than that,

56
00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.139
I can't make him...

57
00:04:31.268 --> 00:04:33.408
take me on as a burden too.

58
00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:37.309
He's struggling enough already...

59
00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:40.449
without me adding to it.

60
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.119
I didn't fall in love...

61
00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:48.389
to become a burden...

62
00:04:49.518 --> 00:04:51.689
or to burden anyone else.

63
00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:54.929
If I'd known,

64
00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:57.929
I wouldn't have started it.

65
00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.598
I want to put him at ease.

66
00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:05.869
When he's with me at least.

67
00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:11.449
I want him...

68
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.718
to be able to relax.

69
00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:19.989
That's why I got started.

70
00:05:23.158 --> 00:05:24.489
That's why...

71
00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:27.699
I prefer it this way.

72
00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:33.439
You're way too cool.

73
00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:37.208
I want to be cool.

74
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:38.708
And scary tenacious.

75
00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.708
I always was.

76
00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:02.398
(Express bus)

77
00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.098
Did you have to take the first bus on a work day?

78
00:06:08.098 --> 00:06:10.038
It wasn't my choice.

79
00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:12.069
I'm following their schedule.

80
00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:15.939
I have less than half a day between the seminar and my flight,

81
00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:18.809
and they really want to meet then.

82
00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:20.418
Okay.

83
00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:24.249
Call as soon as you arrive.

84
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.489
Get on the bus. It's cold.

85
00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:34.329
- Take care. - What greeting is that?

86
00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:38.968
You should say something like, "See you soon."

87
00:06:39.168 --> 00:06:42.768
You can't say "take care" like we'll never meet again.

88
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.968
Did I say that?

89
00:06:46.608 --> 00:06:49.579
- Don't do it again. - Okay.

90
00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:51.778
Go on.

91
00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:53.439
The tumor is quite large...

92
00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:57.738
and the chest CT and PET-CT show signs it spread to the lungs.

93
00:08:59.468 --> 00:09:03.248
Let's do chemotherapy to get the cancer in the lungs...

94
00:09:03.748 --> 00:09:05.779
and try to reduce the mass.

95
00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:32.638
Did she call?

96
00:09:34.138 --> 00:09:35.208
No.

97
00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:39.248
Not once in over a month?

98
00:09:41.378 --> 00:09:43.319
Why don't you call the UK?

99
00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:44.988
- You think I didn't? - And?

100
00:09:44.988 --> 00:09:49.019
Their headhunter left to a war-torn part of Somalia very suddenly.

101
00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:52.929
- A member of his team is Korean. - Is it Eun Jae?

102
00:09:53.998 --> 00:09:55.559
They can't confirm.

103
00:09:56.569 --> 00:09:59.529
They'll call as soon as they do, so I'm waiting.

104
00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:02.399
This is insane.

105
00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.519
Hello, ma'am.

106
00:10:16.348 --> 00:10:18.218
Did you get an x-ray?

107
00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:22.358
Come by in the afternoon. I'll explain then.

108
00:10:23.588 --> 00:10:24.728
Bye.

109
00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:32.829
Mr. Chu.

110
00:10:36.638 --> 00:10:38.238
Where'd he go?

111
00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:42.878
Shall I send it myself?

112
00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:55.189
(Song Eun Jae)

113
00:10:56.628 --> 00:10:58.059
An x-ray?

114
00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:00.799
Taken a month ago.

115
00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:18.149
What are you doing here?

116
00:11:18.848 --> 00:11:20.149
What's this?

117
00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:23.549
Is this Doctor Song's leg?

118
00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:28.559
- Doctor Kwak. - Is Doctor Song sick?

119
00:11:29.218 --> 00:11:30.388
She's sick?

120
00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.659
Did I hear correctly?

121
00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:36.059
What does she have?

122
00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:10.199
Pick up.

123
00:12:29.478 --> 00:12:31.519
Hey, you called.

124
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:33.419
I turned my phone off in class...

125
00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.958
and forgot to turn it on.

126
00:12:35.258 --> 00:12:37.829
- I see. - How are you?

127
00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:39.858
How's my sister?

128
00:12:41.858 --> 00:12:44.569
- What? - How's my sister?

129
00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:36.888
Hello?

130
00:13:38.248 --> 00:13:39.618
Do you know who I am?

131
00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:44.228
I know everything.

132
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:47.159
Tell me the truth.

133
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:51.269
Doctor Song.

134
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:54.238
Do you know where she is?

135
00:13:56.738 --> 00:13:57.809
Yes.

136
00:13:59.368 --> 00:14:00.708
She's at our hospital.

137
00:14:18.988 --> 00:14:22.098
I don't think she told her family.

138
00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:28.069
As you can see, even we're not allowed inside.

139
00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:30.439
She won't see anyone.

140
00:14:31.439 --> 00:14:32.939
Don't blame her.

141
00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:36.138
Once you see her,

142
00:14:37.049 --> 00:14:38.708
you won't be able to.

143
00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:47.988
(No visitors)

144
00:15:48.012 --> 00:15:54.476
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 40 Hospital Ship "Love That Transcends"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

145
00:16:53.718 --> 00:16:54.779
You're awake.

146
00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:57.888
Stay lying down.

147
00:17:05.388 --> 00:17:06.459
Why...

148
00:17:08.098 --> 00:17:10.299
- are you here? - Doctor Song.

149
00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:12.368
How did you find out?

150
00:17:14.338 --> 00:17:15.799
Who told you?

151
00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:17.838
Is that important?

152
00:17:20.178 --> 00:17:21.979
Does that matter to you?

153
00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:23.509
You didn't see me.

154
00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:28.878
- Pretend you didn't. - Doctor Song.

155
00:17:29.378 --> 00:17:31.148
- Please leave. - Eun Jae.

156
00:17:31.148 --> 00:17:32.448
Leave now!

157
00:17:34.489 --> 00:17:35.789
Why are you doing this?

158
00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:38.289
How could you do this to me?

159
00:17:38.928 --> 00:17:41.398
- How could you... - I told you to get out!

160
00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.178
Doctor Song.

161
00:17:57.848 --> 00:17:59.009
Open the door.

162
00:18:00.378 --> 00:18:01.918
Open the door.

163
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:10.358
Are you okay?

164
00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:12.428
Answer me.

165
00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:16.969
Please open the door.

166
00:18:30.249 --> 00:18:31.348
Okay.

167
00:18:33.448 --> 00:18:35.019
I'll do what you want.

168
00:18:37.388 --> 00:18:40.658
I'll do what you say as long as you come out.

169
00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:43.989
Don't sit in the cold.

170
00:18:49.098 --> 00:18:50.269
Come outside.

171
00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:05.648
Please.

172
00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:34.378
Thank you.

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:37.378
Well done.

174
00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:27.529
Turn and look at me.

175
00:20:29.499 --> 00:20:31.569
It might be the last time we meet.

176
00:20:33.239 --> 00:20:34.898
Must I only see your side profile?

177
00:20:44.908 --> 00:20:45.908
Okay.

178
00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:49.019
Do what you want.

179
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.088
I'll...

180
00:20:53.658 --> 00:20:54.759
go now.

181
00:20:58.529 --> 00:20:59.628
I'll go,

182
00:21:01.898 --> 00:21:03.729
but I want to show you something first.

183
00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:10.838
I'm doing this for the others,

184
00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:15.378
so I can't leave without showing it to you.

185
00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:48.039
It's me.

186
00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:50.108
Are you...

187
00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:54.079
upset that I pulled you by the hair?

188
00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:57.948
Is that why you left?

189
00:22:00.989 --> 00:22:03.688
I won't pull you by the hair again.

190
00:22:04.729 --> 00:22:05.989
What I mean is...

191
00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:10.928
I miss you.

192
00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.138
Please...

193
00:22:14.868 --> 00:22:16.198
come back.

194
00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:20.039
It's me. I stopped drinking.

195
00:22:21.108 --> 00:22:23.279
Gosh, I miss you so much.

196
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:25.848
I really miss you.

197
00:22:26.148 --> 00:22:29.579
You nagged me so much, but you can't anymore,

198
00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:31.088
can you?

199
00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:34.588
Get better soon and come back.

200
00:22:35.019 --> 00:22:36.989
Everyone is waiting for you.

201
00:22:37.188 --> 00:22:40.898
I don't eat anything salty or sweet anymore,

202
00:22:41.158 --> 00:22:43.269
so come back soon.

203
00:22:51.668 --> 00:22:54.779
Please come back, doctor. I miss you.

204
00:22:59.249 --> 00:23:00.719
Doctor, it's me.

205
00:23:01.378 --> 00:23:05.289
I came here with Jae Geol and caught a lot of fish.

206
00:23:05.588 --> 00:23:09.559
It's good for you, so come here and have some.

207
00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:12.388
Dr. Song Eun Jae.

208
00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:15.759
I'm Han Sol's mother.

209
00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:17.898
Han Sol...

210
00:23:18.368 --> 00:23:21.299
doesn't need a respirator and can leave the hospital.

211
00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.368
Doctor.

212
00:23:25.908 --> 00:23:27.138
Thank you.

213
00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:30.549
Thank you so much.

214
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:34.019
I'm sorry.

215
00:23:36.588 --> 00:23:38.148
It's our turn now.

216
00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:42.259
As you took care of us,

217
00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.829
we'll take care of you now.

218
00:23:48.499 --> 00:23:49.999
Please come back.

219
00:23:51.668 --> 00:23:52.729
All of us...

220
00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:56.098
All of us are waiting for you.

221
00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:14.059
Let's go back.

222
00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:18.029
Then we'll fight together.

223
00:24:20.898 --> 00:24:22.898
I'm not doing it for you.

224
00:24:24.598 --> 00:24:25.898
Without you,

225
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:28.499
I can't live.

226
00:24:35.108 --> 00:24:36.108
I beg you.

227
00:24:38.979 --> 00:24:40.049
Next to you...

228
00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:44.049
is where I belong.

229
00:24:44.948 --> 00:24:46.049
Please.

230
00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:53.329
Don't push me away.

231
00:25:59.158 --> 00:26:01.398
(Operating Room)

232
00:26:10.838 --> 00:26:11.938
You can do it, right?

233
00:26:14.438 --> 00:26:17.479
Remember that you're not alone.

234
00:26:18.908 --> 00:26:20.079
I'll be back.

235
00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:23.588
That's right.

236
00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:26.418
That's the attitude.

237
00:26:41.698 --> 00:26:42.938
You left the honor...

238
00:26:43.608 --> 00:26:46.368
of being the best surgeon in Korea.

239
00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:48.678
Where have you been?

240
00:26:51.408 --> 00:26:53.579
Don't worry and sleep.

241
00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:57.249
I'll make your leg so strong that you can stay being...

242
00:26:57.588 --> 00:26:59.418
a surgeon for a long time.

243
00:27:02.418 --> 00:27:03.559
Rest assured.

244
00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:25.579
Doctor.

245
00:27:26.108 --> 00:27:27.779
Doctor.

246
00:27:28.648 --> 00:27:30.289
Doctor.

247
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:32.618
What should I do?

248
00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:44.098
- It's appendicitis. - No helicopter can come.

249
00:27:44.098 --> 00:27:45.329
They can't fly.

250
00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:46.739
As a Korean medicine doctor, I can't do a thing.

251
00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:49.039
I can't perform the operation as a dentist.

252
00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:52.438
- At a time like this... - Do you need a surgeon?

253
00:27:59.309 --> 00:28:00.348
Dr. Song.

254
00:28:01.979 --> 00:28:03.388
I came back now.

255
00:28:04.188 --> 00:28:07.459
I resume work at the hospital ship today.

256
00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:09.759
This is Surgeon Song Eun Jae.

257
00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:17.829
Shall I transfer him to the operating room?

258
00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:19.598
- Of course. - Take the lead.

259
00:28:20.838 --> 00:28:21.838
Nurse Yoo.

260
00:28:26.108 --> 00:28:29.108
There was a time when I thought I could be alone.

261
00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:39.118
I used to be ashamed of being dependent.

262
00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:44.688
However,

263
00:28:45.428 --> 00:28:48.098
I don't feel ashamed when he catches me...

264
00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:50.569
as I lose my balance.

265
00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:01.938
We'll feel weak many times in life.

266
00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:05.178
We'll also feel lost.

267
00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:07.579
At times like that,

268
00:29:08.348 --> 00:29:10.219
please look around yourself.

269
00:29:13.459 --> 00:29:16.459
You'll find him who supports you at times...

270
00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:18.289
when you feel weak.

271
00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:23.999
That's why we can start anew.

272
00:29:25.698 --> 00:29:27.269
While believing in the power of love,

273
00:29:28.438 --> 00:29:30.039
I loved.

274
00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:33.438
After all, it's love.

275
00:29:34.138 --> 00:29:36.579
(Thank you for watching Hospital Ship.)
