Episode 5

4
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.620
No longer

5
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.800
will I live just passively
accepting everything.

6
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.460
That's right!

7
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.920
Let me pay back some of my debt as well.

8
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.280
The exchange of revenge services
should be done properly.

9
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.020
It's no longer an exchange of services.

10
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.520
From now on, we are one family.

11
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.960
If we live, we live together.
If we die, we'll also die together.

12
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.920
The revenge of my Unnies is my revenge.

13
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.660
Just a moment!

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.140
Why?

15
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.440
The photo was taken from outside,
though.

16
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.860
We've only received that one picture.

17
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.620
That's not just any picture, though.

18
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.800
We've only just begun.

19
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.540
We haven't done anything yet.

20
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.060
But it's not as if we've
done absolutely nothing.

21
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.120
Why don't we wait a little bit for now?

22
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.340
If there is an ulterior motive,
we'll definitely get a signal.

23
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.380
What do we do if
something else comes up?

24
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.760
Don't be afraid!

25
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.220
Unnie will protect you.

26
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.680
That's right. Now there are four of us.

27
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.680
<i>Hong Do, don't cry</i>

28
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.820
<i>Oppa is here</i>

29
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.960
<i>Just keep</i>

30
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.960
You have a drink, too.

31
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.840
<i>your own way</i>

32
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.980
Here it is.

33
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.680
<i>as a wife</i>

34
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.480
Do you have a fishing line on your tail?
What is making you so happy?

35
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.120
I'm always happy.

36
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.900
Sook, you have a drink, too.
I'll buy it.

37
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.700
Really?

38
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.760
But Unnie, are you dating these days?

39
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.600
Your face has completely brightened.

40
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.040
I am.

41
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.800
There she goes again.

42
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And not just one or two.

43
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.620
Oh, you're talking crap now.

44
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.080
Who is it? Someone from the market?

45
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.740
Who is it, Unnie?

46
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.740
With a lot of money,

47
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.740
very refined

48
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.680
and very smart,

49
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.680
and the looks are perfect as well.

50
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.340
It must be true!

51
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.280
Bring him by!
I'm very good at judging men.

52
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.220
Unnie is?

53
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.260
So that's why Unnie has
changed a bit these days, huh?

54
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.620
Yes.

55
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.720
I have to change.

56
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.140
Oh right, is Hee Soo okay?

57
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.760
He has to continue to go to
school with those jerks after all.

58
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.760
At school,

59
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.580
there is a trustworthy person
that I've attached to him.

60
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.280
That's good!

61
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.880
Hyung!

62
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.840
Let's go together!

63
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.480
Does Hyung know how to do it?

64
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.940
Hyung is good at things like that.

65
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.480
Yah, Baek Seo Yeon!

66
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.220
Are your injuries all better now?

67
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.540
Yah, it's not that I ran away
that night. You know, right?

68
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.340
You told me to go first.

69
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.240
So I just did what you said. Okay?

70
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.760
Ayy, I didn't realize that
you were thinking like that.

71
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.920
Huh? Baek Seo Yeon. I'm really touched.

72
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.140
I'm glad we ran into you.

73
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.640
Are you all better now?

74
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.900
Are you okay?

75
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.200
You.

76
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.960
Be good to your mother, girl!

77
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.360
What concern is it of yours?

78
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.000
I mean,

79
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.820
she says she doesn't want to.

80
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.440
What? What is that?

81
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.160
I heard that there was someone
who broke his arm while being a fool,

82
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.000
so I tried it once.

83
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.660
It seems perfectly fine.

84
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.620
Wow!

85
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.000
Wow.

86
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.220
Hey,

87
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.100
What are you doing?

88
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.640
Aren't you leaving?

89
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.800
I'm going right now. Let's go!

90
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.420
However, how do the Ajummas
and Hyung know each other?

91
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.240
The Ajummas are the ones
who are close to each other.

92
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.520
I'm just... while going
back and forth... somehow.

93
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.780
Ah, the other day, the one who ate
ramen. She's your stepmother, isn't she?

94
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.480
That's right. She's the stepmother.

95
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.280
I am the illegitimate child.

96
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.600
It sounds like a drama, doesn't it?

97
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.960
Yes.

98
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.200
Still, it looks as if you're
close to your stepmother.

99
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.080
Does it look that way?
That Madam and I look close?

100
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.780
Madam?

101
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.020
Do you think the word
"Mom" would come easily?

102
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.860
Ah, you're not close, are you?

103
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.780
If I act like this,
then it will do, right?

104
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.040
Yes, please continue to ignore me.

105
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.860
I also have to be nervous in
order to escape suspicion.

106
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.920
And so that I can pretend
to be a kind son some more.

107
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.580
Actually, there is something
that I'm worried about...

108
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.820
What about?

109
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.745
You two seem to be in
that kind of relationship

110
00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:55.080
where you can tell each other
your worries. Hmm?

111
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.340
That's good to see.

112
00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.440
What is your worry?

113
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.363
Oh, that. I keep getting
calls from my birth mother.

114
00:09:03.563 --> 00:09:05.960
So I was asking what
I should do about it.

115
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.333
Father told me to not meet her,
but she keeps contacting me.

116
00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:11.280
So I thought that I
might just get in trouble.

117
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.760
Things like that,
you should have told me.

118
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.060
It's just that Father is busy.

119
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.100
What should I do?

120
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.720
Oh, that woman. Really.

121
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.800
I told her so that she could understand.
She doesn't even know her place.

122
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.400
I'll take care of it.
Don't even think about it, darling.

123
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.720
I have never even thought about it.

124
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.120
But darling, you even listen to the
child's concerns. That's thoughtful of you!

125
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.360
I was just giving him
advice to be careful.

126
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.440
Having come into this house, he can't
go rolling around lowering his status.

127
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.440
Not even knowing his place.

128
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.340
Oh, okay. That's true.

129
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.260
For the time being,
I'm not going to open this door.

130
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.040
You've thought well.

131
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.360
Let's now just go looking forward!

132
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.300
Soon the campaigning will start,
and you will become busy as well.

133
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.820
You have to change as well.

134
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.820
What are you talking about?

135
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.760
I am also

136
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.000
going to change.

137
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.100
Are you saying that
you'll change like this?

138
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.000
I am

139
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.040
not someone who is here for
you to take your anger out on.

140
00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.580
So from now on,
don't treat me any which way you want.

141
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.840
Unnie!

142
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.520
Hmm?

143
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.240
Unnie, in your life, have you never had
someone that you wanted to take revenge on?

144
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.160
How could I not have anyone?
There are so many.

145
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.120
Then...

146
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.100
those guys,

147
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.387
if you wanted to discreetly,
without anyone knowing,

148
00:12:37.587 --> 00:12:40.160
in a way that the law won't
get involved, give them hell,

149
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.160
then how would you do it?

150
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.580
Whether you're caught by the law or not,
big or small, revenge is revenge.

151
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.822
I have to take care of the children
and take care of the store.

152
00:12:50.022 --> 00:12:51.420
I have so many things that I have to do.

153
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.100
I have no time to think
of things like that.

154
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.728
The more precious a thing
you have in your hand,

155
00:12:56.928 --> 00:13:00.340
the stronger the fist you make.
Isn't that right?

156
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.700
You don't avoid poop because you're scared
of it. You avoid it because it's dirty.

157
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.480
Those idiots who acted like that,
they're poop. Poop! Diarrhea!

158
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.820
If everyone just avoids it,
then who will clean up that poop?

159
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.380
When the smell of poop is
just spreading everywhere.

160
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.360
Our success is going to be
a little too easy, isn't it?

161
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.880
That's what I mean. No matter who looks
at it, Candidate Baek is going to win.

162
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.900
We have to wait for the
results to see if we succeed.

163
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.560
Look at him.
Look at him with his false modesty.

164
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.840
Here. Here. Here. Here.

165
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.100
You're working hard.

166
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.520
Yes, you have to do this so that I can
stand up proudly in front of my father.

167
00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.400
Don't worry.

168
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.060
Father's pride, I will raise it up high.

169
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.200
Okay.

170
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:06.900
Okay.

171
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.800
However, did you have something to say?

172
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.800
No.

173
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.020
I was just wondering
if you were doing well.

174
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.200
There isn't anything that
makes you uncomfortable?

175
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.800
Yes. Madam treats me well, so it's good.

176
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.760
That's why. That habit.

177
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.580
Madam, more than she might look...

178
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.940
Hey, it's still "Madam"? Call her
"Mother" since we're one family now.

179
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.280
Anyway, if you need anything, tell the
housekeeper. Don't bother your mother.

180
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.440
Yes, I will.

These three people are working
together for the election.

185
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.556
With the election of the Superintendent
of Education as the start,

186
00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.340
there is definitely a big picture somewhere.

187
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.340
Isn't it that Soo Gyum has
watched the news too often?

188
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.200
Isn't this becoming too big?

189
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.820
If it became a bigger revenge,
that would be good.

190
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.340
If it's going to be anyway,
it would be good.

191
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.100
So what are you going to do?

192
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.620
And not just "I'm in the
middle of thinking about it."

193
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.040
That's why we've gathered here.

194
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.700
So that we can all "study". It's
almost time for the teacher to get here.

195
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.080
I've come.

196
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.880
Oh, it's our Smartie. Smartie.

198
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
What is this?

199
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.140
Mi Sook, you come here and lie down.

Comic books are meant to
be read while lying down.

201
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.700
Oh, yes.

202
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.280
Come here.

203
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.460
This is strong stuff.

204
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.480
Ayyy, I borrowed those!

205
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.400
Such a cruel revenge isn't acceptable.

206
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.580
My wish is that no one be
put in danger or be hurt.

207
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.460
That's right.
We don't do things like that.

208
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.800
However,

209
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.880
we can't just continue to hide
and give them little griefs.

210
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.380
Exactly. We have to find a
way that's suitable for us.

211
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.480
How about something like this?

212
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.580
We each look to see what we have.

213
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.680
I have nothing but money.

214
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.800
I have a wily mind.

215
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.940
I...don't...

216
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.340
You do that thing well.

No. I just handle fish.

Ah, there is something I do well.
Chicken fight.

221

Oooh! Definitely!

222
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.960
However,
how do we use that in a revenge?

Are you alright? You don't look alright.

I'll prepare.
This time, I won't tolerate.

liquor for a while, right?

314
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.010
With this,
how will you go around campaigning?

315
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.010
Tomorrow, I'll take off the cast.

316
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.630

Sell a lot.
Thank you.

320
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.108
Well, it would have been good
if he had gotten

321
00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:43.700
casts on both arms
so that he can't hit.

322
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.170
It's ok. In the hospital, he was told
that he should not drink for a while.

323
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.980
He will be quiet for a while.

324
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.265
Unnie, I'll go now.

325
00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:56.160
Please work hard.

326
00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.890
Jung Hye. It's hot. It's hot. You'll
get burned, burned. Drink it slowly.

327
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.190
Drink slowly. Make one more cup quickly.

328
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.480
Slowly.

329
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.400
Anyway, thanks to our candidate throwing his
own body, it made for some good advertising.

330
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.860
Was that "noise marketing"?

331
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.550
These days, there's no better
marketing strategy than that.

332
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.140
Our neighborhood ladies are sentimental.

333
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.280
Seeing you in this impressionable shape,
they will start to cheer you on.

334
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.298
In the education field,
if you do a good job

335
00:26:32.498 --> 00:26:34.750
of wheedling the moms,
then everything is okay.

336
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.960
He is the expert, so don't worry.

337
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.350
I will arrange for a chance
for you to recover your image.

338
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.650
Wouldn't it be good to make
it a cozy party for sponsors?

339
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.100
If you make a good speech there,

340
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.910
your aura will be pakkk!

341
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.080
Yes, Yes, Yes. Ohhhh. Sorry, sorry.

342
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.740
Oh, be careful. Be careful.

343
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.880
Every year, what the hell is this?

344
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.760
Why should the whole family have to
have a medical checkup as a group?

345
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.240
He wants to control all the
stock owners at one time.

346
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.880
Brother, your face looks good.

347
00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.400
Like always, I'm confident in my health.

348
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.170
Brother, you are so lucky.

349
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.960
You got married according to your plan.

350
00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.960
Now a son falls into your
lap from out of nowhere?

351
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.950
Why? You have children, too,
three of them. All daughters.

352
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.390
Don't think it's all over.
Aigoo. You'll have one more kid?

353
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.420
If you want to make
the son the successor,

354
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:50.080
then the father needs to be
in that position first, right?

355
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.630
I'll go ahead.

356
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.570
Oh my god, is that the kid?

357
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.610
That woman is really something. Being
here with her illegitimate stepchild.

358
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.610
Does she have no pride?

359
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.900
They say the Chairman's family
has gotten a firstborn grandson?

360
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.540
Byung Soo must have caused some
trouble before and had the kid.

361
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.870
So who is his mom?

362
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.190
I don't know. A rootless woman.

363
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.620
Right.
Oh my god.

364
00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.770
Up until now, Right.
Oh my god.

365
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.180
that daughter-in-law had
been treated like a nobody.

366
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.160
Oh my god. Now she will be aww...

367
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.100
Is that the kid?

368
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.530
Whatever happened,
will the Madam care at all?

369
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.280
Why? Didn't you hear the rumor?
She has pretended to be all elegant, but

370
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.521
Madam is doing nothing.

371
00:28:44.721 --> 00:28:47.390
She's not interested in her
husband's business, either.

372
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.160
She just enjoys shopping.

373
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.840
Anyway, she's infertile,
so it's good to get a child for free.

374
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.040
Since she doesn't have to suffer
raising a kid, she must be happy.

375
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.440
Don't turn around.

376
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.610
Raise your head and straighten your waist
up. Control the expression on your face.

377
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.600
But those people.
Pretend that you don't hear them.

378
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.850
They are just looking for reasons to stir
up trouble. You don't need to give them any.

379
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.490
The Chairman wants you to come in.

380
00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.590
Ah, he will see the young master first.

381
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.180
This is the second time we're meeting.
Sit down.

382
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.350
You were sick. Do you feel better now?

383
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.270
An old man should tour
the hospital every season.

384
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.250
When I first saw you,

385
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:54.110
I wondered if Byung Soo
was trying to pull off a trick.

386
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.610
Now that I see you a second time,
you do indeed resemble Byung Soo.

387
00:29:59.040 --> 00:29:59.800
So.

388
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.950
Is it ok staying at your home?

389
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.350
Yes. Everyone is taking care of me well.

390
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.710
It's our second meeting,

391
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.370
so we can be honest, can't we?

392
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.600
Why do you think

393
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.890
your father brought you home?

394
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.720
Because I'm family.

395
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.610
Right. Family is good.

396
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.200
To me, being a family

397
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.060
is being people who are
necessary to each other.

398
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.450
Am I a necessary person to you,

399
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.720
grandfather?

400
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.560
You're not something to
entrust to Byung Soo, are you?

401
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.670
He is too greedy.

402
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.670
He can't become a container who
can hold everything he wants.

403
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.450
This is a company I
had worked so hard to build.

404
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.690
When I did this,
my grandmother stopped coughing.

405
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.150
These days,

406
00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.280
you seem to be doing something
fun with your stepmother.

407
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.350
How is it? Shall I help you?

408
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.300
No.
Why?

409
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.300
Because my ankle may be trapped by you.

410
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.650
You're not coughing any more.

411
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.790
Aren't you too honest?

412
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.620
If I lie, you will be able to tell,
won't you?

413
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.660
Still, you should have done so.

414
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.400
If you don't want to be tied to me,

415
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.030
at least you should at
least pretend to be dumb.

416
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.230
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

417
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.230
That's alright.

418
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.660
I know that

419
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.500
you feel uncomfortable with that kid,

420
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.280
although it happened before marriage

421
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.280
and even we didn't know it.

422
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.410
But isn't he the child
you needed as well?

423
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.960
I believe you know what I mean.

424
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.790
You may go.

425
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.520
My husband will not
give up Soo Gyum easily.

426
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.720
It's because it's a condition of becoming
the successor that he needs the child.

427
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.140
Does he absolutely have to have
a child to become the successor?

428
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.140
It's not the Joseon dynasty.

429
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.860
That condition must have been imposed
when my husband had no children.

430
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.220
Because Father-in-law
trusts the second son more.

431
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.320
It's a makjang drama.

432
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.890
Then, even if there is a son,

433
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.595
If there's a way to prevent
him from being a successor.

434
00:33:19.795 --> 00:33:20.590
That's right.

435
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.530
Then my husband probably
won't need a son.

436
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.440
Then Soo Gyum can be free.

437
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.630
Ah...

438
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.320
That's why you decided to accept him?

439
00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.770
Letting Soo Gyum into the Avengers Club.

440
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.483
We should do a bigger revenge to let

441
00:33:37.508 --> 00:33:40.054
Soo Gyum be able to go
back to his country home.

442
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.524
A "bigger revenge" means?

443
00:33:41.724 --> 00:33:44.190
Will it be okay to do
that to your husbands?

444
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.900
I don't care, but Mi Sook Unnie...

445
00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.170
I...

446
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.170
made up my mind.

447
00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.354
I told my husband already that
I was going to change.

448
00:33:56.554 --> 00:33:58.240
I wouldn't just continue enduring.

449
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.640
Our Mi Sook became courageous.

450
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.390
So don't worry about me.

451
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.390
Just think about a more...

452
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.390
certain revenge.

453
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.950
Mother-in-law,

454
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:43.310
I'm sorry.

455
00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.810
Your son

456
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.480
may go through some difficult times.

457
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.400
Who are you?

458
00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.990
My daughter sent you?

459
00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.760
It's about time for mine to
be better than Hee Soo's.

460
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.760
Still far from it.

461
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.410
By the way,
I was curious from the beginning.

462
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:40.410
Why are you living with Father?

463
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.250
Is it the difference between
the ideal and the reality?

464
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.840
The only thing I can do
is to live as his wife.

465
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.080
Who said so?

466
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.800
Who told you to live like this? Put aside
your family, relations, others' opinion.

467
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.760
How about you?

468
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.510
What do you want to do?

469
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.120
That is...
My opinion.

470
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.660
is not important.

471
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.670
Whatever it is, it won't do.

472
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.810
I came too late.

473
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.120
My shop work took longer than
I expected. Umbrella and cup.

474
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.780
You didn't have to give them to me.

475
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.650
I chose the most similar one,
but I wonder if it will be okay to use.

476
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.040
Then I'll...

477
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.400
Miss, why don't you
have a cup of tea before you go?

478
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.030
But you're busy.

479
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.980
I like it more than the broken one.

480
00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.020
Ah, that's a relief.

481
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.750
But why do you keep smiling?

482
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.000
It's nothing.

483
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.480
I'm busy. I'll go then. I drank it well.

484
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.420
Please drop by to have
tea when you pass by here.

485
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.950
Yes, Hong Do Hee.

486
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.950
Wake up.

487
00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.680
What woman...

488
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.640
Let's sell a lot of fish and
treat my children to a good life.

489
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.160
Hey,
you should get a pair of running shoes.

490
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.910
Those are very worn out.

491
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.910
They're okay. Still fine. Why?

492
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:23.200
I'll choose your shoes.
You go and get some toilet paper.

493
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:23.740
Yes.

494
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.760
Son, go pick out some cookies.

495
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.040
So you can go fight one round?

496
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.670
Oh, this mart smells so bad!

497
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.610
Oh, the fishy smell! Oh, yah!

498
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.620
So,

499
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.315
you should do your shopping
in your little outdoor market.

500
00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:02.590
Why are you showing up here
and appearing before my eyes?

501
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:14.250
Does one avoid poop because one is scared
of it? One avoids it because it's dirty.

502
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.760
What? Poop!

503
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.990
Why are you running away? It must be
because you feel guilty about something.

504
00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.840
Jung Wook's mother,

505
00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.543
if you came to the supermarket, then shop.

506
00:39:24.743 --> 00:39:26.920
Why are you picking a fight
with me and causing a fuss?

507
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.150
F..fuss?!
Yah, have you said everything?!

508
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.640
I haven't yet. But I'm just going
to leave since I'm rather busy.

509
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:38.000
Ha! Now that the settlement is over, you
seem to be slowly showing your true colors.

510
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.229
But ha! You don't even realize
that I allowed the settlement.

511
00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:42.620
So how dare you walk around
with your head raised so high?

512
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:44.620
Of course,

513
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.700
the settlement is over,
so why should I be cast down before you?

514
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.230
Well, a wench who sells fish at the
outdoor market could only be like that.

515
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:56.890
You should live and eat at your outdoor
market. Why are you here? How about it?

516
00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.000
Are you even able to drive
your cart properly? Huh?

517
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.880
That's right.

518
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.880
I'm a wench who sells fish
at the outdoor market.

519
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.220
So what?
What's wrong with my occupation?

520
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.640
You must have lived
without ever eating fish.

521
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.552
Ha! How could I trust the goods

522
00:40:13.752 --> 00:40:14.800
from an outdoor market in order
to be able to eat it?!

523
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.975
If it's sold at the outdoor market,
then it's "goods".

524
00:40:17.175 --> 00:40:19.290
And if it's sold at the supermarket,
then does it become "quality merchandise"?

525
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.442
Do you even know what kind
of world it is today,

526
00:40:21.642 --> 00:40:23.260
thatyou stand there talking smack
about another's occupation?

527
00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.920
Yah! Have you said everything?!
I said I haven't yet!

528
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.790
Because we had only signed and
stamped the settlement agreement but

529
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.320
haven't submitted it to the court yet.
So I was going to be quiet.

530
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:33.100
But it's good that this happened. I'll say
the rest (of what I have to say) today.

531
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.227
And also, the motorcycle accident
from the other night,

532
00:40:36.427 --> 00:40:37.690
I was going
to just let that go,

533
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.840
but let's say that you trained your
child wrong and let it go at that.

534
00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.240
Wh-what?

535
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:45.710
What accident?!

536
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.340
Oh, you must not normally
talk to your son much.

537
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.920
Because his body was so weak that you had to
raise him as if he were a glass container.

538
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.040
While riding his motorcycle, that son
caused an accident and then ran away.

539
00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.500
There were three
injured victims from it.

540
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.790
Should I go get the three testimonies from
the accident report and give them to you?

541
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.640
That is something I don't know about.
I will only acknowledge proven facts.

542
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:15.020
That you have taught your child wrong
and so is ruining his life is a fact!

543
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.240
What? You crazy bitch!

544
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.490
Aigoo... What's giving
off that fishy smell? Hmm?

545
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:31.690
Yah!

546
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.120
I told you not to appear before my eyes,
didn't I?

547
00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.120
Just pretend you didn't
see me and walk away.

548
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.310
I mean...

549
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.688
You could shop in your
mother's shabby outdoor market,

550
00:41:41.888 --> 00:41:43.480
why are you crawling all the way over here?

551
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.400
You dare to pick on me, even all alone?

552
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.400
What are you saying?

553
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.600
Without your lackeys,
do you have the guts to pick on me?

554
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.760
Do you want to be turned inside out?

555
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.420
Why? This time, do you want to hit me?

556
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.170
Okay, please,
hit me rather than just being all talk.

557
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.010
Wow.

558
00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.560
Wow. Crazy bas...

559
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.070
Yah...

560
00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.370
This bastard assailant,
now that the settlement's done,

561
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.420
he's talking like a
"brutus in human form."

562
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.600
You probably meant
"brute in human form. "

563
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.970
Stop getting your words
wrong and try studying.

564
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.640
How long are you going
to live like this?

565
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.390
You bastard, you really... Aish...

566
00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.090
Do you think it's all
over after the settlement?

567
00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.520
Don't get it wrong.

568
00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.190
I won't let you off.

569
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.960
I will go to the school board.
I'll make sure

570
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:26.320
your gangster son gets expelled!

571
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.370
Jung Hye!

572
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:28.780
M-Madam?

573
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:34.910
I must have seen wrongly.

574
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.490
What? You crazy.

575
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.210
Oh, Jung Hye. Here.

576
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:41.920
Here. Over here.

577
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.130
You're being really
ridiculous right now.

578
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:53.790
Why?

579
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.330
Why? Do I seem like an easy target,
but Jung Hye is scary?

580
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.800
Scary?! Wh-what would be scary?!

581
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.150
The parent of the kid
who beat my child up

582
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.060
and the Madam,

583
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:03.630
do you think you deserve
the same treatment?

584
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.050
Even if you treat us differently,

585
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.630
You should have at least
minded your manners.

586
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.920
Who is the ass talking nonsense that
you can talk about manners like this?

587
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.130
Or at least, you shouldn't have
started talking rudely first.

588
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:13.930
Ma'am.

589
00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.160
You! Really!

590
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.730
I'm not going to leave you alone.

591
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.350
I'm going to make sure you're completely
ruined and living in the streets.

592
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.550
Oh, Jung Hye?

593
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:26.140
Ha!

594
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.580
Look!

595
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.340
You think you're going to fool me again?

596
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.930
Even if the Madam is God,
I'm not afraid of her at all!

597
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.990
Ms. Joo Gil Yeon?

598
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:33.630
What?!

599
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.790
Omo. Ma..

600
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:38.640
Madam.

601
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.890
What are you doing right now?

602
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.480
Oh, this fishy smelling guy doesn't
know his place and keeps talking back.

603
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:46.810
Why?

604
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.090
Just because your mother was able to
settle, you've now discovered some courage?

605
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.000
Yah, your mother.

606
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.160
She knew her place well and
even got down on her knees well.

607
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.850
She must not have
taught you that at home.

608
00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.760
What?

609
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.690
Moron.

610
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.970
Aigoo... This is why I say that
proper family education is important.

611
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:06.010
Yah.

612
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.630
Watch this yourself.

613
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:08.940
While watching this...

614
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.010
Please live having learned
your place in life, okay?

615
00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.610
Did you receive good family education?

616
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.250
This bastard, really!

617
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.780
Ugh.

618
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.640
Why are you hitting a
person and making a fuss?

619
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.890
Ms. Joo Gil Yeon,

620
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.260
I think I definitely told you that
this person is very close to me.

621
00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:31.260
This kind of behavior,

622
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.600
it's very unfortunate.

623
00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.360
Ah, it... It wasn't anything much.
Just...

624
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:38.730
we parents had something to
consult each other about our sons.

625
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.550
I don't think there is much time left until
the store contract needs to be renewed.

626
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.160
Should I raise it by another $20,000?

627
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.000
Omona, Madam is really...

628
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.080
I mean, even though you are
the wife of the building owner,

629
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:54.160
if you speak that way,

630
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.920
you'll probably hear that you're
trying to throw your position around.

631
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.460
The one trying to throw
her position around is you.

632
00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.170
The building owner is me.

633
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.820
Well, of course, since you're
the wife of the General Manager,

634
00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.560
then what the General Manager owns,
you probably own as well.

635
00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.220
Jung Hye.

636
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.680
I'll handle this one.

637
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.440
Earlier, you hit me, didn't you?

638
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.090
When did I hit you?

639
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.620
The violence!

640
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:18.410
Over there,

641
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.510
it should all be recorded.

642
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:22.440
Since your threats against
me and my livelihood

643
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.210
are all recorded here,

644
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:26.650
it's now my turn.

645
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:29.610
Why?

646
00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.180
You want to curse at me again?

647
00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.760
Or are you going to hit me?

648
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.720
I'm going to tell you this clearly.

649
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.190
Even without Jung Hye,

650
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.060
Even without the CCTV,

651
00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:42.880
I'm not the least bit scared of you.

652
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.120
Don't look at a person
as being inconsequential.

653
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.270
Got nothing to say?

654
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.610
If you hit a person, shouldn't you
apologize and say you're sorry?

655
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.920
Aish... An apology? Whatever.

656
00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.560
You're the one who was walking
without looking in front of you

657
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.600
properly and ran into me.

658
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.290
Look properly when
you're walking around!

659
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.920
You should be grateful that
I didn't drop my cellphone.

660
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.600
You speak very entertainingly

661
00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.590
when you look like a piece of
chewed up and spat out gum.

662
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.340
Is it because your
lips stick out so much?

663
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.720
Aish!
Yah.

664
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.180
Even if you don't have manners,
don't you recognize your sunbae?

665
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:29.610
Hoobae,

666
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.470
take care of me well.

667
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.220
Oh.

668
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.000
And you...

669
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.080
You smell.

670
00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:43.710
Can you please get rid of
that rotten smell first?

671
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.970
Son! Let's go.

672
00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.600
That such a lowlife family can come here
makes me feel bad.

673
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:00.780
Mother, let go!

674
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:02.440
Come along! Stop talking.

675
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.430
Trashy people.

676
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.370
Aigoo...

677
00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.940
Aigoo! So happy!

678
00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.480
Ah, how come the two of you are here?

679
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.760
To buy ramen ingredients.

680
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.400
So, Soo Gyum must also
be good at cooking ramen?

681
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.800
If it's ramen,
Hee Soo's is the most delicious.

682
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:32.840
How nice would it be if I
can eat Hee Soo's ramen.

683
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.950
I have exams now,
so I need to revise at home.

684
00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.760
We need to study.

685
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.700
Then Mom has to go and have a drink.

686
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.790
In the daytime?

687
00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.620
After seeing that woman,
I suddenly want to drink.

688
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:47.360
Son goes to study, mom goes to drink.

689
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.230
So where should we go?

690
00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.160
Seo Yeon,
I made your favorite clam soup.

691
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.300
How rare.

692
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:07.130
Where is it?

693
00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.190
Aigoo.

694
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.640
Yes, Jung Hye?

695
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:15.370
Unnie, do you have time today?

696
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.960
By any chance,
are you with your husband?

697
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:25.100
No, there's an election activity this
weekend, too. He said he'll come home late.

698
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.030
Why?

699
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:27.640
Ah! That's great!

700
00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.180
We can meet up!

701
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.800
Now?

702
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:33.340
Where?

703
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.700
But... Is it okay to go to
Mi Sook's house like this?

704
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.310
She said her husband
will come home late.

705
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:42.920
Ah, fine.
Hurry.

706
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.700
Mi Sook Unnie~~!

707
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:50.920
Ah, how on earth is everyone...

708
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.140
Can we go inside?

709
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.130
Ah, y-yes.

710
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:55.530
Omona.
Ah, so heavy.

711
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.640
I tried to stop her,
but she's broken into your house anyway.

712
00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.420
Today, we met Joo Gil Yeon.

713
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.250
So we're going to drink.

714
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.700
Aigoo, let's see the standard of the
house chores of a good mother and wife.

715
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.530
Aigoo...

716
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.830
Oh, Seo Yeon, these are mom's friends.

717
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.160
Where are you going?

718
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:24.120
Aigoo...

719
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:33.880
Aigoo...

720
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.090
You must be hungry.

721
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.160
You can look around.

722
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.500
Here, cucumbers.

723
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.990
Aigoo...

724
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.800
Oh, do you want another cucumber?

725
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.160
You must like cucumbers.

726
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.880
Madam, what are you doing?

727
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.530
Come here and help!

728
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.260
If not now, when will you learn
how to cook? Don't you think so?

729
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.800
That's right.

730
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.800
How about starting with something easy?

731
00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.700
Jung Hye, can you prepare the onion?

732
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:45.320
Yes.

733
00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.380
I've prepared it.

734
00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.330
Ah, this...
Is this how you've prepared it?

735
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.770
Yes, I washed it clean.

736
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.490
This... the layer...

737
00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.820
You have to peel it.

738
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.860
Ahhhh...

739
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.760
Okay.

740
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.060
I've peeled the onion.

741
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:07.690
You did well.

742
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.320
You've peeled it well.

743
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.520
Can you bring the chili powder?

744
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.940
Ah, th-there... Yes.
Mi Sook.

745
00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:19.470
Pour some, pour some of it.

746
00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:30.540
Avengers Club!
Fighting!

747
00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.850
Mi Sook, you should've seen
how that woman ran away.

748
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.320
Joo Gil Yeon?

749
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:39.980
Joo Gil Yeon.

750
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.350
But what if she really
tries to do something?

751
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.550
Let her! I'm not afraid of her at all.

752
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:51.530
But how did you appear so
suddenly right at that time?

753
00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:53.020
Unnie called me.

754
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:03.700
Jung Hye?

755
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.000
Jung Hye?

756
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:21.900
Haha... I only said that to
scare that woman. My goodness.

757
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:27.500
Anyway,
today is the best day of my life.

758
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.800
I even feel 10 years younger.

759
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.600
What do I call this feeling?

760
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.200
Should I say it's a Botox for my pride?

761
00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:45.350
- Cheers!
- cheers! cheers!

762
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:48.550
Today, take it easy with the drinking.

763
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.800
To look at it,
there doesn't seem to be any problems.

764
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:59.550
Same in my home, too.

765
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:04.550
For a long time,
there was nothing going on in my home.

766
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.750
There's one thing.
Even if I want to help you,

767
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:18.250
if you don't do something,
then there is a limit to what I can do.

768
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:19.750
We got together to take revenge,

769
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:24.000
but if we keep going this way,
then it's just a friendly gathering.

770
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.600
I don't know what to do
with my daughter, Seo Yeon.

771
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.200
More than your husband,

772
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.000
it's your daughter that is
the more painful knife cut.

773
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:56.650
My husband was originally a man who
became rough when he drank too much,

774
00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.993
but it hasn't been that long since
the violence became serious.

775
00:53:59.193 --> 00:54:00.100
You! What is this...

776
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.000
- Honey!

777
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.950
Dad! Dad, stop it.

778
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:08.400
Don't be this way with Mom.

779
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.050
Why should I?
- Do you think I'm a joke, too?

780
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:13.350
Dad, enough of this.

781
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.900
Wake up from the alcohol
and then we can talk.

782
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.050
- Let's go into the bedroom.
- What?!

783
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:21.550
You come here! Stop right there!

784
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:29.850
My husband's violence started
becoming serious from two years ago.

785
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:33.000
From after you sent your son off?

786
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:38.250
When my son was gone,
it was hard for my husband and me.

787
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.050
And for Seo Yeon, too.

788
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:44.700
Even though I realized that
something was going wrong,

789
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:50.000
at first I thought my
daughter had changed,

790
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.450
but...

791
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.700
I now realize it was me who changed.

792
00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:01.450
There was nothing I
could do for my daughter.

793
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.350
Unnie, you are a good mother.

794
00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:09.225
That's right,
there's no mother like our Mi Sook.

795
00:55:09.425 --> 00:55:14.100
Unnie,
do you mind telling us your son's name?

796
00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.100
How old was he?

797
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:22.950
Seo Jin. Baek Seo Jin.

798
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.800
If he lived till now,

799
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.700
he would have been the same age as Soo
Gyum, in the third grade of high school.

800
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.100
How did you lose him?

801
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:41.800
In the end...

802
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.150
he never returned.

803
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:54.850
The worst thing you can do is to not
keep the right order

804
00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:57.850
and die before your parents.

805
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.150
Seo Jin was the one who was wrong.

806
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:05.150
That's right.
Unnie, it wasn't your fault.

807
00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:08.375
Unnie, you are a really good mother.

808
00:56:08.575 --> 00:56:11.400
No, you're wrong. It was all my fault.

809
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.550
The fault belongs elsewhere.
Why are you apologizing?

810
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:18.300
If I had been raised by a good mother,

811
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.800
would I have been a better mother?

812
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.550
I'm sorry, Jung Hye.

813
00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:36.100
Like you,
I've never known my mother's face.

814
00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:37.925
Same with my father.

815
00:56:38.125 --> 00:56:39.750
What do you mean?

816
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:45.950
I grew up in an orphanage.
I left when I was 18 years old.

817
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:54.200
Back then I just survived
as well as I could.

818
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:57.950
So that's how it was for you.

819
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.100
That's why your children were
so much more precious to you.

820
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.550
Unnie, you are a good mother.

821
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:08.005
Of course, even with a good mother,

822
00:57:08.205 --> 00:57:12.200
there are so many children who can
come to an unfortunate end.

823
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.900
You are a good mother
with good children.

824
00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.950
Thank you.

825
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:31.350
As for me, did you think that I wanted
to sell fish from the day I was born?

826
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:33.350
My mom sold fish.

827
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:38.200
From the time I was young, the smell
of fish clung so much to my body,

828
00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.050
I really disliked fish.

829
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.800
Unnie did?

830
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.800
Why are you being like that? I also
always wanted to live like a princess.

831
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.150
Don't I seem the type?

832
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.600
Until my husband passed away,

833
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.825
I was a woman who didn't
know anything but love.

834
00:58:00.025 --> 00:58:04.050
I thought Unnie was always
just a courageous woman.

835
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.775
Ay, I'm getting depressed.
This is depressing.

836
00:58:08.975 --> 00:58:12.150
Let's stop with this
talk and have a drink.

837
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:13.625
Drink up.

838
00:58:13.825 --> 00:58:15.100
Cheers!

839
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:24.500
There are other people who wronged us.

840
00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:31.150
Those who hurt my unnies,
I'm going to kill them all.

841
00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:35.650
Unnie, I'll get back at them for you.

842
00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:38.300
Of course, you will.

843
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:43.200
Our Madam needs to stop drinking.

844
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.850
What can we do?

845
00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.850
Because we're all so weak.

846
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.000
Well,
that's why we've gathered together.

847
00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:00.950
Ah... there is one revenge I want.

848
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
As we continue with our Avengers Club,

849
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:13.000
a revenge where you two
will fix your fates.

850
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.950
You guys will help me with this, right?

851
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.500
Yes.

852
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.200
Why is family so hard to deal with?

853
00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.000
That's because they are
so uselessly close to us,

854
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:44.500
like a thorn in your side.

855
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:51.000
I always thought that once I had a
family, I wouldn't want anything else.

856
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.150
Curse them.

857
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.550
Let's curse our family out some.

858
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.600
Just because they're family, it doesn't
mean we have to keep tolerating everything.

859
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:08.250
Occasionally, we have to plentifully
and satisfyingly curse them out.

860
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:14.150
We may not be able to do this in front
of others, but we can just between us.

861
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:18.350
But we can't curse out others.

862
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:27.400
Even if we do curse them, only I can.
Okay. Let's go. Let it out.

863
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.650
Baek Seo...

864
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:47.650
Baek Seo Yeon,

865
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.800
you bad kid.

866
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:55.950
How did I give birth and raise
you that you could do that to me?

867
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:59.550
How could you choose to
say such hateful words?

868
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.300
Baek Seo...

869
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.425
Baek Seo Jin!

870
01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:18.450
You bad brat!

871
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:21.750
Who told you that you could leave first?

872
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:27.025
If I want to meet you,
I can't even go to heaven.

873
01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:32.300
Who said you could take your own life?
You bad brat!

874
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.150
You can say more. Go on.

875
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.900
I'm done.

876
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:56.600
I think you need to learn
how to curse from me.

877
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.600
So follow me.

878
01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:06.450
"You $%&^*#"

879
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:11.800
Yah! You, jerk! You piece of trash.

880
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.150
Don't patronize me! I'm not an idiot.

881
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:20.000
There's a lot I can do.

882
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.750
I'll show you.
Just wait and see. You wait.

883
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:30.500
I'll show you. You just wait!
You're going to die!

884
01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:37.450
Jung Hye, our Madam here,
is closing out our lesson.

885
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:43.250
I'll bring more fruit.

886
01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:47.550
You don't have to.
We don't need to eat more.

887
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:49.600
Need the bathroom.

888
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.450
I...

889
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.100
I'm going to curse some more.

890
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.900
I'm not finished.

891
01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.000
I'm going to curse more, so wait for me.

892
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:05.800
Unnie, you can't go home just yet.

893
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.400
Understood.
So hurry up and use the bathroom.

894
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.350
Mi Sook, someone's at the door.

895
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.825
Is it Seo Yeon?

896
01:03:20.025 --> 01:03:22.300
I'll get the door.

897
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:40.400
Assholes! I'm going to kill you all!

898
01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:42.900
Ahh...

899
01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.400
Son of a...

900
01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:27.600
Next Episode Preview

901
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.400
We have to succeed in
this mission first, then I'll go.

902
01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.200
The three of you have important things to
discuss. At least, I have to help a little.

903
01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.800
For Mrs. Lee to prepare us food... Omo.

904
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.250
It's delicious, right?

905
01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:39.800
Hope you will sell many.

906
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.450
You should choose your friends well.

907
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:44.000
I really love the sauna.

908
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.625
Should I build it inside the house?
What kind of material will be good?

909
01:04:47.825 --> 01:04:51.250
Everyone looks like they want to use me.
No one really cares about me.

910
01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:52.950
Then why do you think I brought
him here if he has no use?

911
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:55.650
Do you have to use
your son's inheritance?

912
01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.400
Are you not confident?
