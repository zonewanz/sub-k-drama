1
00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:14.087
So your first love, Sa Jin Jin, is getting married to...

2
00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.288
your brother, Anthony, today?

3
00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.999
What a terrible coincidence.

4
00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.799
It's like the story of a cheap soap opera.

5
00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:23.999
Stop it. He's feeling bad as is.

6
00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.328
Don't cry because you're feeling bad.

7
00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:27.769
I'm okay.

8
00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.139
Really? Are you really okay?

9
00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:31.839
Of course, I'm not.

10
00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.678
Oh, dear. Don't be so sad.

11
00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.609
I'm not sad at all.

12
00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:39.818
It's not even real. "We got Married" is just a TV show.

13
00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.859
Thank you so much for coming all the way here...

14
00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.759
to celebrate their wedding.

15
00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.428
I'm Park Seul Gi, the host of this wedding and "We Got Married".

16
00:00:58.928 --> 00:00:59.969
All right.

17
00:01:00.238 --> 00:01:02.969
We'll now begin the wedding ceremony of...

18
00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.238
the groom, Anthony, and the bride, Sa Jin Jin.

19
00:01:07.678 --> 00:01:11.648
The bride and groom, please enter the hall.

20
00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.878
Please give them a big applause.

21
00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:22.219
I must say this is the wedding of the century.

22
00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.288
I can't take my eyes off the beautiful couple.

23
00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:29.398
Keep clapping until they reach the podium.

24
00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.598
Hello.

25
00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:38.639
- I'm really sorry. - It's fine.

26
00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.949
Let's greet your guests who are here to celebrate.

27
00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:47.178
Bride and groom, bow.

28
00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:11.769
(The sixth story: My girlfriend's wedding)

29
00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.208
I take Sa Jin Jin as my wife...

30
00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:21.549
and promise to create a warm and special time for us.

31
00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.919
I take Anthony as my husband...

32
00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:26.859
and promise to always take...

33
00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.759
the first step and smile for him.

34
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.789
Just look at how broad they are.

35
00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.629
They're endlessly broad.

36
00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.129
Anthony has amazingly broad shoulders.

37
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.769
Could you help me out?

38
00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:43.269
- You'll be my brother-in-law. - Do you want that?

39
00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.438
Yes, dear brother-in-law.

40
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.539
- I vow that... - I vow that...

41
00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:49.178
- I will stay with you forever. - I will stay with you forever.

42
00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:50.908
A round of applause, please.

43
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.479
You made a promise in front of all these witnesses.

44
00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.349
I hope that you never fight,

45
00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.088
stay happy, and never end up getting divorced.

46
00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:03.088
Kiss! Let the groom kiss the bride!

47
00:03:03.428 --> 00:03:04.588
No kissing.

48
00:03:04.588 --> 00:03:07.099
Kiss her! Kiss her.

49
00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.099
- Kiss her. Kiss her. - Kiss her. Kiss her.

50
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.238
- Kiss her. Kiss her. - Kiss her. Kiss her.

51
00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:16.139
- Kiss her. Kiss her. - Kiss her. Kiss her.

52
00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.908
Thank you, everyone.

53
00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:21.139
I guess that was the bride's friend.

54
00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.479
She gave us a lovely suggestion.

55
00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.218
How about we let Anthony...

56
00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.819
celebrate this special day...

57
00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.118
by kissing his lovely bride?

58
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.019
How about that?

59
00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.958
To live up to your support and demand,

60
00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.229
our handsome groom Anthony...

61
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.058
will now kiss...

62
00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:44.599
his beautiful bride!

63
00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.938
It's their first time, of course it's awkward. Everyone!

64
00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:54.609
- Kiss her. Kiss her. - Kiss her. Kiss her.

65
00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.678
- Kiss her. Kiss her. - Kiss her. Kiss her.

66
00:03:57.678 --> 00:03:59.979
- That's it. - Kiss her. Kiss her.

67
00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.148
They deserve some applause!

68
00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:05.419
There's no going back.

69
00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.789
The deal has been signed.

70
00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.129
I hope this is the beginning of a happy marriage.

71
00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.528
Let's all give them a warm hand.

72
00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.798
Congratulations.

73
00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.538
"A successful fan"?

74
00:04:25.168 --> 00:04:27.309
I sent them gifts when they were on a radio show,

75
00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.439
and they chose her instead?

76
00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.048
I bet Sa Jin Jin told them to post the photo.

77
00:04:33.278 --> 00:04:34.819
I bet he just couldn't refuse.

78
00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:38.989
My dear brother is just too polite.

79
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.429
What if Sa Jin Jin sees this and thinks he really like her?

80
00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:45.358
What if she flirts with him?

81
00:04:45.358 --> 00:04:47.929
She's a fan of your big brother.

82
00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:49.429
They should really start going out.

83
00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:51.629
Are you crazy? That can never happen.

84
00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:56.869
We refuse to be boring or average,

85
00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:59.309
so we prepared a special event.

86
00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:03.208
It's time to find the owner of the ring!

87
00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.408
Thank you.

88
00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.048
Before we begin,

89
00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.918
can the beautiful bride please turn around?

90
00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:18.228
This is all so nerve-wracking.

91
00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:19.689
Before the bride...

92
00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.199
are three men dressed in animal costumes.

93
00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:24.829
One is Anthony, the groom.

94
00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:27.538
One is Gong Ji Won, the groom's brother,

95
00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:30.108
and one is a member of our crew.

96
00:05:30.608 --> 00:05:34.179
The crucial hint are their hands.

97
00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.509
Jin Jin, you have to find your groom's hand...

98
00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.208
and put the ring on his finger.

99
00:05:39.348 --> 00:05:43.918
Can the three men hold out a hand?

100
00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:49.119
Jin Jin, step forward and find your man.

101
00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:56.298
- Is this possible? - It'll be too easy for her.

102
00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:58.869
How is that possible?

103
00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.009
Hands are smart, you know.

104
00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.408
- What? - You idiot.

105
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.939
Hands can talk.

106
00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:11.148
If you like someone, your hands flirt like crazy.

107
00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:13.848
Like a magnet's opposite poles pull each other,

108
00:06:13.848 --> 00:06:15.179
you just have to hold hands.

109
00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:17.348
Take your time and look thoroughly.

110
00:06:18.088 --> 00:06:20.119
Jin Jin's looking for her groom.

111
00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:23.129
Which of these hands belong to Anthony?

112
00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.158
Which is Anthony's?

113
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.798
No one knows the answer.

114
00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:34.939
Jin Jin's looking very hard...

115
00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.239
with her eyes wide open.

116
00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:39.639
Now we're onto the mongoose.

117
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:45.809
(Wedding of the century)

118
00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:49.079
You were sure you'd found him when you put the ring on.

119
00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:51.489
Yes, I was sure.

120
00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:54.958
There.

121
00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:58.889
A round of applause, everyone!

122
00:06:59.528 --> 00:07:01.199
Jin Jin put the ring on...

123
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.929
the hand of the pink bear.

124
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.769
Are you sure?

125
00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:08.398
Yes, I'm sure.

126
00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:11.009
Anthony has a spot on the back of his hand.

127
00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:14.139
He got it while playing with a mechanical pencil as a boy.

128
00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:18.048
Us Candies... Anthony's fans used to joke about...

129
00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:19.309
wanting to be reborn as...

130
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:21.949
the lead in that mechanical pencil.

131
00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:25.288
It's time to reveal who's wearing each mask.

132
00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:29.158
Can the pink bear please take off his mask?

133
00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.098
The pink bear was...

134
00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:41.369
Gong Ji Won, the groom's younger brother.

135
00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:46.009
Let's see who's wearing the other two outfits.

136
00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:47.838
- First, - That's odd.

137
00:07:47.838 --> 00:07:49.379
- let's see who the rabbit is. - That can't be.

138
00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:50.478
Who is it?

139
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:53.148
Please show yourself.

140
00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:58.019
The white rabbit was a member of our filming crew.

141
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:02.088
Then is the mongoose our groom?

142
00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:06.759
Mongoose, please take off your mask.

143
00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:11.699
Oh, dear.

144
00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:17.009
The mongoose turned out to be Anthony.

145
00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:18.939
What a pity.

146
00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:30.619
I must have lost my mind. What's wrong with me?

147
00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:33.288
Anthony's spot is on his right hand, and I checked their left hands.

148
00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:35.859
How could I have missed something like that?

149
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:39.629
Anthony must've been so upset.

150
00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:40.999
But he was smiling.

151
00:08:41.898 --> 00:08:45.269
Was he? How? Do you remember?

152
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:46.269
He grinned.

153
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:48.839
Without showing his teeth? With each corner at a 15-degree angle?

154
00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:50.739
I don't really remember.

155
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.068
I bet that was the smile you saw.

156
00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:55.808
That's his embarrassed smile.

157
00:08:56.308 --> 00:08:59.278
He has a 30-degree smile when he's happy,

158
00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:02.019
and when he's very happy, you can see his teeth.

159
00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:04.489
Anthony has such a great personality,

160
00:09:04.489 --> 00:09:06.219
he rarely gets angry.

161
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:08.989
How could she not know my hand?

162
00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:13.898
No, it can happen.

163
00:09:13.898 --> 00:09:16.129
Now I know my brother has a spot...

164
00:09:16.129 --> 00:09:17.568
on the back of his hand.

165
00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:20.369
Okay.

166
00:09:20.568 --> 00:09:23.239
Chul Min, I'll take the ring.

167
00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:25.938
- What? - You don't wear rings.

168
00:09:25.938 --> 00:09:27.678
You don't like accessories.

169
00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:30.678
I'll keep it and give it to you at the next shoot. Hand it over.

170
00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.278
No, I'll keep it.

171
00:09:34.249 --> 00:09:35.818
- Will you? - Yes.

172
00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:41.619
Han Ah Reum, get over here.

173
00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:46.759
Me? Why?

174
00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:50.298
You're so shameless. I don't believe you.

175
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.028
Don't you show remorse?

176
00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:55.739
I learned about morals and ethics...

177
00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:57.408
in school, you know.

178
00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:01.609
The person who wronged you was not me.

179
00:10:01.609 --> 00:10:03.209
Then who was it?

180
00:10:03.209 --> 00:10:06.009
I have so many different versions of me.

181
00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:07.219
Put it simply.

182
00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:09.048
I blame the alcohol.

183
00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:12.489
I can't help but lose my mind when I drink.

184
00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:14.859
Then don't drink.

185
00:10:14.859 --> 00:10:16.859
Or drink with someone.

186
00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:20.629
Ah Reum, do you even know what you did?

187
00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:23.398
Sorry. Sorry, sorry. I'm really sorry.

188
00:10:23.729 --> 00:10:25.869
I didn't think your lover would leave you.

189
00:10:25.869 --> 00:10:29.198
What nonsense are you talking about?

190
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:32.168
- What will you do about my car? - What?

191
00:10:32.808 --> 00:10:35.209
Were you talking about your car?

192
00:10:35.408 --> 00:10:36.808
I thought you were talking about something else.

193
00:10:37.548 --> 00:10:40.219
Something else? What something else?

194
00:10:40.219 --> 00:10:43.918
I washed my car, steamed the insides, and wiped it down.

195
00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:45.249
Do you know how many times I washed it?

196
00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:48.558
I'll pay you for it. I'll pay you double. Or triple.

197
00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:51.688
Wait, why do you sound like you're not sorry?

198
00:10:51.688 --> 00:10:54.928
Will you just say it only once?

199
00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:58.898
Oh, right. I'll set you up on a date.

200
00:11:01.469 --> 00:11:04.038
- A date? - I'll keep doing that...

201
00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:05.808
until you find someone you like.

202
00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:07.639
As an apology.

203
00:11:09.438 --> 00:11:10.448
Really?

204
00:11:10.548 --> 00:11:12.048
Why? Don't you want it?

205
00:11:14.178 --> 00:11:15.278
When?

206
00:11:15.349 --> 00:11:17.349
That wasn't an easy scene,

207
00:11:17.349 --> 00:11:19.719
but it went very well.

208
00:11:20.058 --> 00:11:22.158
Great job today, you two.

209
00:11:22.158 --> 00:11:24.328
You do know that the press conference is next week, right?

210
00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:27.959
Keep this a secret even if reporters call you.

211
00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:29.028
- Sure. - Okay.

212
00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:33.599
Anyway, you two look too awkward for people who just had a wedding.

213
00:11:34.438 --> 00:11:36.739
You two haven't had a drink yet, have you?

214
00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:38.839
Not yet.

215
00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:42.609
The weather is too great for two beautiful people to go home.

216
00:11:43.178 --> 00:11:44.709
I have something planned tonight.

217
00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:47.678
Jin Jin.

218
00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:49.418
Gosh, this is good.

219
00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:53.658
Keep it going, okay? I'll see you next week.

220
00:11:53.818 --> 00:11:55.759
- Great job today. - Great job.

221
00:11:58.459 --> 00:11:59.688
Well...

222
00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:04.229
- Never mind. - It's not that.

223
00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:07.369
I didn't want to burden you. Don't worry about it.

224
00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:08.839
No, it's not that.

225
00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.308
It's 010-5982...

226
00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:28.058
It's fine.

227
00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:29.688
1023.

228
00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:40.538
He might not think it's his birthday.

229
00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:43.938
He might think it's just a coincidence.

230
00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:46.068
He's not an idiot.

231
00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:49.808
He probably thought I was too much, right?

232
00:12:49.808 --> 00:12:53.778
I'm sure he was happy. He's probably telling everyone he has your number.

233
00:12:54.719 --> 00:12:56.589
I'm sure he'll text you soon.

234
00:12:58.219 --> 00:12:59.249
"Are you asleep?"

235
00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:02.719
Hey, come on. He would never do that.

236
00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:05.259
He's a busy man.

237
00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:07.658
Goodness, you're doing that again.

238
00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:10.499
Hey, your current social position is so much better...

239
00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:12.428
than anyone else right now.

240
00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:13.938
But why do you always...

241
00:13:14.068 --> 00:13:16.969
play the underdog with a former idol star who's forgotten?

242
00:13:16.969 --> 00:13:19.139
That's simpler than a times table.

243
00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:21.778
He's a star, and I'm a fan.

244
00:13:21.808 --> 00:13:23.908
Let's just say that you're right.

245
00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:25.609
That's not what's important.

246
00:13:26.648 --> 00:13:28.019
Then what's important?

247
00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:29.619
We need to get things straight.

248
00:13:31.788 --> 00:13:34.019
Why isn't Ji Won here yet?

249
00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:40.599
Tyson will definitely win.

250
00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:42.328
No, Bruce Lee will.

251
00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:44.599
Don't you know Mike Tyson, the nuclear punch?

252
00:13:44.599 --> 00:13:49.239
His neck size was 20in, and weighed at least 40kg more than Bruce Lee.

253
00:13:49.568 --> 00:13:51.568
He's probably five weight divisions above him.

254
00:13:51.568 --> 00:13:53.239
Weight divisions aren't important.

255
00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:55.709
Bruce Lee's punches are 1.5 times stronger than Tyson's,

256
00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.648
and he can punch five times in a second.

257
00:13:57.709 --> 00:13:59.749
He's so fast that cameras can't catch him.

258
00:14:00.078 --> 00:14:02.979
- Bruce has muscles within muscles, - Muscles within muscles,

259
00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:04.548
and more muscles in those muscles.

260
00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:07.489
Exactly. That's what you call a man who's 100 percent muscular,

261
00:14:08.318 --> 00:14:09.418
like me.

262
00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:14.499
Tyson was the first heavyweight champion who won...

263
00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:17.469
all three leagues, WBA, WBC, and IBF.

264
00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:19.698
Ji Won, don't you know about Bruce Lee's lethal moves?

265
00:14:19.969 --> 00:14:21.568
What? Nunchucks?

266
00:14:21.568 --> 00:14:23.668
No, hitting vital points.

267
00:14:23.668 --> 00:14:26.139
Eyes, middle of the forehead, neck, solar plexus, temples,

268
00:14:26.168 --> 00:14:27.239
and...

269
00:14:28.038 --> 00:14:29.139
that part.

270
00:14:31.578 --> 00:14:32.578
I lost.

271
00:14:40.719 --> 00:14:42.959
Gosh, it'd be great if you could stop by.

272
00:14:43.328 --> 00:14:45.028
Next time, I won't let you off.

273
00:14:45.028 --> 00:14:46.828
Fine, thanks for today.

274
00:14:46.828 --> 00:14:48.629
Don't mention it. Bye.

275
00:14:52.599 --> 00:14:53.639
Ji Won.

276
00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:59.038
Was Jin Jin the friend whom you said lives upstairs?

277
00:15:03.249 --> 00:15:04.979
I was going to tell you.

278
00:15:09.448 --> 00:15:12.948
I was planning a surprise meeting.

279
00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:16.158
Jin Jin has been your fan for a very long time,

280
00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:18.889
and I've seen how much she likes you.

281
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:21.298
I thought she'd be happy,

282
00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:24.198
so I've been planning a surprise.

283
00:15:25.198 --> 00:15:26.298
I see.

284
00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:30.469
Anyway, I'll arrange something very soon.

285
00:15:30.469 --> 00:15:32.469
When we all meet next time, it won't be work-related.

286
00:15:32.469 --> 00:15:34.109
Let's all meet up comfortably, okay?

287
00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:35.379
Okay.

288
00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:36.749
Bye.

289
00:15:37.148 --> 00:15:38.349
Hold on, Ji Won.

290
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:40.578
Haven't you...

291
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.219
ever thought Jin Jin was pretty?

292
00:15:46.048 --> 00:15:47.959
What are you talking about?

293
00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:51.259
We've been friends since when we were babies.

294
00:15:52.828 --> 00:15:54.528
- Just go. - Okay.

295
00:16:03.552 --> 00:16:06.784
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E11 20th Century Boy & Girl "My Friend's Wedding"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

296
00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:15.119
One more time, okay?

297
00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:18.489
Ji Won, get a hold of yourself and try again.

298
00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:19.959
Good boy.

299
00:16:22.619 --> 00:16:24.729
Jin Jin is married, so she's out of the question.

300
00:16:34.239 --> 00:16:35.269
I choose...

301
00:16:38.869 --> 00:16:39.979
Young Shim.

302
00:16:45.849 --> 00:16:48.078
Why? Why her?

303
00:16:48.178 --> 00:16:50.089
Yes, I'm curious too.

304
00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:52.288
She's cute.

305
00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:55.918
That's complete nonsense.

306
00:16:56.188 --> 00:16:58.629
You're only after money and power, you materialistic jerk.

307
00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:07.469
Hey! I don't like you either.

308
00:17:08.138 --> 00:17:09.669
You're too scrawny.

309
00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:23.449
Oh, right.

310
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:25.548
There were a lot of cameras and crew members,

311
00:17:25.548 --> 00:17:27.019
and it really wasn't scripted.

312
00:17:27.519 --> 00:17:30.259
How do you not get intimidated by all that?

313
00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:31.588
Did you take Xanax?

314
00:17:31.689 --> 00:17:33.858
Man, I really came to respect you.

315
00:17:36.199 --> 00:17:37.298
Jin Jin.

316
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:40.298
I was at your wedding. Can't you at least thank me?

317
00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:13.399
Thanks.

318
00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:17.038
And thanks for coming today.

319
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:21.709
- Thanks to you, I had fun. - I had fun too.

320
00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:26.679
Wasn't my brother really handsome today?

321
00:18:31.189 --> 00:18:33.189
Why? Wasn't he?

322
00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:37.128
- Of course he was. - You don't seem too excited.

323
00:18:39.689 --> 00:18:43.528
Oh, I heard women sometimes get that marriage blue.

324
00:18:45.128 --> 00:18:46.469
Is that why?

325
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:50.808
What is it?

326
00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:53.038
What's wrong?

327
00:18:55.078 --> 00:18:56.378
Why didn't you tell me?

328
00:18:57.909 --> 00:19:01.249
Why didn't you tell me your brother was Anthony?

329
00:19:05.788 --> 00:19:08.019
For a more dramatic effect?

330
00:19:10.229 --> 00:19:11.459
If you're meant to be,

331
00:19:12.528 --> 00:19:14.058
you two will end up meeting.

332
00:19:15.798 --> 00:19:16.969
Thanks a lot.

333
00:19:22.399 --> 00:19:25.169
Right? Everything's great if it all works out.

334
00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:27.878
I mean, your wish came true. Aren't you happy?

335
00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:30.608
Yes, I am.

336
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:34.019
Okay.

337
00:19:35.078 --> 00:19:37.318
If you're happy, then I'm happy.

338
00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:40.249
She came by so many times today.

339
00:20:41.749 --> 00:20:44.848
She couldn't wait a second before she pierced my heart.

340
00:20:46.489 --> 00:20:48.519
She's even there when the clouds pass me by.

341
00:20:50.888 --> 00:20:53.358
She suddenly appeared in my peaceful life,

342
00:20:54.058 --> 00:20:56.628
and got a hold of me so that I can't move an inch.

343
00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:00.739
Why does she keep appearing before me?

344
00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:05.808
Hello, I'm Jeong Ji Yeong, the host of "With You Tonight".

345
00:21:06.878 --> 00:21:10.078
It seems like this person, JJ, has a guest in his heart.

346
00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:14.318
Are you curious about the reason for this stranger's visit?

347
00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:16.949
If that's the case,

348
00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:19.318
why don't you listen carefully...

349
00:21:20.058 --> 00:21:22.788
to what your heart says?

350
00:21:25.388 --> 00:21:26.858
Sometimes,

351
00:21:26.858 --> 00:21:30.098
your ears can see through the heart better than your eyes.

352
00:21:30.098 --> 00:21:33.269
It's what Chang said in the movie, "Happy Together".

353
00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:48.219
Jin Jin, come out for breakfast.

354
00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:50.048
I'm not eating.

355
00:21:50.949 --> 00:21:52.048
Suit yourself.

356
00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.588
What's wrong with this?

357
00:22:04.499 --> 00:22:05.868
She won't have breakfast.

358
00:22:06.469 --> 00:22:08.298
- Why not? - I don't know.

359
00:22:08.499 --> 00:22:11.709
I thought it was strange how she didn't skip breakfast lately.

360
00:22:11.969 --> 00:22:14.409
She'd never had breakfast,

361
00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:16.848
so I thought it was because the autumn came.

362
00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:19.778
She had so little too.

363
00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:23.588
She didn't look so good last night.

364
00:22:23.588 --> 00:22:26.048
Why don't we feed her some herbal tonics?

365
00:22:26.048 --> 00:22:29.519
She wouldn't drink it even if we get her those.

366
00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:32.328
How could you two worry about her eating habits...

367
00:22:32.328 --> 00:22:34.058
every day throughout the year?

368
00:22:34.429 --> 00:22:36.598
Don't worry. She's feeding herself just fine.

369
00:22:37.128 --> 00:22:38.328
Give me some rice too.

370
00:22:38.328 --> 00:22:40.098
- What? - Goodness.

371
00:22:42.038 --> 00:22:43.269
Good morning.

372
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:46.239
Did you sleep well? You look good.

373
00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:47.479
I had a sound sleep.

374
00:22:48.439 --> 00:22:49.778
Did you get hurt?

375
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.179
I got hurt a little while exercising.

376
00:22:53.179 --> 00:22:55.979
Goodness. There's an orthopedics in the intersection.

377
00:22:55.979 --> 00:22:57.489
Go get it treated.

378
00:22:57.489 --> 00:22:59.489
- Hurry, Mom. I'm hungry. - Okay.

379
00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:04.088
Do you have any good news?

380
00:23:04.788 --> 00:23:06.058
You're so quick-witted.

381
00:23:07.098 --> 00:23:08.699
I began working again.

382
00:23:08.828 --> 00:23:10.769
Really? What is it?

383
00:23:10.899 --> 00:23:13.028
Is it a drama or movie?

384
00:23:13.699 --> 00:23:16.399
It's a variety show. You know "We Got Married"?

385
00:23:17.808 --> 00:23:20.909
Isn't it about having a fake marriage life?

386
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:23.409
Yes, I held my wedding ceremony yesterday too.

387
00:23:24.009 --> 00:23:26.519
Why would you take that?

388
00:23:26.878 --> 00:23:29.888
Won't it work as a disadvantage for your real marriage?

389
00:23:30.548 --> 00:23:31.618
Don't worry.

390
00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:35.058
It's a fake marriage, so people won't think it's real. It's okay.

391
00:23:35.058 --> 00:23:37.588
Of course, it's all right.

392
00:23:37.788 --> 00:23:40.199
I'm glad to hear that my daughter got married...

393
00:23:40.199 --> 00:23:41.558
even if it's fake.

394
00:23:42.058 --> 00:23:44.628
Who's your partner?

395
00:23:44.628 --> 00:23:46.899
- You must have a husband. - Anthony.

396
00:23:47.098 --> 00:23:48.399
My husband is Anthony.

397
00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:51.769
- Your brother? - Yes.

398
00:23:51.769 --> 00:23:54.409
Gosh, how did that happen?

399
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:57.348
He's the singer whom she liked so much.

400
00:23:57.348 --> 00:23:58.949
The one who looks stupid?

401
00:24:02.548 --> 00:24:05.949
Your dad has such bad eyes for people.

402
00:24:05.949 --> 00:24:08.558
He's gentle and good-looking.

403
00:24:08.558 --> 00:24:09.759
I like him.

404
00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:13.528
He looks so genuine and reliable.

405
00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:16.528
Bring him home some time.

406
00:24:16.528 --> 00:24:18.729
They do that stuff in the show.

407
00:24:18.729 --> 00:24:21.899
Are you crazy? No, that's never going to happen.

408
00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:23.638
She's right. It's not necessary.

409
00:24:23.969 --> 00:24:25.769
They're not married for real either.

410
00:24:25.769 --> 00:24:27.838
Don't invite just anyone in the house.

411
00:24:27.838 --> 00:24:29.638
Invite only her real partner.

412
00:24:29.638 --> 00:24:32.878
It's no use being so protective of your daughter.

413
00:24:33.278 --> 00:24:35.048
You know well already.

414
00:24:35.419 --> 00:24:38.888
She'll put us aside once she finds her life partner anyway.

415
00:24:39.749 --> 00:24:41.388
Bring your brother here someday.

416
00:24:41.388 --> 00:24:43.489
I wanted to treat him to a meal...

417
00:24:43.489 --> 00:24:45.828
after hearing the story from Kwang Hee.

418
00:24:46.128 --> 00:24:48.298
- That'd be nice. - Okay.

419
00:25:02.638 --> 00:25:04.509
- Anthony likes Korean food, right? - Right.

420
00:25:05.249 --> 00:25:06.878
He especially likes meat.

421
00:25:07.078 --> 00:25:09.449
- Pork or beef? - Chicken.

422
00:25:09.578 --> 00:25:10.888
But he hates eggs.

423
00:25:11.649 --> 00:25:14.888
Right, right. He can't eat spicy food either, can he?

424
00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:16.489
No. His taste is like that of a child.

425
00:25:16.489 --> 00:25:18.259
But he loves green onion kimchi.

426
00:25:19.259 --> 00:25:20.558
Then...

427
00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:23.999
For today's dinner, let's make non-spicy chicken as the main dish,

428
00:25:23.999 --> 00:25:26.699
other Korean dishes without eggs, and green onion kimchi.

429
00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:28.669
- What? - He's coming for dinner.

430
00:25:28.939 --> 00:25:30.108
What?

431
00:25:30.469 --> 00:25:33.179
What's wrong? Your mom said she wanted to cook for him.

432
00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:35.439
You said you have no work today, so I told him to come.

433
00:25:35.439 --> 00:25:37.278
I have a photoshoot today.

434
00:25:37.449 --> 00:25:40.249
Oh, right. And I have a meeting with Director Choi too.

435
00:25:40.249 --> 00:25:41.848
I'm so busy today.

436
00:25:41.848 --> 00:25:44.519
Gosh, it can't be helped then.

437
00:25:44.818 --> 00:25:47.019
I guess we have to eat dinner without you today.

438
00:25:47.288 --> 00:25:50.229
He can come again next time, so don't be too disappointed.

439
00:25:55.499 --> 00:25:58.298
Are you insane? You must be crazy.

440
00:25:58.298 --> 00:26:00.939
Why would he visit my house? Does he want to come?

441
00:26:01.439 --> 00:26:03.098
You told him to come, right?

442
00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:05.138
Did you tell him that I'll be home?

443
00:26:05.138 --> 00:26:06.979
Did you ask him to meet together with me?

444
00:26:08.409 --> 00:26:10.449
My mom might ask him so many things.

445
00:26:10.449 --> 00:26:12.009
The house is messy too.

446
00:26:12.509 --> 00:26:14.278
Will we be able to paper the walls before dinner?

447
00:26:16.118 --> 00:26:18.788
Call him and cancel the dinner in a careful way, so he doesn't get hurt.

448
00:26:18.788 --> 00:26:20.888
Wait, no. He'll feel uncomfortable then.

449
00:26:21.588 --> 00:26:23.659
Gosh, why on earth did you do that?

450
00:26:23.659 --> 00:26:27.028
Are you insane? Did you hurt your head along with your wrist?

451
00:26:28.028 --> 00:26:29.628
No, that's not it.

452
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:32.969
By the way, do you know this song?

453
00:26:33.939 --> 00:26:36.368
I'm so sorry, but I love you

454
00:26:36.368 --> 00:26:37.808
It was all a lie

455
00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:41.239
Hey!

456
00:26:50.189 --> 00:26:53.888
Your grandson is Ham Jong Hwa who was born in 2000, right?

457
00:26:55.118 --> 00:26:58.388
He might get released soon if you settle the case.

458
00:26:58.388 --> 00:27:00.328
So you need to prepare for settlement money first.

459
00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:03.598
Are you talking about money?

460
00:27:03.598 --> 00:27:05.598
It's 5,400 dollars in total.

461
00:27:05.769 --> 00:27:07.469
What if I can't prepare that money?

462
00:27:07.939 --> 00:27:11.068
It will be sent as a juvenile protection case...

463
00:27:11.068 --> 00:27:13.338
or a criminal case.

464
00:27:13.479 --> 00:27:15.808
He was put in the detention center, so he's likely to be indicted.

465
00:27:15.808 --> 00:27:17.278
The case will be taken to court.

466
00:27:17.278 --> 00:27:19.608
If you can't reach a settlement, it'll lead to a trial on appeal.

467
00:27:19.608 --> 00:27:21.348
So what's going to happen?

468
00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:23.318
Like I told you,

469
00:27:23.318 --> 00:27:26.348
it will be progressed as a juvenile protection case or a criminal case.

470
00:27:26.348 --> 00:27:29.519
So what is going to happen? I don't understand.

471
00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:32.659
You call yourself a law expert, but all you talk about is nonsense.

472
00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:35.499
Is it that hard to say things in an easier way?

473
00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:38.298
Can't you make it easy to understand?

474
00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:54.078
My goodness.

475
00:27:54.078 --> 00:27:56.548
He looks so much like his dad.

476
00:27:57.189 --> 00:27:58.189
What is it about?

477
00:27:58.189 --> 00:28:00.189
My friend, Hyung Geun's youngest child...

478
00:28:00.618 --> 00:28:02.959
gave birth to a son recently.

479
00:28:04.128 --> 00:28:07.999
I saw her son-in-law at the wedding, and he was so handsome.

480
00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:11.969
This baby looks exactly like the baby-version of his dad.

481
00:28:11.969 --> 00:28:13.838
He's so good-looking already.

482
00:28:13.838 --> 00:28:16.098
Hey, check this out.

483
00:28:17.009 --> 00:28:18.239
Goodness.

484
00:28:18.368 --> 00:28:19.878
Your friend thinks he's cute because he's her grandson.

485
00:28:19.878 --> 00:28:22.679
Why would she send pictures to others too?

486
00:28:23.078 --> 00:28:24.878
All the babies look the same to me.

487
00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:26.749
Why would she send those pictures? It's annoying.

488
00:28:27.078 --> 00:28:28.519
I just don't understand.

489
00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:30.548
I don't understand you.

490
00:28:30.788 --> 00:28:33.088
Look how much fat you have here.

491
00:28:33.088 --> 00:28:36.288
And you don't feel guilty to eat all that food?

492
00:28:36.788 --> 00:28:39.328
Mom. You're hurting my feelings.

493
00:28:39.328 --> 00:28:40.999
I'm just eating before I go to work.

494
00:28:41.528 --> 00:28:44.429
If you get married and give a birth,

495
00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:46.798
I'll do all the feeding and raising.

496
00:28:46.798 --> 00:28:49.239
So please lose weight...

497
00:28:49.239 --> 00:28:51.269
and get married already.

498
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:53.808
Let me hold an adorable grandchild in my arms.

499
00:28:54.838 --> 00:28:55.909
Mom.

500
00:28:56.108 --> 00:28:59.509
It's meaningless to get married in this society.

501
00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:01.378
While we're at it,

502
00:29:01.578 --> 00:29:05.519
let me declare to stay single throughout my life.

503
00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:07.019
What do you mean?

504
00:29:07.558 --> 00:29:08.919
I won't get married.

505
00:29:09.419 --> 00:29:11.328
It's not that I can't. I choose not to.

506
00:29:11.328 --> 00:29:13.229
- I choose not to get married. - What?

507
00:29:14.699 --> 00:29:17.098
You know I do my job properly.

508
00:29:17.098 --> 00:29:19.899
I feel satisfied only if I'm in charge of...

509
00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:21.138
casting and everything else.

510
00:29:21.138 --> 00:29:23.739
Okay, but keep this in mind.

511
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:25.838
Make sure she's not in a low level.

512
00:29:25.838 --> 00:29:28.939
Hey. It's Air Force One.

513
00:29:29.378 --> 00:29:30.378
Air Force One?

514
00:29:30.378 --> 00:29:33.009
Yes, she's the flight attendant for the president's private plane.

515
00:29:33.749 --> 00:29:36.019
- Okay. - Are you ready?

516
00:29:36.019 --> 00:29:38.588
Are you ready?

517
00:29:38.919 --> 00:29:40.388
- Shall we clink our glasses? - Sure.

518
00:29:44.558 --> 00:29:46.798
- So you work for Air Force One? - Yes.

519
00:29:59.209 --> 00:30:00.909
- Go in first. - Okay.

520
00:30:02.239 --> 00:30:04.649
She isn't my type of girl. I need another blind date.

521
00:30:06.378 --> 00:30:07.649
She models for our company.

522
00:30:07.649 --> 00:30:09.989
You know, right? She's like the face of our company.

523
00:30:10.689 --> 00:30:13.358
This restaurant is famous for its potato soup.

524
00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:16.659
I knew you'd use a fork.

525
00:30:20.729 --> 00:30:24.669
She's clumsy. She's way too clumsy.

526
00:30:24.699 --> 00:30:26.199
- I can't stand her eating. - Goodness.

527
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:27.298
- I need another blind date. - Goodness.

528
00:30:29.169 --> 00:30:31.769
He's too picky.

529
00:30:32.808 --> 00:30:35.778
Her ex-boyfriend is Kim Min Woo, the major leaguer.

530
00:30:35.778 --> 00:30:38.808
Before then, she dated Kim Young Hwa, the son of Wonhee Group.

531
00:30:42.449 --> 00:30:43.989
Goodness.

532
00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:46.618
She is so gluttonous.

533
00:30:47.118 --> 00:30:48.358
I need another blind date.

534
00:30:52.828 --> 00:30:54.128
The ring.

535
00:30:54.858 --> 00:30:58.068
Yes, the wedding ring for "We Got Married". It's nowhere to be found.

536
00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:01.538
I need it for the shooting. What should I do?

537
00:31:02.499 --> 00:31:05.409
You want black coffee with an extra shot?

538
00:31:05.409 --> 00:31:08.409
Yes, I'd be grateful.

539
00:31:09.608 --> 00:31:10.679
Thank you.

540
00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:13.749
It's all done.

541
00:31:24.408 --> 00:31:26.508
(Episode 12 will air shortly.)
