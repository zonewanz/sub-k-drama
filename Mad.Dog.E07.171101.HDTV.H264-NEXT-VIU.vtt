(All characters, organizations, locations,)

00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:08.515
(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:17.043 --> 00:00:18.212
Bum Joon?

4
00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:22.712
Mr. Shin.

5
00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:26.552
Mr. Shin.

6
00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:28.653
Mr. Shin.

7
00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:29.923
Mr. Shin.

8
00:00:30.223 --> 00:00:32.893
The assistant pilot crashed the plane?

9
00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:35.263
No, don't lower it. You pulled it up.

10
00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:36.693
You pulled it for certain.

11
00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:38.302
I lied.

12
00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:43.802
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:45.903
You pulled it up.

14
00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.473
You tried to fly the plane back up.

15
00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:50.272
You did.

16
00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.213
You pulled up...

17
00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:54.312
the control wheel.

18
00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:58.022
(October 11, 2015)

19
00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:08.392
Juhan Air flight 801, you may approach.

20
00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:10.592
Report back when you see the runway.

21
00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:14.672
(October 11, 2015, 11:33am)

22
00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:24.883
Mr. Shin, wake up.

23
00:01:24.942 --> 00:01:25.942
Mr. Shin!

24
00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:40.963
What's going on?

25
00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:42.862
It'll be all right.

26
00:01:50.303 --> 00:01:51.303
Mr. Shin.

27
00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:53.373
Mr. Shin, wake up!

28
00:01:53.873 --> 00:01:55.373
Mayday, mayday.

29
00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:56.743
Jeju Tower approach!

30
00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:58.183
Jeju Tower, come in.

31
00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:03.582
Oh, no!

32
00:02:03.713 --> 00:02:04.722
No!

33
00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:06.323
- No! - Are we crashing?

34
00:02:06.952 --> 00:02:07.952
My goodness.

35
00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:10.722
Put this on.

36
00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:12.592
What's going on?

37
00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:15.833
Oh, goodness!

38
00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:17.833
What is this?

39
00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:20.233
What are we going to do?

40
00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:24.803
Squawk 7700.

41
00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:25.842
Mayday!

42
00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:27.942
JH 801, Acknowledge!

43
00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:30.213
There's no wind, let alone any turbulence.

44
00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:32.512
Go ahead, JH 801.

45
00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:34.053
Low altitude alert!

46
00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.483
Mayday. Mayday, mayday!

47
00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:41.322
Jeju Tower approach. Mayday!

48
00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:44.092
JH 801, contact Jeju control!

49
00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:45.463
I can't reach them.

50
00:02:45.463 --> 00:02:46.523
It's slowing down.

51
00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:49.162
Pull up. Go around!

52
00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:51.933
Pull up.

53
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:55.032
Pull up!

54
00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:58.173
Pull up!

55
00:03:13.282 --> 00:03:14.592
He didn't lower it.

56
00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:19.722
He didn't lower it.

57
00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:49.923
Hey, you can't drive now.

58
00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:51.393
Kang Woo!

59
00:03:51.923 --> 00:03:53.493
Move aside, you jerk!

60
00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:32.062
You've been smoking, right?

61
00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:35.803
Me?

62
00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:42.442
It's not like I smoke because I want to.

63
00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:44.142
I'm smoking against my will...

64
00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:45.283
to make a living for you and Ju Won.

65
00:04:46.613 --> 00:04:47.613
What?

66
00:04:51.683 --> 00:04:52.683
Listen.

67
00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:55.593
Do you remember the car cut-off frauds...

68
00:04:55.593 --> 00:04:58.093
which our team has been after for months?

69
00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:02.062
We happened to spot them planning another scheme...

70
00:05:02.062 --> 00:05:04.933
at a grilled tripe place yesterday.

71
00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:05.962
So?

72
00:05:06.803 --> 00:05:08.202
We got a table next to them,

73
00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:10.402
pretending like we're customers.

74
00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:12.243
Then we grabbed a drink...

75
00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:13.873
saying stuff about car insurance,

76
00:05:13.873 --> 00:05:16.312
trying to sound like insurance con artists.

77
00:05:16.873 --> 00:05:18.512
That's when...

78
00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:21.113
they started to talk to us.

79
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:22.483
Then we started pouring drinks for them,

80
00:05:22.483 --> 00:05:24.183
and when they got drunk,

81
00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:26.152
they even asked our new kid, Jae Soo...

82
00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:27.892
about how much he earns.

83
00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:29.093
They even offered him a spot...

84
00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:30.892
in case we don't treat him right,

85
00:05:30.892 --> 00:05:34.033
and told us all about their schemes.

86
00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.233
We got all of that on a recording.

87
00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:39.233
And you couldn't help but smoke at that time.

88
00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:40.233
Exactly.

89
00:05:40.533 --> 00:05:42.933
I really didn't want to smoke.

90
00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:45.772
You only got better at lying...

91
00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:47.942
after you started working as a claims examiner.

92
00:05:51.382 --> 00:05:54.353
I really didn't want to smoke.

93
00:05:55.183 --> 00:05:56.252
You overwork every day,

94
00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:57.382
sleep in a car,

95
00:05:57.382 --> 00:05:58.882
drink, and smoke.

96
00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:00.283
What if something happens to you,

97
00:06:00.283 --> 00:06:01.923
and you end up leaving us behind?

98
00:06:02.093 --> 00:06:03.493
Nothing will happen to me.

99
00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:04.562
Goodness.

100
00:06:07.022 --> 00:06:09.332
Will you please quit smoking?

101
00:06:10.062 --> 00:06:13.433
All right. I get it.

102
00:06:13.762 --> 00:06:16.902
That's my lifelong desire, Mr. Choi.

103
00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:29.252
We're almost there, Mr. Park.

104
00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:30.923
Yes.

105
00:06:31.322 --> 00:06:32.483
Are you saying...

106
00:06:32.483 --> 00:06:34.593
he didn't crash the plane on purpose?

107
00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:36.353
Ms. Jang,

108
00:06:36.752 --> 00:06:38.723
do you understand what Mr. Park said?

109
00:06:38.962 --> 00:06:41.363
Wasn't that text message from Bum Joon weird?

110
00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:44.702
Someone who's planning a suicide won't say that.

111
00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:48.373
That's true, but...

112
00:06:58.712 --> 00:07:00.413
Let's stay here for a bit.

113
00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:40.382
Hey, Min Joon.

114
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.752
Aren't you going to say goodbye to your brother?

115
00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:44.522
Have a good trip or whatever.

116
00:07:44.562 --> 00:07:46.123
Aren't you going to call me your brother?

117
00:07:46.663 --> 00:07:48.462
We're now even living together here.

118
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.163
I don't have a brother.

119
00:07:53.762 --> 00:07:55.033
I don't have anyone like that.

120
00:07:56.132 --> 00:07:58.702
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

121
00:07:59.373 --> 00:08:00.502
I don't want to hear that.

122
00:08:01.212 --> 00:08:03.873
Next time, call me your brother,

123
00:08:03.873 --> 00:08:04.913
okay?

124
00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:21.863
Bum Joon.

125
00:08:37.713 --> 00:08:38.782
Who was it?

126
00:08:41.182 --> 00:08:43.813
Who made you bear false witness?

127
00:08:46.483 --> 00:08:47.623
Whoever it was...

128
00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:50.993
I'll...

129
00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:54.262
I'll...

130
00:09:14.752 --> 00:09:15.782
What are you doing?

131
00:09:15.983 --> 00:09:17.282
Let's go to the office.

132
00:09:18.022 --> 00:09:19.022
Nice car.

133
00:09:19.022 --> 00:09:20.152
How many cars do you have?

134
00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:22.353
Let me drive it.

135
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.422
Ms. Jang.

136
00:09:32.063 --> 00:09:34.373
You're a good driver, Ms. Jang.

137
00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:36.733
My dad ran a car center.

138
00:09:36.932 --> 00:09:38.103
Car center?

139
00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:40.272
- Auto repair shop. - I see.

140
00:09:41.473 --> 00:09:43.672
He doesn't run it anymore?

141
00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:46.483
Don't try to dig up my past.

142
00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.152
I want to know your past.

143
00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:50.723
My past? What past?

144
00:09:50.922 --> 00:09:52.382
Did you come all the way here...

145
00:09:52.382 --> 00:09:53.782
because of the text message?

146
00:09:57.823 --> 00:09:59.022
A person planning to commit suicide...

147
00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:02.392
wouldn't send that kind of message for sure.

148
00:10:03.733 --> 00:10:06.302
Did you hack the USIM chip I threw away?

149
00:10:07.132 --> 00:10:09.002
Mad Dog's gone too far.

150
00:10:11.672 --> 00:10:12.672
What?

151
00:10:13.802 --> 00:10:15.873
I heard your brother didn't commit suicide.

152
00:10:16.272 --> 00:10:18.282
Your brother didn't crash the plane.

153
00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:20.012
But you're too calm.

154
00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:22.113
He didn't commit suicide?

155
00:10:22.882 --> 00:10:24.422
Did Mr. Choi tell you that?

156
00:10:25.052 --> 00:10:27.593
Great. Do you trust me now?

157
00:10:27.993 --> 00:10:29.022
How can you be laughing?

158
00:10:29.022 --> 00:10:30.693
Should I be crying then?

159
00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:33.262
It's nothing to cry about.

160
00:10:46.272 --> 00:10:47.943
Lee Mi Ran was alive,

161
00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:49.813
and Ko Jin Chul killed her?

162
00:10:50.272 --> 00:10:51.343
Do you have evidence?

163
00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:53.512
How did you find Shin Ji Woong?

164
00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.022
You were right.

165
00:11:00.123 --> 00:11:01.693
Two years ago in Yeongwol. 5.1 million dollars.

166
00:11:02.693 --> 00:11:04.993
Han Dong Yoon who lent his license...

167
00:11:04.993 --> 00:11:06.792
is now the director of Hansaeng Hospital.

168
00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:08.833
He laid low after getting fined.

169
00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:10.193
But now he switched over to Hansaeng Hospital.

170
00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:13.363
This time, he claimed Taeyang almost 2 million.

171
00:11:13.703 --> 00:11:15.502
The upper management told me to pay it out.

172
00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:17.573
Who gave that order?

173
00:11:17.573 --> 00:11:18.603
I don't know.

174
00:11:19.443 --> 00:11:22.042
Director Cha has the final approval of this one.

175
00:11:22.512 --> 00:11:23.772
But cases like this usually gets...

176
00:11:23.772 --> 00:11:25.012
Chairman Cha's approval.

177
00:11:25.012 --> 00:11:26.182
Normally we don't deal with...

178
00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:27.243
something like this as you know.

179
00:11:28.113 --> 00:11:30.313
But the files came to Claims Examination Team...

180
00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:32.152
since Hansaeng Hospital is a new hospital.

181
00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:34.052
Hey.

182
00:11:34.552 --> 00:11:37.392
I've been loyal to my company for 16 years,

183
00:11:37.623 --> 00:11:39.363
but I'm a claims examiner to my bones.

184
00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:41.762
Giving two million dollars to a repeat offender...

185
00:11:41.762 --> 00:11:42.792
doesn't make sense.

186
00:11:43.463 --> 00:11:44.932
I saw Mr. Shin in the hospital...

187
00:11:44.932 --> 00:11:46.703
on a field examination.

188
00:11:50.073 --> 00:11:51.772
I heard he retired after the accident...

189
00:11:51.772 --> 00:11:54.213
and went to the US with his family.

190
00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:56.012
Within two years,

191
00:11:56.012 --> 00:11:57.912
he developed alcoholic dementia.

192
00:11:59.213 --> 00:12:00.752
His family gave up on him.

193
00:12:00.983 --> 00:12:02.083
They never visited him...

194
00:12:02.083 --> 00:12:03.282
after putting him in the hospital.

195
00:12:11.762 --> 00:12:13.563
When I was examining the case two years ago,

196
00:12:14.392 --> 00:12:16.693
there was no mention of Mr. Shin's...

197
00:12:16.693 --> 00:12:18.063
alcohol abuse in the file.

198
00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:22.902
I had no reason not to believe his testimony.

201
00:12:26.772 --> 00:12:27.973
I'm sorry, Kang Woo.

202
00:12:29.412 --> 00:12:30.943
What have I done?

203
00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.382
You shouldn't be sorry.

204
00:12:33.313 --> 00:12:34.983
There are others who should be.

205
00:12:35.412 --> 00:12:36.453
Who?

206
00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:39.953
The ones who covered it up on purpose.

207
00:12:41.652 --> 00:12:44.463
Juhan Air has been selected as...

208
00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:46.522
2017's best airline by the world renowned...

209
00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:49.233
"World Air Transport" magazine.

210
00:12:49.392 --> 00:12:51.662
It is a prestigious award well known...

211
00:12:51.662 --> 00:12:53.802
for its professional and fair judgment.

212
00:12:53.802 --> 00:12:56.333
It's called the Nobel Prize of airline industry.

213
00:13:00.912 --> 00:13:02.042
Thank you.

214
00:13:10.983 --> 00:13:13.853
Juhan Air is the first Asian company...

215
00:13:13.853 --> 00:13:16.422
to be awarded the best airline by WAT magazine.

216
00:13:16.453 --> 00:13:17.563
Congratulations.

217
00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:19.823
How do you feel?

218
00:13:19.823 --> 00:13:21.593
I'd like to thank...

219
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:24.132
all the passengers who love our airline.

220
00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:26.932
Since we received this great award,

221
00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:30.203
we'll provide unparalleled service to our customers.

223
00:13:33.672 --> 00:13:36.172
Flight JH 801 crashed.

224
00:13:36.473 --> 00:13:37.782
After two years,

225
00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:40.282
you received an amazing award.

226
00:13:41.213 --> 00:13:42.353
At the time,

227
00:13:42.353 --> 00:13:43.813
a thorough health check...

228
00:13:43.813 --> 00:13:45.422
on our employees had not been done.

229
00:13:45.922 --> 00:13:48.052
We deeply regret our wrongdoings.

230
00:13:48.693 --> 00:13:50.193
I would like to...

231
00:13:50.422 --> 00:13:52.963
sincerely apologize again...

232
00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:55.993
to the families of the victims.

233
00:13:55.993 --> 00:13:57.603
Right after the accident,

234
00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.402
Chairman Joo Jung Pil, your late father,

235
00:13:59.402 --> 00:14:01.073
had a stroke and collapsed.

236
00:14:01.203 --> 00:14:02.902
He has been in the hospital...

237
00:14:02.902 --> 00:14:04.542
for two years now.

238
00:14:05.103 --> 00:14:07.973
Some media are speculating...

239
00:14:08.373 --> 00:14:12.343
that he actually passed away.

240
00:14:13.682 --> 00:14:15.813
What are you saying?

241
00:14:16.682 --> 00:14:20.123
Journalists should only report facts.

242
00:14:20.422 --> 00:14:23.522
You can't spread false information.

243
00:14:23.522 --> 00:14:25.993
I'm checking with you for accurate information.

244
00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:27.762
- Sir. - Inheritance tax...

245
00:14:27.762 --> 00:14:29.593
is about 150 million dollars, right?

246
00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:31.703
You'll have to sell your shares...

247
00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:34.203
in order to prepare that money in cash.

248
00:14:34.203 --> 00:14:36.703
Because the management rights...

249
00:14:36.703 --> 00:14:37.843
hasn't been succeeded,

250
00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.713
you could lose the management control.

251
00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:43.243
So people who like to talk...

252
00:14:43.843 --> 00:14:46.382
It's not the people who like to talk.

253
00:14:48.152 --> 00:14:50.412
It's the strategic shareholders.

256
00:14:55.422 --> 00:14:57.493

I'm not...

262
00:15:14.272 --> 00:15:16.443
an immoral person...

263
00:15:16.443 --> 00:15:18.682
who wouldn't give his father a funeral...

264
00:15:20.182 --> 00:15:22.182
because of money.

265
00:15:23.483 --> 00:15:24.552
My father...

266

Why not?

Should I have stuck...

00:15:51.512 --> 00:15:53.243
to the question list like I was told?

273
00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:54.682
Then I wouldn't be a journalist.

00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:02.053
For what?

343
00:21:03.553 --> 00:21:04.593
Who caused it?

Can we act on our own like this?

00:21:52.442 --> 00:21:53.472
Noo Ri.

352
00:21:53.702 --> 00:21:56.873

"so meaningless and in vain?"

An ex-convict is sitting near the police station.

356
00:22:04.952 --> 00:22:06.853
That makes his life meaningless.

357
00:22:07.353 --> 00:22:09.823
You live only once, so what's the point of...

358
00:22:09.823 --> 00:22:12.263
being calculative and selfish?

359
00:22:12.863 --> 00:22:14.763
I live only once,

360
00:22:14.763 --> 00:22:16.593
so I should be bold and do something big.

361
00:22:17.162 --> 00:22:19.162
You might cause big trouble if you...

362
00:22:19.162 --> 00:22:20.503
don't tell this to Mr. Choi beforehand.

363
00:22:20.503 --> 00:22:22.603
He must not be in his right mind now.

This operation is only between you and me.

It's our joint operation.

366

Let's get bold and cause a real scene.

367
00:22:30.712 --> 00:22:32.642
No, why would I do that?

368
00:22:35.652 --> 00:22:36.652
He's here.

369
00:22:46.823 --> 00:22:47.892
Where's Kang Woo?

370
00:22:48.363 --> 00:22:49.392
Why are you here?

371
00:22:49.392 --> 00:22:50.732
Because I sent you the text.

372
00:22:50.732 --> 00:22:53.132
You're impersonating your leader now?

373
00:22:53.132 --> 00:22:55.373
You want to be sent to prison again?

Ko Jin Chul was murdered.

376
00:23:05.783 --> 00:23:07.553
- Did Kang Woo... - No.

377
00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:09.753
Then who killed him when and where?

378
00:23:09.753 --> 00:23:11.952
Last night, in the police station. Not sure who.

379
00:23:11.952 --> 00:23:13.353
You need to find out now.

380
00:23:17.962 --> 00:23:20.123
What nonsense are you talking about?

381
00:23:44.783 --> 00:23:46.123
You didn't have to come all the way here.

382
00:23:46.482 --> 00:23:47.793
It's just that...

383
00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.823
What? You thought I'd be depressed?

384
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.662
We don't have much time.

385
00:23:52.722 --> 00:23:54.033
We wasted two years already.

386

(Life Insurance, Contractor: Kim Bum Joon)

389
00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:52.382
Why are you after...

390
00:24:52.382 --> 00:24:54.353
the insurance company, Kim Min Joon?

391
00:24:58.392 --> 00:24:59.722
Mr. Kim.

392
00:25:02.063 --> 00:25:03.432
What are you doing here?

393
00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:05.962
You examined through the original papers...

394
00:25:05.962 --> 00:25:07.202
of my brother's insurance, right?

395
00:25:08.503 --> 00:25:10.073
Didn't you find anything strange?

396
00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:12.442
If so, I would've found out two years ago already.

397
00:25:12.442 --> 00:25:14.873
You would've found out two years ago.

398
00:25:15.912 --> 00:25:17.783
You're right.

399
00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:20.682
You investigated the case two years ago.

400

401

402
00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:26.882
you have in Taeyang Insurance.

404
00:25:33.293 --> 00:25:34.462
Hello, Director Kwon.

405
00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:38.162
What?

406
00:25:38.503 --> 00:25:39.863
It wasn't deposited?

407
00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:42.632
I did transfer the money.

408
00:25:42.632 --> 00:25:44.803
The manager of Claims Examination Team...

409
00:25:44.803 --> 00:25:47.242
paid a visit to our hospital.

410
00:25:47.942 --> 00:25:48.972
Ms. Cha.

411
00:25:49.873 --> 00:25:52.742
You're not as good as your father.

412
00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:07.992
We see each other again.

413
00:26:08.263 --> 00:26:09.662
Mr. Jan Gebauer.

414
00:26:09.662 --> 00:26:11.533
Call me Kim Min Joon,

415
00:26:11.533 --> 00:26:12.763
Ms. Cha.

416
00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:15.573
It's nothing.

417
00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:17.503
The life insurance worth 3.4 million dollars.

418
00:26:19.702 --> 00:26:21.712
I want to take out the insurance too.

419
00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:23.773
How can I take out the life insurance...

420
00:26:23.773 --> 00:26:25.742
worth 3.4 million dollars?

421
00:26:25.742 --> 00:26:28.053
It's not Claims Examination Team's job.

422
00:26:28.313 --> 00:26:29.613
Go talk to a consultant...

423
00:26:29.613 --> 00:26:32.053
I just can't trust any consultant.

424
00:26:32.722 --> 00:26:35.992
What if my consultant is someone like Lee Mi Ran?

425
00:26:36.422 --> 00:26:39.593
How could she live in hiding for two years?

426
00:26:39.593 --> 00:26:41.232
It's scares me so much.

427
00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:42.833
What are you talking about?

428
00:26:43.162 --> 00:26:44.603
Are you on drugs?

429
00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:46.003
What?

430
00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:47.773
What did you just say?

431
00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:52.803
Nothing.

432
00:26:52.803 --> 00:26:54.773
Maybe I'm on drugs...

433
00:26:54.773 --> 00:26:56.543
like he just said.

434
00:26:58.382 --> 00:27:00.583
So I can't take it out from the headquarters.

435
00:27:01.212 --> 00:27:03.553
Then I'll take care of it myself.

436
00:27:11.462 --> 00:27:12.563
What was that?

437
00:27:13.662 --> 00:27:15.063
What do you mean?

438
00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:19.702
You seem to keep many secrets from me lately.

439
00:27:20.363 --> 00:27:21.373
No way.

440
00:27:22.303 --> 00:27:23.303
That's not true.

441
00:27:23.603 --> 00:27:26.273
You went to Kwongeun Medical Foundation...

442
00:27:26.843 --> 00:27:28.373
for an inspection, didn't you?

443
00:27:29.613 --> 00:27:31.712
Oh, that hospital is...

444
00:27:31.712 --> 00:27:34.783
I'm glad to see your passion for work.

445
00:27:35.452 --> 00:27:37.452
But I have already approved this case.

446
00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:39.323
Stop everything, and process it.

447
00:27:40.353 --> 00:27:41.593
Yes, Director Cha.

448
00:27:44.192 --> 00:27:46.523
He killed himself in the police station...

449
00:27:46.523 --> 00:27:48.692
of all places, so it became huge problem.

450
00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:51.162
Are you sure he killed himself?

451
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.563
The only person who has motives for murder...

452
00:27:53.563 --> 00:27:55.073
has an alibi.

453
00:27:55.202 --> 00:27:56.932
Who? What's the alibi?

454
00:27:56.932 --> 00:27:59.103
There were some guys taken in with him.

455
00:27:59.103 --> 00:28:01.273
A former police officer who's a claims examiner,

456
00:28:01.273 --> 00:28:02.813
and a young man who was a German citizen.

457
00:28:03.412 --> 00:28:05.843
But at the time of Ko Jin Chul's death,

458
00:28:05.843 --> 00:28:07.353
they were sitting right in the middle of the office,

459
00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:08.813
so they have a strong alibi.

460
00:28:09.382 --> 00:28:11.823
They were so loud because they came in a huge group.

461
00:28:14.222 --> 00:28:15.753
That guy, Ko Jin Chul.

462
00:28:16.293 --> 00:28:19.863
I think he was suspected of insurance fraud,

463
00:28:19.863 --> 00:28:21.632
and someone died in every single case.

464
00:28:21.632 --> 00:28:24.732
But they were mostly women without families,

465
00:28:24.732 --> 00:28:27.033
so there's no one who'd want to kill him.

466
00:28:32.273 --> 00:28:33.603
(Bathroom hallway's security camera)

467
00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:40.412
You did see someone on the security camera...

468
00:28:40.412 --> 00:28:42.013
of the bathroom hallway, right?

469
00:28:42.013 --> 00:28:44.253
That's why you think it may be a murder.

470
00:28:44.982 --> 00:28:46.922
Oh, well...

471
00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:50.253
I'm not supposed to tell you this.

472
00:28:50.253 --> 00:28:51.392
What is it?

473
00:28:57.093 --> 00:28:59.363
That day, until the accident,

474
00:28:59.363 --> 00:29:02.232
so until about 12:45 am,

475
00:29:02.773 --> 00:29:05.242
the security camera was being checked.

476
00:29:05.503 --> 00:29:06.902
What are you talking about?

477
00:29:07.373 --> 00:29:09.813
Then are you saying you have zero footage?

478
00:29:10.573 --> 00:29:12.543
This is highly confidential.

479
00:29:12.843 --> 00:29:14.353
If this gets out,

480
00:29:14.353 --> 00:29:15.712
we'll all lose our jobs.

481
00:29:19.523 --> 00:29:20.892
Not here.

482
00:29:21.422 --> 00:29:22.422
Hey!

483
00:29:22.793 --> 00:29:24.992
Where are you going? There are no cameras.

484
00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.563
If you can't find it, you must.

485
00:29:27.692 --> 00:29:30.192
That's Mad Dog's motto.

486
00:29:30.192 --> 00:29:31.662
Motto? Forget that.

487
00:29:31.662 --> 00:29:33.303
So how will you find it?

488
00:29:33.732 --> 00:29:35.672
(Jinguk Hangover Soup)

489
00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.202
We're going to eat.

490
00:29:40.202 --> 00:29:41.242
I'm so hungry.

491
00:29:41.242 --> 00:29:42.373
Goodbye.

492
00:29:43.773 --> 00:29:45.712
How dare you make a detective come and go...

493
00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:48.912
Darn it, Kang Woo.

494
00:29:49.283 --> 00:29:50.652
You made me look like an idiot.

495
00:29:55.892 --> 00:29:58.363
Stop eating food from a convenience store.

496
00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:00.023
This will become your flesh and bones.

497
00:30:00.023 --> 00:30:01.563
Eat. Eat up.

498
00:30:02.533 --> 00:30:05.132
This place is facing the police station's entrance,

499
00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:07.232
but the camera is inside.

500
00:30:07.232 --> 00:30:08.632
So I guess it's not here either.

501
00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:11.503
Let's eat quickly...

502
00:30:11.503 --> 00:30:12.803
and look around one more time.

503
00:30:12.843 --> 00:30:14.142
- Eat up. - Sure.

504
00:30:14.513 --> 00:30:17.513
You didn't bring two boxes of seonji last night.

505
00:30:17.642 --> 00:30:19.583
You need to bring them today.

506
00:30:19.912 --> 00:30:22.712
I don't have enough ingredients for business.

507
00:30:22.712 --> 00:30:24.722
You have to bring them today, okay?

508
00:30:25.452 --> 00:30:26.623
Last night.

509
00:30:30.253 --> 00:30:31.462
Excuse me, ma'am.

510
00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:33.363
Why? Do you need more radish kimchi?

511
00:30:33.422 --> 00:30:36.063
Yes, this radish kimchi is amazingly delicious.

512
00:30:38.202 --> 00:30:39.333
By the way,

513
00:30:40.003 --> 00:30:42.333
if you open for 24 hours a day,

514
00:30:42.702 --> 00:30:45.172
what time do you receive the ingredients?

515
00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:47.043
Why do you ask?

516
00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:49.412
This is my brother,

517
00:30:49.642 --> 00:30:52.283
and he really loves seonji.

518
00:30:52.912 --> 00:30:56.152
So I'm thinking about starting a business too.

519
00:30:56.583 --> 00:30:58.922
It depends on the store,

520
00:30:58.922 --> 00:31:01.892
but we usually get it before 1am.

521
00:31:01.992 --> 00:31:04.323
Before 1am? Really?

522
00:31:04.892 --> 00:31:07.563
Hey, you're a night owl. It sounds perfect.

523
00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:11.962
Thank you. Your food is great.

524
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:15.503
Eat up.

525
00:31:32.882 --> 00:31:34.323
I'll take what she's eating.

526
00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:35.523
Okay.

527
00:31:36.922 --> 00:31:38.323
There are many empty seats.

528
00:31:38.462 --> 00:31:40.063
I let you drive my car yesterday.

529
00:31:40.063 --> 00:31:41.063
Treat me a meal.

530
00:31:41.063 --> 00:31:43.732
Didn't you think I drove to not let you get hurt?

531
00:31:43.732 --> 00:31:46.563
Who would get hurt? Me? Why?

532
00:31:47.033 --> 00:31:49.503
Forget it. Just be quiet and eat.

533
00:31:52.142 --> 00:31:54.513
Are you only eating half? Why?

534
00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:55.873
I don't have the appetite.

535
00:31:57.043 --> 00:31:58.242
You should finish it.

536
00:32:00.142 --> 00:32:01.553
You can't get sick.

537
00:32:03.283 --> 00:32:04.682
You must like egg rolls.

My gosh, those tenants.

540
00:32:32.942 --> 00:32:35.253
I thought you'd be sitting around crying.

541
00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.882
Where have you been?

542
00:32:37.253 --> 00:32:39.152
I'm not like you.

543
00:32:39.823 --> 00:32:41.123
Two years ago,

544
00:32:41.123 --> 00:32:42.853
you sat around at home crying, didn't you?

545
00:32:42.853 --> 00:32:45.293
Then what did you do back in Germany?

546
00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:47.123
I didn't cry like a kid.

547
00:32:47.123 --> 00:32:48.333
I partied.

548
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.533
I splurged the 3.4 million dollars.

549
00:32:52.662 --> 00:32:53.863
How splendid.

550
00:32:54.803 --> 00:32:56.773
Both you and me.

551
00:32:57.132 --> 00:32:59.642
Don't bring me down to your level.

552
00:32:59.773 --> 00:33:02.113
Can you stop barging in without my permission?

553
00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.873
I heard you visited Moo Shin.

554
00:33:04.712 --> 00:33:07.212
Why do you need the investigation report?

555
00:33:07.212 --> 00:33:08.313
None of your business.

556
00:33:08.313 --> 00:33:10.682
Will you keep engaging in an individual battle?

557
00:33:10.982 --> 00:33:12.722
I thought you didn't want to be on my level.

558
00:33:13.053 --> 00:33:16.023
Then what? Did you think I'll join you...

559
00:33:16.023 --> 00:33:18.162
saying, "We're a team now"?

560
00:33:18.793 --> 00:33:19.793
Mr. Choi.

561
00:33:20.063 --> 00:33:21.793
Do you trust me?

562
00:33:22.793 --> 00:33:24.462
Because I can't trust you.

563
00:33:27.503 --> 00:33:29.432
I'm proposing a give-and-take.

564
00:33:30.373 --> 00:33:31.503
Take it.

565
00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:33.942
The investigation report.

566
00:33:36.843 --> 00:33:38.783
Okay, I'll take it.

567
00:33:39.343 --> 00:33:41.053
What do you want me to give you?

568
00:33:41.182 --> 00:33:43.382
Why do you want the original insurance files?

569
00:33:52.623 --> 00:33:54.732
Before Lee Mi Ran died, she told me...

570
00:33:56.232 --> 00:33:58.603
to go find the originals of the insurance policy.

571
00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:10.313
And?

572
00:34:10.373 --> 00:34:11.443
What do you mean?

573
00:34:11.443 --> 00:34:13.383
You received the originals of the insurance policy,

574
00:34:13.383 --> 00:34:15.713
yet you went back to Taeyang Insurance...

575
00:34:15.713 --> 00:34:18.322
and asked for the investigation report. Why?

576
00:34:20.123 --> 00:34:22.322
That's not fair.

577
00:34:22.322 --> 00:34:23.892
You gave me just 1. You can't ask for 2.

578
00:34:23.892 --> 00:34:27.762
Hey, life isn't fair.

579
00:34:36.233 --> 00:34:37.443
Taeyang Insurance.

580
00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:40.173
That's what she said.

581
00:34:40.673 --> 00:34:41.742
Tae...

582
00:34:43.173 --> 00:34:44.182

Originals.

587
00:35:04.532 --> 00:35:05.802
Find it.

588
00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:09.572
Find the originals...

589
00:35:10.072 --> 00:35:13.373
of Taeyang Insurance's insurance policy.

590
00:35:13.443 --> 00:35:14.612
What did she mean?

591
00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:15.912
Exactly.

592
00:35:17.412 --> 00:35:18.883
I have no idea either.

593
00:35:33.762 --> 00:35:34.862
Taeyang...

594
00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.162
Insurance.

595
00:35:43.773 --> 00:35:44.802
Yes?

596
00:35:48.572 --> 00:35:49.612
What?

597
00:36:07.023 --> 00:36:08.733
You begged me to let you know...

598
00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:11.532
if something happens, so I called you.

599
00:36:11.932 --> 00:36:14.403
But his wife will be mad if she ever finds out.

600
00:36:14.403 --> 00:36:15.572
How would she know?

601
00:36:15.572 --> 00:36:17.032
She never comes back from the US.

602
00:36:19.603 --> 00:36:21.142
What happened this morning?

603
00:36:25.213 --> 00:36:27.682
He's been curled up...

604
00:36:27.682 --> 00:36:29.552
and lying there for months now.

605
00:36:30.213 --> 00:36:32.653
But today, he was on his back, watching TV.

606
00:36:38.762 --> 00:36:41.063
I approached him thinking he's finally himself.

607
00:36:46.432 --> 00:36:48.302
Oh, goodness. What's wrong?

608
00:36:48.572 --> 00:36:50.873
Stop it, please. My goodness!

609

Nurse!

610
00:36:57.543 --> 00:36:59.182
What was on TV at that time?

611
00:36:59.512 --> 00:37:01.153
Just the morning news.

612
00:37:01.153 --> 00:37:02.853
Around what time did this happen?

613
00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:07.492
It was right before breakfast,

614
00:37:08.523 --> 00:37:10.722
so around 7:20am.

615
00:37:16.492 --> 00:37:19.633
The 23 passengers who were on board...

616
00:37:19.633 --> 00:37:24.043
on flight JH 801 back in October 11, 2015,

617
00:37:24.043 --> 00:37:27.713
agreed to the additional compensation...

618
00:37:27.713 --> 00:37:31.282
regarding the damage suit filed against Juhan Air.

619
00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:34.083
Legal Affairs Manager Lee Young Ho announced...

620
00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:37.722
that Juhan Air will pay out additional...

621
00:37:37.923 --> 00:37:40.023
compensation to all the passengers...

622
00:37:40.023 --> 00:37:42.023
since the company was at fault...

623
00:37:42.023 --> 00:37:45.523
for not checking the two pilots' health status.

624
00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:55.833
I think he panicked...

625
00:37:55.833 --> 00:37:57.702
because the accident and the suicide story...

626
00:37:57.702 --> 00:37:59.043
were brought up again.

I wasn't trying to leave you out, Ms. Jang.

Well... Ms. Jang.

Let's go with a hit-and-run.

639

- I told you... - What?

640
00:39:00.603 --> 00:39:01.603
Turn around.

641

- Okay. - Okay.

Hi. Welcome.

643
00:39:25.092 --> 00:39:26.623
Did you...

644
00:39:26.862 --> 00:39:28.762
see a car go by last night...

645
00:39:28.762 --> 00:39:30.293
after midnight?

646
00:39:30.293 --> 00:39:32.662
I'm sure there were lots of cars.

647

What's wrong?

at the intersection.

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.773
I can't find the culprit...

651
00:39:39.773 --> 00:39:42.012
because there are no surveillance cameras.

652
00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.012
Goodness.

653
00:39:43.412 --> 00:39:46.642
The camera in here doesn't record the street.

654
00:39:47.483 --> 00:39:49.182
Ma'am, it's all done.

655

- Come over here. - Okay.

656
00:39:50.952 --> 00:39:53.623
There was an accident last night.

00:39:53.623 --> 00:39:54.822
Did you see anything?

658
00:39:55.592 --> 00:39:56.992
- Last night? - Yes.

659
00:39:57.963 --> 00:39:59.862
Around what time was it?

660
00:39:59.862 --> 00:40:03.833
It was around 12:45am.

661
00:40:04.162 --> 00:40:06.802
My truck was probably out there.

662
00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:09.302
Do you want to check the dash cam?

663
00:40:09.873 --> 00:40:11.242
Thank you.

664
00:40:12.603 --> 00:40:15.112
- It's no problem. - That's good news.

665
00:40:15.543 --> 00:40:16.543
Let's go.

666
00:40:17.543 --> 00:40:18.713
- Go ahead. - Okay.

667
00:40:18.713 --> 00:40:20.182
Deposit the money please.

668
00:40:20.182 --> 00:40:21.653
Okay, I will. You should go.

669
00:40:21.653 --> 00:40:23.083
- Okay. - Goodness.

670
00:40:23.412 --> 00:40:25.623
There's a car entering the police station.

671
00:40:26.253 --> 00:40:28.193
There's one that's leaving afterwards.

672
00:40:28.423 --> 00:40:29.492
There are only two cars.

673
00:40:29.952 --> 00:40:32.592
Show me the car that's entering the station.

674
00:40:34.032 --> 00:40:35.162
Should I play it in slow motion?

675
00:40:35.693 --> 00:40:36.693
Stop.

676
00:40:37.503 --> 00:40:40.633
The car's from 2016, and its color is grand blue.

677
00:40:40.932 --> 00:40:43.003
The dash cam near the fender.

678
00:40:43.173 --> 00:40:45.873
The car is like new without a scratch.

679
00:40:47.142 --> 00:40:48.873
That's Manager Park's car.

680
00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.313
What?

681
00:40:53.642 --> 00:40:54.753
What's up, Ha Ri?

682
00:40:56.612 --> 00:40:59.153
What? I'm in front of your office.

683
00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:03.023
She just hung up on me.

684
00:41:03.853 --> 00:41:05.762
Gosh, her temper hasn't changed.

685
00:41:07.162 --> 00:41:09.592
If it's true, we can't just sit here.

686
00:41:09.932 --> 00:41:12.633
We should record Mr. Shin's testimony.

687
00:41:15.373 --> 00:41:16.903
He's an incompetent.

688
00:41:17.072 --> 00:41:18.742
We can't record him.

689
00:41:18.972 --> 00:41:20.503
Even if we did,

690
00:41:20.642 --> 00:41:23.213
nobody would believe him since his brain cells...

691
00:41:23.472 --> 00:41:24.782
aren't functioning right.

692
00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:26.083
Detective Jo.

693
00:41:33.483 --> 00:41:35.153
Is that why Cheetah and Pentium are...

694
00:41:35.153 --> 00:41:36.653
after the one who killed Ko Jin Chul?

695
00:41:37.222 --> 00:41:38.463
You'll catch him first?

696
00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:39.693
Is that what they're doing?

697
00:41:39.963 --> 00:41:41.293
Just stay put for now.

698
00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:42.662
The police want...

699
00:41:42.662 --> 00:41:45.032
Ko Jin Chul's case to blow over quietly.

700
00:41:45.032 --> 00:41:47.003
You might mess it up.

701
00:41:47.003 --> 00:41:48.733
I'll look into it and let you know.

702
00:41:49.472 --> 00:41:50.503
Thanks.

703
00:41:50.972 --> 00:41:51.972
Don't mention it.

704
00:41:52.472 --> 00:41:54.012
There's nothing I can't do for you.

705
00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:55.912
Bye.

706
00:42:04.883 --> 00:42:06.123
You knew him since you were a policeman, right?

707
00:42:06.383 --> 00:42:07.552
Has it been over 20 years?

708
00:42:07.952 --> 00:42:08.992
22 years.

(Poongnyeon Restaurant)

710
00:42:20.873 --> 00:42:21.873
Yes.

711
00:42:26.373 --> 00:42:27.642
That really is my car.

712
00:42:29.543 --> 00:42:32.012
That's right. There was a car leaving...

713
00:42:32.012 --> 00:42:33.443
when I was going in.

714
00:42:34.782 --> 00:42:36.182
Did I score?

715
00:42:37.112 --> 00:42:39.253
That was by sheer luck.

716
00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:41.793
Why did you go to the police station?

717
00:42:41.793 --> 00:42:44.123
Shouldn't we be suspicious of Manager Park?

718
00:42:44.123 --> 00:42:45.293
Hey, you punk.

719
00:42:45.293 --> 00:42:47.023
I went because I heard Ko Jin Chul was caught.

720
00:42:48.262 --> 00:42:49.492
Play it fast.

721
00:42:49.693 --> 00:42:50.702
Okay.

00:42:57.673 --> 00:42:59.202
Play Moo Shin's dash cam.

723
00:42:59.503 --> 00:43:00.572
Okay.

724
00:43:04.412 --> 00:43:06.583
He looks familiar.

725
00:43:07.753 --> 00:43:09.983
- Make it clearer. - Wait a second.

726
00:43:14.253 --> 00:43:15.293
Clearer.

727
00:43:20.293 --> 00:43:21.662
Kang Woo, he is...

728
00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:25.003
Legal Affairs Manager Lee Young Ho announced...

729
00:43:25.003 --> 00:43:28.702
that Juhan Air will pay out additional...

Lee Young Ho.

732
00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.313
With 10 million dollars from Taeyang Insurance,

733
00:43:40.313 --> 00:43:41.853
we secured more stocks.

734
00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:43.083
That old geezer.

735
00:43:43.753 --> 00:43:46.123
He drove me crazy with 10 million dollars.

736
00:43:48.052 --> 00:43:49.592
How about my father's funeral?

737
00:43:49.722 --> 00:43:51.362
I'm thinking next weekend, sir.

738
00:43:53.262 --> 00:43:54.262
That's perfect.

739
00:43:55.463 --> 00:43:56.862
How about Ko Jin Chul?

740
00:43:58.262 --> 00:44:00.003
- It's taken care of. - How?

741
00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:03.032
It's better that you didn't know.

742
00:44:04.202 --> 00:44:06.673
This is why I like you so much.

743
00:44:06.943 --> 00:44:09.443
You know exactly what you should do.

744
00:44:10.612 --> 00:44:11.782
All right then.

745
00:44:12.112 --> 00:44:14.813
What should I give you as an award?

746
00:44:15.583 --> 00:44:17.182
I'm already receiving more than enough.

747
00:44:17.883 --> 00:44:18.983
From whom?

748
00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:20.892
I've never given you anything.

749
00:44:21.353 --> 00:44:22.592
But you are.

750
00:44:22.623 --> 00:44:23.653
Am I?

751
00:44:32.802 --> 00:44:35.373
How long have you been working here?

752
00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:36.833
It's been four years.

753
00:44:36.833 --> 00:44:39.543
Who recommended you? Was it Chairman Cha?

754
00:44:39.543 --> 00:44:42.443
I believe Chairman Joo recommended me first.

755
00:44:43.112 --> 00:44:44.583
That's right. He did.

756
00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:48.612
After my father's funeral,

757
00:44:48.813 --> 00:44:51.853
will you go back to Taeyang Insurance?

758
00:44:58.463 --> 00:45:00.392
I belong to Juhan Air.

759
00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:02.032
Trust me, sir.

760
00:45:06.333 --> 00:45:08.003
I know.

761
00:45:11.403 --> 00:45:14.173
I hope you never change.

762
00:45:18.612 --> 00:45:21.052
He's a lawyer if he's the Legal Affairs Manager.

763
00:45:21.282 --> 00:45:23.583
Why did he take care of Ko Jin Chul himself?

764
00:45:24.253 --> 00:45:25.452
Because he's a lawyer,

765
00:45:26.753 --> 00:45:28.452
Ko Jin Chul was killed instantly.

766
00:45:29.753 --> 00:45:32.162
That means Ko Jin Chul let his guard down.

767
00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:34.733
Nobody would be suspicious of him...

768
00:45:34.733 --> 00:45:36.563
even if he came to visit a murder suspect.

769
00:45:36.563 --> 00:45:37.603
Why do you think?

770
00:45:39.463 --> 00:45:40.503
Because he's a lawyer.

(Delivery Ceremony of Insurance Policy)

772

He works for Juhan Air, right?

773
00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:55.012
Why are you after Juhan Air?

774
00:45:55.012 --> 00:45:56.753
I have a reason to.

775
00:45:56.912 --> 00:45:58.123
What about Taeyang Insurance?

776
00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.583
I told you already that Lee Mi Ran told me...

777
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:03.023
to find the original insurance policy.

778
00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:04.722
It's not time yet.

779
00:46:04.992 --> 00:46:06.523
Don't whine, and just wait.

780
00:46:06.523 --> 00:46:09.092
Is it not time yet or will it never be time?

781
00:46:10.903 --> 00:46:12.063
Did you know Taeyang Marine,

782
00:46:12.063 --> 00:46:14.603
the affiliate of Taeyang Insurance, renewed...

783
00:46:14.603 --> 00:46:17.173
Juhan Air's insurance a month before the crash?

784
00:46:19.673 --> 00:46:21.642
Soon after that,

785
00:46:22.673 --> 00:46:24.583
Cha Hong Joo became an executive director.

786
00:46:26.842 --> 00:46:28.883
You don't understand the meaning of renewal.

787
00:46:29.313 --> 00:46:31.853
They just renewed their existing coverage.

788
00:46:32.383 --> 00:46:35.322
Taeyang was Juhan's insurance for 10 years.

789
00:46:36.092 --> 00:46:37.193
I see.

790
00:46:37.923 --> 00:46:40.623
So you're digging into Juhan Air...

791
00:46:40.623 --> 00:46:42.492
without suspecting Taeyang at all.

792
00:46:42.492 --> 00:46:44.032
- Kim Min Joon. - That's right.

793
00:46:44.932 --> 00:46:46.032
I'm going to do that.

794
00:46:46.362 --> 00:46:47.403
So...

795
00:46:50.842 --> 00:46:52.342
you stay put.

796
00:46:53.072 --> 00:46:55.813
Don't rush in like a fool who doesn't know anything.

You...

798
00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:03.452
really can't make this work.

799
00:47:04.623 --> 00:47:07.222
I guess you're still attached to Taeyang.

800
00:47:08.052 --> 00:47:09.322
You ended up here...

801
00:47:09.322 --> 00:47:11.392
because you get dragged around by stuff like this.

802
00:47:11.392 --> 00:47:13.222
Yes. That's right.

803
00:47:13.923 --> 00:47:14.932
So...

804
00:47:15.992 --> 00:47:16.992
get out.

805
00:47:30.043 --> 00:47:31.742
Why didn't you just tell him...

806
00:47:31.742 --> 00:47:33.742
that he's the one who killed Ko Jin Chul?

807

Lee Young Ho killed Jin Chul.

808

Ko Jin Chul was after Kim Min Joon.

809
00:47:39.753 --> 00:47:42.392
You think Lee Young Ho doesn't know Kim Min Joon?

810
00:47:44.092 --> 00:47:45.423
It's better that we put them apart...

811
00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:47.293
for his sake.

812
00:47:47.592 --> 00:47:49.463
He wouldn't just do nothing.

813
00:47:50.903 --> 00:47:52.302
He's not the type to do so.

814
00:47:53.903 --> 00:47:54.932
I'm going home.

She told me to find the original insurance policy.

that Ms. Cha renewed Juhan Air's insurance...

824

alive?

Do you still follow me?

847
00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.012
Let's get out.

848
00:51:24.012 --> 00:51:25.742
- Why? - Now.

849
00:51:47.572 --> 00:51:48.833
Tell me what's going on.

850
00:51:48.833 --> 00:51:49.903
Let's go first.

851
00:51:51.403 --> 00:51:53.003
I'll ask you one more time.

852
00:51:53.003 --> 00:51:55.142
Tell me what's going on.

853
00:52:06.753 --> 00:52:07.822
What are you doing?

854
00:52:12.193 --> 00:52:14.392
It's not great to let them know we're here.

855
00:52:17.563 --> 00:52:19.202
They have breakfast together.

856
00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:20.603
They look close with each other.

857
00:52:20.603 --> 00:52:23.302
Juhan Air and Taeyang Insurance.

858
00:52:23.873 --> 00:52:24.943
Kim Min Joon.

859
00:52:26.472 --> 00:52:28.673
Don't get involved with that man.

860
00:52:29.273 --> 00:52:30.273
Why?

861
00:52:31.012 --> 00:52:33.742
He might've killed Ko Jin Chul.

862
00:52:35.753 --> 00:52:38.483
You could get killed too.

863
00:52:47.463 --> 00:52:48.662
Hong Joo.

864
00:53:08.483 --> 00:53:09.483
Hi, Kang Woo.

865
00:53:09.713 --> 00:53:10.753
Hi, Hong Joo.

866
00:53:12.023 --> 00:53:13.153
What is it?

867
00:53:13.653 --> 00:53:14.722
By any chance,

868
00:53:17.293 --> 00:53:18.592
do you have something to tell me?

869
00:53:20.833 --> 00:53:21.892
What about you?

870
00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:24.233
Don't you have something to tell me?

871
00:53:25.103 --> 00:53:26.302
I don't.

872
00:53:27.972 --> 00:53:28.972
Same here.

873
00:53:32.702 --> 00:53:33.742
I have nothing to say.

874
00:53:34.742 --> 00:53:35.912
I see.

875
00:54:05.503 --> 00:54:07.742
Mr. Choi, Lee Young Ho met...

876
00:54:07.742 --> 00:54:08.742
Hong Joo.

877
00:54:09.742 --> 00:54:10.742
Let's go.

878
00:54:10.943 --> 00:54:12.142
What are you going to do?

879
00:54:12.742 --> 00:54:14.313
What else can we do?

880
00:54:14.313 --> 00:54:15.813
We just do what we always do.

881
00:54:17.583 --> 00:54:18.923
Will you set a bait?

882
00:54:19.583 --> 00:54:21.023
What bait are you using this time?

883
00:54:21.552 --> 00:54:23.153
Maybe a shark.

884
00:54:24.193 --> 00:54:26.063
I should set something suitable for her.

885
00:54:30.532 --> 00:54:33.063
Hi, Moo Shin. Can I ask you for a favor?

886
00:54:37.972 --> 00:54:39.503
What did you just say?

887
00:54:39.503 --> 00:54:40.972
I'd like you to give me more time...

888
00:54:40.972 --> 00:54:43.873
to examine the Kwongeun Medical Foundation case.

889
00:54:43.873 --> 00:54:45.443
I thought I made it clear.

890
00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:46.642
I clearly told you to process it...

891
00:54:46.642 --> 00:54:48.052
since I handled the case on my discretion.

892
00:54:49.412 --> 00:54:51.052
It's highly likely...

893
00:54:51.052 --> 00:54:53.153
that the hospital is Han Dong Yoon's.

894
00:54:54.293 --> 00:54:56.322
How much is the possibility?

895
00:54:56.592 --> 00:54:59.023
Is it 60, 80, or 100 percent?

896
00:54:59.392 --> 00:55:00.492
That's...

897
00:55:00.523 --> 00:55:02.032
What about our detection rate...

898
00:55:02.693 --> 00:55:04.233
for the last two years?

899
00:55:04.233 --> 00:55:05.762
Is it over 20 percent?

900
00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:07.773
I'm sorry, ma'am.

901
00:55:08.873 --> 00:55:10.133
I guess...

902
00:55:10.472 --> 00:55:13.202
you don't deserve to be in...

903
00:55:14.373 --> 00:55:16.512
the manager position of Claims Examination Team.

904
00:55:24.123 --> 00:55:25.353
(Claims Examination Team Manager, Park Moo Shin)

905
00:55:38.463 --> 00:55:39.463
Hi, Kang Woo.

906
00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:41.833
It's all ready here.

907
00:55:43.802 --> 00:55:44.972
Sorry, Moo Shin.

908
00:55:45.373 --> 00:55:46.543
Don't be.

909
00:55:47.543 --> 00:55:48.742
I'm the one who's sorry.

910
00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:51.313
I should've done a better job two years ago.

911
00:55:51.583 --> 00:55:54.052
No, it's not your fault.

912
00:55:57.112 --> 00:56:00.052
Don't ever apologize to me from now on.

913
00:56:14.103 --> 00:56:15.302
Head.

914

Head.

915
00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:01.383
What is this?

916
00:57:01.383 --> 00:57:02.813
Ko Jin Chul died.

917
00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:05.423
It's the document related to his death.

918
00:57:08.193 --> 00:57:10.662
I'm sorry I made you worry, sir.

919
00:57:12.092 --> 00:57:14.592
Don't mention it. It's all right.

920
00:57:19.262 --> 00:57:21.202
Did you come here to say that?

921
00:57:21.603 --> 00:57:24.142
I came to ask you if your last offer is...

922
00:57:24.142 --> 00:57:25.373
still valid.

923
00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:27.713
You said you'll give me...

924
00:57:27.713 --> 00:57:29.612
everything I ask for, didn't you?

925
00:57:31.213 --> 00:57:32.242
Yes.

926
00:57:32.912 --> 00:57:34.412
What is it that you want?

927
00:57:34.753 --> 00:57:37.753
I want to return to Taeyang Insurance.

928
00:57:38.782 --> 00:57:40.182
You want to come back?

929
00:57:40.253 --> 00:57:42.052
Ko Jin Chul is dead now.

930
00:57:42.052 --> 00:57:44.762
And I'd like to pay you back for waiting for me...

931
00:57:45.463 --> 00:57:46.892
for the last two years.

932
00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:48.762
It has the lowest fraud detection rate now.

933
00:57:49.563 --> 00:57:50.762
I'll bring it up for you.

934
00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:06.012
What will you do now,

935
00:58:06.012 --> 00:58:07.383

Head.

938
00:58:43.112 --> 00:58:45.253
I should've had a drink with you when you asked.

939
00:58:47.153 --> 00:58:48.153
I'm sorry.

940
00:58:59.233 --> 00:59:00.633
What should I do now,

941
00:59:02.133 --> 00:59:03.133
Bum Joon?

942
00:59:23.322 --> 00:59:24.793
This is the last day I'll drink.

01:00:32.892 --> 01:00:35.563
No solicitors allowed on the premises.

949
01:00:40.463 --> 01:00:41.873
Where is Mr. Choi?

950
01:00:42.003 --> 01:00:44.342
Who knows?

951
01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:49.943
Do you want to know where he is?

952
01:01:07.432 --> 01:01:08.463
Fifth floor.

953

(Claims Examination Team Manager's Room)

957
01:02:07.452 --> 01:02:09.623
What are you doing here, Mr. Choi?

958
01:02:10.452 --> 01:02:11.492
What do you think?

959
01:02:11.923 --> 01:02:13.322
I'm back in my place.

960
01:02:13.662 --> 01:02:14.733
Back in your place?

961
01:02:21.633 --> 01:02:23.103
Hello, Mr. Kim Min Joon.

962

Why did you come back?

966
01:03:04.483 --> 01:03:05.713
Thanks to the JH 801 case,

967
01:03:05.713 --> 01:03:07.552
he was made known to the world...

968
01:03:07.782 --> 01:03:09.282
and got promoted as well.

969
01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:10.782
Stay under the radar.

970
01:03:10.782 --> 01:03:11.923
Don't let people notice you.

971
01:03:12.253 --> 01:03:15.293
I want to hold Juhan Air responsible.

972

Get ready to take down a dog.

977
01:03:28.572 --> 01:03:30.202
- It's not here. - What is?

978
01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:31.873
Let's go, Ms. Jang.

979
01:03:31.873 --> 01:03:33.873
Turn the car around and call them!

980
01:03:33.873 --> 01:03:36.072
Wait. Stand still.
