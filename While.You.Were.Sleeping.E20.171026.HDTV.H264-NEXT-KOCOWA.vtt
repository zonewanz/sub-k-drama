00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:09.092
(Episode 20)

2
00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:28.088
Why did you come so late?

3
00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:30.548
I missed you so much.

4
00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:45.737
Men are animals.

5
00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:57.677
What? Why am I...

6
00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:05.618
It's Hyang Mi, not her!

7
00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:08.528
You're hugging Hyang Mi!

8
00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:12.227
Goodness!

9
00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.028
Prosecutor Jung... I mean...

10
00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:18.568
Should I call you Jae Chan now?

11
00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:20.798
No, Hyang... Hyang Mi.

12
00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:29.947
I'm sorry I'm late.

13
00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:32.078
I didn't know you were
waiting for me.

14
00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:34.318
I think she's misunderstanding...

15
00:01:34.318 --> 00:01:37.318
Hyang Mi, look around. Get away
from him.

16
00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:38.657
You don't know anything. Hold on.

17
00:01:38.657 --> 00:01:40.157
We know! Get away from him!

18
00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:41.628
Let go of me. It hurts!

19
00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:45.727
Hong Joo! This is a total
misunderstanding. You know, right?

20
00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:50.298
A misunderstanding?

21
00:01:51.268 --> 00:01:52.298
Hong Joo.

22
00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:57.538
You're Hyang Mi, right?
My apologies.

23
00:01:57.977 --> 00:01:59.207
My mother said...

24
00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:02.278
misunderstandings occur when
people lack understanding.

25
00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:05.947
Today's misunderstanding occurred
only because Jae Chan...

26
00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:07.417
and I lack understanding.

27
00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:09.288
This kind of situation will never...

28
00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:12.717
happen again, and we'll work hard
on that.

29
00:02:12.858 --> 00:02:16.528
Please let go of any grudges and
your arms too.

30
00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:24.798
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31
00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:28.868
Why did you do something
you're sorry for?

32
00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:29.868
Yes, why did he...

33
00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:32.677
Let's leave these two alone.

34
00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:37.848
Are you Nam Hong Joo from
the Hong Joo Samgyeopsal?

35
00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:39.078
Yes, I am.

36
00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:42.887
Is this scarf yours, Hyang mi?

37
00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:02.768
She's totally beautiful...

38
00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:04.437
and very intelligent.

39
00:03:04.778 --> 00:03:06.677
A total femme fatale style.

40
00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:11.477
Here you go.

41
00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:12.578
Thank you.

42
00:03:15.548 --> 00:03:18.687
She's finally here to see him.

43
00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:20.657
Let's get going.

44
00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:22.157
Please get well soon.

45
00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:24.457
- Let's go now.
- I don't care if you get well.

46
00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:26.157
- Thank you for coming.
- Let's go.

47
00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:27.457
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go.

48
00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:28.727
Thanks again.

49
00:03:29.997 --> 00:03:31.997
Turn around and just walk.

50
00:03:38.278 --> 00:03:41.207
You two look like twins
from the back.

51
00:03:42.108 --> 00:03:45.447
Or I guess I'm still recovering
from the operation.

52
00:03:45.447 --> 00:03:47.147
I still see and hear things.

53
00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:48.448
That's enough.

54
00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:51.017
The more you give excuses,
the worse it gets.

55
00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:52.517
Okay.

56
00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:57.827
Did you get the ring?

57
00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:02.068
- Yes.
- I also put in the note you wrote.

58
00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:03.068
Did you read it?

59
00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:04.997
I wrote the note?

60
00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:09.807
You wrote it to me 13 years ago.

61
00:04:09.807 --> 00:04:10.807
Don't you remember?

62
00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:14.878
We've met before? 13 years ago?

63
00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:19.417
Your father was killed because
of a soldier who ran away, right?

64
00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:20.778
Yes.

65
00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:22.718
I also lost my father because of
a runaway soldier.

66
00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:24.818
And we met at the same
funeral site.

67
00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:26.287
You really don't remember?

68
00:04:27.318 --> 00:04:29.227
Well, I'm not sure.

69
00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:31.957
Do you remember me?

70
00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:35.698
Yes, I remember you.

71
00:04:38.798 --> 00:04:40.698
I don't even remember things from
a month ago.

72
00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:42.838
How can I remember things from
13 years ago?

73
00:04:42.937 --> 00:04:44.477
It'd be weird if I remember it.

74
00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:48.778
But you said you remember when
I was in the ICU.

75
00:04:49.448 --> 00:04:51.278
I never went to the ICU.

76
00:04:51.278 --> 00:04:53.347
No way. I saw you.

77
00:04:53.548 --> 00:04:55.088
Jae Chan, you might have
just seen things.

78
00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:57.347
People see things
right after the operation.

79
00:04:57.417 --> 00:04:58.687
Maybe you did the same.

80
00:05:03.158 --> 00:05:05.097
I'm sorry I don't remember.

81
00:05:30.818 --> 00:05:31.858
Are you not sleepy?

82
00:05:35.158 --> 00:05:36.628
Do you remember Chestnut?

83
00:05:37.088 --> 00:05:38.858
That boy you saw at Dad's funeral?

84
00:05:39.057 --> 00:05:40.097
Yes.

85
00:05:41.827 --> 00:05:42.968
That Chestnut...

86
00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:45.367
was Nam Hong Joo.

87
00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:46.997
You said Chestnut was a boy.

88
00:05:47.298 --> 00:05:48.408
I was wrong.

89
00:05:48.608 --> 00:05:50.638
Does Hong Joo know this too?
That you've met her before?

90
00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:52.977
Yes, she knows.

91
00:05:53.977 --> 00:05:55.678
- But she doesn't know.
- What does that mean?

92
00:05:58.448 --> 00:06:00.647
She said she doesn't remember
because it's been too long.

93
00:06:01.448 --> 00:06:04.318
How can she forget that?
Is it even possible?

94
00:06:04.457 --> 00:06:05.787
But you said it was only one day.

95
00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:07.457
It's possible she doesn't remember.

96
00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:10.858
But I remember every minute and
second from that day.

97
00:06:12.457 --> 00:06:14.327
Maybe it meant nothing to her.

98
00:06:17.068 --> 00:06:18.738
It's not that it's nothing,

99
00:06:19.238 --> 00:06:21.908
but maybe Hong Joo's
memory is just bad.

100
00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:26.307
- Seung Won.
- Yes?

101
00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:28.048
Turn off the light.

102
00:06:29.408 --> 00:06:30.448
I'll get some sleep.

103
00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:35.147
Why didn't you tell me this
before I sat down?

104
00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:51.968
(Seogu University Hospital)

105
00:07:03.408 --> 00:07:05.818
Is Yoo Man Ho admitted here?

106
00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:07.378
May I help you?

107
00:07:07.647 --> 00:07:10.048
I'm Prosecutor Jung from Hangang
District Prosecutors' Office.

108
00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:12.088
I have something to tell
Yoo Man Ho.

109
00:07:12.187 --> 00:07:15.158
Yoo Man Ho's prosecutor is
Prosecutor Shin.

110
00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:18.298
I'm in the same division with her.
We went to the same school.

111
00:07:19.198 --> 00:07:20.727
You have to show your ID.

112
00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:22.867
Nobody will believe you
if you just say it.

113
00:07:26.198 --> 00:07:27.198
Who are you?

114
00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:29.638
Impersonating a prosecutor can
lead you to scary results.

115
00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:31.537
You can be put in jail for up to
3 years or charged a fine of...

116
00:07:31.537 --> 00:07:33.477
7,000 dollars. Don't you know that?

117
00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:35.608
Of course I know. That's...

118
00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:37.647
Criminal Law Article 128.

119
00:07:37.647 --> 00:07:38.778
It's Article 118.

120
00:07:38.778 --> 00:07:41.647
Right, it's Article 118.
Of course I know it.

121
00:07:41.647 --> 00:07:43.187
You are impersonating!

122
00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:45.017
What kind of a prosecutor
doesn't know it?

123
00:07:45.318 --> 00:07:46.358
You little...

124
00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:50.287
Can I see him if his prosecutor
comes here?

125
00:07:50.488 --> 00:07:52.327
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

126
00:07:57.628 --> 00:07:58.867
(Prosecutor Shin)

127
00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:03.707
Hello, Prosecutor Shin?
This is Prosecutor Jung.

128
00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:10.108
I know it's you. You don't
have to say it so loudly.

129
00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:14.318
You haven't forgotten, right?
I wanted to speak to Yoo Man Ho.

130
00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:17.988
I know, I know. I'll visit you when
my work is over. Hang up now.

131
00:08:18.718 --> 00:08:23.028
Please come! I'm sorry
I took your time. I'm really sorry.

132
00:08:23.028 --> 00:08:24.128
I said, I know.

133
00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:28.128
He shouldn't be doing this
if he knows he's sorry.

134
00:08:28.128 --> 00:08:29.727
That's exactly what I mean.

135
00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:32.468
Why does he do things he'd be sorry
for? Why?

136
00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:35.167
Why? Why? Why?

137
00:08:37.207 --> 00:08:41.448
So it's true. She's shallow like
you said. She turned her back.

138
00:08:41.707 --> 00:08:44.247
Wait and see.
She'll fall in love with him again.

139
00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:45.577
(Prosecutor Lee Ji Kwang)

140
00:08:48.147 --> 00:08:49.247
Yes, Prosecutor Lee?

141
00:08:49.517 --> 00:08:52.617
Hyang Mi, I'm visiting
Prosecutor Jung.

142
00:08:52.818 --> 00:08:54.057
Do you know the number of
his room he's admitted?

143
00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:57.557
I don't know! I don't work for
Prosecutor Jung anymore.

144
00:08:57.557 --> 00:08:59.397
I'm working for Prosecutor Shin,
okay?

145
00:09:02.528 --> 00:09:04.667
Does she have to be so mean?

146
00:09:07.397 --> 00:09:09.068
How do I find him?

147
00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:14.037
It's Ms. Son! Ms. Son!

148
00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:19.647
Ms. Son! Ms. Son!

149
00:09:19.678 --> 00:09:21.647
Ms. Son!

150
00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:25.687
Look who's here.

151
00:09:26.488 --> 00:09:28.588
I didn't expect to see you here.

152
00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:30.888
Didn't you hear me calling you?

153
00:09:30.997 --> 00:09:32.897
No, I didn't hear anything.

154
00:09:33.397 --> 00:09:34.597
What brought you here?

155
00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:36.827
What do you mean?
I came to visit Jae Chan.

156
00:09:38.897 --> 00:09:40.937
Aren't you visiting him too?

157
00:09:41.008 --> 00:09:42.968
I'm here because...

158
00:09:42.968 --> 00:09:44.008
Mother!

159
00:09:45.437 --> 00:09:47.537
- Chan Woo.
- Is he your son?

160
00:09:47.577 --> 00:09:49.977
Yes, he is. Chan Woo, say hello.

161
00:09:49.977 --> 00:09:52.147
He's my colleague who works...

162
00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:55.088
Hello, Prosecutor Lee. I've heard
a lot about you.

163
00:09:55.088 --> 00:09:58.187
You're a smart boy!

164
00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:02.787
By the way, is he sick?

165
00:10:05.957 --> 00:10:07.597
He has chronic renal failure.

166
00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:15.408
He passed out from anemia when he
was eight, so we checked up on him.

167
00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:17.738
They told me he had kidney failure.

168
00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:22.408
He went through dialysis
for 3 to 4 times a week.

169
00:10:23.347 --> 00:10:25.647
It got worse lately, so he has to
go through that every day.

170
00:10:27.747 --> 00:10:30.388
We're waiting for transplants
because that's the only way.

171
00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:32.787
It's quite rough.

172
00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:37.557
I didn't know this because
you never told me.

173
00:10:38.457 --> 00:10:41.827
Before, when it rained,
I used to think,

174
00:10:44.497 --> 00:10:46.698
"Oh, no. I just washed my car."

175
00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:50.238
"Did I bring my umbrella?"

176
00:10:50.908 --> 00:10:52.437
Those things were what I thought.

177
00:10:53.678 --> 00:10:58.048
But now that my son is sick,
do you know what I think?

178
00:11:01.888 --> 00:11:04.048
"There must be many car accidents
because it's raining hard."

179
00:11:05.588 --> 00:11:09.827
"By any chance, will there be anyone
who can transplant a kidney..."

180
00:11:10.787 --> 00:11:12.997
"to my son among the dead?"

181
00:11:14.827 --> 00:11:16.997
I wish those things as I watch rain.

182
00:11:30.548 --> 00:11:33.747
The sound of ambulance means
someone is hurt.

183
00:11:35.117 --> 00:11:37.888
This could be a horrible tragedy
for someone else.

184
00:11:40.088 --> 00:11:41.787
But for people like us,

185
00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:45.698
it makes us have hope even if
it's just a faint one.

186
00:11:50.128 --> 00:11:51.798
I know I'm horrible.

187
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.367
No, you're not.

188
00:11:56.638 --> 00:11:57.638
You're not horrible.

189
00:12:00.108 --> 00:12:01.247
You heard nothing from me.

190
00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:06.117
I don't want to think of such
things even at work.

191
00:12:07.617 --> 00:12:09.588
Sure. I won't say anything.

192
00:12:19.097 --> 00:12:20.097
Sir.

193
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:23.267
Weren't you in the ICU recently
due to a gun shot?

194
00:12:23.727 --> 00:12:24.767
Yes.

195
00:12:25.367 --> 00:12:27.537
This was on the floor near your bed.

196
00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:32.778
It's an earring.

197
00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:49.327
Are you trying to play with me?

198
00:12:49.628 --> 00:12:51.798
I'm eating horrible food here.

199
00:12:51.798 --> 00:12:54.198
Oh, right. I couldn't think of that.

200
00:12:54.497 --> 00:12:56.968
Should I eat it outside?

201
00:12:56.997 --> 00:12:58.767
Just have it here,
so I can at least smell it.

202
00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:03.167
Here. You can smell it all you want.

203
00:13:06.278 --> 00:13:07.477
Come on.

204
00:13:07.807 --> 00:13:10.207
What? You said you
wanted to smell it.

205
00:13:13.477 --> 00:13:14.517
Oh, right.

206
00:13:17.658 --> 00:13:18.917
Is this yours, Hong Joo?

207
00:13:21.158 --> 00:13:22.758
Where did you find it?
I've been looking for it everywhere.

208
00:13:28.327 --> 00:13:30.298
It was on the floor of the ICU.

209
00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:37.408
Why are you lying to me?

210
00:13:38.037 --> 00:13:40.307
You came to see me at the ICU
when my operation was over, right?

211
00:13:42.347 --> 00:13:45.778
What is this?
Are you investigating me?

212
00:13:46.747 --> 00:13:48.718
You remember everything from
13 years ago, right?

213
00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:52.687
You remember everything including
Chestnut and the reservoir, right?

214
00:13:53.888 --> 00:13:57.128
I'm thirsty. I'll go get some water.

215
00:14:00.528 --> 00:14:01.897
Don't run away, and tell me now.

216
00:14:02.827 --> 00:14:05.238
You're making me think I saw
things due to my operation.

217
00:14:05.997 --> 00:14:07.537
I remember everything so clearly.

218
00:14:08.037 --> 00:14:10.508
You said it yourself that
you remember that day.

219
00:14:12.338 --> 00:14:13.477
Why are you avoiding it?

220
00:14:14.508 --> 00:14:16.008
Why do you act like you
don't remember anything?

221
00:14:34.097 --> 00:14:35.167
I remember it.

222
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:40.667
How can I forget you?

223
00:14:44.608 --> 00:14:48.108
You're the person who was with
me on the saddest day of my life.

224
00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:53.347
You're the one who created the day
I want to forget the most.

225
00:14:56.318 --> 00:14:57.818
Why would you want to
forget about the day?

226
00:14:57.988 --> 00:14:59.017
I...

227
00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:02.287
I almost killed you that day.

228
00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:04.727
What are you saying?
You saved me that day.

229
00:15:05.798 --> 00:15:07.827
I hesitated.

230
00:15:11.138 --> 00:15:15.307
I had a horrible thought
for a very short time.

231
00:15:16.307 --> 00:15:18.037
I was so mad at the guy.

232
00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:19.908
I thought...

233
00:15:21.378 --> 00:15:23.747
it wouldn't really matter
if you died with him.

234
00:15:26.178 --> 00:15:30.187
Wake up! Please!

235
00:15:31.888 --> 00:15:35.787
It was horrible for me
when you got out of the water.

236
00:15:37.997 --> 00:15:39.028
I thought...

237
00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:42.327
I killed a person.

238
00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:48.437
My hands are trembling thinking
of what happened that day.

239
00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.977
I know my excuses
don't really work.

240
00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:01.048
But I lost someone whom
I really love.

241
00:16:03.048 --> 00:16:06.517
His absence was too big for me.
I couldn't stand that.

242
00:16:08.687 --> 00:16:10.727
So I filled his absence with
my anger.

243
00:16:11.628 --> 00:16:13.957
The regrets remained with me
like some scars.

244
00:16:18.997 --> 00:16:21.267
You 13 years ago...

245
00:16:23.738 --> 00:16:24.878
is a scar to me.

246
00:16:27.037 --> 00:16:28.147
A very deep wound.

247
00:16:33.178 --> 00:16:34.218
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:36.318 --> 00:16:38.718
I thought it would be okay
if I acted like I don't remember.

249
00:16:42.658 --> 00:16:46.528
But seeing how it hurts me so much,
I guess I was wrong.

250
00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:08.784
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] E20 While You Were Sleeping "A boy meets a girl"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

251
00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:23.468
What is it?
Why didn't you pick up the call?

252
00:17:24.198 --> 00:17:25.238
What brought you here?

253
00:17:26.997 --> 00:17:29.867
You told me to come over.
You said you want to see Yoo Man Ho.

254
00:17:31.178 --> 00:17:33.937
Right! I forgot about that. Hey...

255
00:17:33.937 --> 00:17:35.948
Let me go fetch my notes.

256
00:17:56.298 --> 00:17:58.968
You've written so much. Are you
going to tell him all that?

257
00:18:00.068 --> 00:18:01.108
Yes, I am.

258
00:18:02.408 --> 00:18:05.307
Don't go too far. He's about to die.

259
00:18:07.307 --> 00:18:08.307
Mr. Yoo Man Ho.

260
00:18:10.147 --> 00:18:11.747
I'm Prosecutor Jung,

261
00:18:11.747 --> 00:18:13.318
who was in charge of
your daughter's murder case.

262
00:18:14.787 --> 00:18:18.718
I'm here to clarify the things you
got wrong about the investigation.

263
00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:28.227
But I lost someone whom
I really love.

264
00:18:29.867 --> 00:18:33.397
His absence was too big for me.
I couldn't stand that.

265
00:18:35.068 --> 00:18:37.238
So I filled his absence with
my anger.

266
00:18:37.878 --> 00:18:40.238
The regrets remained with me
like some scars.

267
00:18:49.617 --> 00:18:50.687
Mr. Yoo.

268
00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:57.187
I know why you were so upset.

269
00:19:01.827 --> 00:19:05.397
Someone killed your beautiful and
precious daughter out of anger.

270
00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:06.497
You couldn't understand that.

271
00:19:08.238 --> 00:19:10.437
So you must have hated Do Hak Young.

272
00:19:10.707 --> 00:19:12.707
You must have also hated me for
setting that man free.

273
00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:14.647
I understand why you were upset.

274
00:19:19.178 --> 00:19:23.388
I have met many people around
Yoo Su Kyung for this case.

275
00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:28.258
Everyone around her praised,
respected, and loved her.

276
00:19:28.457 --> 00:19:31.658
Su Kyung is such an honest girl
that she doesn't need the laws.

277
00:19:31.658 --> 00:19:34.667
Yoo Su Kyung gave me her autograph.

278
00:19:34.727 --> 00:19:38.097
She never refused any of my
autograph requests.

279
00:19:38.138 --> 00:19:39.238
Please have it.

280
00:19:39.338 --> 00:19:40.698
Thank you so much.

281
00:19:41.408 --> 00:19:44.037
She always gave me something
to drink whenever I visited.

282
00:19:44.378 --> 00:19:45.638
She was a nice person.

283
00:19:47.178 --> 00:19:49.477
Even the prime suspect,
Do Hak Young,

284
00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.847
said your daughter was nice.

285
00:19:53.417 --> 00:19:56.017
This was the most crucial
evidence that she was not killed.

286
00:20:11.838 --> 00:20:13.798
I had to tell you this.

287
00:20:15.338 --> 00:20:18.108
I hoped you wouldn't misunderstand
your daughter who was really nice.

288
00:20:19.838 --> 00:20:22.048
She wasn't someone that would
make others resentful.

289
00:20:54.477 --> 00:20:55.477
Prosecutor Jung.

290
00:20:56.108 --> 00:20:57.108
Yes, ma'am.

291
00:21:02.548 --> 00:21:03.617
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:05.588 --> 00:21:08.957
I know my apology doesn't mean much.

293
00:21:09.957 --> 00:21:11.097
But I'm...

294
00:21:12.198 --> 00:21:13.358
really sorry.

295
00:21:18.298 --> 00:21:19.338
That note.

296
00:21:20.397 --> 00:21:21.807
May I read it?

297
00:21:22.537 --> 00:21:23.968
I want to read it all slowly.

298
00:21:25.977 --> 00:21:29.477
I've only heard things
from Lawyer Lee.

299
00:21:30.278 --> 00:21:32.647
Now I want to know
what your thoughts are.

300
00:21:34.988 --> 00:21:36.017
Sure.

301
00:21:39.557 --> 00:21:42.128
Thank you so much for saying...

302
00:21:46.198 --> 00:21:47.597
that my daughter is nice.

303
00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:51.298
No worries.

304
00:22:00.678 --> 00:22:02.008
Thank you for coming today.

305
00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:04.878
Why did you change your
attitude towards them?

306
00:22:06.218 --> 00:22:07.218
What attitude?

307
00:22:07.278 --> 00:22:11.617
You wanted to accuse him
and ask things.

308
00:22:12.917 --> 00:22:15.588
Why did you suddenly soften up?

309
00:22:19.128 --> 00:22:20.298
I just thought...

310
00:22:24.537 --> 00:22:26.997
I'm not better than anyone.

311
00:22:27.867 --> 00:22:28.867
What are you saying?

312
00:22:31.638 --> 00:22:32.638
What are you doing?

313
00:22:37.878 --> 00:22:39.948
What are you doing!
Prosecutor Jung!

314
00:22:40.878 --> 00:22:42.588
Hey, Jae Chan!

315
00:23:01.707 --> 00:23:04.608
Sir, I'm sorry, but could you go
to Seogu University Hospital?

316
00:23:04.838 --> 00:23:05.878
Sure.

317
00:23:43.477 --> 00:23:44.517
(Little Pup)

318
00:23:49.548 --> 00:23:51.358
- Hong Joo.
- Are you crazy?

319
00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:53.117
Why did you come out like this?

320
00:23:54.088 --> 00:23:55.187
Get back inside.

321
00:23:56.287 --> 00:23:57.588
Visiting hour is over.

322
00:23:58.198 --> 00:23:59.327
Are you here to see me?

323
00:23:59.827 --> 00:24:02.968
You're were going out to find me.

324
00:24:04.028 --> 00:24:05.037
It's raining.

325
00:24:06.138 --> 00:24:08.068
You didn't even know where I was.

326
00:24:08.908 --> 00:24:10.037
Did you see me in your dream?

327
00:24:10.307 --> 00:24:11.678
Yes, I saw you in my dream.

328
00:24:12.278 --> 00:24:13.937
You got soaked by the rain
when you're so sick.

329
00:24:15.108 --> 00:24:16.147
You were lost.

330
00:24:18.647 --> 00:24:22.017
You were out of your mind
in my dream.

331
00:24:26.187 --> 00:24:28.628
You had fever, and
your wounds were infected.

332
00:24:29.957 --> 00:24:32.528
But you were foolishly looking
for me in the rain.

333
00:24:37.028 --> 00:24:38.068
Hong Joo.

334
00:24:38.968 --> 00:24:39.968
Hong Joo!

335
00:24:50.707 --> 00:24:54.747
So? Did I end up finding you
in your dream?

336
00:24:55.017 --> 00:24:56.187
Yes, you did.

337
00:24:57.888 --> 00:24:59.187
But you were half dead.

338
00:25:24.247 --> 00:25:25.278
Jae Chan.

339
00:25:27.278 --> 00:25:28.318
Jae Chan!

340
00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:36.957
(You and I get to meet each other
no matter what happens.)

341
00:25:39.858 --> 00:25:42.628
What did I say when I found you?
Did you hear that too?

342
00:25:45.198 --> 00:25:46.638
You felt the same way as I did...

343
00:25:48.508 --> 00:25:49.667
13 years ago.

344
00:25:52.577 --> 00:25:54.278
I was just like you.

345
00:25:55.548 --> 00:25:56.908
But I wasn't being honest.

346
00:25:57.778 --> 00:26:00.517
What do you mean?

347
00:26:01.187 --> 00:26:02.588
I hesitated too.

348
00:26:04.287 --> 00:26:06.917
Save that man and me.

349
00:26:07.388 --> 00:26:08.388
Save both of us...

350
00:26:09.928 --> 00:26:11.028
if you don't want to regret.

351
00:26:12.097 --> 00:26:13.097
I trust you will save us.

352
00:26:16.097 --> 00:26:17.667
When I ran into water to save
the man,

353
00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:20.238
I also hesitated
for a very short time.

354
00:26:21.937 --> 00:26:23.138
Should I just get out?

355
00:26:28.147 --> 00:26:29.508
I was also very upset...

356
00:26:31.117 --> 00:26:32.647
like you that time.

357
00:26:35.948 --> 00:26:39.687
You said in my dream that
you were angry like I was.

358
00:26:40.858 --> 00:26:43.028
You were fighting with yourself...

359
00:26:43.028 --> 00:26:44.057
It was really tough.

360
00:26:45.557 --> 00:26:46.758
I was like you too.

361
00:26:48.468 --> 00:26:50.028
It was a scar for me too.

362
00:26:55.408 --> 00:26:58.977
So I tried forgetting about it,
but I got reminded because of you.

363
00:27:02.647 --> 00:27:05.847
But in the end, we made the
decision.

364
00:27:07.178 --> 00:27:09.048
That we should not cross any lines.

365
00:27:09.847 --> 00:27:12.888
I ran into the water, and
you pulled the rope.

366
00:27:13.858 --> 00:27:17.457
I saved the police man,
and you saved me.

367
00:27:20.897 --> 00:27:23.667
So? Did I say like this
in your dream?

368
00:27:30.838 --> 00:27:31.878
And then you...

369
00:27:33.138 --> 00:27:35.048
told me not to avoid anything.

370
00:27:36.378 --> 00:27:37.608
You told me not to run away.

371
00:27:39.818 --> 00:27:43.787
You also told me not to disappear
when you're looking for me.

372
00:27:50.687 --> 00:27:52.597
So how do you reply in your dream?

373
00:29:28.028 --> 00:29:29.088
It's so good to see you again,

374
00:29:30.888 --> 00:29:32.097
Hong Joo.

375
00:29:35.628 --> 00:29:36.667
Nice to see you again.

376
00:29:37.838 --> 00:29:38.937
Jung Jae Chan.
