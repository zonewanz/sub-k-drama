00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.291


2
00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:06.940
(Last week)

3
00:00:07.527 --> 00:00:08.790
What are you filming?

4
00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.540
(Yuchen Gang, only their appearance is thuggish.)

5
00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:16.010
(Mungdol Gang, we are the crazy ones in this area.)

6
00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:17.300
Okay. Let's go.

7
00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:21.090
(Police Department, make no mistake. They're not in a gang.)

8
00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:24.340
(Real Criminal Variety, City of Crime)

9
00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.560
(Daniel, the most sought-after boss, came to take over a new gang.)

10
00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.700
(Daniel took the role of a boss for Mungdol Gang.)

11
00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:36.200
(Yeon Soo, the irresistibly cute boss, joined Team Police.)

12
00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:37.550
It's Ms. Tuna.

13
00:00:37.557 --> 00:00:41.410
(Energetic Sa Yeon became the boss of Yuchen Gang.)

14
00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:45.290
(Sae Ho was recruited to Mungdol Gang as the youngest member.)

15
00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:47.550
(And three teams were formed.)

16
00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.560
Let me explain...

17
00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.450
- the rules of Boss' Unfair Deal. - Unfair Deal?

18
00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:55.790
The boss may equally distribute 1,000 dollars to the gang members.

19
00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.890
Or the boss may distribute it unfairly however he or she likes.

20
00:00:59.913 --> 00:01:03.010
Should you feel suspicious about the boss' intentions,

21
00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:06.800
you may use the Revolution Card only once until the final race.

22
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.030
You may find out how much you received.

23
00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:11.170
If you find out that the boss distributed fairly,

24
00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:14.020
all distributed capital will return to the boss.

25
00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:16.690
If the boss distributed unfairly, the revolt is successful.

26
00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:20.100
The boss' capital is divided equally among the members.

27
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.330
(We'll stir up a revolt. We don't even need to think about it.)

28
00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:26.750
(The revolt was a success, and 3 members took Sa Yeon's capital.)

29
00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:30.160
(Remaining bosses are Yeon Soo and Daniel.)

30
00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:32.940
(Should I trust Daniel or not?)

31
00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.390
(I don't know what to do. It's up to you, So Min.)

32
00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:39.700
(So Min declares a revolt which was expected from her reputation.)

33
00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:42.750
(Mungdol Gang has used the Revolution Card on Daniel.)

34
00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.270
You have used your Revolution Card.

35
00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:47.890
- Really? - I'll announce Daniel's capital.

36
00:01:47.894 --> 00:01:48.940
How much of 1,200 dollars...

37
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.610
(Boss Kang earned the gang's trust with his innocent eyes and smile.)

38
00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:58.420
(I completely trust Boss Kang.)

39
00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.550
I bet he equally distributed the capital.

40
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.640
(Trust me. Everyone got 300 dollars.)

41
00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:07.590
(If he distributed the capital fairly, he will keep 1,200 dollars.)

42
00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:11.650
- The amount Daniel has... - Listen to him.

43
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:14.550
(The amount Daniel has...)

44
00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:15.670
is 1,170 dollars.

45
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:19.920
- Didn't I tell you? - Hey.

46
00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:20.970
(Boss Kang embezzled the capital.)

47
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:24.510
- Look! Didn't I tell you? - Daniel.

48
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:27.660
I told you so. Sae Ho, didn't I tell you this would happen?

49
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.280
(Daniel only gave them 10 dollars each and kept the rest.)

50
00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:30.600
(Four hours ago when dividing the capital)

51
00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:31.750
How will you distribute the capital?

52
00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:38.120
Well... I'll treat them to a meal later.

53
00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:40.930
I'll give them 10 dollar each.

54
00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:43.310
(He kept the capital to himself with his broad smile.)

55
00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:46.010
I told you that we should use the card!

56
00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.950
- See what I mean? - I was skeptical at first.

57
00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:49.950
See?

58
00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:52.400
(The betrayal of the boss he trusted gives him the chills.)

59
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.490
He even got teary-eyed because I didn't trust him.

60
00:02:56.496 --> 00:02:57.490
- He had 1,170 dollars? - Goodness.

61
00:02:57.497 --> 00:02:58.580
(Ji Hyo, Sae Ho, and So Min get 400 dollars.)

62
00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:02.030
Hey, our team has been nothing but trusting of each other so far.

63
00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:03.470
You can use it by all means. I'm fine.

64
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.650
(She's laid-back.)

65
00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:06.330
You can use it.

66
00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.520
You should just go ahead and use it. It's not like we can win the game.

67
00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.540
(What? He's flustered.)

68
00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:13.240
- Out of nowhere, Yeon Soo... - This is driving me crazy.

69
00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:15.240
Why are you playing a mind game all of a sudden?

70
00:03:15.248 --> 00:03:17.680
No, that's not my intention. I'm not playing any mind games.

71
00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:18.880
- She told me to use the card. - Please do.

72
00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:20.350
Yeon Soo...

73
00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:22.000
(She has a face that no one can doubt.)

74
00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:23.840
- All right. - We...

75
00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:27.190
- will use the Revolution Card. - We'll use it.

76
00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:28.240
(They decide after giving a lot of thought.)

77
00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:29.720
(Team Police also uses the Revolution Card.)

78
00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.530
If Yeon Soo gave each of you 250 dollars equally,

79
00:03:32.532 --> 00:03:34.360
she will take the entire capital of 1,000 dollars.

80
00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:35.530
- Okay. - Then it'd be great.

81
00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:36.710
- Really? - I can give her the money.

82
00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:42.290
- I'll announce the amount now. - Okay.

83
00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.310
The amount Yeon Soo has...

84
00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:51.650
(How much did Yeon Soo take from 1,000 dollars?)

85
00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:52.650
is 970 dollars.

86
00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:54.100
(She has 970 dollars.)

87
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:56.750
- Unbelievable! - Gosh.

88
00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:59.120
- You just gave me goose bumps. - Didn't I tell you this earlier?

89
00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:01.320
I questioned if she gave us only 10 dollars each and kept the rest.

90
00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:03.060
I cannot believe this!

91
00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:07.200
(It seemed she would never betray the gang members.)

92
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.520
(However, she asked about the minimum amount she must give them.)

93
00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:13.380
(She gave them only 10 dollars which was the minimum amount.)

94
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.920
(There's no way the guys are going to start a revolution against me.)

95
00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:18.670
- Yeon Soo! - She's worse than Sa Yeon.

96
00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:20.830
She's worse than me. She's more cold-blooded than me.

97
00:04:21.447 --> 00:04:22.510
You're something else, Yeon Soo.

98
00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:24.080
Jong Kook, we could have been in big trouble.

99
00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:27.320
- Let's go to the Room of Truth. - Okay.

100
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.320
- Bring it to me. - Hey, bring it.

101
00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:32.240
- We have a lot of empty gourds. - Let me see your head.

102
00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.520
- I can't trust her. - This could've been a disaster.

103
00:04:34.527 --> 00:04:35.570
(Team Police's revolt was a success.)

104
00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:38.210
- Everyone. - Yes.

105
00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:40.450
Today's final race is...

106
00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:42.460
Empty the Safe.

107
00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:44.930
(Empty the Safe)

108
00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:46.270
(What safe?)

109
00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:47.320
Safe?

110
00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:49.190
Let's empty it out.

111
00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.510
The safes with all the capital you have earned today are hidden...

112
00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:56.310
in each gang's headquarters.

113
00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.210
(The safes with all of their capitals are hidden.)

114
00:04:58.217 --> 00:05:01.150
The team that finds 1 of the 2 opposing gangs' safes...

115
00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:04.020
and that obtains the capital will win the race.

116
00:05:04.023 --> 00:05:05.820
- This is a team match then. - You're right.

117
00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:06.870
However,

118
00:05:08.127 --> 00:05:09.520
the capital of the safe will be...

119
00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.530
given to the member that opened the safe.

120
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:17.380
(Only 1 member who opens the safe will acquire the capital.)

121
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.180
There's a twist at the end.

122
00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:22.270
(They chuckle at the same time.)

123
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:24.740
Whenever we play races like this, why do you have that look?

124
00:05:24.744 --> 00:05:26.140
(It's his instinct to betray.)

125
00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:28.140
- I understand the rules now. - But where are the safes?

126
00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:29.940
- We have to find them. - The locations of the safes...

127
00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.210
- We have to find those safes? - Yes, we need to find them.

128
00:05:32.218 --> 00:05:34.680
(Every member of Yuchen Gang including the boss is funny.)

129
00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:39.170
You can get the locations when you remove opposing teams' name tags.

130
00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:42.690
Choose two people who will carry the location of the safe...

131
00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:44.860
and two people who will carry the password of the safe.

132
00:05:44.864 --> 00:05:46.680
Then hide the information in the name tags.

133
00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:49.830
Jong Kook, it's time to use your strength.

134
00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:51.180
That's right.

135
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.890
He will rip your name tags.

136
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.050
I will call them to the Room of Truth.

137
00:05:56.643 --> 00:05:58.940
When the race ends, the members of the winning team...

138
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:02.260
can exchange 50 dollars for 1 Running Ball.

139
00:06:02.582 --> 00:06:04.260
Running Balls will go into the lottery machine.

140
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.710
The one whose Running Ball gets picked...

141
00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.370
will become the winner and receive the team's entire capital.

142
00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:13.620
That's incredible.

143
00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:15.520
(The scale of prize money is like that of a blockbuster.)

144
00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:16.670
That's amazing.

145
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.960
Now, please move to your headquarters.

146
00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:21.060
Let's move.

147
00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:22.260
- Let's go! - The scale is big today.

148
00:06:22.268 --> 00:06:23.400
It's very big.

149
00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:26.380
(Which member is destined to win the safe?)

150
00:06:27.507 --> 00:06:29.270
(The 3rd floor of the main building, the headquarters of Mungdol Gang)

151
00:06:29.275 --> 00:06:30.760
- Where is our safe? - Here it is.

152
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.510
It's really big.

153
00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:34.080
(The safe is bigger and fancier than they expected.)

154
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.990
- We need to hide it. - That's right.

155
00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:38.500
Perhaps, we can stack chairs around it.

156
00:06:39.252 --> 00:06:41.520
- Shall we put it in a box? - That's good.

157
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:42.750
Let's put it in a box.

158
00:06:42.755 --> 00:06:43.940
This is a good idea.

159
00:06:44.223 --> 00:06:45.620
- Let's do this. - This is a good idea.

160
00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.460
- This works. - This is a good idea.

161
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.120
(Even if they hide the safe in a box...)

162
00:06:49.128 --> 00:06:50.960
What do we do if Jong Kook runs with it?

163
00:06:50.963 --> 00:06:52.180
(What if he takes the entire safe?)

164
00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:53.950
It's very possible.

165
00:06:54.534 --> 00:06:56.610
It's dreadful to think about it.

166
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.570
I want to do well today.

167
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:00.550
He will go, "Stay away."

168
00:07:01.074 --> 00:07:03.000
I want to rip someone's name tag today.

169
00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.260
(He suddenly shows his puppy dog face.)

170
00:07:04.277 --> 00:07:06.710
It's your first time participating in a race.

171
00:07:06.713 --> 00:07:08.860
When you are in the same team as Ji Hyo,

172
00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:10.450
you can get scolded a lot.

173
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.130
(You can get scolded a lot.)

174
00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:14.680
You can get scolded a lot.

175
00:07:14.687 --> 00:07:17.820
She does it to keep up the fighting spirit.

176
00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:19.690
- Remember that. - Daniel.

177
00:07:19.692 --> 00:07:21.260
- We need to win. - That's right.

178
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.940
That's right. Not only that,

179
00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:25.030
but you betrayed the team.

180
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:27.060
(Daniel currently has zero amount of money.)

181
00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:28.810
You have zero amount of money.

182
00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:32.830
We only need to make it less noticeable.

183
00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.640
- I know what you are talking about. - You do, right?

184
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.490
- All right. - This is simple.

185
00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:38.690
- This is a bit scary. - Let's go this way.

186
00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:41.280
- Let's go. - Team Police will win.

187
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.360
(They are the police, right?)

188
00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:44.310
- How about here? - Here.

189
00:07:44.317 --> 00:07:45.560
Here.

190
00:07:45.585 --> 00:07:47.130
Let's bury it here.

191
00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:49.080
Shall we put it against the equipment?

192
00:07:49.088 --> 00:07:52.000
(They look like the culprits.)

193
00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:53.820
All right.

194
00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:57.020
We only need to make it less noticeable.

195
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:58.440
That's good enough.

196
00:07:59.198 --> 00:08:01.610
We will have the countdown for the race.

197
00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:04.830
- Let's go. - Let's go.

198
00:08:04.837 --> 00:08:07.200
(2 members carry the location, and 2 members carry the password.)

199
00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:09.140
- 4, 3. - Let's hide it now.

200
00:08:09.142 --> 00:08:10.770
(2 members carry the location, and 2 members carry the password.)

201
00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:13.010
2, 1. The race begins.

202
00:08:13.012 --> 00:08:14.060
Start!

203
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.510
Okay. Let's go.

204
00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:18.630
(Who is destined to rob the safes?)

205
00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:22.730
Maybe it's because of this team, but I feel righteous today.

206
00:08:22.755 --> 00:08:24.000
That's right.

207
00:08:24.824 --> 00:08:26.390
I will use my strength.

208
00:08:26.392 --> 00:08:28.020
(Rip name tags for the location and password of the safes.)

209
00:08:28.027 --> 00:08:30.070
- We should go out. - We should go out.

210
00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:32.810
We should go out.

211
00:08:33.699 --> 00:08:35.200
- Listen. - Come here.

212
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:36.560
(There is no other choice.)

213
00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:39.800
We need to hurry up and rip the other team members' name tags.

214
00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:41.340
Standing by won't get us anywhere.

215
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.850
- We need to rip the name tags. - We do.

216
00:08:44.944 --> 00:08:47.070
Gosh, we need to cover a lot of ground.

217
00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:48.630
(Mungdol Gang approaches the headquarters of Yuchen Gang.)

218
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.310
Be careful.

219
00:08:50.316 --> 00:08:52.900
They must be around here, seeing as there are cameras.

220
00:08:52.952 --> 00:08:54.280
Be careful. Come here.

221
00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:55.700
(Something doesn't feel right.)

222
00:08:58.991 --> 00:09:00.190
(What?)

223
00:09:00.193 --> 00:09:02.610
(Who is that?)

224
00:09:04.797 --> 00:09:06.660
(How did he find me?)

225
00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:07.880
That's clear glass.

226
00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:10.250
- You can't hide behind it. - Okay.

227
00:09:11.237 --> 00:09:12.470
I can see them well.

228
00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:14.390
(Let's have a round.)

229
00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:15.700
Sae Ho.

230
00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:17.620
Why don't we fight 1 on 1?

231
00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:19.760
1 on 1?

232
00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:21.510
- What do you think? - I am for it.

233
00:09:21.514 --> 00:09:23.130
(1 on 1? I am for it.)

234
00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:25.230
- I am for it. - This is my fight.

235
00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:26.810
Stay out of it. It's a 1 on 1 fight.

236
00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:28.080
(The old man with 7 years of experience, Seok Jin)

237
00:09:28.087 --> 00:09:29.130
This is so sudden.

238
00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:31.790
Sae Ho, we are done if you get your name tag ripped.

239
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:33.140
(The young man with a relatively fit body, Sae Ho)

240
00:09:34.227 --> 00:09:36.770
(Team Police is on the move.)

241
00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:40.750
They are here. I can see them.

242
00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:43.460
(The two teams are together.)

243
00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:44.700
How long do you think...

244
00:09:44.704 --> 00:09:47.070
it will take me to go to the other side?

245
00:09:47.073 --> 00:09:48.750
It's too dangerous.

246
00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:50.150
It's too dangerous to go alone.

247
00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:51.240
I have an idea.

248
00:09:51.244 --> 00:09:53.520
Stay together for a second.

249
00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:54.710
Stay together.

250
00:09:54.714 --> 00:09:55.760
(Jong Kook carries out his plan.)

251
00:09:56.716 --> 00:10:00.630
(He plans to attack the two teams from behind.)

252
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.080
(It will be easy if the plan succeeds.)

253
00:10:02.088 --> 00:10:03.500
I hope they hide well.

254
00:10:04.657 --> 00:10:07.510
I am sorry. I work out.

255
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.710
I do, too.

256
00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:10.320
Come on.

257
00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:12.040
(The situation is a tinderbox.)

258
00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:15.600
It will be useless if Jong Kook attacks alone.

259
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:17.160
When Jong Kook shows up...

260
00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:19.150
We need to divert their attention.

261
00:10:19.305 --> 00:10:20.850
The other team has arrived. They are on the other side.

262
00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:23.470
- They are on the other side. - Come on.

263
00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:26.490
(They begin to divert their attention.)

264
00:10:26.812 --> 00:10:28.890
Are they on the other side? Hold on.

265
00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:31.630
- See you later. - Come here.

266
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:33.710
Let's go to the other side.

267
00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:34.850
Go slowly.

268
00:10:34.854 --> 00:10:36.230
(They move to the other side to avoid Team Police.)

269
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.090
Jong Kook is here! Jong Kook is here!

270
00:10:40.092 --> 00:10:42.470
Come. Jong Kook is here.

271
00:10:42.728 --> 00:10:44.660
- Jong Kook is here! - Sa Yeon.

272
00:10:44.664 --> 00:10:46.360
- Hurry up. - Catch him. Catch Jong Kook.

273
00:10:46.365 --> 00:10:47.980
We need to catch Jong Kook.

274
00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:49.830
- Hurry up. - Catch him. Catch Jong Kook.

275
00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:51.070
(He falls back calmly.)

276
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.650
Catch Jong Kook.

277
00:10:52.972 --> 00:10:54.040
(Ripping)

278
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.120
Catch him.

279
00:10:55.608 --> 00:10:58.290
(Yu Chen is out.)

280
00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:00.520
Hurry up.

281
00:11:00.947 --> 00:11:02.080
Catch him.

282
00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:04.130
(The speed is unbelievable.)

283
00:11:05.718 --> 00:11:06.950
No, no.

284
00:11:06.953 --> 00:11:08.330
Rip his name tag.

285
00:11:08.454 --> 00:11:10.130
Come on, Sa Yeon.

286
00:11:10.323 --> 00:11:12.350
Seok Jin, help her.

287
00:11:12.358 --> 00:11:14.210
- He got him. - I got him.

288
00:11:14.994 --> 00:11:16.220
(Jong Kook and Sa Yeon rip the name tags at the same time.)

289
00:11:16.228 --> 00:11:17.380
We have this.

290
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:21.280
(What is going on?)

291
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:23.010
He is unbelievable.

292
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:24.250
We need to watch the video again.

293
00:11:24.337 --> 00:11:26.280
- He is brutal. - We need to watch the video again.

294
00:11:26.472 --> 00:11:27.470
Sa Yeon.

295
00:11:27.473 --> 00:11:29.390
Seok Jin, help her.

296
00:11:29.542 --> 00:11:30.540
He got him.

297
00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:32.990
(The two name tags were ripped at the same time.)

298
00:11:33.913 --> 00:11:36.110
- I will rip a name tag later. - I did a good job, right?

299
00:11:36.115 --> 00:11:37.180
Yes, you did.

300
00:11:37.183 --> 00:11:39.180
I did my best.

301
00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:40.870
- Seriously. - That's right.

302
00:11:41.687 --> 00:11:44.150
Should Seok Jin and I divide the money in half?

303
00:11:44.156 --> 00:11:45.270
(What should we do with the money?)

304
00:11:45.358 --> 00:11:47.540
What are the rules? I don't know them well.

305
00:11:47.927 --> 00:11:49.690
Can't you see that there are four members?

306
00:11:49.695 --> 00:11:52.780
- What should we do? - We now need...

307
00:11:52.932 --> 00:11:56.560
to rip the name tag of someone who carries the location.

308
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:59.100
- They are divided into two groups. - We are equally matched.

309
00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:00.600
It's Haha and Se Chan versus you and I.

310
00:12:00.606 --> 00:12:01.750
There is Yeon Soo.

311
00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:04.020
- Good luck. - Let's take a look at them.

312
00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:05.460
Jong Kook is incredible.

313
00:12:05.578 --> 00:12:08.230
(They have the password and location of Yuchen Gang's safe.)

314
00:12:08.514 --> 00:12:10.180
Move quickly. They will come to rip your name tags.

315
00:12:10.182 --> 00:12:12.330
- Wait a minute. - Let's go together.

316
00:12:12.351 --> 00:12:16.480
Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Sa Yeon are out.

317
00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:18.850
(Mungdol Gang hears the announcement.)

318
00:12:18.858 --> 00:12:21.640
(They have a mental breakdown.)

319
00:12:21.994 --> 00:12:23.470
We need to move quickly.

320
00:12:23.562 --> 00:12:24.560
We need to move quickly.

321
00:12:24.563 --> 00:12:25.990
- We can't wait any longer. - We need to move.

322
00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:28.460
- I can't believe Jong Kook is out. - The ace members...

323
00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:30.080
- are out. - We have a chance of winning.

324
00:12:30.603 --> 00:12:31.830
We need to find them.

325
00:12:31.837 --> 00:12:34.570
(Yuchen Gang chases after Team Police.)

326
00:12:34.573 --> 00:12:36.750
Where are they? They are gone.

327
00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:38.290
Is there...

328
00:12:38.444 --> 00:12:39.810
Is there a snack bar in here?

329
00:12:39.812 --> 00:12:41.230
(Team Police follows Yeon Soo into a building.)

330
00:12:41.714 --> 00:12:43.260
There is no snack bar here.

331
00:12:44.083 --> 00:12:45.110
Give it to me.

332
00:12:45.117 --> 00:12:47.000
- Isn't this the annex? - Give it to me.

333
00:12:47.319 --> 00:12:49.370
The annex is over there. Isn't this the main building?

334
00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:52.540
(They are at the wrong place.)

335
00:12:54.293 --> 00:12:56.240
- The annex is over there. - I am sorry.

336
00:12:56.429 --> 00:12:58.110
Hold on, Haha.

337
00:12:58.364 --> 00:13:00.060
We could have wandered into the basement.

338
00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:01.730
123455?

339
00:13:01.734 --> 00:13:03.330
(What's the password?)

340
00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:04.900
Why would you try to memorize it?

341
00:13:04.904 --> 00:13:06.070
123455.

342
00:13:06.072 --> 00:13:07.170
(The 1st one to open the safe wins the prize money.)

343
00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:09.340
- Let's disperse. - Let's disperse.

344
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:10.670
(They decide to disperse.)

345
00:13:10.676 --> 00:13:13.360
We will attack each other if we stay together.

346
00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:16.760
Let's disperse and go to the location on our own.

347
00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:18.630
- Let's go. - One.

348
00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:20.410
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - Let's go.

349
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:24.590
(They bring their hands together and go their own ways.)

350
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.740
I am going.

351
00:13:26.192 --> 00:13:28.210
(Nervous)

352
00:13:29.962 --> 00:13:31.330
We need to rip someone's name tag.

353
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.280
(Where is Team Police?)

354
00:13:35.868 --> 00:13:37.880
(They find Yeon Soo.)

355
00:13:38.938 --> 00:13:41.340
(She runs into Yuchen Gang as soon as the team disperses.)

356
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.490
Run, run.

357
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.440
(It's better to stay together.)

358
00:13:45.444 --> 00:13:46.660
Catch her.

359
00:13:50.082 --> 00:13:51.450
(She runs as fast as she can.)

360
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.630
What should I do?

361
00:13:52.718 --> 00:13:54.830
I got you. I am sorry, Yeon Soo.

362
00:13:55.054 --> 00:13:56.530
- We don't have much time. - Yeon Soo.

363
00:13:56.956 --> 00:13:58.140
We don't have much time.

364
00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:01.110
I am sorry, Yeon Soo.

365
00:14:01.327 --> 00:14:02.460
Is it the location?

366
00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:04.190
(Yuchen Gang acquires the location of Team Police's safe.)

367
00:14:04.196 --> 00:14:06.610
"In the forest next to the pavilion in front of the annex".

368
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.210
- Let's go. - What's going on?

369
00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:11.620
Everyone is headed to the safe.

370
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:15.120
(Who is destined to open the safe first?)

371
00:14:16.342 --> 00:14:18.120
Let's go down.

372
00:14:18.344 --> 00:14:19.440
So Min.

373
00:14:19.445 --> 00:14:20.660
So Min, come here.

374
00:14:20.813 --> 00:14:22.410
We will move separately.

375
00:14:22.414 --> 00:14:23.990
See you down there.

376
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:27.950
Let's catch someone.

377
00:14:27.953 --> 00:14:30.100
(They divide into 2 groups to reassemble later.)

378
00:14:30.823 --> 00:14:32.370
Good idea, Cho Daniel.

379
00:14:32.458 --> 00:14:33.690
I like "Cho Daniel".

380
00:14:33.692 --> 00:14:37.220
(The Daniels are in control.)

381
00:14:37.229 --> 00:14:40.480
(They strut with confidence.)

382
00:14:42.201 --> 00:14:43.610
This is driving me crazy.

383
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.700
Let's go down.

384
00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:47.350
(Where are the preys?)

385
00:14:51.076 --> 00:14:53.890
(They spot the first prey.)

386
00:14:55.748 --> 00:14:58.710
(The members of Yuchen Gang and Mungdol Gang meet.)

387
00:14:58.717 --> 00:15:00.260
My goodness.

388
00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:01.500
There they are.

389
00:15:01.587 --> 00:15:03.220
We found them.

390
00:15:03.222 --> 00:15:04.370
Let's fight 1 on 1.

391
00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:06.200
- Excuse me. - Let's fight 1 on 1.

392
00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:08.470
- Wait for me. I am exhausted. - Seok Jin.

393
00:15:09.061 --> 00:15:10.340
Sae Ho is coming.

394
00:15:12.064 --> 00:15:14.010
(Running)

395
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.350
Kwang Soo.

396
00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:16.710
My goodness.

397
00:15:17.436 --> 00:15:19.450
Kwang Soo! Kwang Soo!

398
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.170
(The situation is a tinderbox.)

399
00:15:22.174 --> 00:15:23.290
I work out.

400
00:15:25.244 --> 00:15:26.240
All right.

401
00:15:26.245 --> 00:15:27.710
Daniel, you are on your own.

402
00:15:27.713 --> 00:15:29.390
Seok Jin, you can do it, right?

403
00:15:29.548 --> 00:15:30.740
Yes.

404
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:31.980
- I work out. - Seok Jin.

405
00:15:31.984 --> 00:15:33.760
Seok Jin, we have been on the show for seven years.

406
00:15:33.819 --> 00:15:36.000
- That's right. - Seok Jin, you can do it.

407
00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:38.140
Let's fight 1 on 1.

408
00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:39.840
1 on 1.

409
00:15:40.492 --> 00:15:41.710
1 on 1.

410
00:15:43.796 --> 00:15:44.860
My goodness.

411
00:15:44.863 --> 00:15:47.480
(They start a real fight.)

412
00:15:47.833 --> 00:15:51.280
(It's Daniel versus Kwang Rak.)

413
00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:54.200
Come here. Turn around.

414
00:15:54.206 --> 00:15:56.390
(It's Sae Ho versus Seok Jin.)

415
00:15:56.442 --> 00:16:00.620
(Whose name tag will be torn?)

416
00:16:03.582 --> 00:16:05.530
(Tearing)

417
00:16:06.952 --> 00:16:09.950
(Daniel is out.)

418
00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:11.370
- Run. - Come here.

419
00:16:11.523 --> 00:16:12.600
You come here.

420
00:16:13.859 --> 00:16:15.090
(Ripping)

421
00:16:15.094 --> 00:16:16.160
- Did you tear it? - Yes.

422
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:18.090
(Seok Jin is out.)

423
00:16:18.097 --> 00:16:19.460
- Did you both tear them? - Yes.

424
00:16:19.465 --> 00:16:21.350
(The score is tied.)

425
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:23.700
Wait a minute.

426
00:16:23.702 --> 00:16:25.570
(Team Police has all the hints about Yuchen Gang's safe.)

427
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:27.530
It's over if I get caught.

428
00:16:27.539 --> 00:16:29.440
(His team wins if he finds the safe.)

429
00:16:29.441 --> 00:16:31.790
Is it here? What's this?

430
00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:35.210
Please just this once.

431
00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:37.800
(Kwang Rak is the only survivor from Yuchen Gang.)

432
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.110
Where am I? What went wrong?

433
00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:42.900
(Which gang will find the safe first?)

434
00:16:44.323 --> 00:16:46.400
- Where are you going, Haha? - You startled me.

435
00:16:47.092 --> 00:16:49.290
It's not in here. We should look up there.

436
00:16:49.295 --> 00:16:50.490
- It's here. - It's the annex.

437
00:16:50.496 --> 00:16:51.560
(This is the annex.)

438
00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:53.930
(They enter the annex where Yuchen Gang's safe is located.)

439
00:16:53.932 --> 00:16:56.880
- Remember Nevis. Nevis. - Nevis.

440
00:16:57.936 --> 00:16:59.750
- We can do anything as a team. - Right.

441
00:16:59.972 --> 00:17:02.250
All we need to do is split it in half.

442
00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:03.750
Right.

443
00:17:03.942 --> 00:17:05.020
There's the pavilion.

444
00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:06.860
Here it is.

445
00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:08.460
Where's the forest?

446
00:17:08.847 --> 00:17:11.330
I must find the forest.

447
00:17:12.618 --> 00:17:14.680
I can't continue because my legs feel numb.

448
00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:15.880
Go ahead. I don't care.

449
00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:16.950
(They're close to finding the safe.)

450
00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:17.990
Seriously?

451
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.250
(May I open the safe?)

452
00:17:19.258 --> 00:17:20.990
I don't care about...

453
00:17:20.993 --> 00:17:24.070
- being successful. - Can you be on the lookout?

454
00:17:24.596 --> 00:17:26.590
You don't care about being successful?

455
00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:27.850
Not at all.

456
00:17:27.966 --> 00:17:31.010
There it is. It's the forest next to the pavilion.

457
00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:32.750
Is this the forest?

458
00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:34.770
I'm almost there. Let's win.

459
00:17:34.773 --> 00:17:39.720
(Kwang Rak finds the safe hidden in the forest.)

460
00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:43.660
(Once he enters the passcode, he wins.)

461
00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:46.030
Kwang Soo...

462
00:17:46.452 --> 00:17:47.480
can win.

463
00:17:47.486 --> 00:17:49.250
- I think he will. - He knows the place and passcode.

464
00:17:49.254 --> 00:17:51.400
- Now? - Will he remember?

465
00:17:51.724 --> 00:17:53.190
- I have the passcode. - What?

466
00:17:53.192 --> 00:17:54.440
Really?

467
00:17:56.195 --> 00:17:57.670
- I hope he remembers. - Let me see.

468
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.580
- He memorized it. - What if he forgot?

469
00:17:59.865 --> 00:18:01.130
- It's 102803. - He might not remember.

470
00:18:01.133 --> 00:18:03.010
Won't he remember since he's an actor?

471
00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:06.230
- I think he will. - He's more of a fool than an actor.

472
00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:08.720
(You didn't know, did you?)

473
00:18:10.442 --> 00:18:11.940
(Is he acting like a fool?)

474
00:18:11.944 --> 00:18:13.460
Seok Jin has the passcode.

475
00:18:14.346 --> 00:18:16.480
(Or is he really a fool?)

476
00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:18.260
He has the passcode.

477
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.950
What was it again?

478
00:18:19.952 --> 00:18:23.050
(While he wastes time trying to open the safe,)

479
00:18:23.055 --> 00:18:24.250
(Team Police enters Yuchen Gang's headquarters.)

480
00:18:24.256 --> 00:18:25.450
Be on the watch.

481
00:18:25.457 --> 00:18:27.240
(Team Police enters Yuchen Gang's headquarters.)

482
00:18:29.728 --> 00:18:31.980
(The safe is down there.)

483
00:18:33.265 --> 00:18:34.710
I found it.

484
00:18:36.468 --> 00:18:41.770
(Team Police wins if they open the safe.)

485
00:18:41.774 --> 00:18:43.920
- I found it. - Okay.

486
00:18:44.042 --> 00:18:45.770
(He rips off the name tag.)

487
00:18:45.778 --> 00:18:48.540
(What did he do?)

488
00:18:48.547 --> 00:18:51.180
Only the member who opens the safe...

489
00:18:51.183 --> 00:18:53.910
wins all the money of the opposing gang.

490
00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:56.450
(The one who opens the safe can win all the money.)

491
00:18:56.455 --> 00:18:58.170
- Okay. - We're on the same team.

492
00:18:58.657 --> 00:19:00.100
It's an individual game.

493
00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:02.340
In the end, there's only one winner.

494
00:19:03.362 --> 00:19:04.990
(He's happy to win.)

495
00:19:04.997 --> 00:19:06.260
But we're on the...

496
00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:08.700
(Has he lost his mind?)

497
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.950
(He hits Se Chan's head.)

498
00:19:12.438 --> 00:19:15.770
(Se Chan opens Yuchen Gang's safe.)

499
00:19:15.774 --> 00:19:16.770
Okay.

500
00:19:16.775 --> 00:19:18.470
(He wins 1,000 dollars.)

501
00:19:18.477 --> 00:19:20.090
- We're the same... - Okay.

502
00:19:20.846 --> 00:19:24.780
(He's speechless after getting betrayed.)

503
00:19:24.783 --> 00:19:25.780
In the end...

504
00:19:25.784 --> 00:19:27.850
We're on the same team.

505
00:19:27.853 --> 00:19:28.950
(He tries to suppress his anger.)

506
00:19:28.954 --> 00:19:31.940
(He deserves to be arrested.)

507
00:19:32.357 --> 00:19:34.440
- My goodness. - I have bad news.

508
00:19:34.927 --> 00:19:37.020
Kwang Soo opened the safe first.

509
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:39.240
(Kwang Soo opened the safe first.)

510
00:19:40.032 --> 00:19:43.600
(Did Kwang Soo open the safe first?)

511
00:19:43.602 --> 00:19:44.750
Seriously?

512
00:19:46.505 --> 00:19:50.370
(Kwang Rak struggled to unlock the safe.)

513
00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:51.820
Seok Jin has the passcode.

514
00:19:53.445 --> 00:19:56.780
(It took a split second to determine who would open the safe first.)

515
00:19:56.782 --> 00:20:00.960
(Se Chan was busy betraying Haha.)

516
00:20:04.456 --> 00:20:06.690
(Kwang Soo who always acted like a fool...)

517
00:20:06.692 --> 00:20:07.960
I got it.

518
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.010
(opened Team Police's safe first.)

519
00:20:12.965 --> 00:20:14.010
Okay.

520
00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:17.800
Okay. I opened it.

521
00:20:17.803 --> 00:20:20.020
(He empties out Team Police's safe.)

522
00:20:20.205 --> 00:20:21.270
(Yuchen Gang succeeds.)

523
00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:22.270
I got it.

524
00:20:22.274 --> 00:20:24.400
(Kwang Soo wins Team Police's property.)

525
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:25.690
I found it.

526
00:20:27.179 --> 00:20:28.260
I did it.

527
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:30.640
(Only if they weren't suspicious...)

528
00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:32.900
- If we didn't get suspicious... - I'm sorry.

529
00:20:33.352 --> 00:20:34.650
I should have given up earlier.

530
00:20:34.653 --> 00:20:35.700
(He's regretful.)

531
00:20:35.888 --> 00:20:39.440
Once you make up, go back to the starting place.

532
00:20:40.292 --> 00:20:42.770
I was suspicious of you too, so I have nothing to say.

533
00:20:43.195 --> 00:20:44.510
Nevis.

534
00:20:44.696 --> 00:20:46.530
(He still feels contempt.)

535
00:20:46.532 --> 00:20:48.480
- Haha. - It's over now.

536
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.200
My goodness.

537
00:20:50.202 --> 00:20:52.170
(They end up getting hurt, and the final race ends.)

538
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.490
Everyone, I'll announce the result.

539
00:20:56.742 --> 00:20:58.760
Here's the result of the final race, City of Crime.

540
00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:01.210
Yuchen Gang wins.

541
00:21:01.213 --> 00:21:02.940
(Yuchen Gang wins.)

542
00:21:02.948 --> 00:21:05.680
Lee Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

543
00:21:05.684 --> 00:21:07.060
(He deserves respect.)

544
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.780
Good job.

545
00:21:09.788 --> 00:21:11.950
Step forward. Step forward now.

546
00:21:11.957 --> 00:21:13.070
He's angry.

547
00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:16.710
I told you the location and the passcode.

548
00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:19.110
- You had to go to the annex. - Why didn't you go together?

549
00:21:19.464 --> 00:21:22.510
Find the safe, and enter the passcode. Why did you split?

550
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:24.450
I quit.

551
00:21:25.103 --> 00:21:26.900
- I'm too scared to work. - What?

552
00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:28.700
- Send me to "Inkigayo". - Come here.

553
00:21:28.707 --> 00:21:30.600
- We had to find quickly. - That's why.

554
00:21:30.609 --> 00:21:33.040
Only one member can take the money.

555
00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:35.710
That's not what I mean. You knew the location, right?

556
00:21:35.714 --> 00:21:37.680
What's the point of your finding it quickly?

557
00:21:37.683 --> 00:21:38.710
(Didn't you listen to me?)

558
00:21:38.717 --> 00:21:40.410
- We'd like to quit. - We really do.

559
00:21:40.419 --> 00:21:42.550
- Wait. - Am I wrong?

560
00:21:42.554 --> 00:21:46.000
Can I replace them if they quit?

561
00:21:46.992 --> 00:21:48.140
Just in case.

562
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.690
No.

563
00:21:49.695 --> 00:21:50.810
Really?

564
00:21:51.096 --> 00:21:53.360
- You aren't good at talking. - I'm not good at talking?

565
00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:55.200
- Is that why? - You can't.

566
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.860
- Won't I improve? - No, you won't.

567
00:21:56.868 --> 00:21:58.680
Is that so? Sorry.

568
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.700
That's not what I mean.

569
00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:02.500
His look changed completely.

570
00:22:02.574 --> 00:22:04.977
I'm really sorry,

571
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.480
but stay behind after the shoot.

572
00:22:09.081 --> 00:22:11.617
- I'm being serious. - Jong Kook.

573
00:22:11.783 --> 00:22:14.620
I don't understand what happened. I really don't.

574
00:22:15.454 --> 00:22:17.589
We haven't used it in a long time.

575
00:22:17.689 --> 00:22:22.094
Currently, Yuchen Gang has 2,400 dollars in total.

576
00:22:22.527 --> 00:22:24.763
Kwang Soo has 27 Running Balls.

577
00:22:25.197 --> 00:22:27.532
Sa Yeon has 8, Jae Seok has 7,

578
00:22:27.532 --> 00:22:30.068
and Seok Jin has seven.

579
00:22:31.036 --> 00:22:32.537
Let's start.

580
00:22:32.537 --> 00:22:34.439
(Kwang Soo has the majority of balls.)

581
00:22:34.439 --> 00:22:37.042
I'm not even nervous.

582
00:22:38.076 --> 00:22:41.513
(Let's call the spirits for luck.)

583
00:22:41.613 --> 00:22:45.717
(They clap as if they're hypnotized.)

584
00:22:47.085 --> 00:22:51.223
(Everyone follows without knowing what's going on.)

585
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:52.357
(Answer us, Spirit of Luck.)

586
00:22:53.792 --> 00:22:55.694
(Is this how it's done?)

587
00:22:55.694 --> 00:22:57.596
- What's wrong? - It makes me feel excited.

588
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.264
Shall I start?

589
00:22:59.264 --> 00:23:00.732
(Only one Running Ball is picked.)

590
00:23:00.732 --> 00:23:02.834
The name on the ball is the final winner.

591
00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:07.539
The winner receives all the money that the gang has.

592
00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:08.840
(Who will it be?)

593
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.008
I hope it isn't Kwang Soo.

594
00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:11.743
I hope Kwang Soo doesn't get picked.

595
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.011
(It's Kwang Soo and three more members.)

596
00:23:13.011 --> 00:23:15.013
- 1, 2, 3. - 2, 3.

597
00:23:15.614 --> 00:23:17.282
- Here it is. - It came out immediately.

598
00:23:18.784 --> 00:23:21.553
(Is Kwang Soo the winner?)

599
00:23:23.321 --> 00:23:24.523
(Running Ball is selected.)

600
00:23:24.523 --> 00:23:26.091
- He didn't look. - Don't look.

601
00:23:26.091 --> 00:23:27.526
- That's not it. - No.

602
00:23:27.526 --> 00:23:29.261
- The second ball doesn't count. - Whose name is it?

603
00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:30.562
Show us the second ball.

604
00:23:30.562 --> 00:23:32.464
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

605
00:23:32.464 --> 00:23:34.066
I have a high chance.

606
00:23:34.599 --> 00:23:36.501
This is the first ball.

607
00:23:37.102 --> 00:23:38.270
Let's take a look.

608
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.038
(Who will win all the capital?)

609
00:23:40.038 --> 00:23:41.573
Who will win the prize?

610
00:23:41.573 --> 00:23:43.775
- It's 2,400 dollars. - 2,400 dollars.

611
00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:44.976
It's most likely Kwang Soo.

612
00:23:44.976 --> 00:23:46.578
(Who will be the final winner?)

613
00:23:46.578 --> 00:23:52.584
- Pick again if it's the same name. - Right.

614
00:23:52.718 --> 00:23:54.453
We pick again if it's the same name.

615
00:23:54.453 --> 00:23:56.354
What nonsense is this?

616
00:23:56.555 --> 00:23:58.523
What nonsense is this?

617
00:23:58.523 --> 00:23:59.758
If both names are...

618
00:23:59.758 --> 00:24:02.894
It's likely that it's my name since I have 27 Running Balls.

619
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.296
Right.

620
00:24:04.296 --> 00:24:05.497
If it's the same name...

621
00:24:05.497 --> 00:24:07.866
It's likely that it's Kwang Soo.

622
00:24:07.866 --> 00:24:09.000
(Whose name will it be?)

623
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.036
- This is unbelievable. - Why?

624
00:24:11.236 --> 00:24:12.370
Noh Sa Yeon.

625
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.842
(Sa Yeon wins.)

626
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.247
The winner of 2,400 dollars is...

627
00:24:22.514 --> 00:24:23.915
- Noh Sa Yeon. - Noh Sa Yeon.

628
00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:25.984
(The final winner is Sa Yeon.)

629
00:24:25.984 --> 00:24:29.287
- It's unbelievable. - Really?

630
00:24:30.122 --> 00:24:31.823
I have 27...

631
00:24:32.524 --> 00:24:34.893
You should be happy for her.

632
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.496
The final winner of City of Crime is...

633
00:24:37.496 --> 00:24:39.498
Sa Yeon who had a low probability.

634
00:24:39.498 --> 00:24:40.866
This is amazing.

635
00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:43.034
Sa Yeon wins the accumulated prize.

636
00:24:43.034 --> 00:24:44.102
(Spitting)

637
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.441
As promised, the accumulated prize of 2,400 dollars...

638
00:24:49.441 --> 00:24:52.277
will be given to her.

639
00:24:52.277 --> 00:24:53.979
(The amount is given to Sa Yeon.)

640
00:24:55.514 --> 00:24:56.982
I'm so happy.

641
00:24:57.516 --> 00:24:59.551
How is this possible?

642
00:24:59.551 --> 00:25:00.852
(She's moved.)

643
00:25:00.852 --> 00:25:02.521
- It's a donation. - Is it?

644
00:25:03.054 --> 00:25:04.422
Was it a donation?

645
00:25:04.422 --> 00:25:06.792
Look at her face. Did you see it?

646
00:25:08.193 --> 00:25:10.195
That's not it.

647
00:25:10.195 --> 00:25:12.464
2,400 dollars...

648
00:25:12.664 --> 00:25:15.700
will be donated under Sa Yeon's name.

649
00:25:16.034 --> 00:25:20.939
(They finish the day with a good deed.)

650
00:25:20.939 --> 00:25:22.274
- Thank you. - Thank you.

651
00:25:22.274 --> 00:25:23.909
- Thank you. - Good job.

652
00:25:24.009 --> 00:25:25.644
- Are you tired? - Thank you.

653
00:25:25.977 --> 00:25:27.279
- Se Chan. - Yes?

654
00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:29.581
(Why is he given an envelope?)

655
00:25:29.581 --> 00:25:30.682
What is it?

656
00:25:30.682 --> 00:25:32.450
- It's tomorrow's mission. - For tomorrow?

657
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.419
(They're given tomorrow's mission.)

658
00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:37.322
Okay. What we did today won't continue, right?

659
00:25:37.856 --> 00:25:39.624
- I'm done with this makeup, right? - Yes.

660
00:25:39.991 --> 00:25:42.294
(What is it this time?)

661
00:25:42.761 --> 00:25:43.995
"An item that brings back memories"?

662
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:45.864
(An item that brings back memories)

663
00:25:45.864 --> 00:25:47.566
"An item that brings back memories"?

664
00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:51.803
"Bring an item that brings back memories related to fall."

665
00:25:51.803 --> 00:25:54.906
(Bring an item that brings back memories related to fall.)

666
00:25:56.141 --> 00:25:57.108
Fall?

667
00:25:57.108 --> 00:25:58.210
(Let me see.)

668
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.545
"An item that brings back memories related to fall"?

669
00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:04.282
- Tomorrow, bring an item... - Tomorrow?

670
00:26:04.282 --> 00:26:06.952
that brings back memories related to fall.

671
00:26:07.018 --> 00:26:09.454
Try to find an item that everyone can relate to.

672
00:26:10.322 --> 00:26:12.257
Related to fall?

673
00:26:12.724 --> 00:26:14.226
Can I bring a person?

674
00:26:14.226 --> 00:26:15.260
(Can I bring a person?)

675
00:26:16.928 --> 00:26:20.899
(What items will they bring?)

676
00:26:21.366 --> 00:26:23.301
(The next morning at a rest area)

677
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:25.470
- This is nice. - Hi.

678
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.972
Hi. Nice to see you.

679
00:26:26.972 --> 00:26:28.373
- Hi. - This is great.

680
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:31.343
- I love this place. - Nice view.

681
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.379
- Look at this place. - I've never been here before.

682
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.982
Why did you even cover that? It's a giraffe.

683
00:26:36.982 --> 00:26:38.350
I didn't cover it.

684
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.118
- I didn't. - It's obviously a giraffe.

685
00:26:40.118 --> 00:26:41.553
I didn't do it.

686
00:26:41.553 --> 00:26:42.721
It might be a cactus.

687
00:26:42.721 --> 00:26:44.489
It might be a flamingo.

688
00:26:45.257 --> 00:26:47.993
An ex-girlfriend he dated last fall?

689
00:26:47.993 --> 00:26:49.294
(An ex-girlfriend?)

690
00:26:49.294 --> 00:26:50.996
- Is it? - No.

691
00:26:50.996 --> 00:26:52.030
Is it a miniature?

692
00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.032
What do you mean?

693
00:26:54.032 --> 00:26:56.067
- You like miniatures. - I don't have anything like that.

694
00:26:57.202 --> 00:26:59.237
It'd be so creepy if he had a miniature of his ex-girlfriend.

695
00:26:59.237 --> 00:27:04.943
- Can someone cut Kwang Soo's hair? - It's MacGyver style.

696
00:27:04.943 --> 00:27:07.012
MacGyver.

697
00:27:07.012 --> 00:27:08.680
That hairstyle usually looks awesome.

698
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.448
Many boyband members have this hairstyle.

699
00:27:10.448 --> 00:27:12.217
- G-Dragon, - G-Dragon.

700
00:27:12.217 --> 00:27:15.086
- Song Min Ho, Baekhyun... - Mine looks a bit different.

701
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.990
It reminds me of Kim Byung Ji.

702
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.025
(You remind me of Kim Byung Ji.)

703
00:27:20.025 --> 00:27:22.460
(They look exactly the same.)

704
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.729
- Ha Seok Ju in his prime. - Right.

705
00:27:24.729 --> 00:27:26.798
- Kim Joo Sung. - Him too.

706
00:27:26.798 --> 00:27:28.099
Lee Duke Jean.

707
00:27:28.099 --> 00:27:29.334
My hairstyle looks different.

708
00:27:29.534 --> 00:27:31.102
Even your face looks like his.

709
00:27:31.102 --> 00:27:35.340
Did you all bring an item that brings back memories?

710
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.341
- Yes. - Yes.

711
00:27:36.341 --> 00:27:39.010
Now that fall is here,

712
00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.313
we'll go on a trip.

713
00:27:41.746 --> 00:27:44.516
Before that, let's have your items...

714
00:27:44.516 --> 00:27:46.952
appraised.

715
00:27:46.952 --> 00:27:50.021
(Appraising the items)

716
00:27:50.021 --> 00:27:51.556
Are you going to appraise our memories?

717
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.291
Appraising?

718
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.796
You're going to introduce your item and memories attached to it.

719
00:27:57.796 --> 00:28:02.267
The other members will write down a price.

720
00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:05.437
Excluding the highest and lowest prices,

721
00:28:05.437 --> 00:28:08.273
the average price will be calculated.

722
00:28:08.273 --> 00:28:09.708
(They will calculate the average.)

723
00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:12.210
I don't like that you're going to put a price on our memories.

724
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.244
Right.

725
00:28:13.244 --> 00:28:15.847
- I don't think it's a problem. - Really?

726
00:28:16.214 --> 00:28:18.283
- I guess I was mistaken. - I've already put a price on yours.

727
00:28:18.283 --> 00:28:19.784
How much?

728
00:28:19.784 --> 00:28:22.120
About 30 cents?

729
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.822
(Your memories are worth 30 cents.)

730
00:28:24.589 --> 00:28:27.058
It is worth 30 cents?

731
00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:29.060
Who wants to go first?

732
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.129
- Seok Jin took out his item. - Hold on.

733
00:28:31.329 --> 00:28:33.431
- He took it out. - It's a baseball.

734
00:28:33.431 --> 00:28:34.966
- Fall baseball. - Fall baseball.

735
00:28:34.966 --> 00:28:38.269
Fall means baseball.

736
00:28:40.038 --> 00:28:42.841
Fall baseball reminds me of...

737
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:44.776
- A girl? - To be honest,

738
00:28:44.809 --> 00:28:46.644
it breaks my heart.

739
00:28:46.978 --> 00:28:48.480
A ball hit his chest once.

740
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.715
(Jae Seok explains on behalf of Seok Jin.)

741
00:28:51.983 --> 00:28:54.119
I like that. I want to buy that ball.

742
00:28:54.452 --> 00:28:55.720
It's lucky.

743
00:28:56.021 --> 00:28:57.555
It's not easy to get hit by a ball in the chest.

744
00:28:57.555 --> 00:28:59.457
Guys, listen.

745
00:28:59.724 --> 00:29:02.694
It'll break your hearts too.

746
00:29:02.727 --> 00:29:05.530
You must be thinking about the fall baseball.

747
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.066
But I'm thinking of a batting cage.

748
00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:10.568
A batting cage?

749
00:29:11.102 --> 00:29:13.638
(What memories does he have?)

750
00:29:14.706 --> 00:29:18.476
It was fall, and my wife was very sick.

751
00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:23.114
- Don't make it up. - Hold on.

752
00:29:23.548 --> 00:29:25.417
Listen.

753
00:29:25.417 --> 00:29:27.452
We talked this morning.

754
00:29:27.452 --> 00:29:29.054
"What did you bring?"

755
00:29:29.054 --> 00:29:31.222
"A baseball." "What memories do you have?"

756
00:29:31.623 --> 00:29:32.690
"Am I supposed to have memories?"

757
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.959
(This happened this morning.)

758
00:29:34.959 --> 00:29:36.327
"I have none."

759
00:29:37.095 --> 00:29:38.563
"I just brought it."

760
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.633
"I should make one up."

761
00:29:41.699 --> 00:29:43.201
- Also, - The thing is...

762
00:29:43.201 --> 00:29:44.803
- your wife is very healthy. - She's healthy.

763
00:29:44.803 --> 00:29:46.337
She's healthy now.

764
00:29:46.371 --> 00:29:48.206
Are you doing this to get a high price?

765
00:29:48.339 --> 00:29:51.743
- The thing is... - This is not even a real baseball.

766
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.111
It's too light.

767
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:55.113
It says, "KBL".

768
00:29:55.113 --> 00:29:56.614
That's a basketball league.

769
00:29:56.614 --> 00:29:59.451
- KBL? - Is this from a claw machine?

770
00:29:59.451 --> 00:30:00.485
Is this a basketball?

771
00:30:00.485 --> 00:30:01.519
(Everyone's suspicious)

772
00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:02.854
Is this a basketball?

773
00:30:03.354 --> 00:30:05.056
It's a prize.

774
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.626
It's a prize. If you manage to hit 10 balls,

775
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.462
you get this as a prize.

776
00:30:10.695 --> 00:30:13.264
- If you hit 10 balls. - 10 balls?

777
00:30:13.264 --> 00:30:16.301
My wife's fever was as high as 40°C.

778
00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:18.503
She went to the emergency room. Ebola was suspected.

779
00:30:18.503 --> 00:30:20.505
- You know what it is, right? - Yes.

780
00:30:20.505 --> 00:30:24.042
I was so worried it really would be Ebola.

781
00:30:24.709 --> 00:30:26.111
And?

782
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:28.413
And you went to practice baseball?

783
00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.115
What were you thinking?

784
00:30:30.548 --> 00:30:32.283
- Should we write down a price? - You're awful.

785
00:30:32.283 --> 00:30:35.120
The price would be close to zero.

786
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.222
Why did you practice baseball when your wife was sick?

787
00:30:37.222 --> 00:30:38.857
It was on the way from the emergency room.

788
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:43.228
She said she'd get better if I could hit 10 balls.

789
00:30:43.862 --> 00:30:46.231
She could have slapped you in the face.

790
00:30:46.231 --> 00:30:48.299
Is he Shim Cheong?

791
00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:50.969
That's absurd. Is it okay to make a story up?

792
00:30:50.969 --> 00:30:53.638
I liked the story where the ball hit your chest.

793
00:30:53.972 --> 00:30:56.875
Can't you tell that story instead?

794
00:30:56.875 --> 00:30:58.009
It was...

795
00:30:58.009 --> 00:30:59.244
(He starts right away.)

796
00:30:59.511 --> 00:31:01.112
It was four years ago.

797
00:31:01.579 --> 00:31:03.381
My son wanted to go to a baseball game.

798
00:31:04.849 --> 00:31:06.751
That day, Lee Seung Yeop was playing.

799
00:31:07.285 --> 00:31:10.121
I'm putting the lid back on the pen.

800
00:31:11.022 --> 00:31:13.358
- Which one was it? - I like it.

801
00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:15.793
- Remember his 400th home run? - Yes.

802
00:31:15.793 --> 00:31:17.562
That ball was flying towards us.

803
00:31:17.762 --> 00:31:20.999
My son was so little. He didn't know what to do.

804
00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:24.068
"Hyun Woo, move!" And the ball hit my chest.

805
00:31:24.068 --> 00:31:26.604
(The ball hit my chest.)

806
00:31:29.574 --> 00:31:31.576
- My chest was... - I've written down a price.

807
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.546
Seok Jin is unbelievable.

808
00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:36.114
It hit my belly.

809
00:31:36.581 --> 00:31:38.650
It hit my belly.

810
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.051
Your belly?

811
00:31:40.051 --> 00:31:41.519
Thank goodness it didn't go any lower.

812
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:43.955
- My blood pressure plunged. - I'm done.

813
00:31:43.955 --> 00:31:46.057
Please show your prices on the count of three.

814
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.792
My son is watching.

815
00:31:48.493 --> 00:31:51.462
- One, two, - He got his family involved.

816
00:31:51.462 --> 00:31:52.497
three. Reveal your prices.

817
00:31:53.364 --> 00:31:55.133
I added three cents for Hyun Woo's sake.

818
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.603
The average price for Seok Jin's item is...

819
00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.371
five cents.

820
00:32:01.272 --> 00:32:04.776
It's not okay to make up a story.

821
00:32:04.776 --> 00:32:06.978
Let me hear yours then.

822
00:32:06.978 --> 00:32:09.414
- Let's hear it. - It's not acceptable.

823
00:32:09.981 --> 00:32:11.282
Should we hear Jae Seok's story?

824
00:32:11.849 --> 00:32:13.451
It's a jacket.

825
00:32:13.785 --> 00:32:16.020
- It's from a famous brand. - That's right.

826
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.555
- Right? - You recognize it.

827
00:32:18.022 --> 00:32:21.025
(It's a jacket from a famous brand.)

828
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.229
- Put it on. - I will.

829
00:32:25.129 --> 00:32:27.031
- Does it still fit? - It does.

830
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:34.372
(He puts on the jacket that's full of memories.)

831
00:32:34.372 --> 00:32:36.541
You look awful.

832
00:32:36.541 --> 00:32:39.043
(How could he look so ugly?)

833
00:32:39.777 --> 00:32:42.347
You look ridiculous. You look so old-fashioned.

834
00:32:42.513 --> 00:32:44.315
Were you old-fashioned back then too?

835
00:32:45.083 --> 00:32:47.051
You might think it's old fashioned now,

836
00:32:47.051 --> 00:32:48.820
but it was so popular back then.

837
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.022
The problem is your face, not your jacket.

838
00:32:51.022 --> 00:32:53.258
(The problem is your face.)

839
00:32:53.925 --> 00:32:56.327
- That jacket is no problem. - You didn't know?

840
00:32:57.262 --> 00:32:59.964
(What memories does this jacket bring back?)

841
00:32:59.964 --> 00:33:01.899
It's more than just the memories.

842
00:33:01.899 --> 00:33:04.269
This jacket gave me so much confidence.

843
00:33:04.302 --> 00:33:06.804
I used to wear this to so many clubs.

844
00:33:06.804 --> 00:33:09.540
I loved this jacket.

845
00:33:09.874 --> 00:33:11.609
Are there any special stories?

846
00:33:11.609 --> 00:33:13.044
Stories?

847
00:33:13.978 --> 00:33:16.080
That would add 10 dollars.

848
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.082
Listen to me.

849
00:33:18.182 --> 00:33:21.519
When I wore this...

850
00:33:21.552 --> 00:33:24.022
- to clubs... - Let's do it like this.

851
00:33:24.022 --> 00:33:27.558
If you picked up a girl wearing that, the price will go up.

852
00:33:27.959 --> 00:33:29.761
If you failed, it'll go down.

853
00:33:29.761 --> 00:33:30.862
- That jacket needs to be lucky. - Jae Seok.

854
00:33:30.862 --> 00:33:32.130
Did you pick up any girls wearing that?

855
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.765
- Please tell them. - Were you there too?

856
00:33:33.765 --> 00:33:35.199
Tell them what I was like.

857
00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:37.502
I'm not sure if you know,

858
00:33:37.502 --> 00:33:41.105
but to get a room, you had to be there early.

859
00:33:41.105 --> 00:33:42.340
- You had to be there early. - Right.

860
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.476
So the waiters would say,

861
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.213
"Please send someone early."

862
00:33:49.213 --> 00:33:50.481
Most of us would come around 10pm.

863
00:33:50.481 --> 00:33:52.350
I called him.

864
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.052
(Jae Seok had a lot of free time.)

865
00:33:54.052 --> 00:33:56.621
"Jae Seok, what are you doing?" "Nothing."

866
00:33:56.621 --> 00:33:58.389
Be there by 8pm.

867
00:33:58.389 --> 00:34:00.491
My job was to get us a room.

868
00:34:00.491 --> 00:34:03.661
(He confesses.)

869
00:34:03.661 --> 00:34:05.229
I got us a room. I was a "room catcher".

870
00:34:05.229 --> 00:34:06.664
I know what that is.

871
00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:07.699
- "Room catcher." - I know what it is.

872
00:34:07.699 --> 00:34:10.301
The name sounds cool.

873
00:34:10.668 --> 00:34:13.304
There's a reason why I asked him for help.

874
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:15.940
If I asked someone who loved to drink,

875
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.309
they'd start drinking before us. But Jae Seok didn't.

876
00:34:18.309 --> 00:34:21.913
- I don't drink. - He just eats some grapes.

877
00:34:21.913 --> 00:34:24.916
(He just eats some grapes.)

878
00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:26.584
He doesn't drink.

879
00:34:26.584 --> 00:34:28.453
- Why did you even go? - What?

880
00:34:28.453 --> 00:34:30.455
They would let me pay a bit less.

881
00:34:30.455 --> 00:34:33.057
- If you got them a room? - Yes.

882
00:34:33.091 --> 00:34:36.828
- That's a sad story. - It wasn't bad.

883
00:34:36.828 --> 00:34:39.197
You went there hours before the others and got them a room?

884
00:34:39.297 --> 00:34:42.967
This jacket gave me so much confidence.

885
00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:46.971
You looked even worse back then.

886
00:34:46.971 --> 00:34:49.374
He did.

887
00:34:49.374 --> 00:34:53.344
No girls wanted to sit next to him.

888
00:34:53.411 --> 00:34:55.680
I added another zero just because of that.

889
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.949
- Really? - This is nice.

890
00:34:57.949 --> 00:34:59.584
All right. Let's take a look.

891
00:34:59.584 --> 00:35:01.219
1, 2, 3. Please show us.

892
00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:02.687
(How much is the price?)

893
00:35:02.687 --> 00:35:04.455
- Thank you. - Jae Seok's item is...

894
00:35:04.455 --> 00:35:05.890
- worth... - It was a nice story.

895
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.492
13 dollars and 60 cents.

896
00:35:08.126 --> 00:35:09.660
- Next. - I brought...

897
00:35:10.061 --> 00:35:13.664
one of my cover albums with a fall theme.

898
00:35:13.664 --> 00:35:15.233
(What did Jong Kook bring?)

899
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.137
(A cover album)

900
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:23.474
It was the first album I had ever released in fall.

901
00:35:23.474 --> 00:35:26.210
The theme was fall.

902
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.612
Are you trying to promote your album?

903
00:35:27.812 --> 00:35:30.481
- What? - For the revival of that album.

904
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:32.083
I didn't think of that.

905
00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:34.619
- Wait. - Was that your intention?

906
00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:36.287
- You're promoting it. - Jong Kook.

907
00:35:36.287 --> 00:35:39.290
You don't care about the price we give.

908
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.026
- Listen to me. - You want to promote that album.

909
00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:44.629
Please show your love for "Collective Invention".

910
00:35:44.629 --> 00:35:45.763
- Listen. - Stop it.

911
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.366
- It's about a mutant fish man. - This album...

912
00:35:48.499 --> 00:35:50.601
I would like to promote something to make it popular again.

913
00:35:50.835 --> 00:35:52.937
"Young Gu and Space Monster Bulgoeri".

914
00:35:52.937 --> 00:35:54.572
(It's a film Jae Seok had a supporting role.)

915
00:35:54.772 --> 00:35:58.576
("Young Gu and Space Monster Bulgoeri")

916
00:35:59.744 --> 00:36:04.982
(It's an old film where Jae Seok was spelled "Je Seok".)

917
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.386
- I actually know that film. - I...

918
00:36:08.453 --> 00:36:11.255
I have a story behind this album.

919
00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:14.559
It's the first album that I signed and gave you guys as gifts.

920
00:36:14.559 --> 00:36:16.294
- You gave me one too? - I gave this to everyone.

921
00:36:16.294 --> 00:36:17.428
I gave it to everyone.

922
00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:19.864
Seok Jin, I saw it near the shoe rack at your house.

923
00:36:20.031 --> 00:36:21.332
- That's not true. - No, you have it.

924
00:36:21.332 --> 00:36:23.334
- This must be a different album. - I personally wrote on the CD.

925
00:36:23.334 --> 00:36:24.869
I even remember when I gave these out.

926
00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:28.139
It was the day we were saying romantic things to Ji Hyo...

927
00:36:28.139 --> 00:36:29.240
to increase her heart rate.

928
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.075
- I remember that day. - The heart rate mission?

929
00:36:31.542 --> 00:36:37.048
(He gave the CD that he signed when they were shy around each other.)

930
00:36:37.515 --> 00:36:39.450
When he gave the CD,

931
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.352
- he talked to me formally. - I did.

932
00:36:41.352 --> 00:36:42.787
- Really? - She's right.

933
00:36:42.787 --> 00:36:43.788
It's been so long.

934
00:36:43.788 --> 00:36:45.022
I remember something.

935
00:36:45.022 --> 00:36:47.959
When he was working on this album, Jong Kook invited me and Joong Ki...

936
00:36:47.959 --> 00:36:49.894
to the shoot for the music video.

937
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:51.963
So I went there to congratulate him.

938
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.531
But Joong Ki filmed the music video,

939
00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:55.099
and I sat on the sofa the entire day.

940
00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:57.635
This is a true story! And he disappeared!

941
00:36:57.969 --> 00:36:59.971
- You disappeared without notice! - It wasn't...

942
00:36:59.971 --> 00:37:02.473
- It wasn't my album. - You invited both of us.

943
00:37:02.473 --> 00:37:04.876
- Hey, you shouldn't have done that. - At the end of the shoot,

944
00:37:04.876 --> 00:37:06.777
- It wasn't my album. - he took something out.

945
00:37:07.078 --> 00:37:08.813
He gave it to Joong Ki and thanked him for helping.

946
00:37:09.413 --> 00:37:11.549
I was just standing next to him.

947
00:37:11.549 --> 00:37:13.050
(He felt awkward.)

948
00:37:13.317 --> 00:37:15.720
- I asked Joong Ki what it was. - I said it wasn't my album.

949
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.988
Kwang Soo.

950
00:37:17.622 --> 00:37:19.257
- This was the album. - Yeon Soo.

951
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:21.859
- Both of us went, - It wasn't my album.

952
00:37:21.859 --> 00:37:26.063
but he only called me because he was worried Joong Ki might be bored!

953
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.032
He only let him star in the music video!

954
00:37:28.699 --> 00:37:30.968
- Seriously? - You were just his sidekick.

955
00:37:30.968 --> 00:37:32.603
- You were Joong Ki's entertainment. - This really happened?

956
00:37:32.603 --> 00:37:34.605
- I just remembered this. - Kwang Soo, this wasn't the album.

957
00:37:34.605 --> 00:37:36.741
(He's still tormented as he feels he's Joong Ki's entourage.)

958
00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:39.176
But So Min and Se Chan didn't receive this album.

959
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.578
- No. - I never got one.

960
00:37:40.578 --> 00:37:42.713
We don't have any memories to share with you.

961
00:37:43.014 --> 00:37:44.081
None.

962
00:37:44.081 --> 00:37:46.918
- It's just a regular CD. - Well...

963
00:37:46.918 --> 00:37:49.186
- You don't have any memories? - He's right.

964
00:37:49.186 --> 00:37:51.622
- I was sad when he was talking. - What?

965
00:37:51.622 --> 00:37:53.224
I was a bit sad when he was talking.

966
00:37:53.224 --> 00:37:54.792
I don't have any memories.

967
00:37:54.792 --> 00:37:55.893
- Don't you feel the same? - You and I can't associate.

968
00:37:55.893 --> 00:37:57.295
I brought this so I could give it to you.

969
00:37:57.295 --> 00:37:58.496
- Really? - You bet.

970
00:37:58.496 --> 00:38:01.065
I brought this so I could give it to you.

971
00:38:01.065 --> 00:38:02.934
- Jong Kook, what about me? - I signed this.

972
00:38:02.934 --> 00:38:04.569
- Hold on a second. Jong Kook. - I'm serious.

973
00:38:04.702 --> 00:38:05.703
Why am I not getting one?

974
00:38:05.703 --> 00:38:07.071
In my opinion, he's throwing you away.

975
00:38:07.872 --> 00:38:09.907
- You'll trash me after using me? - He already abandoned you.

976
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:11.809
- I treated you with respect. - You...

977
00:38:11.809 --> 00:38:14.045
- I prepared something else for you. - You did?

978
00:38:14.045 --> 00:38:16.414
To Jong Kook, you are...

979
00:38:16.414 --> 00:38:18.282
- just a leaf. - Will I fall?

980
00:38:18.282 --> 00:38:19.717
You are going to fall soon.

981
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:22.019
- It is what it is. - That hurt.

982
00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:23.754
- Poor Se Chan. - He's signing the CD.

983
00:38:23.788 --> 00:38:25.623
- He's signing it now. - To whom will you give this?

984
00:38:25.623 --> 00:38:27.325
- Will you give this to Se Chan? - He's doing it now.

985
00:38:27.491 --> 00:38:29.393
The value of the CD will go up with his autograph.

986
00:38:29.393 --> 00:38:31.262
I'm making my memories with you starting today.

987
00:38:31.262 --> 00:38:32.930
- I'll be part of the memories. - Is today the first day?

988
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.467
- I feel he's trying to revitalize. - No, not at all.

989
00:38:36.567 --> 00:38:37.868
- I'm serious. - What a viper!

990
00:38:37.868 --> 00:38:40.871
- The CD has a lot of good songs. - His behavior...

991
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:41.872
Please support...

992
00:38:41.872 --> 00:38:44.408
- Jong Kook's album. - That won't help at all, So Min.

993
00:38:44.542 --> 00:38:45.676
- What are you doing? - Stay out of it.

994
00:38:46.043 --> 00:38:47.044
- So Min. - Let me see.

995
00:38:47.044 --> 00:38:48.346
Jong Kook, I'm certain...

996
00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:50.181
you'll see it being sold online.

997
00:38:50.181 --> 00:38:51.682
(I'm talking about the CD you just signed.)

998
00:38:51.682 --> 00:38:53.818
- She'll sell it for 150 dollars. - Goodness.

999
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:55.386
She's more than capable of doing so.

1000
00:38:55.519 --> 00:38:58.489
I can't wait to find out the appraised value.

1001
00:38:58.489 --> 00:38:59.724
- Hold on. - My gosh.

1002
00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.859
It's meaningful because this is relevant to the show.

1003
00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:04.095
This was the first album I gave you.

1004
00:39:04.662 --> 00:39:06.063
Be generous.

1005
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:09.367
- It's meaningful in a way. - I think...

1006
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:12.169
It's hard to be funny with the appraised value. Just write it down.

1007
00:39:12.169 --> 00:39:15.406
(I get that you're trying hard, but just write it down.)

1008
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.209
(Seok Jin is truly a hard-working member on variety shows.)

1009
00:39:18.209 --> 00:39:19.543
- Just write a number down. - He can just...

1010
00:39:19.543 --> 00:39:21.646
- write down any number. - You can't...

1011
00:39:21.646 --> 00:39:23.648
You can't be funny while writing down the number.

1012
00:39:23.648 --> 00:39:24.682
(Just give up already.)

1013
00:39:24.849 --> 00:39:26.350
Don't try to overachieve like that.

1014
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.085
(I was too ambitious, wasn't I?)

1015
00:39:28.085 --> 00:39:29.387
You're right.

1016
00:39:30.121 --> 00:39:33.324
(Jong Kook's cover album's appraised value is 14 dollars and 50 cents.)

1017
00:39:33.457 --> 00:39:35.326
- Next story, please. - Shall I go next?

1018
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.395
- All right, Se Chan. - I think...

1019
00:39:37.395 --> 00:39:40.564
- this fits today's theme perfectly. - What is this?

1020
00:39:42.199 --> 00:39:46.137
(Se Chan's nostalgic object is Actor of the Month Award.)

1021
00:39:46.203 --> 00:39:47.638
- "Actor of the Month Award". - Yes.

1022
00:39:47.638 --> 00:39:49.006
(You brought an award certificate?)

1023
00:39:49.206 --> 00:39:51.409
- It was from a comedy program. - I got it on October 28, 2008.

1024
00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:53.411
- You got it in the fall. - It was...

1025
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:55.046
when I was enjoying my first heyday.

1026
00:39:55.413 --> 00:39:57.381
- My role was Woong Yi's Dad. - I remember that one.

1027
00:39:57.815 --> 00:39:59.850
My catchphrase was, "Come here. Come quickly."

1028
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.552
- And many fans came to me indeed. - "Come quickly."

1029
00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:05.723
- I got this for that role. - More than anything...

1030
00:40:05.723 --> 00:40:07.692
Who was the producer in charge?

1031
00:40:07.725 --> 00:40:10.361
I think it was...

1032
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.063
(His memory is dim.)

1033
00:40:12.063 --> 00:40:13.564
If you don't remember this...

1034
00:40:13.564 --> 00:40:14.699
Hold on a second.

1035
00:40:14.932 --> 00:40:17.134
- Are you serious? - You don't remember the producer?

1036
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:19.070
- 5, 4... - How can you forget the crew?

1037
00:40:19.203 --> 00:40:22.273
- Wait. 5, 4, - 5, 4...

1038
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.441
3...

1039
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:24.542
(Oh, right! I just remembered!)

1040
00:40:24.542 --> 00:40:25.776
I got it. I'm so relieved.

1041
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.912
It was Nam Seung Yong. He's a director now.

1042
00:40:27.912 --> 00:40:29.580
All right. We will call him right now.

1043
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.682
(Let's call and find out.)

1044
00:40:31.816 --> 00:40:32.850
- Sorry? - We'll call him.

1045
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.219
(They plan to call the director to check the facts.)

1046
00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:37.922
- There's no need for that. - On October 28, 2008...

1047
00:40:38.122 --> 00:40:39.990
- We're really going to call him? - Is this really important?

1048
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.493
- Is it? It's my memory. - I agree.

1049
00:40:42.493 --> 00:40:44.528
Someone must have given the award to me that day.

1050
00:40:44.562 --> 00:40:47.565
- Your memory might be distorted. - Of course, we need to check.

1051
00:40:47.565 --> 00:40:49.700
(They're calling the director with a phone from the Running Man crew.)

1052
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.769
- Hold on a second. - Was it Director Nam?

1053
00:40:51.769 --> 00:40:53.971
- We're calling Director Nam. - Did Director Nam...

1054
00:40:53.971 --> 00:40:55.973
- run the show at that time? - To what do I owe the pleasure?

1055
00:40:55.973 --> 00:40:58.609
(They are on the phone with Director Nam.)

1056
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:59.810
- Hi. - Who is this?

1057
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.579
Director Nam, this is Yu Jae Seok.

1058
00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:04.048
- We're filming now. - Is that so? I got it.

1059
00:41:04.582 --> 00:41:05.916
He's acting like he's nice.

1060
00:41:05.916 --> 00:41:09.120
(He's putting on a nice front since this is for the show.)

1061
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.422
- That was so sudden. - He sounded like a nice guy.

1062
00:41:11.622 --> 00:41:13.124
He chuckled to pretend he's nice.

1063
00:41:13.124 --> 00:41:15.392
- He's not like this. - He sounded cold and then nice.

1064
00:41:15.392 --> 00:41:16.994
- He sounded like a gentleman. - Director Nam...

1065
00:41:16.994 --> 00:41:19.563
- has been on a few shows. - That's right.

1066
00:41:19.563 --> 00:41:22.333
- He actually likes appearing on TV. - Really?

1067
00:41:22.399 --> 00:41:24.435
- Director Nam. - Yes.

1068
00:41:24.435 --> 00:41:25.870
I hope you've been well.

1069
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.572
- This is going to air? - Yes.

1070
00:41:28.873 --> 00:41:30.641
I had a feeling. You're talking to me formally.

1071
00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:35.646
(He changes his tone to sound gentle for the show.)

1072
00:41:35.646 --> 00:41:37.581
- Gosh, what's up with him? - You're doing a great job.

1073
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:39.383
Director Nam is great.

1074
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.185
He appeared on several shows previously.

1075
00:41:41.185 --> 00:41:43.354
- What's the purpose of the call? - Sir.

1076
00:41:43.354 --> 00:41:45.222
- Yes? - We just had a question.

1077
00:41:45.222 --> 00:41:47.224
- We need your statement. - This is...

1078
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:50.528
In October of 2008,

1079
00:41:50.795 --> 00:41:54.165
were you in charge of "People Looking for Laughter"?

1080
00:41:54.165 --> 00:41:55.232
(Is this true?)

1081
00:41:55.699 --> 00:42:00.604
(Se Chan's memory is in question. Is his memory true?)

1082
00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:02.473
Yes, I was in charge of the skit Se Chan was in.

1083
00:42:02.473 --> 00:42:03.841
(His story checks out.)

1084
00:42:03.841 --> 00:42:05.910
- Thank you, sir. - Actor of the Month Award...

1085
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:09.713
- Do you remember giving the award? - Ask him if he remembers it.

1086
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:11.816
Well, Actor of the Month Award...

1087
00:42:11.816 --> 00:42:13.818
wasn't a prestigious award.

1088
00:42:13.818 --> 00:42:17.655
(Actor of the Month Award wasn't that prestigious.)

1089
00:42:18.989 --> 00:42:23.561
(The truth unfolds after 9 years. It wasn't a prestigious award.)

1090
00:42:23.561 --> 00:42:26.363
I bet everyone got the award.

1091
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.066
I wanted the comedians to work hard.

1092
00:42:30.067 --> 00:42:33.437
We gave the awards out to encourage them. They aren't that important.

1093
00:42:33.437 --> 00:42:35.873
(I get it now. They just wanted to encourage me.)

1094
00:42:35.873 --> 00:42:37.541
I guess it's like Secret Santa.

1095
00:42:37.541 --> 00:42:39.076
They give those out to everyone.

1096
00:42:39.143 --> 00:42:41.345
- It's like they took turns for it. - It's like Secret Santa.

1097
00:42:41.378 --> 00:42:43.914
I understand. Thank you for your time.

1098
00:42:43.914 --> 00:42:45.683
- Sure. - Have a good day.

1099
00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.785
- It was true. - At least...

1100
00:42:47.785 --> 00:42:50.254
- At least... Don't be. - I'm sorry that I doubted you.

1101
00:42:50.354 --> 00:42:53.457
- Let me say this is a real award. - That's right.

1102
00:42:53.457 --> 00:42:54.658
The appraised value...

1103
00:42:54.859 --> 00:42:57.294
is 22 dollars and 25 cents, the highest amount so far.

1104
00:42:57.294 --> 00:42:58.462
(The appraised value is 22 dollars and 25 cents.)

1105
00:42:58.629 --> 00:43:01.465
I gave this a lot of thought.

1106
00:43:01.899 --> 00:43:04.869
- I prepared a gift set. - You did?

1107
00:43:04.869 --> 00:43:07.638
- That's a lot. - He brought a lot of stuff.

1108
00:43:07.872 --> 00:43:11.709
- That's a duffel bag. - These might make you cringe,

1109
00:43:11.709 --> 00:43:13.978
but I'm quite sentimental.

1110
00:43:13.978 --> 00:43:16.046
- He took this seriously. - He did.

1111
00:43:16.146 --> 00:43:18.549
I struggled a lot back in the days.

1112
00:43:18.949 --> 00:43:20.217
First of all,

1113
00:43:20.551 --> 00:43:23.721
when the ratings of the show weren't great...

1114
00:43:24.121 --> 00:43:25.389
However, we weren't...

1115
00:43:25.789 --> 00:43:28.158
Tell your story after you show us your item.

1116
00:43:28.492 --> 00:43:31.595
- You're making me angry. - What is it?

1117
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:33.697
Give me a minute. However,

1118
00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:35.799
we might've stayed in status quo.

1119
00:43:35.799 --> 00:43:37.201
(We might have stayed in status quo...)

1120
00:43:37.201 --> 00:43:39.703
- We tightened laces and ran harder. - We tried harder.

1121
00:43:39.703 --> 00:43:42.006
- So what is your object? - Exactly.

1122
00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:44.742
- Exactly. - So I prepared sneakers.

1123
00:43:44.742 --> 00:43:47.311
(His first nostalgic object is a pair of plain sneakers.)

1124
00:43:47.311 --> 00:43:49.280
- You got that from your car trunk! - Hey!

1125
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.681
I bet he took them out from the trunk.

1126
00:43:51.348 --> 00:43:53.117
In my opinion, he got them straight out of the trunk.

1127
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.252
Weren't you wearing those this morning?

1128
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.321
I'm being serious.

1129
00:43:57.721 --> 00:43:58.989
- Hey! - I'm not fooling around.

1130
00:43:59.189 --> 00:44:00.457
- Are you serious? - Please look at my eyes.

1131
00:44:00.457 --> 00:44:01.792
I'm not goofing around.

1132
00:44:02.159 --> 00:44:04.828
- Don't provoke our sentiments. - And this always...

1133
00:44:04.828 --> 00:44:07.064
kept my back safe.

1134
00:44:07.798 --> 00:44:09.934
(The second object is the name tag they put on for every shoot.)

1135
00:44:09.934 --> 00:44:11.402
- Come on! Hey! - You've got to be kidding.

1136
00:44:11.835 --> 00:44:13.504
Didn't we use that name tag yesterday?

1137
00:44:13.938 --> 00:44:17.074
- Come on! What is this? - We all have that.

1138
00:44:17.207 --> 00:44:18.342
The number's going to be the lowest.

1139
00:44:18.609 --> 00:44:20.444
- I already wrote down the number. - Everyone has it.

1140
00:44:20.544 --> 00:44:22.079
- I put down my number. - And...

1141
00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:25.316
You might not know this. All of you just talked and laughed.

1142
00:44:25.582 --> 00:44:27.584
However, when I was tired and exhausted, I got home...

1143
00:44:27.584 --> 00:44:29.820
Truth be told, many of you called me.

1144
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.121
- You all felt empty inside. - What's the next one?

1145
00:44:31.188 --> 00:44:33.724
- Seok Jin and Kwang Soo called me. - That's true.

1146
00:44:33.724 --> 00:44:36.894
Whenever I got that call, this comforted and filled my life.

1147
00:44:36.894 --> 00:44:38.729
To me, this was a remedy.

1148
00:44:38.729 --> 00:44:40.397
(This was like a remedy that comforted him.)

1149
00:44:40.397 --> 00:44:41.598
- He's serious about this one. - This was a remedy.

1150
00:44:41.699 --> 00:44:43.834
(Remedy? This sounds like it might be about our memories.)

1151
00:44:43.834 --> 00:44:45.002
- What is it? - Show us.

1152
00:44:45.035 --> 00:44:46.270
(Remedy? This sounds like it might be about our memories.)

1153
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.871
- Spicy noodles. - Come on, Haha!

1154
00:44:47.871 --> 00:44:50.975
(His third nostalgic object is a bag of spicy noodles.)

1155
00:44:50.975 --> 00:44:53.210
- Hey, are you serious? - I'm so serious.

1156
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:54.979
(Gosh, he fooled me again.)

1157
00:44:54.979 --> 00:44:56.814
Hey, you con artist!

1158
00:44:56.914 --> 00:44:58.649
- Haha, this is too mean. - Do you want me to scold you?

1159
00:44:58.649 --> 00:44:59.917
- And there's one more. - You!

1160
00:44:59.917 --> 00:45:02.519
- Hey. - Hold on, there's more.

1161
00:45:02.519 --> 00:45:04.388
Fans of Running Man in Thailand, are you watching?

1162
00:45:04.521 --> 00:45:07.992
- Thanks for tom yum goong noodles! - You, come here. Let this go.

1163
00:45:07.992 --> 00:45:09.526
Take these with you, and go on a trip alone.

1164
00:45:10.227 --> 00:45:11.695
Hey, leave! Go!

1165
00:45:12.162 --> 00:45:13.397
How could you?

1166
00:45:13.397 --> 00:45:14.832
- Seriously. - Unbelievable.

1167
00:45:14.932 --> 00:45:17.334
- You're such a jerk! - I can't believe you.

1168
00:45:17.334 --> 00:45:19.236
You got here and just put some stuff together.

1169
00:45:19.269 --> 00:45:20.771
- I... - Let's hear the appraised value.

1170
00:45:20.771 --> 00:45:24.041
- I really thought about every item. - 1... 1...

1171
00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:26.744
We are the members of Running Man!

1172
00:45:27.511 --> 00:45:29.847
- He's shameless. - 1, 2, 3.

1173
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.982
0.1 cent, 0.1 cent...

1174
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:33.684
0.2 cent, 0.1 cent...

1175
00:45:33.684 --> 00:45:36.720
The appraised value of Haha's package for the fall trip is...

1176
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.888
0.2 cent.

1177
00:45:37.888 --> 00:45:39.723
(It's a gift set that costs only 0.2 cent.)

1178
00:45:39.723 --> 00:45:41.992
I thought this was a gift set.

1179
00:45:41.992 --> 00:45:44.461
- It's lower than Seok Jin's. - 0.2 cent.

1180
00:45:44.795 --> 00:45:46.497
It was worse than the Ebola story.

1181
00:45:46.497 --> 00:45:49.066
Are we still family?

1182
00:45:51.101 --> 00:45:52.503
Don't call me again.

1183
00:45:53.437 --> 00:45:54.538
Stop it.

1184
00:45:54.538 --> 00:45:55.973
Don't call me. I'm serious.

1185
00:45:55.973 --> 00:45:57.007
(I'll go on a trip alone.)

1186
00:45:58.308 --> 00:46:01.011
- Ji Hyo. - I'm...

1187
00:46:01.545 --> 00:46:03.180
not a good talker.

1188
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.549
Mine is not related to Running Man.

1189
00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:06.817
Really?

1190
00:46:06.817 --> 00:46:08.052
And you're going to present it to us?

1191
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.022
- It's my childhood memory. - I see.

1192
00:46:12.022 --> 00:46:14.725
I couldn't find what I wanted to find.

1193
00:46:14.725 --> 00:46:17.094
- What is that? - Garden balsam flowers.

1194
00:46:17.895 --> 00:46:21.065
(Garden balsam flowers)

1195
00:46:21.832 --> 00:46:24.968
- Wait. Where did you find it? - I tried to...

1196
00:46:24.968 --> 00:46:26.603
find it in my neighborhood, but...

1197
00:46:27.371 --> 00:46:31.375
Were you the one who picked all the flowers?

1198
00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:32.409
(Were you the thief?)

1199
00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:33.477
No.

1200
00:46:33.477 --> 00:46:37.247
I bought this at a supermarket yesterday.

1201
00:46:37.247 --> 00:46:39.583
I used to do it...

1202
00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:41.952
- with my grandma too. - With our grandmothers.

1203
00:46:41.952 --> 00:46:44.288
With ground alum.

1204
00:46:44.288 --> 00:46:46.290
- If it stays until the first snow, - Right.

1205
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.624
- your crush will love you back. - Exactly.

1206
00:46:47.624 --> 00:46:48.692
(That's why I did it.)

1207
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.263
(If the color stays until the first snow, you'll be loved back.)

1208
00:46:53.263 --> 00:46:54.531
That's not true.

1209
00:46:55.432 --> 00:46:57.468
I had a lot of color left,

1210
00:46:58.102 --> 00:46:59.603
but my crush didn't love me back.

1211
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:01.572
Never.

1212
00:47:01.939 --> 00:47:04.541
He used to go to clubs with dyed fingernails.

1213
00:47:04.541 --> 00:47:05.576
(They can imagine it.)

1214
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.745
And toenails too.

1215
00:47:08.745 --> 00:47:11.448
(His toenails would be dyed too.)

1216
00:47:11.582 --> 00:47:15.119
(It's a sad memory.)

1217
00:47:15.352 --> 00:47:18.722
After dying our fingernails with garden balsams,

1218
00:47:18.789 --> 00:47:21.291
my mom dyed...

1219
00:47:21.291 --> 00:47:23.560
my dad's little fingernail.

1220
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.762
- She did? - She dyed his nail too.

1221
00:47:25.762 --> 00:47:27.798
When just a bit of color was left,

1222
00:47:27.798 --> 00:47:33.003
he was so surprised in the middle of picking his nose.

1223
00:47:33.103 --> 00:47:34.571
Did he think he was bleeding?

1224
00:47:34.705 --> 00:47:36.273
He though his nose was bleeding.

1225
00:47:36.273 --> 00:47:39.243
He screamed.

1226
00:47:39.243 --> 00:47:40.410
"Dad, what's wrong?"

1227
00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:41.845
"Nothing."

1228
00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:44.248
He thought his nose was bleeding.

1229
00:47:44.248 --> 00:47:46.183
Her family is funny.

1230
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.052
- That was funny. - So Min.

1231
00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.389
All girls...

1232
00:47:52.389 --> 00:47:54.791
could relate...

1233
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:56.793
So you dyed your fingernails with garden balsams.

1234
00:47:56.793 --> 00:47:59.163
Did it help you get a boyfriend?

1235
00:47:59.163 --> 00:48:00.664
- What memory do you have? - Are there any...

1236
00:48:00.664 --> 00:48:04.701
- romantic memories? - Then I wouldn't be here right now.

1237
00:48:04.701 --> 00:48:06.103
Where would you be?

1238
00:48:06.103 --> 00:48:09.540
I'd be someone's wife.

1239
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.975
You can still be working.

1240
00:48:11.975 --> 00:48:13.243
What are you talking about?

1241
00:48:13.243 --> 00:48:14.811
You can still be on Running Man after getting married.

1242
00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:17.714
- You don't have to get married. - You're blushing.

1243
00:48:18.248 --> 00:48:19.850
- Why... - What memory do you have?

1244
00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:21.084
- are you attacking me? - Ji Hyo.

1245
00:48:21.084 --> 00:48:22.653
Stay strong to the end.

1246
00:48:22.719 --> 00:48:26.156
These days, everything changes so quickly.

1247
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:28.292
Nail polish can be removed...

1248
00:48:28.292 --> 00:48:30.327
Ji Hyo is trying so hard.

1249
00:48:30.561 --> 00:48:32.329
She's trying hard.

1250
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:35.065
She's suddenly discussing generation gaps.

1251
00:48:35.065 --> 00:48:38.101
I'm not trying to talk about my memories.

1252
00:48:38.101 --> 00:48:41.104
Just imagine my being a kid, waiting for the first snow.

1253
00:48:41.104 --> 00:48:44.641
- "So I dyed my nails yesterday." - "So I dyed my nails yesterday."

1254
00:48:44.641 --> 00:48:46.476
- Exactly. - "When will the first snow come?"

1255
00:48:46.476 --> 00:48:49.379
I didn't. I couldn't find any garden balsams.

1256
00:48:49.379 --> 00:48:52.749
- Fine. - I bought it at the supermarket.

1257
00:48:52.749 --> 00:48:54.618
This is Ji Hyo.

1258
00:48:55.018 --> 00:48:56.119
This is Ji Hyo.

1259
00:48:56.119 --> 00:48:58.021
I'm done.

1260
00:48:58.288 --> 00:49:01.124
I can't give it a high price.

1261
00:49:01.124 --> 00:49:02.159
(Garden balsams, 6 dollars and 22 cents)

1262
00:49:02.159 --> 00:49:05.862
- My memory is... - What is it?

1263
00:49:06.797 --> 00:49:08.465
- Kwang Soo, what are you doing? - Nothing.

1264
00:49:09.433 --> 00:49:11.368
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

1265
00:49:11.368 --> 00:49:15.472
He wrote a name on his giraffe.

1266
00:49:15.472 --> 00:49:16.673
- Well... - "Dan Bi"?

1267
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.375
- Is it a girl? - Kwang Soo.

1268
00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:20.143
- Listen. - He gave the giraffe a name.

1269
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.812
- Dan Bi. - He named the giraffe.

1270
00:49:21.812 --> 00:49:23.180
- It's nothing. - Let's listen to So Min.

1271
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.382
Just so you know,

1272
00:49:25.582 --> 00:49:27.818
he wrote the name just now.

1273
00:49:28.285 --> 00:49:30.020
First,

1274
00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.924
this is about 12 years old.

1275
00:49:34.524 --> 00:49:35.659
You still have it?

1276
00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:38.428
Have you ever heard of this?

1277
00:49:38.428 --> 00:49:42.399
If you happen to catch a falling leaf,

1278
00:49:42.399 --> 00:49:43.900
- your wish will come true. - Right.

1279
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.403
Right. Your first love will love you back.

1280
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:47.938
I was walking on the street,

1281
00:49:47.938 --> 00:49:50.207
- and this ended up in my hood. - Really?

1282
00:49:50.207 --> 00:49:52.476
I thought, "It means I'll get into a university."

1283
00:49:52.476 --> 00:49:54.111
What happened?

1284
00:49:54.111 --> 00:49:55.812
- I got in. - That's incredible.

1285
00:49:55.812 --> 00:49:57.581
Your wish was to get into a university?

1286
00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:02.352
(Thanks to that falling leaf, she got into a university.)

1287
00:50:02.352 --> 00:50:07.024
- When you see a beat-up car? - You wink.

1288
00:50:07.391 --> 00:50:09.493
- Wink? - She knows so many of those.

1289
00:50:09.493 --> 00:50:12.329
- But... - Her day is full of those things.

1290
00:50:13.063 --> 00:50:15.599
It's full of superstitions.

1291
00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:16.800
(She's busy.)

1292
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.235
I'm very busy.

1293
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:24.274
(She winked at a beat-up car even while shooting.)

1294
00:50:24.741 --> 00:50:27.144
She winked three times at a beat-up car.

1295
00:50:27.144 --> 00:50:29.179
When she sees two, she winks twice.

1296
00:50:29.179 --> 00:50:31.581
- She makes us do it too. - If you wink at the driver,

1297
00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:33.950
it'll bring even more good luck.

1298
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.252
- At the driver? - Yes.

1299
00:50:35.452 --> 00:50:36.620
I see.

1300
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.389
- And... - It's not easy...

1301
00:50:39.389 --> 00:50:41.992
- That's a real memory. - to keep those things.

1302
00:50:41.992 --> 00:50:43.327
(She has another item.)

1303
00:50:43.493 --> 00:50:46.029
This is my diary I wrote in the fall...

1304
00:50:46.029 --> 00:50:47.764
when I was in third grade.

1305
00:50:48.432 --> 00:50:50.701
- You still have it? - Unbelievable.

1306
00:50:51.068 --> 00:50:53.103
- This is amazing. - That's incredible.

1307
00:50:53.103 --> 00:50:54.738
It's...

1308
00:50:54.871 --> 00:50:56.840
You wrote a letter to Saet Byul.

1309
00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.608
I don't remember her well.

1310
00:50:58.608 --> 00:50:59.910
"Hi, Saet Byul. It's So Min."

1311
00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.079
"I heard you were transferring to another school soon."

1312
00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:05.349
"Can't you stay at Neunggok Elementary School?"

1313
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:07.551
- "You're my best friend." - That's cute.

1314
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:08.685
- "Even if you move," - That's cute.

1315
00:51:08.685 --> 00:51:11.388
"please don't forget me, and let's stay friends forever."

1316
00:51:11.722 --> 00:51:13.990
- "Bye." - That's so sweet.

1317
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:15.492
She wrote it in third grade.

1318
00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:16.893
It touched me.

1319
00:51:16.893 --> 00:51:19.396
- Do you remember Saet Byul? - No.

1320
00:51:19.396 --> 00:51:20.430
Really?

1321
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:22.466
It's an old memory.

1322
00:51:22.666 --> 00:51:25.068
Why would you write a letter in your diary?

1323
00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:28.438
I wanted to try a new format.

1324
00:51:28.438 --> 00:51:30.741
Now that I think of it,

1325
00:51:31.475 --> 00:51:33.243
isn't this a bit inauthentic?

1326
00:51:33.243 --> 00:51:34.811
(Was it just for show?)

1327
00:51:34.811 --> 00:51:36.847
- Wait. - Didn't you...

1328
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.082
There was no Saet Byul in the first place.

1329
00:51:39.082 --> 00:51:40.784
(What if Saet Byul didn't exist?)

1330
00:51:40.784 --> 00:51:42.386
Did you just make it up?

1331
00:51:44.287 --> 00:51:47.224
(Why couldn't she send this letter?)

1332
00:51:47.224 --> 00:51:50.193
(Is it because Saet Byul didn't exist?)

1333
00:51:50.861 --> 00:51:52.662
- Look at the handwriting. - You made it sloppy on purpose?

1334
00:51:52.662 --> 00:51:54.598
Wait.

1335
00:51:54.598 --> 00:51:56.066
- Did she... - It's a letter.

1336
00:51:56.066 --> 00:51:57.701
Did she write it yesterday?

1337
00:51:57.834 --> 00:51:58.969
Did you...

1338
00:51:58.969 --> 00:52:00.771
Did you write it with your left hand yesterday?

1339
00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:02.939
Saet Byul is fictional, right?

1340
00:52:02.939 --> 00:52:04.841
The notebook is very clean.

1341
00:52:04.975 --> 00:52:06.810
- I didn't. - She probably...

1342
00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:08.578
So Min is not normal.

1343
00:52:08.578 --> 00:52:10.414
It doesn't surprise me.

1344
00:52:10.414 --> 00:52:11.415
(So Min can do anything.)

1345
00:52:11.415 --> 00:52:12.516
Look at this.

1346
00:52:12.516 --> 00:52:14.451
- "My Imagination". - That's the title.

1347
00:52:15.018 --> 00:52:18.955
"I want the fall to be the way I want."

1348
00:52:18.955 --> 00:52:22.159
"I want the gingko leaves to be half-red and half-yellow."

1349
00:52:22.159 --> 00:52:23.393
- It's fall. - "I want the maple leaves to be..."

1350
00:52:23.393 --> 00:52:26.129
- "half-blue and half-sky blue." - This is amazing.

1351
00:52:26.129 --> 00:52:30.033
"I want the fields to have the colors of the rainbow."

1352
00:52:30.567 --> 00:52:33.203
You spelled "rainbow" wrong.

1353
00:52:33.203 --> 00:52:36.339
("Rainbow" is spelled incorrectly.)

1354
00:52:36.339 --> 00:52:37.908
She was a kid.

1355
00:52:37.908 --> 00:52:40.377
She was in third grade.

1356
00:52:40.377 --> 00:52:43.580
- She was a kid. - That's cute.

1357
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.550
I want the dragonflies to be green, blue, and yellow.

1358
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.218
Won't the world come to an end that way?

1359
00:52:48.218 --> 00:52:52.656
- Let's just listen. - Okay.

1360
00:52:52.889 --> 00:52:54.157
It brings back...

1361
00:52:54.391 --> 00:52:56.860
old memories.

1362
00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.762
It's so So Min.

1363
00:52:58.762 --> 00:53:01.665
- Wasn't she so cute? - She was.

1364
00:53:01.665 --> 00:53:02.732
It's incredible.

1365
00:53:03.066 --> 00:53:05.368
- She wrote about frogs too. - She wrote about frogs.

1366
00:53:05.368 --> 00:53:06.870
"Frogs are croaking."

1367
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.638
"Frogs with big eyes..."

1368
00:53:08.638 --> 00:53:12.209
"sing by the pond..."

1369
00:53:12.209 --> 00:53:14.144
"on a rainy day."

1370
00:53:14.144 --> 00:53:15.579
This is...

1371
00:53:15.579 --> 00:53:19.349
By the way, the weather was sunny every day.

1372
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:21.017
It's always like that.

1373
00:53:21.017 --> 00:53:23.854
That's because you write them all on the same day.

1374
00:53:23.854 --> 00:53:25.188
The weather is...

1375
00:53:25.188 --> 00:53:26.256
(It's always sunny.)

1376
00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:29.059
- She wrote them on the same day. - It was always sunny.

1377
00:53:29.059 --> 00:53:30.594
The weather was...

1378
00:53:30.894 --> 00:53:32.829
sunny for two months.

1379
00:53:33.063 --> 00:53:34.865
- It's sunny every day. - It's like in LA.

1380
00:53:35.065 --> 00:53:36.967
She lived in LA.

1381
00:53:37.167 --> 00:53:39.135
She must have studied abroad.

1382
00:53:39.769 --> 00:53:41.071
Neunggok, LA.

1383
00:53:41.371 --> 00:53:42.873
She lived in Neunggok, LA.

1384
00:53:42.873 --> 00:53:44.741
I have another item.

1385
00:53:44.741 --> 00:53:46.309
- You do? - Show us.

1386
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:47.310
It's a napkin.

1387
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:50.313
It's a bit wrinkly.

1388
00:53:50.313 --> 00:53:52.282
It's from a coffee shop.

1389
00:53:52.282 --> 00:53:53.950
Please blur the name.

1390
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:57.988
"November 30, 2010. I wiped my tears with this."

1391
00:53:57.988 --> 00:53:59.489
- "Because of J." - After a break-up?

1392
00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:01.224
- I was... - Did you break up with someone?

1393
00:54:01.391 --> 00:54:03.059
And you...

1394
00:54:03.059 --> 00:54:04.427
- held on to it? - You held on to it?

1395
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:05.662
Think about...

1396
00:54:05.662 --> 00:54:08.431
how much it would scare that person.

1397
00:54:08.431 --> 00:54:11.301
- We don't know who that is, but... - He must be scared.

1398
00:54:11.301 --> 00:54:13.270
(Please get rid of that!)

1399
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:14.638
Please stop!

1400
00:54:15.472 --> 00:54:16.706
Get rid of it.

1401
00:54:16.706 --> 00:54:18.542
That guy must be so scared.

1402
00:54:18.542 --> 00:54:22.078
I can't believe she held on to it.

1403
00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:24.147
So Min, you're unbelievable.

1404
00:54:24.147 --> 00:54:28.885
So Min's items are worth 39 dollars and 25 cents.

1405
00:54:29.519 --> 00:54:32.222
It's time to meet Dan Bi.

1406
00:54:32.489 --> 00:54:34.224
- Let's meet her. - I brought Dan Bi.

1407
00:54:34.224 --> 00:54:35.659
Who is that?

1408
00:54:35.725 --> 00:54:38.428
Who is Dan Bi?

1409
00:54:38.662 --> 00:54:41.364
That name was given just three minutes ago.

1410
00:54:42.165 --> 00:54:43.600
- This is Dan Bi. - Her neck is bent.

1411
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.803
(Dan Bi's neck is bent.)

1412
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.238
You shouldn't do that.

1413
00:54:48.238 --> 00:54:50.941
Did she inspire...

1414
00:54:50.941 --> 00:54:53.476
your hairstyle?

1415
00:54:53.476 --> 00:54:55.412
- What are you talking about? - You went to the same hairdresser?

1416
00:54:55.412 --> 00:54:57.447
No, I didn't.

1417
00:54:57.881 --> 00:55:00.684
- It looks like a mane. - They look similar.

1418
00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.153
This giraffe...

1419
00:55:03.687 --> 00:55:05.021
means a lot to me.

1420
00:55:05.021 --> 00:55:07.757
On Running Man,

1421
00:55:08.158 --> 00:55:11.328
Jae Seok nicknamed me Giraffe.

1422
00:55:11.728 --> 00:55:13.797
This is the first stuffed giraffe I received after that.

1423
00:55:13.797 --> 00:55:15.532
- Really? - That's meaningful.

1424
00:55:15.699 --> 00:55:17.000
Did you get it in fall?

1425
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.568
(It needs to be related to fall.)

1426
00:55:18.568 --> 00:55:19.803
Sorry? Yes.

1427
00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:22.739
(He feels guilty.)

1428
00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:25.241
- It was around fall. - Can you prove it?

1429
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:26.509
How are you going to prove that?

1430
00:55:26.509 --> 00:55:27.611
It was in fall.

1431
00:55:27.611 --> 00:55:29.212
Why did you name her Dan Bi?

1432
00:55:29.479 --> 00:55:31.247
- It's because... - Is it your ex-girlfriend's name?

1433
00:55:31.247 --> 00:55:32.282
No.

1434
00:55:32.282 --> 00:55:34.451
- How long were you together? - It's...

1435
00:55:34.851 --> 00:55:36.353
How long did you go out with her?

1436
00:55:36.353 --> 00:55:39.389
Dan Bi was the name of the dog I had for 13 years.

1437
00:55:39.389 --> 00:55:42.826
(Dan Bi wasn't his ex-girlfriend.)

1438
00:55:42.892 --> 00:55:44.961
(What's this all of a sudden?)

1439
00:55:45.795 --> 00:55:47.831
That sounds strange.

1440
00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:50.500
He changes the conversation in a strange way.

1441
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.569
- It's true. I'm not lying. - That sounds nice.

1442
00:55:52.569 --> 00:55:55.872
Dan Bi isn't alive anymore.

1443
00:55:55.872 --> 00:55:57.874
- Is that so? - Keep it short.

1444
00:55:57.874 --> 00:55:59.843
- Keep it short. - Okay.

1445
00:56:00.143 --> 00:56:01.478
That's all I'll say.

1446
00:56:01.478 --> 00:56:05.548
(He stops explaining.)

1447
00:56:05.548 --> 00:56:07.651
(Go on and finish your story.)

1448
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:09.419
- You should continue. - The story of my dog...

1449
00:56:09.419 --> 00:56:11.021
is a different story.

1450
00:56:11.021 --> 00:56:13.356
- What about this? - Is the story of your dog...

1451
00:56:13.356 --> 00:56:15.659
- separate? - It's a personal story.

1452
00:56:15.659 --> 00:56:17.494
- Why did you bring it up? - Why did you bring up your dog?

1453
00:56:17.494 --> 00:56:18.962
- Pardon? - Why did you bring up your dog?

1454
00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:20.530
It just came to my mind.

1455
00:56:21.765 --> 00:56:24.534
I've made my decision.

1456
00:56:25.468 --> 00:56:27.270
- Wait a minute. - I've already decided.

1457
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:29.506
- Dan Bi, take care. - Come on.

1458
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.975
- I still love you. - I've decided.

1459
00:56:31.975 --> 00:56:35.178
- One... - I'm here today because of her.

1460
00:56:35.178 --> 00:56:36.579
(He tries to appeal to the audience.)

1461
00:56:36.579 --> 00:56:38.048
I wouldn't be here without this toy.

1462
00:56:38.048 --> 00:56:39.082
(Everyone gives a low price.)

1463
00:56:39.082 --> 00:56:42.986
Kwang Soo's appraisal value is two cents.

1464
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.056
Everyone is given their appraisal value.

1465
00:56:46.289 --> 00:56:49.659
Today's race is Unforgettable Autumn Trip Race.

1466
00:56:49.659 --> 00:56:52.062
(Unforgettable Autumn Trip Race)

1467
00:56:52.729 --> 00:56:56.199
Once you finish Autumn Trip within budget,

1468
00:56:56.199 --> 00:56:57.434
you clear the mission.

1469
00:56:57.434 --> 00:56:59.169
What can we do with 0.2 or 5 cents?

1470
00:56:59.169 --> 00:57:01.571
Do we ask for help from those who have money?

1471
00:57:01.971 --> 00:57:04.541
However, you'll play in teams today.

1472
00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:07.377
(The members share the budget. They won't have to fight each other.)

1473
00:57:07.377 --> 00:57:08.411
Is it a team competition?

1474
00:57:08.978 --> 00:57:12.449
We'll take budge away from your team whenever you fail a mission.

1475
00:57:12.449 --> 00:57:14.951
(Team budget gets subtracted every time they fail a mission.)

1476
00:57:14.951 --> 00:57:18.555
(Do we share our appraisal value?)

1477
00:57:18.988 --> 00:57:22.826
We were competing within our team.

1478
00:57:22.959 --> 00:57:25.228
- My goodness. - Why didn't you write 50 dollars?

1479
00:57:25.228 --> 00:57:28.164
Why didn't you bring something good?

1480
00:57:28.164 --> 00:57:30.133
- We competed within our team. - Come on.

1481
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.170
If you need additional money for the trip besides the one we're giving,

1482
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:37.674
you may leave your item at the pawnshop.

1483
00:57:37.707 --> 00:57:40.076
We'll lend you money based on the value.

1484
00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:44.447
If you don't have your item when the trip is over,

1485
00:57:44.547 --> 00:57:47.550
you'll experience water bomb in the final stage.

1486
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:49.853
Please take out loans wisely.

1487
00:57:49.853 --> 00:57:50.887
(You may get water bombed.)

1488
00:57:50.954 --> 00:57:54.390
You have to leave your item at the pawnshop to take out a loan.

1489
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:58.528
As such, you must carry your item throughout the race.

1490
00:57:58.528 --> 00:57:59.829
What about Dan Bi?

1491
00:57:59.829 --> 00:58:02.098
You must carry your item throughout the race.

1492
00:58:02.198 --> 00:58:03.199
We must carry it?

1493
00:58:03.199 --> 00:58:06.002
(Do I have to carry Dan Bi around?)

1494
00:58:06.369 --> 00:58:07.637
Do we have to carry it?

1495
00:58:07.771 --> 00:58:11.174
You'll start the mission to win basic budget for the trip.

1496
00:58:12.308 --> 00:58:13.409
Everyone.

1497
00:58:13.409 --> 00:58:14.577
(They're about to start.)

1498
00:58:15.178 --> 00:58:18.782
We attached the appraisal value to your item.

1499
00:58:18.782 --> 00:58:19.849
What is he doing?

1500
00:58:19.849 --> 00:58:20.984
(He's a nuisance.)

1501
00:58:22.018 --> 00:58:23.453
He's with Dan Bi.

1502
00:58:23.453 --> 00:58:25.255
- I have Dan Bi on my back. - They're having fun.

1503
00:58:25.522 --> 00:58:28.658
When we were in school, our grandparents used to...

1504
00:58:28.658 --> 00:58:31.094
- carry babies behind their back. - That's right.

1505
00:58:31.294 --> 00:58:32.395
Is that only worth 10 cents?

1506
00:58:32.395 --> 00:58:33.429
(He's still disappointed.)

1507
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:36.266
All of us are wearing backpacks.

1508
00:58:36.266 --> 00:58:37.867
It looks worse on Jong Kook.

1509
00:58:38.067 --> 00:58:39.736
That's what I thought too.

1510
00:58:39.736 --> 00:58:41.838
- Come on. - Seriously. Turn around.

1511
00:58:41.838 --> 00:58:43.506
- What's wrong? - It looks bad on him.

1512
00:58:43.506 --> 00:58:45.975
- It's so small. - I bet he never used a backpack.

1513
00:58:45.975 --> 00:58:48.244
- You see muscles on the side. - It's tiny.

1514
00:58:48.244 --> 00:58:49.479
(He's too muscular.)

1515
00:58:49.479 --> 00:58:51.381
- The backpack looks too small. - That's right.

1516
00:58:51.381 --> 00:58:53.216
I didn't use a backpack when I was in school.

1517
00:58:53.216 --> 00:58:55.351
- That's right. - Someone must've carried it.

1518
00:58:55.351 --> 00:58:58.354
It was a black and rectangular briefcase, and I carried the tip.

1519
00:58:58.354 --> 00:58:59.656
That's right.

1520
00:58:59.656 --> 00:59:01.090
- Did you carry it? - He didn't carry any books.

1521
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.026
- What did you have in it? - Nothing.

1522
00:59:03.026 --> 00:59:04.727
(Jae Seok is curious.)

1523
00:59:05.528 --> 00:59:07.363
I had a metal tray inside.

1524
00:59:07.363 --> 00:59:08.898
(He carried a metal tray.)

1525
00:59:08.898 --> 00:59:10.233
- A metal tray? - Nunchucks?

1526
00:59:10.233 --> 00:59:11.801
- Why? - Was it a lunchbox?

1527
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:13.736
- Why would you carry that? - To hit people.

1528
00:59:13.736 --> 00:59:15.271
- He's strange. - Something to hit people with.

1529
00:59:16.172 --> 00:59:18.741
Let's start the team mission to win the basic budget for the trip.

1530
00:59:18.741 --> 00:59:20.577
It's called Flower Field Zero.

1531
00:59:20.577 --> 00:59:21.611
- What is it? - Flower Field Zero?

1532
00:59:21.611 --> 00:59:22.745
(Flower Field Zero)

1533
00:59:23.112 --> 00:59:26.516
With hands under your chin, you'll play five rounds.

1534
00:59:26.516 --> 00:59:28.351
You win if the number I call from 0 to 8...

1535
00:59:28.351 --> 00:59:30.753
is different from the number of standing members.

1536
00:59:31.054 --> 00:59:33.323
You gain 10 dollars. If the number is the same,

1537
00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:35.859
- you fail, and the mission is over. - Okay.

1538
00:59:35.859 --> 00:59:40.363
If you succeed, you may decide to continue the next round.

1539
00:59:40.363 --> 00:59:41.865
When you succeed,

1540
00:59:41.865 --> 00:59:45.068
- you win 10 dollars again. - I understand.

1541
00:59:45.068 --> 00:59:46.302
Let's do it. We need to eat.

1542
00:59:46.302 --> 00:59:48.238
- Let's do it. - Let's do a good job.

1543
00:59:48.238 --> 00:59:49.272
Seriously.

1544
00:59:49.672 --> 00:59:51.341
Let's start Flower Field Zero.

1545
00:59:51.341 --> 00:59:54.177
Everyone, please sit down.

1546
00:59:54.177 --> 00:59:55.278
What happens when we win?

1547
00:59:55.278 --> 00:59:57.313
Kwang Soo's giraffe will be too visible.

1548
00:59:58.114 --> 01:00:00.149
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1549
01:00:00.149 --> 01:00:01.918
Does the giraffe count as well?

1550
01:00:01.918 --> 01:00:02.919
- No. - She doesn't?

1551
01:00:02.919 --> 01:00:04.320
- No. - Dan Bi isn't alive.

1552
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.489
We have to be observant.

1553
01:00:06.489 --> 01:00:07.824
Be careful of zero.

1554
01:00:07.824 --> 01:00:09.592
Okay. That's important.

1555
01:00:10.059 --> 01:00:12.262
You must stand with hands under your chin.

1556
01:00:12.262 --> 01:00:13.263
Hands under the chin?

1557
01:00:13.263 --> 01:00:14.664
Let's start Round One.

1558
01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:16.633
1, 2, 3.

1559
01:00:17.767 --> 01:00:20.503
(How will their Round 1 go?)

1560
01:00:21.271 --> 01:00:22.572
1, 2, 3.

1561
01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:23.573
Three.

1562
01:00:23.573 --> 01:00:26.175
(5 members stand up.)

1563
01:00:26.175 --> 01:00:27.243
(They win Round 1.)

1564
01:00:27.243 --> 01:00:29.279
- We won. - We did.

1565
01:00:29.279 --> 01:00:31.180
(They win while looking cute.)

1566
01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.383
- Good job. - That was great.

1567
01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:35.785
Will you stop at 10 dollars or continue?

1568
01:00:35.785 --> 01:00:37.353
- We continue. - We'll do it.

1569
01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.623
- 10 dollars is not enough. - We're likely to win.

1570
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:42.859
- Let's keep going. - Right.

1571
01:00:42.859 --> 01:00:44.627
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

1572
01:00:44.961 --> 01:00:47.730
Se Chan, are you really the youngest here?

1573
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:49.465
- Why? - Is it because of his looks?

1574
01:00:49.465 --> 01:00:50.500
His looks...

1575
01:00:50.967 --> 01:00:53.269
He doesn't seem the youngest.

1576
01:00:53.269 --> 01:00:54.938
He doesn't look the youngest.

1577
01:00:55.071 --> 01:00:56.105
You'd better be good.

1578
01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.274
What was that?

1579
01:00:58.908 --> 01:00:59.976
What was that?

1580
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.545
- What just happened? - Se Chan is...

1581
01:01:02.612 --> 01:01:04.747
the boss when the three of us are alone.

1582
01:01:05.181 --> 01:01:07.350
- In that case... - He's very strong.

1583
01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:08.718
He has a strong presence.

1584
01:01:08.718 --> 01:01:11.054
Let's start Round 2. If you win, you get 20 dollars.

1585
01:01:11.054 --> 01:01:12.588
If you lose, you get nothing.

1586
01:01:12.956 --> 01:01:14.150
(Whispering)

1587
01:01:14.157 --> 01:01:15.790
In 1, 2, 3. 4.

1588
01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:17.590
(Will they win Round 2?)

1589
01:01:17.593 --> 01:01:21.280
(The producer calls for 4.)

1590
01:01:21.864 --> 01:01:22.910
You lose.

1591
01:01:23.199 --> 01:01:24.260
Did we win?

1592
01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:27.130
(Exactly 4 members stood up.)

1593
01:01:27.136 --> 01:01:28.200
We lost.

1594
01:01:28.204 --> 01:01:30.070
- What happened? - Four stood up.

1595
01:01:30.073 --> 01:01:31.250
Kwang Soo.

1596
01:01:31.474 --> 01:01:33.790
Kwang Soo, I told you to stay seated.

1597
01:01:34.177 --> 01:01:35.960
I told you to stay seated.

1598
01:01:36.112 --> 01:01:38.180
- How could you? - I told him.

1599
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:40.110
- What? - I told him to stay seated.

1600
01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:41.210
You stood up too.

1601
01:01:41.217 --> 01:01:43.260
If you stood up last time, you should've stay seated this time.

1602
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.880
Didn't you know?

1603
01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:47.550
- Can we try one more time? - There was a mistake.

1604
01:01:47.557 --> 01:01:49.050
There was a mistake.

1605
01:01:49.058 --> 01:01:50.690
- Can you be louder? - We couldn't hear you.

1606
01:01:50.693 --> 01:01:52.590
- I couldn't hear either. - Your voice is too low.

1607
01:01:52.595 --> 01:01:53.690
I was loud enough.

1608
01:01:53.696 --> 01:01:55.730
- "1, 2, 3." - You should be louder.

1609
01:01:55.732 --> 01:01:57.330
- You should be clear. - I couldn't hear you.

1610
01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:59.350
- What did you hear then? - Either way,

1611
01:01:59.369 --> 01:02:01.180
did we take the challenge?

1612
01:02:01.604 --> 01:02:03.300
Everyone didn't realize that...

1613
01:02:03.306 --> 01:02:04.870
we had lost.

1614
01:02:04.874 --> 01:02:06.240
- I didn't realize it. - I had no idea.

1615
01:02:06.242 --> 01:02:08.310
- We didn't know. - We really didn't know.

1616
01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:10.810
- We were confused. - We didn't hear you.

1617
01:02:10.813 --> 01:02:13.280
I'll be more accurate. You must say "challenge".

1618
01:02:13.282 --> 01:02:15.050
- In 1, 2... - Let's say "challenge".

1619
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:16.280
- Challenge. - Challenge.

1620
01:02:16.285 --> 01:02:17.850
Everyone should stand up.

1621
01:02:17.854 --> 01:02:21.200
(Jong Kook directs everyone because he's desperate to win.)

1622
01:02:23.493 --> 01:02:26.206
If you succeed, you win 20 dollars.

1623
01:02:28.164 --> 01:02:30.466
(If they succeed, they win 20 dollars.)

1624
01:02:30.466 --> 01:02:32.201
(If they fail, they win nothing, and the mission is over.)

1625
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:34.704
(What will happen in Round 2?)

1626
01:02:34.704 --> 01:02:36.239
1, 2, 3.

1627
01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.342
(If they succeed, they win 20 dollars.)

1628
01:02:39.342 --> 01:02:41.077
(If they fail, they win nothing, and the mission is over.)

1629
01:02:41.944 --> 01:02:43.579
(What will happen in Round 2?)

1630
01:02:43.579 --> 01:02:45.114
1, 2, 3. 3.

1631
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.253
(They win Round 2.)

1632
01:02:50.653 --> 01:02:51.687
Three.

1633
01:02:51.888 --> 01:02:54.223
(They're happy to succeed.)

1634
01:02:54.824 --> 01:02:56.659
(They congratulate each other.)

1635
01:02:56.659 --> 01:02:58.361
- We did it. - Awesome.

1636
01:02:58.361 --> 01:03:00.229
- We did it. - Great.

1637
01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:02.365
Will you stop at 20 dollars or continue?

1638
01:03:02.365 --> 01:03:04.534
- Let's go. - Yes.

1639
01:03:04.534 --> 01:03:06.536
- Let's take on the challenge. - Round 3.

1640
01:03:06.669 --> 01:03:08.905
- Challenge. - Challenge.

1641
01:03:08.905 --> 01:03:11.174
- Challenge. - It's nice and simple.

1642
01:03:11.174 --> 01:03:13.609
- We work well as a team. - Here we go.

1643
01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:15.311
(Jong Kook gives an order.)

1644
01:03:15.311 --> 01:03:18.381
- 1, 2, 3. - You should stand up.

1645
01:03:18.381 --> 01:03:19.482
(Haha, stand up.)

1646
01:03:19.482 --> 01:03:20.550
Five.

1647
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:21.984
(Do I stand up?)

1648
01:03:22.485 --> 01:03:25.054
(Haha listened to Jong Kook and stood up. What'd be the result?)

1649
01:03:25.054 --> 01:03:27.390
(Three members stand up.)

1650
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.592
(They win Round 3.)

1651
01:03:29.592 --> 01:03:31.360
- Okay. - Great.

1652
01:03:31.694 --> 01:03:32.795
Okay.

1653
01:03:32.962 --> 01:03:34.363
- Jong Kook... - That's right.

1654
01:03:34.363 --> 01:03:36.032
was leading us.

1655
01:03:36.032 --> 01:03:38.601
- Jong Kook kept leading us. - That was great.

1656
01:03:38.601 --> 01:03:40.503
We want to do whatever we want.

1657
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:42.205
We can't because of Jong Kook.

1658
01:03:42.572 --> 01:03:44.941
Jong Kook told us what to do.

1659
01:03:44.941 --> 01:03:46.742
- No, what should we do? - After Jong Kook...

1660
01:03:46.742 --> 01:03:48.678
- took the lead, - Go.

1661
01:03:48.678 --> 01:03:50.146
we continue to succeed.

1662
01:03:50.379 --> 01:03:51.981
- We feel... - It's annoying but great.

1663
01:03:51.981 --> 01:03:53.783
This game is Jong Kook...

1664
01:03:53.783 --> 01:03:55.051
versus the producer.

1665
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:57.587
His orders make us uncomfortable,

1666
01:03:57.753 --> 01:03:59.388
- but the results are good. - That's right.

1667
01:03:59.388 --> 01:04:02.458
The mission should be called Jong Kook's Zero Game.

1668
01:04:03.092 --> 01:04:05.294
- He can point at us. - We still win.

1669
01:04:05.294 --> 01:04:06.762
- It's great. - It is indeed.

1670
01:04:06.762 --> 01:04:08.297
Will you continue?

1671
01:04:08.297 --> 01:04:10.099
- Of course. - Of course we will.

1672
01:04:10.099 --> 01:04:11.300
- Wait. - What should we do?

1673
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.535
We have eight members.

1674
01:04:13.136 --> 01:04:16.172
(Everyone listens to Jong Kook's plan.)

1675
01:04:16.172 --> 01:04:17.340
1, 2, 3.

1676
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.775
(Will they also win Round 4?)

1677
01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:21.611
Four.

1678
01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:22.945
(Five members stand.)

1679
01:04:22.945 --> 01:04:24.614
(They win Round 4.)

1680
01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:27.049
Wait, we weren't ready yet.

1681
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:28.651
(What happened?)

1682
01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:30.386
- It's fine. - It's okay.

1683
01:04:30.386 --> 01:04:31.921
This won't count.

1684
01:04:32.054 --> 01:04:33.289
Four.

1685
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:35.091
(He thought they had lost.)

1686
01:04:35.091 --> 01:04:37.226
(But he quickly changes his mind.)

1687
01:04:37.593 --> 01:04:39.362
- Never mind. - This won't count.

1688
01:04:39.362 --> 01:04:41.197
- This won't count. - What did you say?

1689
01:04:41.197 --> 01:04:42.198
That's your opinion.

1690
01:04:42.198 --> 01:04:43.799
Why did you say that?

1691
01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:46.502
Haha said that you weren't ready yet.

1692
01:04:46.502 --> 01:04:47.703
No way.

1693
01:04:47.904 --> 01:04:49.739
- Why didn't you keep quiet? - I'm sorry.

1694
01:04:49.739 --> 01:04:51.841
Considering what happened, let's play one more round.

1695
01:04:51.841 --> 01:04:53.342
- Okay. - Come back.

1696
01:04:53.576 --> 01:04:55.144
This is our last chance.

1697
01:04:55.211 --> 01:04:56.879
- Stay quiet. - I know.

1698
01:04:56.879 --> 01:04:58.748
You're not Jong Kook.

1699
01:04:58.981 --> 01:05:00.650
- I'm sorry. - Let's play again.

1700
01:05:00.883 --> 01:05:02.552
If he had stayed quiet...

1701
01:05:02.552 --> 01:05:04.654
- Let's go with our instinct. - Let's do that.

1702
01:05:04.654 --> 01:05:06.956
- Seriously. - Let's go with our instinct.

1703
01:05:07.924 --> 01:05:08.925
(They play Round 4 again.)

1704
01:05:08.925 --> 01:05:09.959
Here we go.

1705
01:05:09.959 --> 01:05:11.694
(They redo Round 4 without Jong Kook's advice.)

1706
01:05:11.694 --> 01:05:13.196
- Let's go. - We can't plan this.

1707
01:05:13.196 --> 01:05:16.032
(Will they succeed without Jong Kook's strategy?)

1708
01:05:16.032 --> 01:05:17.233
In 1, 2, 3.

1709
01:05:17.233 --> 01:05:18.301
Six.

1710
01:05:18.301 --> 01:05:21.337
(The producer said 6. How many members stood up?)

1711
01:05:22.471 --> 01:05:23.573
What?

1712
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.842
(They fail since it's 6 including Jong Kook.)

1713
01:05:26.842 --> 01:05:28.611
You stood up.

1714
01:05:28.611 --> 01:05:29.712
You fail.

1715
01:05:29.712 --> 01:05:32.481
(He looks around.)

1716
01:05:32.481 --> 01:05:35.484
(Jong Kook gets up. They fail round 4.)

1717
01:05:35.484 --> 01:05:37.720
What are you doing?

1718
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.021
- What was that? - I didn't stand up.

1719
01:05:39.021 --> 01:05:41.090
- This is standing up. - I didn't.

1720
01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:42.291
- Did we fail? - I didn't stand up.

1721
01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:44.193
He was so cheap. He half-stood up.

1722
01:05:44.193 --> 01:05:46.529
- What was that? - That was a cheap move!

1723
01:05:46.529 --> 01:05:47.863
- I didn't stand up. - Jong Kook.

1724
01:05:47.863 --> 01:05:49.232
I didn't stand.

1725
01:05:49.232 --> 01:05:50.733
I'm serious. When you called out the number,

1726
01:05:50.733 --> 01:05:52.401
I did this much.

1727
01:05:52.401 --> 01:05:54.237
(It's time to replay the video.)

1728
01:05:54.237 --> 01:05:56.005
(His butt is obviously lifted.)

1729
01:05:56.005 --> 01:05:57.974
(His head even stuck out.)

1730
01:05:59.308 --> 01:06:01.944
(He doesn't know where to look.)

1731
01:06:01.944 --> 01:06:04.180
- Darn it, Jong Kook. - You definitely stood up.

1732
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.214
I approve.

1733
01:06:05.214 --> 01:06:06.382
You stood up.

1734
01:06:06.382 --> 01:06:07.650
- What was that? - I didn't.

1735
01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:08.818
Can you give us one more...

1736
01:06:08.884 --> 01:06:10.052
- Yes, let's go again. - I didn't stand up.

1737
01:06:10.052 --> 01:06:12.255
- Let's hand in ours. - This is tricky.

1738
01:06:12.255 --> 01:06:15.124
Let's do this then. If you give me one item,

1739
01:06:15.324 --> 01:06:16.792
I'll give you one last chance.

1740
01:06:16.792 --> 01:06:19.462
- Give you what? - Give me an item.

1741
01:06:19.462 --> 01:06:21.130
- The baseball is the lightest. - Hey.

1742
01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:22.365
(He doesn't hesitate.)

1743
01:06:22.365 --> 01:06:24.667
- It's the lightest. - No. Why would you do that?

1744
01:06:25.134 --> 01:06:26.869
- Hey. - What?

1745
01:06:26.869 --> 01:06:28.170
- What's wrong? - This is...

1746
01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:29.305
kind of hard.

1747
01:06:29.305 --> 01:06:31.307
Why did Jong Kook stand up halfway?

1748
01:06:31.307 --> 01:06:34.343
Everyone, I think this is strange.

1749
01:06:34.343 --> 01:06:36.912
Jong Kook made a huge mistake,

1750
01:06:36.912 --> 01:06:39.382
- and none of us... - You need to give up yours.

1751
01:06:39.382 --> 01:06:40.483
No, I...

1752
01:06:40.483 --> 01:06:41.651
Doesn't he have to give up his CD?

1753
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:43.653
I never stood up.

1754
01:06:43.653 --> 01:06:44.854
Hey, there.

1755
01:06:45.154 --> 01:06:48.424
(Jae Seok couldn't tell him to give up his CD, so he decided to steal.)

1756
01:06:48.424 --> 01:06:49.625
What...

1757
01:06:50.092 --> 01:06:51.127
Hey.

1758
01:06:51.294 --> 01:06:52.461
(Shall I do it too?)

1759
01:06:52.461 --> 01:06:54.330
Hey, don't do that.

1760
01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:56.065
- Stay still. - Hey.

1761
01:06:56.966 --> 01:06:58.901
(She targets Jae Seok's denim jacket.)

1762
01:06:58.901 --> 01:07:01.070
- So Min. - Everybody,

1763
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:03.739
the staff's plan is to shake us up.

1764
01:07:03.739 --> 01:07:05.675
Let's not be stirred.

1765
01:07:05.675 --> 01:07:07.343
We are one.

1766
01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:09.278
(We are one.)

1767
01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:12.882
(We are one forever.)

1768
01:07:12.882 --> 01:07:13.983
(He's scary.)

1769
01:07:13.983 --> 01:07:16.018
Let's do rock-paper-scissors and choose one person.

1770
01:07:16.052 --> 01:07:19.455
- Which one is the cheapest? - That doesn't matter.

1771
01:07:19.488 --> 01:07:20.956
The cheapest item...

1772
01:07:23.059 --> 01:07:24.794
Choose the cheapest item.

1773
01:07:24.794 --> 01:07:26.929
(We'll give up the baseball.)

1774
01:07:26.929 --> 01:07:28.297
It's done.

1775
01:07:28.297 --> 01:07:29.532
Hey, you.

1776
01:07:29.532 --> 01:07:30.800
(It's Seok Jin's home run.)

1777
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.935
When did you take it out?

1778
01:07:33.135 --> 01:07:35.004
It's perfect for throwing.

1779
01:07:35.004 --> 01:07:36.472
I'll give you another chance.

1780
01:07:36.772 --> 01:07:38.174
- Everybody. - That's over.

1781
01:07:38.174 --> 01:07:40.476
That wasn't up to me.

1782
01:07:42.511 --> 01:07:43.713
You know...

1783
01:07:43.713 --> 01:07:45.781
- You know what's funny? - What?

1784
01:07:45.781 --> 01:07:46.982
I stood up, right?

1785
01:07:46.982 --> 01:07:49.185
- I stopped halfway. - Right.

1786
01:07:49.218 --> 01:07:50.820
If I stood up fully,

1787
01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.154
- then what is it? - It's a fail.

1788
01:07:52.154 --> 01:07:53.222
- It's a fail, right? - Yes.

1789
01:07:53.222 --> 01:07:54.824
Is it my fault or somebody else's?

1790
01:07:54.824 --> 01:07:56.692
- It's your fault. - It's your fault.

1791
01:07:56.692 --> 01:07:59.195
If all six people got up, why would it be my fault?

1792
01:07:59.195 --> 01:08:00.730
It's because...

1793
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:02.832
if you sat down, it would have been five people.

1794
01:08:02.832 --> 01:08:04.467
- If I stood up? - That would make it six.

1795
01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:06.001
If I stood up, whose fault would it have been?

1796
01:08:06.001 --> 01:08:08.571
- Your fault. - Why is it my fault?

1797
01:08:08.571 --> 01:08:10.539
(He's trying to be logical.)

1798
01:08:10.539 --> 01:08:11.841
- You said it. - Listen to this.

1799
01:08:11.841 --> 01:08:13.342
If you sat down, how many would it have been?

1800
01:08:13.442 --> 01:08:15.177
If I sat down, it would have been five.

1801
01:08:15.177 --> 01:08:17.480
- If you stood up? - It's six with me standing up.

1802
01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.481
Whose fault is it then?

1803
01:08:18.481 --> 01:08:22.485
- All six stood up anyhow. - Think about it again.

1804
01:08:22.485 --> 01:08:23.886
(Jae Seok cuts him off.)

1805
01:08:23.886 --> 01:08:25.321
How many is it without you?

1806
01:08:25.321 --> 01:08:26.989
He has to learn by rote.

1807
01:08:26.989 --> 01:08:28.591
He doesn't get it.

1808
01:08:28.591 --> 01:08:29.825
How many people is it if you stand up?

1809
01:08:29.825 --> 01:08:31.927
- I'm just curious. - Ask again.

1810
01:08:31.927 --> 01:08:34.563
If you sat down, how many would it have been?

1811
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:36.832
- If you sat down, it's 5 people. - It's 5.

1812
01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:38.434
- If you stood up, it's 6. - It's 6.

1813
01:08:38.434 --> 01:08:39.602
Whose fault is it?

1814
01:08:40.102 --> 01:08:41.303
It's my fault.

1815
01:08:41.303 --> 01:08:43.072
(Is it my fault?)

1816
01:08:43.072 --> 01:08:44.039
(I'll forgive you, Seok Jin. Don't do it again.)

1817
01:08:44.039 --> 01:08:45.341
- "It's my fault." - I apologize.

1818
01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:47.543
I understand.

1819
01:08:47.543 --> 01:08:49.678
It's not my fault.

1820
01:08:49.678 --> 01:08:51.113
It's everybody's fault.

1821
01:08:52.181 --> 01:08:54.550
- I see. - Good. That's right.

1822
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:57.153
Let's go again. We'll start from 10 dollars again.

1823
01:08:57.219 --> 01:08:58.854
- We're going from 10 dollars? - Yes.

1824
01:08:58.854 --> 01:08:59.922
From 10 dollars?

1825
01:08:59.922 --> 01:09:01.924
- Follow your gut feeling. - Sure, let's do that.

1826
01:09:01.924 --> 01:09:03.092
- Follow your gut feeling. - Okay.

1827
01:09:03.092 --> 01:09:04.527
It's Round One with 10 dollars.

1828
01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.829
In 1, 2, 3. 2.

1829
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:08.330
(They finally got a chance to retry.)

1830
01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:10.800
(They succeed with one off.)

1831
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.604
(They win up to round 3.)

1832
01:09:15.871 --> 01:09:16.872
Bravo.

1833
01:09:16.872 --> 01:09:19.542
- Ji Hyo. - That was good timing.

1834
01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:21.510
- Is it 40 dollars now? - Yes, let's go.

1835
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:23.279
- Go, go. - Let's go for two more rounds.

1836
01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.880
In 1, 2, 3. 4.

1837
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.081
(If they succeed this time, they go to round 5.)

1838
01:09:27.049 --> 01:09:28.751
In 1, 2, 3. 4.

1839
01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:31.420
(It's 4.)

1840
01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.588
You fail.

1841
01:09:33.222 --> 01:09:35.224
Who didn't stand up?

1842
01:09:35.224 --> 01:09:36.926
- Who didn't stand up? - Who didn't stand up?

1843
01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:38.461
If you wanted to sit down, you should do that at home.

1844
01:09:38.461 --> 01:09:39.962
Why would you sit here?

1845
01:09:39.962 --> 01:09:41.263
- Why didn't you stand up? - Why didn't you?

1846
01:09:41.263 --> 01:09:42.832
- Why did you stand up? - Why didn't you?

1847
01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:44.133
Why did you stand up?

1848
01:09:44.133 --> 01:09:45.501
- Why did you stand up? - Look.

1849
01:09:45.501 --> 01:09:46.869
- Why didn't you stand up? - Hey, why did you get up?

1850
01:09:46.869 --> 01:09:47.870
- Why did you stand up? - Were you lazy?

1851
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.305
- Is that why you didn't stand up? - No way.

1852
01:09:49.305 --> 01:09:50.539
Is that why you didn't stand up?

1853
01:09:51.173 --> 01:09:53.609
Do you want to leave with no money or give up another item?

1854
01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:56.145
Let's go with Haha's. He doesn't have that many memories.

1855
01:09:56.145 --> 01:09:57.480
Why don't I have memories?

1856
01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.481
It's fake.

1857
01:09:58.481 --> 01:09:59.782
Are you going to give up all of it?

1858
01:09:59.782 --> 01:10:01.951
They're all 10 cents each.

1859
01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:03.352
- What's the standard? - Hand it in.

1860
01:10:03.452 --> 01:10:04.920
- What standard? - Fine.

1861
01:10:05.421 --> 01:10:06.555
- Okay. - Let's go.

1862
01:10:06.555 --> 01:10:07.756
This is your last chance.

1863
01:10:08.224 --> 01:10:10.025
Let's go. Everybody,

1864
01:10:10.092 --> 01:10:11.894
that was round 3. Will you do round 4?

1865
01:10:11.894 --> 01:10:13.462
- Yes. - Let's go.

1866
01:10:13.462 --> 01:10:16.298
(They lost at round 4 twice.)

1867
01:10:16.298 --> 01:10:17.700
(How will it be this time?)

1868
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.102
In 1, 2, 3. 0

1869
01:10:20.369 --> 01:10:21.670
- Okay. - All right.

1870
01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:23.005
We did it.

1871
01:10:23.005 --> 01:10:24.874
(They finally pass round 4.)

1872
01:10:25.608 --> 01:10:26.842
We did it.

1873
01:10:26.842 --> 01:10:27.843
(They only have round 5 left with 50 dollars.)

1874
01:10:27.843 --> 01:10:30.479
- This is great. - I knew he was going to do that.

1875
01:10:30.479 --> 01:10:32.915
- I think he's going to call six. - Is this the last one?

1876
01:10:33.516 --> 01:10:35.851
- Let's all stand up for this one. - How's this?

1877
01:10:35.851 --> 01:10:37.920
- What if we all stand up? - Let's make it look cool.

1878
01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.055
If you stop now, you can get 40 dollars.

1879
01:10:40.055 --> 01:10:41.590
- No, no. - We have to keep going.

1880
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:43.225
(We have to go for 50 dollars.)

1881
01:10:43.225 --> 01:10:44.827
Wouldn't he do something in the middle?

1882
01:10:45.561 --> 01:10:47.062
40 dollars is okay too.

1883
01:10:47.129 --> 01:10:48.330
Let's all stand up.

1884
01:10:48.464 --> 01:10:51.133
We were trying to reach the top all this time.

1885
01:10:51.133 --> 01:10:53.035
Right? How many times did we do this?

1886
01:10:53.068 --> 01:10:54.770
- Hey. - We could be satisfied here.

1887
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:57.106
- Just do it. - What do you think?

1888
01:10:57.106 --> 01:10:58.340
- Then... - Oh, gosh.

1889
01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.942
- We have to know when to stop. - Just go for it.

1890
01:10:59.942 --> 01:11:02.545
- I like 40 dollars. - We have to know when to stop.

1891
01:11:02.545 --> 01:11:05.014
- Go. - We only have one round left.

1892
01:11:05.014 --> 01:11:06.482
Should we just go then?

1893
01:11:06.482 --> 01:11:08.484
We can do it. Trust ourselves.

1894
01:11:08.551 --> 01:11:11.320
- Let's go with our gut feeling. - Again?

1895
01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.122
We always mess up when we go with our gut feeling.

1896
01:11:13.122 --> 01:11:14.390
(Should we do that again?)

1897
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:15.791
I don't think...

1898
01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:17.226
- we have good instincts. - Should we do that again?

1899
01:11:17.293 --> 01:11:18.494
I...

1900
01:11:18.494 --> 01:11:19.728
I have a good feeling.

1901
01:11:19.728 --> 01:11:21.096
- Let's go. - Okay?

1902
01:11:21.096 --> 01:11:22.431
- All right. - Okay.

1903
01:11:22.431 --> 01:11:23.632
Should we go with our gut feeling?

1904
01:11:23.632 --> 01:11:25.000
- Go, go. - Follow our gut feeling.

1905
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.535
- Okay. - I got this.

1906
01:11:27.002 --> 01:11:28.704
- Let's go. - I'm going to get up.

1907
01:11:29.004 --> 01:11:31.006
- I'm going to sit down. - I'm going to stand up.

1908
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.041
One...

1909
01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:33.409
(This is round 5. If they win, they get 50 dollars.)

1910
01:11:33.409 --> 01:11:36.245
(If they lose, they finish with nothing.)

1911
01:11:36.579 --> 01:11:39.281
(Will they pass round 5 with their gut feelings?)

1912
01:11:39.281 --> 01:11:41.917
In 1, 2, 3. 5.

1913
01:11:42.885 --> 01:11:47.523
(The producer called out 5. How many will stand up?)

1914
01:11:51.727 --> 01:11:52.928
Hold on.

1915
01:11:53.162 --> 01:11:55.798
(It looks like three people got up.)

1916
01:11:55.798 --> 01:11:59.301
(Kwang Soo looked around and got up late.)

1917
01:11:59.301 --> 01:12:00.603
Hold on.

1918
01:12:00.703 --> 01:12:02.171
You can't get up slowly.

1919
01:12:02.171 --> 01:12:03.606
Earlier, you said...

1920
01:12:03.606 --> 01:12:05.007
What are you doing?

1921
01:12:05.007 --> 01:12:06.642
You said I stood up.

1922
01:12:06.642 --> 01:12:07.910
He's angry.

1923
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:09.078
Let's make this look like we won.

1924
01:12:10.079 --> 01:12:11.880
(We did it.)

1925
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.049
I actually saw Kwang Soo.

1926
01:12:14.049 --> 01:12:15.084
(Chuckling)

1927
01:12:15.084 --> 01:12:16.619
(He looked around and got up.)

1928
01:12:16.619 --> 01:12:18.654
- You looked left and right. - This was heavy.

1929
01:12:20.055 --> 01:12:24.827
(He pretended like he was stumbling and counted.)

1930
01:12:25.661 --> 01:12:28.130
(He acted like he stood up properly.)

1931
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:29.865
- Didn't you look left and right? - This was heavy.

1932
01:12:30.032 --> 01:12:31.900
- It was heavy. - You didn't have to get up.

1933
01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.503
- Why did you stand up? - We won.

1934
01:12:34.503 --> 01:12:35.838
This is a pass.

1935
01:12:35.938 --> 01:12:37.172
I accept that.

1936
01:12:37.172 --> 01:12:38.674
You win 50 dollars.

1937
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:40.509
I'll give you the money.

1938
01:12:40.509 --> 01:12:42.678
The people who left their items at the pawnshop are...

1939
01:12:42.678 --> 01:12:44.613
Seok Jin and Haha.

1940
01:12:45.147 --> 01:12:47.750
Today's real race is Unforgettable Autumn Trip.

1941
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.885
Here is the hidden rule...

1942
01:12:49.885 --> 01:12:51.720
for I'll Write a Letter in Autumn.

1943
01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.122
"I'll Write a Letter in Autumn"?

1944
01:12:53.122 --> 01:12:55.257
(I'll Write a Letter in Autumn?)

1945
01:12:55.257 --> 01:12:57.760
If you don't have your item at the end of the race,

1946
01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.695
you'll experience water bomb.

1947
01:12:59.962 --> 01:13:02.631
Those without their items can pick one person...

1948
01:13:02.631 --> 01:13:05.434
who will receive the penalty with them.

1949
01:13:05.768 --> 01:13:06.835
One person?

1950
01:13:07.302 --> 01:13:12.808
(You can pick 1 person who will help you get your item back.)

1951
01:13:12.808 --> 01:13:16.612
(They have to try to avoid the penalty together.)

1952
01:13:16.612 --> 01:13:19.481
Seok Jin and Haha, you can record a video message...

1953
01:13:19.481 --> 01:13:22.851
to invite the person who will join you.

1954
01:13:22.851 --> 01:13:24.420
- Right now? In front of everybody? - Yes.

1955
01:13:25.421 --> 01:13:26.622
We have to stand with them?

1956
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:29.324
I catch a cold...

1957
01:13:29.992 --> 01:13:32.027
when the fall comes,

1958
01:13:32.294 --> 01:13:34.797
so I think I'll get sick if I take the water bomb.

1959
01:13:35.597 --> 01:13:38.100
Please help me today,

1960
01:13:39.001 --> 01:13:40.502
Jong Kook.

1961
01:13:42.137 --> 01:13:43.272
He pointed you out.

1962
01:13:43.272 --> 01:13:46.308
Please join me today.

1963
01:13:46.308 --> 01:13:47.710
- Jong Kook. - Okay.

1964
01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:49.278
(If he doesn't get his baseball back Jong Kook will receive the penalty.)

1965
01:13:49.812 --> 01:13:51.980
This is great. Okay.

1966
01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:53.248
I picked you.

1967
01:13:53.248 --> 01:13:54.950
When we were doing the auction,

1968
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:57.352
I was so disappointed...

1969
01:13:57.352 --> 01:13:59.054
you marked my item with that price.

1970
01:13:59.054 --> 01:14:00.656
It's very precious to me,

1971
01:14:00.889 --> 01:14:03.025
so I really want to get it back...

1972
01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:05.527
with you, Jong Kook.

1973
01:14:06.261 --> 01:14:08.831
(Jong Kook is trustworthy.)

1974
01:14:08.964 --> 01:14:10.933
I picked him first.

1975
01:14:10.933 --> 01:14:12.468
I think you can get it back for me.

1976
01:14:12.468 --> 01:14:14.903
- Okay. - I picked him first.

1977
01:14:15.571 --> 01:14:16.772
Lost and found!

1978
01:14:17.272 --> 01:14:19.675
- I'll return your lost items. - Anyhow,

1979
01:14:19.808 --> 01:14:22.344
if we can't get it back, you'll get the penalty too.

1980
01:14:23.779 --> 01:14:26.982
The first autumn-themed mission is...

1981
01:14:27.382 --> 01:14:29.785
- Shortest Object Trip. - "Shortest object"?

1982
01:14:29.918 --> 01:14:33.655
Please purchase the shortest object.

1983
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:36.692
The member with the longest object...

1984
01:14:36.692 --> 01:14:39.361
has to give up their item as the loser.

1985
01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:41.430
(Whose item will go to the pawnshop?)

1986
01:14:41.563 --> 01:14:43.165
We'll measure accurately.

1987
01:14:43.332 --> 01:14:44.399
What's this?

1988
01:14:44.399 --> 01:14:46.001
- You can't do this. - I paid 10 cents for this.

1989
01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:47.302
(Kwang Soo got a piece of noodle, and he loses.)

1990
01:14:47.302 --> 01:14:49.338
I paid for it. What's this?

1991
01:14:49.772 --> 01:14:51.607
- Why are you doing this? - He's here.

1992
01:14:51.607 --> 01:14:53.175
- No... - He's here already.

1993
01:14:53.342 --> 01:14:55.544
Kwang Soo, record your message.

1994
01:14:55.544 --> 01:14:56.845
Please find my Dan Bi.

1995
01:14:56.845 --> 01:14:58.280
(Please find my Dan Bi.)

1996
01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.548
- Jae Seok. - All right.

1997
01:15:00.082 --> 01:15:02.484
(Jae Seok will be Kwang Soo's partner in getting the punishment.)

1998
01:15:03.185 --> 01:15:06.388
Sing a phrase of a song that starts with "go".

1999
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:11.760
(Jae Seok loses with a made-up song.)

2000
01:15:12.294 --> 01:15:15.264
(The day has come. I'm sorry.)

2001
01:15:15.264 --> 01:15:17.466
(You need to receive another penalty, Kwang Soo.)

2002
01:15:17.466 --> 01:15:21.170
(If they don't get both items back, they get double water bomb.)

2003
01:15:21.804 --> 01:15:23.372
(Jong Kook lost too.)

2004
01:15:23.372 --> 01:15:26.208
(He picks Jae Seok.)

2005
01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:30.813
(Ji Hyo picks Seok Jin.)

2006
01:15:30.813 --> 01:15:31.980
(People who have been chosen)

2007
01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:33.715
This is a perfect autumn weather.

2008
01:15:34.249 --> 01:15:36.351
This is the perfect weather for a picnic.

2009
01:15:36.752 --> 01:15:39.421
The maple leaves are at their peak.

2010
01:15:39.421 --> 01:15:40.455
(The maple leaves are at their peak.)

2011
01:15:40.522 --> 01:15:42.791
They're not at their peak.

2012
01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:44.059
It's still a long way.

2013
01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:45.794
They're at their peak in Gangwon Province.

2014
01:15:45.794 --> 01:15:47.095
This is Seoul.

2015
01:15:47.162 --> 01:15:49.464
That's Gangwon Province, but we're in Seoul.

2016
01:15:49.464 --> 01:15:52.301
- This is Songdo. - That's different from Gangwon.

2017
01:15:52.301 --> 01:15:53.802
He's making me mad.

2018
01:15:55.671 --> 01:15:59.875
Isn't that G...

2019
01:16:01.176 --> 01:16:03.178
(Which "G" are we talking about?)

2020
01:16:03.178 --> 01:16:05.214
I know why he's not taking that off.

2021
01:16:05.214 --> 01:16:06.315
(20 minutes ago in the bus)

2022
01:16:06.315 --> 01:16:08.984
G-Dragon does this.

2023
01:16:09.384 --> 01:16:11.920
He uses this bag all the time now.

2024
01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.489
This is convenient.

2025
01:16:14.489 --> 01:16:15.991
(He tries to copy G-Dragon. Does Haha approve?)

2026
01:16:15.991 --> 01:16:18.994
Isn't that G...

2027
01:16:19.461 --> 01:16:21.129
- It's Kim Byung Ji. - Kim Byung Ji?

2028
01:16:21.129 --> 01:16:22.564
(It's Kim Byung "G".)

2029
01:16:24.032 --> 01:16:25.167
I'm not him.

2030
01:16:25.267 --> 01:16:26.535
What did you say?

2031
01:16:26.869 --> 01:16:28.403
Weren't you going to say G-Dragon?

2032
01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:31.940
Your hairstyle looks like Dean...

2033
01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.242
Dean?

2034
01:16:33.242 --> 01:16:36.511
(Is it the trendy star Dean's hairstyle?)

2035
01:16:36.511 --> 01:16:38.180
It's Dean...

2036
01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:40.716
It's Jee Seok Dean.

2037
01:16:43.385 --> 01:16:45.153
(Spitting)

2038
01:16:47.789 --> 01:16:49.124
What's wrong with me?

2039
01:16:50.392 --> 01:16:52.294
Why is your hair so long in the back?

2040
01:16:52.394 --> 01:16:54.630
It's Lee Duk Jin's hairstyle.

2041
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:57.065
It's getting shorter.

2042
01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:59.534
I think it'll be okay once it grows a bit more.

2043
01:16:59.635 --> 01:17:03.372
You'll become like So Min.

2044
01:17:04.873 --> 01:17:07.242
Her is hair short in the front and long in the back.

2045
01:17:07.242 --> 01:17:09.578
(Their style is short in the front and long in the back.)

2046
01:17:09.978 --> 01:17:11.780
- Are you copying her? - Why are you copying me?

2047
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.048
I'm not copying you.

2048
01:17:13.382 --> 01:17:15.450
- Why are you copying her? - I'm not copying her.

2049
01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:16.585
Do you like me?

2050
01:17:16.652 --> 01:17:18.086
(Do you like me?)

2051
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.523
(Do you like me so much that you copied my hairstyle?)

2052
01:17:22.424 --> 01:17:25.594
You two are talking nonsense again.

2053
01:17:25.861 --> 01:17:27.963
Stop it. Oh, gosh.

2054
01:17:27.963 --> 01:17:30.165
We're not interested at all.

2055
01:17:30.332 --> 01:17:32.534
We don't care if you two date.

2056
01:17:32.634 --> 01:17:34.970
It's stressful whenever I have to get a haircut.

2057
01:17:36.438 --> 01:17:38.206
A homeless person?

2058
01:17:38.807 --> 01:17:40.309
It does look like it.

2059
01:17:40.309 --> 01:17:42.010
Wait.

2060
01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:43.912
(The bug is stuck to Jae Seok.)

2061
01:17:43.912 --> 01:17:45.113
It's gone.

2062
01:17:45.414 --> 01:17:46.615
(Groaning)

2063
01:17:47.883 --> 01:17:53.588
(He kicks Jae Seok's middle part instead of the bug.)

2064
01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:56.024
My bad.

2065
01:17:56.224 --> 01:17:57.659
Wait. I'm serious.

2066
01:17:57.659 --> 01:17:59.995
I didn't mean to. I really didn't mean it.

2067
01:18:00.362 --> 01:18:01.930
(I'm sorry. That wasn't intentional.)

2068
01:18:02.064 --> 01:18:04.066
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

2069
01:18:04.299 --> 01:18:06.001
It's alive.

2070
01:18:06.068 --> 01:18:09.237
That's alive, but my...

2071
01:18:10.672 --> 01:18:12.374
- Hey. - That was a bug.

2072
01:18:12.374 --> 01:18:13.475
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

2073
01:18:13.475 --> 01:18:14.710
You should have stepped on it.

2074
01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:16.511
Where did he kick you?

2075
01:18:16.511 --> 01:18:17.980
- I am okay. - You are?

2076
01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:19.881
I'm a very healthy person.

2077
01:18:20.349 --> 01:18:22.985
Why is your nose runny?

2078
01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:25.354
He's lying.

2079
01:18:25.354 --> 01:18:26.655
His nose is runny.

2080
01:18:27.489 --> 01:18:31.994
(Regardless of his health, the picnic starts.)

2081
01:18:33.929 --> 01:18:37.332
This is Unforgettable Autumn Trip.

2082
01:18:37.332 --> 01:18:39.801
(Autumn Colors Trip)

2083
01:18:39.801 --> 01:18:41.670
You need to take pictures in autumn.

2084
01:18:42.304 --> 01:18:45.440
You have to recruit people and take a group photo...

2085
01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.910
in a designated spot with everybody's faces showing.

2086
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:50.779
- With people? - People?

2087
01:18:50.779 --> 01:18:51.847
Where are they?

2088
01:18:52.581 --> 01:18:54.750
You get three chances.

2089
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:56.718
You have to take a photo in a designated spot,

2090
01:18:56.852 --> 01:19:00.522
and everybody's faces have to be shown to pass the mission.

2091
01:19:01.556 --> 01:19:03.792
If you fail, each of you has to pay five dollars each...

2092
01:19:04.092 --> 01:19:07.829
to a total of 40 dollars for your trip.

2093
01:19:08.597 --> 01:19:12.134
(This game will cost a lot. Will they succeed the mission?)

2094
01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.704
Excuse me. Can we take a picture together?

2095
01:19:15.871 --> 01:19:17.205
Hello.

2096
01:19:17.939 --> 01:19:20.542
Can you take a picture with us?

2097
01:19:20.542 --> 01:19:21.643
No.

2098
01:19:21.643 --> 01:19:22.744
- Please. - So Min.

2099
01:19:22.744 --> 01:19:24.379
So Min, you can't just stop him.

2100
01:19:24.713 --> 01:19:26.782
- Please take care. We're sorry. - Take care.

2101
01:19:27.315 --> 01:19:28.884
Can we take a group photo?

2102
01:19:28.884 --> 01:19:30.952
- There are four here. - All of them?

2103
01:19:30.952 --> 01:19:33.155
- We have 4. - There are 4 people.

2104
01:19:33.221 --> 01:19:34.423
Can we take a picture?

2105
01:19:34.589 --> 01:19:35.991
You're beautiful.

2106
01:19:35.991 --> 01:19:38.260
- You're beautiful. - It's your hiking outfit.

2107
01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.761
- It's perfect. - You look great.

2108
01:19:39.761 --> 01:19:41.263
- It's great for outdoors. - Would that be okay?

2109
01:19:41.296 --> 01:19:42.664
- Okay. - Okay.

2110
01:19:42.664 --> 01:19:45.000
We have five. Thank you.

2111
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.101
Thank you.

2112
01:19:46.601 --> 01:19:49.704
We'll press the shutter. It'll be taken in 10 seconds.

2113
01:19:49.738 --> 01:19:50.739
- In 10 seconds? - 10 seconds?

2114
01:19:50.739 --> 01:19:53.008
- Kwang Soo, you go first. - You go first.

2115
01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:55.210
- Let's get this in 1 try. - In 1, 2, 3.

2116
01:19:56.912 --> 01:19:58.880
You have to take a photo in the designated spot,

2117
01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.551
and everybody's faces have to be shown to pass the mission.

2118
01:20:02.551 --> 01:20:05.287
(They have to take a photo, and everybody's faces have to be shown.)

2119
01:20:05.353 --> 01:20:07.789
- Let's get this in 1 try. - In 1, 2, 3.

2120
01:20:07.856 --> 01:20:08.924
- Press the shutter. - Press the shutter.

2121
01:20:08.924 --> 01:20:10.325
Hurry.

2122
01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:12.828
(Dashing)

2123
01:20:13.662 --> 01:20:14.963
- Come here. - Here, here.

2124
01:20:14.963 --> 01:20:16.431
We have to go lower.

2125
01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:19.067
(It took 5 seconds to run. They have to get in within 5 seconds.)

2126
01:20:19.067 --> 01:20:20.802
- We have to go lower. - That's good.

2127
01:20:20.802 --> 01:20:22.070
This is perfect.

2128
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:23.538
- So Min. - Come.

2129
01:20:23.538 --> 01:20:26.508
- We have 10 seconds. - Madam, go higher.

2130
01:20:27.209 --> 01:20:28.276
Jump, madam.

2131
01:20:28.543 --> 01:20:29.678
Did it get taken?

2132
01:20:30.045 --> 01:20:31.413
- Did it? - It got taken.

2133
01:20:31.413 --> 01:20:33.081
- Let's take a look. - That took one shot.

2134
01:20:33.081 --> 01:20:34.716
- Thank you. - That took one shot.

2135
01:20:34.716 --> 01:20:36.551
- Thank you. - Let's finish this in one shot.

2136
01:20:36.551 --> 01:20:38.053
- We did it. - We can do it.

2137
01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.654
Let's finish this in one shot.

2138
01:20:39.788 --> 01:20:41.423
- In one shot. - Right away.

2139
01:20:41.556 --> 01:20:42.958
- The photo is ready. - It's out.

2140
01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:51.433
(Did all 13 people get in the photo?)

2141
01:20:53.802 --> 01:20:55.637
Madam.

2142
01:20:55.637 --> 01:20:57.772
- Madam. - She got covered.

2143
01:20:57.973 --> 01:21:00.675
(Two people's face were covered.)

2144
01:21:00.675 --> 01:21:01.743
It's okay.

2145
01:21:02.244 --> 01:21:04.179
Ji Hyo is not there either.

2146
01:21:04.179 --> 01:21:07.249
- It got taken before I got there. - That's right.

2147
01:21:07.249 --> 01:21:09.551
- It got taken before I got there. - You need to hurry back.

2148
01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:11.253
I need to hurry back.

2149
01:21:11.253 --> 01:21:12.554
Look at So Min's face.

2150
01:21:12.687 --> 01:21:14.055
- It's like... - Look at her face.

2151
01:21:14.055 --> 01:21:15.590
she took it with people she doesn't know.

2152
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:17.292
She looks like a robot.

2153
01:21:17.592 --> 01:21:19.294
That's not nice, So Min.

2154
01:21:19.294 --> 01:21:21.129
It's so obvious you don't know these people.

2155
01:21:22.664 --> 01:21:25.133
We now know what to do.

2156
01:21:25.133 --> 01:21:26.935
- Let's cheer up. - Let's go.

2157
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:29.204
- We can do this. - We have two chances left.

2158
01:21:29.304 --> 01:21:30.539
Please count down.

2159
01:21:30.539 --> 01:21:33.141
- In 1, 2, 3. Press the shutter. - Press the shutter.

2160
01:21:33.141 --> 01:21:34.809
- Madam. - 10, 9,

2161
01:21:34.809 --> 01:21:36.811
- 8, 7, - Please come here.

2162
01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:38.180
- 6, 5, - Go on your tiptoes.

2163
01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.415
(They get easily into positions.)

2164
01:21:41.816 --> 01:21:43.418
- You're covering me, Jong Kook. - 4, 3,

2165
01:21:43.418 --> 01:21:44.719
two...

2166
01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.721
(She's less robotic this time.)

2167
01:21:46.721 --> 01:21:47.989
Go on your tiptoes.

2168
01:21:47.989 --> 01:21:49.624
2, 1.

2169
01:21:50.192 --> 01:21:51.159
Okay.

2170
01:21:51.159 --> 01:21:52.561
It got taken.

2171
01:21:52.561 --> 01:21:54.229
- I couldn't see. - Please.

2172
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:56.631
(That was their 2nd try out of 3. Did it work this time?)

2173
01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:57.999
Please. Did it work?

2174
01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.668
We did it.

2175
01:21:59.668 --> 01:22:01.136
- We got it. - We are all in it.

2176
01:22:01.136 --> 01:22:02.437
- It worked. - We did it.

2177
01:22:02.437 --> 01:22:03.638
- Okay. - We did it.

2178
01:22:03.638 --> 01:22:04.773
We got it for sure.

2179
01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.242
- It worked. - We did it.

2180
01:22:07.242 --> 01:22:09.044
- We all got in. - It worked.

2181
01:22:09.044 --> 01:22:10.612
- Okay. - We did it.

2182
01:22:10.612 --> 01:22:12.547
- We got it for sure. - We got it.

2183
01:22:12.547 --> 01:22:14.149
- We did it. - Okay.

2184
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:15.984
(It's a perfect photo with everybody showing.)

2185
01:22:16.418 --> 01:22:19.054
You succeeded in this mission,

2186
01:22:19.054 --> 01:22:20.689
so you don't have to pay anything.

2187
01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:21.756
(They pass without having to pay any fees.)

2188
01:22:22.424 --> 01:22:23.792
This is what a trip should be like.

2189
01:22:24.759 --> 01:22:26.194
It really is a trip.

2190
01:22:26.861 --> 01:22:27.963
It's an autumn trip.

2191
01:22:27.963 --> 01:22:30.332
Thank you to all five of them.

2192
01:22:30.332 --> 01:22:32.200
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2193
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.402
Let's move on to the next location.

2194
01:22:34.402 --> 01:22:36.838
(They go to the final location in great mood.)

2195
01:22:37.572 --> 01:22:38.873
(The final penalty is the water bomb.)

2196
01:22:38.873 --> 01:22:40.375
Oh, gosh.

2197
01:22:40.842 --> 01:22:41.910
What's that in the middle?

2198
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:43.845
There must be a last chance.

2199
01:22:43.845 --> 01:22:45.547
- There's something here. - There is.

2200
01:22:45.547 --> 01:22:46.615
What's that?

2201
01:22:47.949 --> 01:22:49.517
(The items left in the pawnshop...)

2202
01:22:49.517 --> 01:22:52.754
(are dangling from a bridge.)

2203
01:22:53.421 --> 01:22:56.958
(Their memories dangle from a bridge. What is this mission?)

2204
01:22:58.793 --> 01:22:59.928
Dan Bi!

2205
01:23:01.162 --> 01:23:02.197
Dan Bi!

2206
01:23:03.398 --> 01:23:04.566
Dan Bi!

2207
01:23:05.767 --> 01:23:09.371
(You were here. I'm finally here for you.)

2208
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:10.639
Dan Bi!

2209
01:23:10.639 --> 01:23:12.040
(It breaks my heart to see you like this.)

2210
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.075
You don't even look at it at home.

2211
01:23:15.543 --> 01:23:16.611
Please.

2212
01:23:16.611 --> 01:23:17.979
(That was for being fake.)

2213
01:23:17.979 --> 01:23:19.047
What's wrong with you?

2214
01:23:19.047 --> 01:23:20.048
(Stop faking it.)

2215
01:23:20.048 --> 01:23:21.116
Stop it.

2216
01:23:21.383 --> 01:23:22.584
You punk.

2217
01:23:24.252 --> 01:23:26.755
- She's avoiding you. Look. - No.

2218
01:23:27.422 --> 01:23:28.790
- She's not avoiding me. - Look.

2219
01:23:29.691 --> 01:23:33.028
Many of you are missing your items.

2220
01:23:33.028 --> 01:23:35.463
This is your last chance to get these items back.

2221
01:23:35.463 --> 01:23:38.199
The final mission is Return of the Memories.

2222
01:23:38.199 --> 01:23:40.268
(Return of the Memories)

2223
01:23:40.268 --> 01:23:43.138
There are six items in the pawnshop right now.

2224
01:23:43.471 --> 01:23:45.373
They are dangling from the bridge.

2225
01:23:45.373 --> 01:23:46.875
(There are 6 items dangling from the bridge.)

2226
01:23:47.842 --> 01:23:51.212
You need to pick one person whose item is there...

2227
01:23:52.213 --> 01:23:53.882
and get the items back...

2228
01:23:53.882 --> 01:23:57.185
while crossing the bridge without falling.

2229
01:23:57.619 --> 01:23:59.154
You have only one chance.

2230
01:23:59.354 --> 01:24:02.724
You know the people involved, right?

2231
01:24:02.724 --> 01:24:05.327
Those people will take the water bomb.

2232
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.961
The rest will be safe.

2233
01:24:06.961 --> 01:24:12.334
(People who have been chosen)

2234
01:24:12.767 --> 01:24:16.571
- Kim Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

2235
01:24:16.671 --> 01:24:19.374
- Kim Jong Kook. - He might not do it.

2236
01:24:19.374 --> 01:24:20.742
He has to. Who else will?

2237
01:24:20.742 --> 01:24:22.143
If he doesn't...

2238
01:24:22.143 --> 01:24:24.813
- I have to get everything back. - Of course.

2239
01:24:24.979 --> 01:24:26.047
You have to.

2240
01:24:26.648 --> 01:24:28.717
- This is scary. - It's shaky.

2241
01:24:28.717 --> 01:24:30.018
How can anyone do this?

2242
01:24:30.018 --> 01:24:34.222
(The bridge is high, and it's shaky.)

2243
01:24:35.623 --> 01:24:36.658
(Will Jong Kook be able to get the items back?)

2244
01:24:36.658 --> 01:24:39.928
Ready. Set, go.

2245
01:24:41.896 --> 01:24:43.832
(It's not easy from the beginning.)

2246
01:24:43.832 --> 01:24:44.866
This...

2247
01:24:46.301 --> 01:24:48.803
(It moves even more with his weight on it.)

2248
01:24:48.803 --> 01:24:52.474
This is around 2.5m to 3m high.

2249
01:24:53.308 --> 01:24:56.444
These spin a lot.

2250
01:24:57.846 --> 01:24:58.880
Okay.

2251
01:24:59.881 --> 01:25:00.915
Okay.

2252
01:25:01.216 --> 01:25:02.717
He's there.

2253
01:25:02.717 --> 01:25:03.818
(If he doesn't get the baseball,)

2254
01:25:03.818 --> 01:25:07.021
Jong Kook, throw the baseball.

2255
01:25:07.021 --> 01:25:10.258
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook will get the water bomb.)

2256
01:25:10.258 --> 01:25:12.293
(Seok Jin, let us avoid the penalty.)

2257
01:25:12.293 --> 01:25:14.429
(He picks up Seok Jin's baseball and exempts him from the penalty.)

2258
01:25:14.429 --> 01:25:16.564
Respect! Seok Jin lives.

2259
01:25:17.031 --> 01:25:18.032
(He picks up his precious album.)

2260
01:25:18.032 --> 01:25:20.034
Where will he store the CD?

2261
01:25:20.135 --> 01:25:22.637
- Put it inside your underwear. - Put it down your pants.

2262
01:25:22.937 --> 01:25:24.706
He reached my item.

2263
01:25:24.839 --> 01:25:26.875
Jong Kook, you can wear the jacket.

2264
01:25:27.475 --> 01:25:29.344
You can wear the jacket.

2265
01:25:30.278 --> 01:25:31.579
Don't laugh. Why are you laughing?

2266
01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:34.048
(He laughs in a meaningful way.)

2267
01:25:34.048 --> 01:25:35.450
- Jong Kook. - I am passing through.

2268
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:36.885
- Hold on, Jong Kook. - What are you doing?

2269
01:25:36.885 --> 01:25:39.721
- Don't do that. - Hey, hey. Hey!

2270
01:25:39.754 --> 01:25:41.022
What will you do for me?

2271
01:25:41.022 --> 01:25:43.024
(He tries to strike a deal.)

2272
01:25:44.225 --> 01:25:47.195
- Jong Kook, Jong Kook! - Jong Kook, Jong Kook!

2273
01:25:47.328 --> 01:25:49.764
- Jong Kook, Jong Kook! - This is driving me crazy.

2274
01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:52.300
- Big respect, big respect. - Please get it. Okay.

2275
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.768
(He rescues the denim jacket after the flattery.)

2276
01:25:53.768 --> 01:25:55.904
You know how to act cute.

2277
01:25:56.004 --> 01:25:57.539
Big respect, big respect.

2278
01:25:57.839 --> 01:25:59.641
It might be too small for him.

2279
01:25:59.674 --> 01:26:01.176
You look cool. It looks good on you.

2280
01:26:01.209 --> 01:26:04.412
It's an honor to see my jacket on your shoulders.

2281
01:26:04.412 --> 01:26:06.514
- Here I go. - It's an honor.

2282
01:26:06.514 --> 01:26:08.850
Tom yum goong!

2283
01:26:08.850 --> 01:26:11.052
(He arrives at Haha's bundle of noodles.)

2284
01:26:11.052 --> 01:26:12.420
(Haha and Jong Kook's penalty depends on the heavy bundle.)

2285
01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.122
That one is the problem.

2286
01:26:14.789 --> 01:26:15.957
He can't pass through that one.

2287
01:26:16.791 --> 01:26:18.893
He must take that one.

2288
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:21.930
Can he really do this? It looks impossible.

2289
01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:23.164
Thank you.

2290
01:26:24.432 --> 01:26:26.134
- I will put it in front of me. - Okay.

2291
01:26:26.801 --> 01:26:31.272
Jong Kook, Dan Bi needs to sacrifice itself for everyone.

2292
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.042
- Jong Kook. - Pass through Dan Bi.

2293
01:26:34.042 --> 01:26:35.910
I wouldn't have asked if it were anyone else.

2294
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:39.681
I am pleading because it's you.

2295
01:26:39.681 --> 01:26:41.516
Dan Bi has a life.

2296
01:26:41.516 --> 01:26:43.151
Dan Bi is alive.

2297
01:26:43.151 --> 01:26:44.719
Jong Kook.

2298
01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:45.954
Don't be that way.

2299
01:26:46.421 --> 01:26:49.190
You should at least try!

2300
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:52.160
- Jong Kook. Jong Kook. - You should at least try.

2301
01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.496
- Jong Kook. - Come on.

2302
01:26:54.896 --> 01:26:56.564
He will get Ji Hyo's garden balsam first.

2303
01:26:56.564 --> 01:26:57.632
(He gets Ji Hyo's garden balsam first.)

2304
01:26:57.632 --> 01:26:59.701
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - Kwang Soo.

2305
01:26:59.701 --> 01:27:02.637
- Are you mad at me? - No. Why would I be mad at you?

2306
01:27:02.804 --> 01:27:05.573
- It's time to save Dan Bi. - Jong Kook, it's the last one.

2307
01:27:06.474 --> 01:27:08.943
(Please save Dan Bi.)

2308
01:27:09.711 --> 01:27:12.380
You might drop everything. Pass through it.

2309
01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.582
- No, you can do it. - Give it a try.

2310
01:27:14.582 --> 01:27:16.084
9012. 9012.

2311
01:27:17.519 --> 01:27:20.088
Gosh, this is heavy.

2312
01:27:20.088 --> 01:27:21.389
If you save the giraffe...

2313
01:27:21.389 --> 01:27:22.423
(He flatters Jong Kook.)

2314
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:23.758
- That's it. - Okay. Okay.

2315
01:27:23.758 --> 01:27:25.126
- Okay. That's good. - Watch the neck.

2316
01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.828
My goodness.

2317
01:27:27.829 --> 01:27:28.897
Jong Kook saved it.

2318
01:27:28.897 --> 01:27:29.931
(He succeeds in saving Dan Bi.)

2319
01:27:30.231 --> 01:27:32.667
Jong Kook is coming to us.

2320
01:27:33.301 --> 01:27:36.638
- Jong Kook doesn't disappoint. - Jong Kook.

2321
01:27:36.638 --> 01:27:38.373
It will be hard.

2322
01:27:38.373 --> 01:27:40.275
Dan Bi complicated the task.

2323
01:27:40.742 --> 01:27:42.477
Dan Bi complicated the task.

2324
01:27:42.477 --> 01:27:43.845
Don't say that.

2325
01:27:43.845 --> 01:27:47.248
Jong Kook, throw it away. Throw Dan Bi down the bridge.

2326
01:27:47.849 --> 01:27:49.551
- Throw it away. - Listen, Jong Kook.

2327
01:27:49.551 --> 01:27:53.087
- Throw Dan Bi away. - Throw Dan Bi away.

2328
01:27:53.087 --> 01:27:55.290
Put it over your shoulders.

2329
01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:57.091
(He puts it over his shoulders.)

2330
01:27:57.091 --> 01:27:58.092
My goodness.

2331
01:27:58.092 --> 01:27:59.294
(He puts it over his shoulders.)

2332
01:27:59.294 --> 01:28:02.263
- That's hilarious. - You are so sexy.

2333
01:28:02.263 --> 01:28:03.298
(Flattering)

2334
01:28:04.299 --> 01:28:06.467
You are so sexy.

2335
01:28:06.467 --> 01:28:08.670
(He makes a fatal mistake.)

2336
01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:11.172
No! Jong Kook!

2337
01:28:11.172 --> 01:28:12.540
(Don't do this to Dan Bi.)

2338
01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:14.142
Dan Bi! Dan Bi!

2339
01:28:14.142 --> 01:28:17.612
- Dan Bi. - No, please. Please.

2340
01:28:17.645 --> 01:28:20.949
Why in the world did you bring such a big doll?

2341
01:28:20.949 --> 01:28:22.684
I can't help that Dan Bi is precious to me.

2342
01:28:23.351 --> 01:28:24.419
Come on.

2343
01:28:24.419 --> 01:28:25.420
(How can I carry it?)

2344
01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:26.955
(Tossing)

2345
01:28:27.488 --> 01:28:28.723
(Jong Kook secures it by its neck for a safe delivery.)

2346
01:28:28.723 --> 01:28:29.824
That's a good idea.

2347
01:28:30.658 --> 01:28:32.093
Was that really necessary?

2348
01:28:32.093 --> 01:28:33.261
(Was that really necessary?)

2349
01:28:33.261 --> 01:28:34.629
Stick it in the next opening. That's it.

2350
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:35.663
- That's it. - My goodness.

2351
01:28:36.264 --> 01:28:37.932
(He sticks it in and advances.)

2352
01:28:37.932 --> 01:28:38.933
My goodness.

2353
01:28:38.933 --> 01:28:39.934
(He sticks it in and advances.)

2354
01:28:39.934 --> 01:28:41.469
(Please let me go.)

2355
01:28:42.303 --> 01:28:43.404
You are almost there.

2356
01:28:44.472 --> 01:28:46.040
Why did he put it behind him?

2357
01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.942
(He puts Dan Bi behind him.)

2358
01:28:48.209 --> 01:28:50.845
You don't need to do that.

2359
01:28:50.845 --> 01:28:53.314
You can put it in front of you.

2360
01:28:53.381 --> 01:28:55.383
- You can put it in front of you. - Put it in front of you.

2361
01:28:55.383 --> 01:28:56.884
- My goodness. - What is wrong with you?

2362
01:28:56.884 --> 01:28:58.252
- Put it in front of you. - No!

2363
01:28:58.252 --> 01:28:59.821
- Put it in front of you. - Don't do that.

2364
01:28:59.821 --> 01:29:02.423
- Put it in front of you. - He is like an alligator.

2365
01:29:02.423 --> 01:29:03.458
Jong Kook, move backwards.

2366
01:29:03.458 --> 01:29:06.361
Jong Kook, the denim jacket is blocking your microphone.

2367
01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:08.596
Is the denim jacket blocking my microphone? That won't do.

2368
01:29:08.596 --> 01:29:10.498
Jong Kook, move backwards.

2369
01:29:10.498 --> 01:29:11.633
(He takes off the denim jacket like a professional.)

2370
01:29:11.633 --> 01:29:13.267
Jong Kook, put it on the giraffe.

2371
01:29:13.267 --> 01:29:14.669
Put it on the giraffe.

2372
01:29:14.669 --> 01:29:15.670
Put it on Dan Bi.

2373
01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:17.538
What is going on? The denim jacket is Jae Seok's.

2374
01:29:17.538 --> 01:29:19.741
- This is crazy. - Both items are ours.

2375
01:29:20.308 --> 01:29:22.844
- Jong Kook, please! - Hey, hey.

2376
01:29:22.844 --> 01:29:25.513
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook, don't do this.

2377
01:29:25.513 --> 01:29:27.048
- Jong Kook, you are almost there. - Yes?

2378
01:29:27.048 --> 01:29:28.282
- I know. - Don't do that.

2379
01:29:28.282 --> 01:29:29.784
The giraffe looks so stylish.

2380
01:29:30.752 --> 01:29:32.987
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

2381
01:29:32.987 --> 01:29:34.922
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - With me?

2382
01:29:34.922 --> 01:29:36.290
- Let the result decide. - All right.

2383
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:38.459
- Let's wrap this up. - Let's wrap this up.

2384
01:29:38.459 --> 01:29:40.495
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Will the three of us play?

2385
01:29:40.962 --> 01:29:41.996
- The three of us will play. - The three of us?

2386
01:29:42.096 --> 01:29:44.632
No, Jong Kook. It puts you at a disadvantage.

2387
01:29:44.632 --> 01:29:46.334
- No, no. - It's 2 against 1.

2388
01:29:47.001 --> 01:29:50.438
Wait a minute. When did you become Jong Kook's guardian?

2389
01:29:50.438 --> 01:29:51.873
- Listen. - Seriously.

2390
01:29:51.873 --> 01:29:54.676
What is wrong with him? Gosh, I poked his eye.

2391
01:29:54.676 --> 01:29:56.844
(He gets his eye poked in his attempt to say something.)

2392
01:29:56.844 --> 01:29:58.713
I poked his eye.

2393
01:29:58.713 --> 01:30:01.449
- Jong Kook! Jong Kook! - Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

2394
01:30:01.449 --> 01:30:02.517
The four of us should play.

2395
01:30:02.517 --> 01:30:04.052
- I will be on Jong Kook's side. - Okay.

2396
01:30:04.052 --> 01:30:06.821
The winner will decide what happens.

2397
01:30:06.821 --> 01:30:07.855
- Okay. - That's good.

2398
01:30:07.922 --> 01:30:08.923
Rock-paper-scissors

2399
01:30:08.923 --> 01:30:10.591
(Rock-paper-scissors of fate)

2400
01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:15.496
(Can Jae Seok and Kwang Soo save Dan Bi?)

2401
01:30:16.898 --> 01:30:18.633
(Jong Kook plays rock while everyone else plays scissors.)

2402
01:30:18.633 --> 01:30:20.935
(Jong Kook wins.)

2403
01:30:20.935 --> 01:30:22.036
Okay!

2404
01:30:22.670 --> 01:30:25.673
(Screaming)

2405
01:30:25.673 --> 01:30:29.143
(He throws Dan Bi down the bridge without a moment of hesitation.)

2406
01:30:29.143 --> 01:30:30.311
This is crazy.

2407
01:30:30.311 --> 01:30:34.482
It was meaningless. My goodness.

2408
01:30:34.549 --> 01:30:35.783
(He is delighted and refreshed.)

2409
01:30:36.651 --> 01:30:39.887
Why did you ask him to play rock-paper-scissors?

2410
01:30:40.288 --> 01:30:41.355
Take it with you.

2411
01:30:41.889 --> 01:30:43.491
(Throwing)

2412
01:30:43.491 --> 01:30:46.461
(He throws his precious Dan Bi.)

2413
01:30:47.462 --> 01:30:48.930
(He throws his denim jacket, too.)

2414
01:30:50.131 --> 01:30:52.633
Thus, Jae Seok and Kwang Soo get...

2415
01:30:52.633 --> 01:30:55.670
the water bomb penalty.

2416
01:30:55.670 --> 01:30:57.238
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are the chosen ones.)

2417
01:30:57.238 --> 01:30:58.272
For goodness' sake.

2418
01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:01.509
The weather turned cold.

2419
01:31:01.509 --> 01:31:04.512
- It's unbelievable. - It's so cold. The sun is setting.

2420
01:31:04.512 --> 01:31:06.948
Now, Kwang Soo and Jae Seok will receive two water bombs...

2421
01:31:06.948 --> 01:31:09.884
for failing to save Dan Bi...

2422
01:31:10.418 --> 01:31:12.820
- and the denim jacket. - Will they receive two each?

2423
01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:15.523
We have two water bombs prepared for them.

2424
01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:18.259
- My goodness. - Don't we just need one?

2425
01:31:18.593 --> 01:31:21.329
Then they can move to the side after the first one.

2426
01:31:21.529 --> 01:31:25.299
We will move to the side without a word.

2427
01:31:25.299 --> 01:31:27.034
- Okay. - We will do it naturally.

2428
01:31:27.101 --> 01:31:29.203
- Here it comes. - Here it comes.

2429
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:32.273
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

2430
01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:38.679
(They get hit with the water bomb.)

2431
01:31:38.679 --> 01:31:40.748
- Move. - Move.

2432
01:31:40.748 --> 01:31:42.650
(Then they move.)

2433
01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:45.019
(They move down without a word.)

2434
01:31:45.019 --> 01:31:47.421
Move. Here is the next one. One,

2435
01:31:47.421 --> 01:31:48.956
- 2, 3. - 2, 3.

2436
01:31:50.091 --> 01:31:52.627
(They get hit one more time.)

2437
01:31:53.261 --> 01:31:54.262
My goodness.

2438
01:31:54.262 --> 01:31:56.531
(They find it entertaining.)

2439
01:31:56.531 --> 01:31:57.832
Look at Kwang Soo.

2440
01:31:57.832 --> 01:32:00.034
(Spluttering)

2441
01:32:00.768 --> 01:32:01.836
Kwang Soo.

2442
01:32:03.471 --> 01:32:05.173
He is taking a picture of them.

2443
01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.576
- I can't believe him. - My goodness.

2444
01:32:08.676 --> 01:32:11.712
- It's Jong Kook's fault. - Seriously.

2445
01:32:11.913 --> 01:32:12.914
I can't believe him.

2446
01:32:12.914 --> 01:32:15.049
(Celebrating the double water bomb)

2447
01:32:15.383 --> 01:32:17.251
(The return of the original idol group, Super Junior)

2448
01:32:17.251 --> 01:32:18.653
(The lovely queens, Red Velvet)

2449
01:32:19.053 --> 01:32:21.289
(Are Eun Hyuk and So Min alumni?)

2450
01:32:21.289 --> 01:32:23.090
(An unexpected love story surfaces.)

2451
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:24.525
(Didn't you like me?)

2452
01:32:25.226 --> 01:32:27.762
(I feel jealous since she keeps talking about Eun Hyuk.)

2453
01:32:28.095 --> 01:32:29.297
(Poop So Min!)

2454
01:32:29.297 --> 01:32:32.533
(A love triangle with So Min begins.)

2455
01:32:33.167 --> 01:32:35.369
(This strange love triangle is charming.)

2456
01:32:35.369 --> 01:32:37.839
(Fall into it.)

2457
01:32:37.839 --> 01:32:38.973
(Is it my turn?)

2458
01:32:40.908 --> 01:32:43.911
(However,)

2459
01:32:43.911 --> 01:32:45.713
(there is...)

2460
01:32:45.713 --> 01:32:48.549
(a spy.)

2461
01:32:48.549 --> 01:32:50.818
(They don't go easy on their own team members...)

2462
01:32:50.818 --> 01:32:53.287
(in order to find the spy.)

2463
01:32:53.287 --> 01:32:55.456
(There is a spy among us.)

2464
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:58.292
(Find the Spy)
