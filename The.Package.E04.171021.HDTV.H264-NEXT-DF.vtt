<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:43.712
<i>I need to know
if she's smiling or crying.</i>

4
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.785
<i>I should see that before I go.</i>

5
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:52.450
I need to find her soon.
I don't have time.

6
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.962
<i>It'd be better if I didn't remember.</i>

7
00:01:43.823 --> 00:01:47.303
<i>I had someone by my side,
no matter what happened.</i>

8
00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:52.805
<i>- Not you.</i>
- Are you okay?

9
00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:56.332
<i>There she is.
My savior, my hero.</i>

10
00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:58.063
<i>The pillar of my life...</i>

11
00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:00.849
I told you not to fight!
Why don't you listen to me?

12
00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.171
I told you, they started it first!

13
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:04.418
I got it!

14
00:02:04.418 --> 00:02:08.078
You don't feel sorry, do you?
Mister, I need your gun.

15
00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:10.175
- Give it to me!
- Why are you doing this?

16
00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:13.357
You don't feel bad for what you did!

17
00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:14.798
I feel bad!

18
00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:18.053
<i>She was my pillar,
and she was strong, too.</i>

19
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.357
<i>I could only count on her.</i>

20
00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:29.571
Big Sis.

21
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:32.280
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

22
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.846
<i>My big sister.</i>

23
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.762
<i>Even when I lied about a school trip
to go on vacation with my girlfriend...</i>

24
00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:43.333
Big Sis, don't tell Mom and Dad.

25
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.281
Don't tell my parents either.

26
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:46.554
Ouch.

27
00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:50.986
<i>And even when she fabricated
my failed report card.</i>

28
00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:55.315
Big Sis, don't tell Mom and Dad, okay?

29
00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:01.894
<i>And when I got into an accident
with my dad's car.</i>

30
00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:07.292
Bis Sis, don't tell Mom and Dad...

31
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.756
<i>- She was loyal.</i>
- Gosh, seriously.

32
00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:15.427
- I'm going to study abroad.
<i>- And she was stubborn too.</i>

33
00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:16.928
Are you crazy?

34
00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:20.593
You're not going to study!
You're running off with a man!

35
00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:22.439
I can get my PhD.

36
00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.464
I can come back to be a professor.

37
00:03:24.464 --> 00:03:27.042
Who in your field would
get their PhD in France?

38
00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:30.626
Was it that punk's idea? Did he
convince you? Tell him to come here!

39
00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.708
Why do you keep calling him a punk?

40
00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:36.161
If his mom called me a wench,
would you be happy?

41
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.440
- You've really lost it.
<i>- Her perfect reasoning.</i>

42
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.399
<i>The queen of inductive reasoning.</i>

43
00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:44.552
<i>Is that the right expression?</i>

44
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.768
So, is it the man
you're fated to be with?

45
00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.286
- No.
- It's not?

46
00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:03.939
I thought the fortune tellers
told you it was fated.

47
00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.244
Fate doesn't exist in this world.

48
00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:09.691
Fate is what I choose for my future.

49
00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:15.655
I'm leaving tomorrow.

50
00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:20.505
- Tomorrow?
<i>- If she hadn't said that...</i>

51
00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:23.683
You'd better not tell Mom and Dad.

52
00:04:23.683 --> 00:04:25.887
<i>If I hadn't heard that...</i>

53
00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.255
<i>You're so frustrating.</i>

54
00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:31.719
You should have told your family.

55
00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.608
How could you keep that a secret?

56
00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:36.947
- I trusted her.
- That's how you fall for it.

57
00:04:36.947 --> 00:04:41.502
Jesus died because he was
stabbed in the back by his pupil.

58
00:04:41.502 --> 00:04:43.380
Although, he came back alive.

59
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.423
But she's still my big sister.

60
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.108
My sister would never so anything bad.

61
00:04:54.664 --> 00:05:04.221
<i>[It will all work out,
as long as you don't mess up again.]</i>

62
00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:40.606
I'm here.

63
00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:44.805
Have you finished crying?

64
00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:47.731
When did you get here?

65
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:49.728
Before you started crying.

66
00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:53.137
<i>This situation and this feeling.</i>

67
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.197
<i>I'm relieved I'm not alone.</i>

68
00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.875
<i>I feel like someone's holding on to me.</i>

69
00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:04.716
<i>But...</i>

70
00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:07.567
<i>I'm so embarrassed.</i>

71
00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.851
What are you looking at? Go away!

72
00:06:09.851 --> 00:06:11.591
Sure, I'll go.

73
00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:14.015
Don't go.

74
00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:16.428
Okay, I won't.

75
00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:18.880
I told you to go.

76
00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.592
<i>Don't stay here,
but don't leave, either.</i>

77
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.615
Are you all right?

78
00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:42.904
I'm sorry. I have good reflexes.
I was an athlete.

79
00:06:50.372 --> 00:06:53.406
If you have good reflexes,
shouldn't you have caught me?

80
00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:56.281
You avoided me
so you could save yourself.

81
00:06:58.882 --> 00:07:01.685
I'm sorry. I'll catch you next time.

82
00:07:01.685 --> 00:07:04.509
That's okay. I don't trust men.

83
00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:07.106
Why don't you trust men?

84
00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:10.563
Men aren't people you can trust.

85
00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:13.048
My friend told me something else.

86
00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:18.229
There are two types of women
in this world.

87
00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.396
Women you shouldn't trust,
and women you can't trust.

88
00:07:20.396 --> 00:07:23.243
Women can't be trusted.

89
00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:25.438
- Why not?
- I'm not sure.

90
00:07:25.438 --> 00:07:28.122
Maybe he doesn't understand women.

91
00:07:28.122 --> 00:07:30.807
Women don't trust men because
they know them too well.

92
00:07:30.807 --> 00:07:33.654
We don't trust each other because
we don't know you, but you know us.

93
00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:36.298
That's why relationships are tragic.

94
00:07:36.298 --> 00:07:37.952
Just like Romeo and Juliet.

95
00:07:37.952 --> 00:07:40.988
Wasn't it a tragedy because they died?

96
00:07:40.988 --> 00:07:43.062
It would have been
more tragic if they lived.

97
00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:46.168
Juliet was 14 and Romeo was 17.

98
00:07:46.168 --> 00:07:49.115
Imagine if they got married.
What do kids know?

99
00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:52.389
And on top of that,
their parents didn't get along.

100
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.384
They might have been happier
because they died.

101
00:07:57.807 --> 00:08:00.500
It's not right to say
they were happy they died.

102
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.115
You shouldn't say that
at an angel's feet.

103
00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:21.986
Your results are the same.

104
00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:24.365
It must be your fate.

105
00:08:24.365 --> 00:08:28.887
You'll meet your eternal love
at an angel's feet.

106
00:08:32.653 --> 00:08:35.205
At an angel's feet?

107
00:08:38.876 --> 00:08:42.745
Your eternal love is at an angel's feet.

108
00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:48.689
You will end up meeting your
eternal love at an angel's feet.

109
00:08:48.689 --> 00:08:51.630
I came because I want to know
where the angel's feet are.

110
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.431
Angel? We don't worship angels.

111
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:58.168
Where are the angel's feet?

112
00:08:58.168 --> 00:08:59.900
I wouldn't know.

113
00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:04.155
It's over there.
Saint Michael the Archangel.

114
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.077
It's a little far though.

115
00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:18.480
If we go up there,
we'll be at an angel's feet.

116
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.299
So So?

117
00:09:24.701 --> 00:09:27.600
- Yes?
- Can we go up there?

118
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.134
No, we can't.

119
00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:32.014
- Is it off limits?
- Yes.

120
00:09:32.014 --> 00:09:35.768
They kept it closed for safety
and cultural preservation.

121
00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:38.394
They don't plan to open it
in the future either.

122
00:09:40.948 --> 00:09:44.595
That's too bad. I wanted to see it.

123
00:09:45.244 --> 00:09:47.506
I have to go back to Korea tomorrow.

124
00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:51.553
- Tomorrow?
- There's work at the office.

125
00:09:51.553 --> 00:09:54.275
Will I be able to
exchange my plane tickets?

126
00:09:54.843 --> 00:09:58.809
It's possible, but you can't
get a refund for the trip.

127
00:09:58.809 --> 00:10:02.779
It doesn't matter. It's my fault
for coming when I shouldn't have.

128
00:10:03.514 --> 00:10:07.456
Anyway, tonight is
my last night in France.

129
00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:16.518
Would you like a glass of wine?

130
00:10:16.518 --> 00:10:19.199
Where? The bars are all closed.

131
00:10:19.199 --> 00:10:23.087
- They sell wine at the hotel here.
- A hotel?

132
00:10:23.087 --> 00:10:24.653
Just the two of us?

133
00:10:24.653 --> 00:10:27.683
Is there... anyone else around?

134
00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:41.914
I'll pay for the wine. Wait here, okay?

135
00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:54.678
I'll pay for the wine. Wait here, okay?

136
00:11:18.057 --> 00:11:19.840
There's no way.

137
00:11:24.324 --> 00:11:25.971
No way.

138
00:11:33.837 --> 00:11:35.548
This isn't right.

139
00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:39.548
That's okay. I do this sometimes
when I have travelers I connect with.

140
00:11:39.548 --> 00:11:41.601
- Really?
- Of course.

141
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:45.275
- Don't feel burdened.
- How could I not?

142
00:11:45.275 --> 00:11:47.285
Why do you feel burdened?

143
00:11:48.798 --> 00:11:53.598
Man, woman, hotel, night, alcohol.
It's the perfect five.

144
00:11:53.598 --> 00:11:56.035
What would follow after that?

145
00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.433
What are you saying? Follow me!

146
00:12:04.298 --> 00:12:07.668
Everywhere is closed,
so this is the only place to get wine.

147
00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:11.467
Are you a pervert who
only thinks about those things?

148
00:12:16.598 --> 00:12:19.216
Wait! Wait for me!

149
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:33.960
Yes.

150
00:12:34.952 --> 00:12:39.241
You know how So So
has a strong personality.

151
00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:44.635
That girl stole her parents' cash
and card to run away from home.

152
00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:48.081
- How could she go back?
- I stole them.

153
00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:50.121
My sister doesn't know how to do that.

154
00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:54.992
<i>My sister didn't know
there were cards and cash in there.</i>

155
00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:56.402
Come here.

156
00:12:57.537 --> 00:12:59.144
Stay safe.

157
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.630
Younger brothers usually say this.
"If you make my sister cry, you're dead."

158
00:13:10.468 --> 00:13:12.955
I won't. Don't worry.

159
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:21.433
But you should worry.

160
00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:26.244
If you make her cry,
I'll really kill you.

161
00:13:34.798 --> 00:13:36.226
You must feel safe with him.

162
00:13:37.806 --> 00:13:39.698
- I'll go now.
- Bye.

163
00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:42.920
Bye.

164
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:49.900
Hey, look here.

165
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.326
Cherish that. French wine is expensive.

166
00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:58.010
If she left like that, she should have
lived happily. I got a call from her.

167
00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:02.649
She cried without saying anything,
so I yelled at her.

168
00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:06.362
I told her to stop crying,
and that I'd kill her if she didn't.

169
00:14:07.068 --> 00:14:09.653
I didn't know that'd become
our last phone call.

170
00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:14.427
Hey, you should have come
to France to look for her back then.

171
00:14:14.427 --> 00:14:16.356
I wasn't able to.

172
00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:21.492
Why are you crying? I told him I'd kill
him if you cried! Why are you crying?

173
00:14:21.492 --> 00:14:23.462
<i>It's because of that bastard, right?</i>

174
00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:27.348
Where is he?
Where is that son of a bitch?

175
00:14:27.348 --> 00:14:29.947
Geez, good thing
you didn't try to run off.

176
00:14:29.947 --> 00:14:34.857
I tried. I tried to hop the wall
of the military unit, but got caught.

177
00:14:34.857 --> 00:14:38.956
That Bae Young Goo abandoned my
sister after he got a position in Korea.

178
00:14:38.956 --> 00:14:40.826
- I couldn't stay still.
- Listen to me.

179
00:14:40.826 --> 00:14:45.234
There are countless people
in similar situations in this country.

180
00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:50.494
That's why French movies...
are really boring.

181
00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:55.888
By the way... where is my sister?

182
00:14:59.543 --> 00:15:02.227
I will give you some advice
as an older brother figure.

183
00:15:02.227 --> 00:15:05.201
This is the most important thing
you should do as family.

184
00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:06.636
You should wait for her.

185
00:15:06.636 --> 00:15:09.486
Wait for her quietly,
without a word. Why?

186
00:15:09.486 --> 00:15:12.567
Family will come back eventually.

187
00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:14.622
Except my wife.

188
00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:18.139
- She still hasn't come back.
- Have a drink.

189
00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:26.806
It's normal to cry sometimes
when living abroad.

190
00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:31.872
It's common.
I miss my friends and family.

191
00:15:31.872 --> 00:15:33.639
You said you don't have a family.

192
00:15:34.302 --> 00:15:36.893
That's why I miss them more.

193
00:15:36.893 --> 00:15:39.640
Ma Ru, why did you come alone?

194
00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:45.593
Just because. Why did you buy that whip?

195
00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:50.865
Why did you bring women's lingerie?

196
00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:53.203
Who was that man who chased you down?

197
00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.431
Why do you take selfies
with that expression?

198
00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:57.497
Did you immigrate to France?

199
00:15:58.053 --> 00:16:01.390
- Why are you going back all of a sudden?
- When are you going back to Korea?

200
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.234
Drink your wine.

201
00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:22.042
Our Han So Ran...

202
00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:24.604
What are you thinking about?

203
00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:27.337
You scared me.

204
00:16:27.337 --> 00:16:30.960
So Ran, we came all the way to France.

205
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.972
Let's be more romantic.

206
00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:35.298
Fine, kiss.

207
00:16:37.058 --> 00:16:39.876
- I won't do it then.
- Fine, I'll do it.

208
00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:44.407
Gosh, I was almost done.

209
00:16:44.407 --> 00:16:46.352
Couldn't you wait?

210
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.196
I heard the sunrise is beautiful here.
Let's go see it tomorrow morning.

211
00:16:56.196 --> 00:17:00.231
- But she told us to stay together.
- It'll only be for a moment.

212
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:03.475
Hey, what if you get lost?
You can't speak English.

213
00:17:03.475 --> 00:17:07.398
I can speak everyday English.

214
00:17:12.348 --> 00:17:14.104
Fine, let's go.

215
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:23.435
If we want to see the sunrise,
we should sleep early.

216
00:17:25.638 --> 00:17:28.766
Just like French lovers...

217
00:17:29.823 --> 00:17:33.247
- I... need to poop.
- What?

218
00:17:33.247 --> 00:17:35.310
Poop.

219
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.139
Let me down. Let me down.

220
00:17:39.516 --> 00:17:43.640
I didn't go for three days.
It's here. I should go when I can.

221
00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.177
Yeah.

222
00:17:52.845 --> 00:17:54.884
You should go when you can.

223
00:17:56.355 --> 00:17:58.359
You should go when you can.

224
00:18:02.787 --> 00:18:06.973
Hey, you were too tired last night,
and you have to poop tonight.

225
00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:10.428
How could you be like that
after coming all the way here?

226
00:18:10.428 --> 00:18:12.299
Is it hard to hold it in?

227
00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.005
<i>Hand me my cell phone. I'm bored.</i>

228
00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:16.272
Sure.

229
00:18:24.946 --> 00:18:26.395
Geez.

230
00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:34.678
Hey, I'm not going to see the sunrise!

231
00:18:34.678 --> 00:18:38.105
<i>Why are you getting annoyed?
Can't you just cheer me on?</i>

232
00:18:38.105 --> 00:18:39.649
I don't know!

233
00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:43.181
- I don't want to fight over poop.
<i>- I can't focus!</i>

234
00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:47.137
That woman. Damn it.

235
00:19:05.206 --> 00:19:07.170
One, two, three!

236
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:11.964
This is one of the places where you can
see the beauty of Mont Saint-Michel.

237
00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:14.751
It's because of the panorama view.

238
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:18.182
The tide comes in twice a day
near the monastery.

239
00:19:18.182 --> 00:19:19.686
There was sand buildup

240
00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:23.024
so environmental conservation
built this deck.

241
00:19:23.024 --> 00:19:24.700
- Should I jump?
- No.

242
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.842
We'll head to the monastery
after you finish taking pictures.

243
00:19:34.207 --> 00:19:37.947
Mont Saint-Michel's history
goes back 1,300 years.

244
00:19:37.947 --> 00:19:41.371
It's the only place that wasn't
affected by the English army

245
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:45.553
during the Hundred Years' War
between France and England.

246
00:19:45.553 --> 00:19:49.639
That's why it's a sacred place
for French people

247
00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:51.620
as well as their pride.

248
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.944
Wow, it'd be nice
to grill some meat here.

249
00:19:57.944 --> 00:20:00.804
I wish you'd stop saying that.

250
00:20:00.804 --> 00:20:04.850
Almost all Korean visitors
only come here for a day.

251
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.600
- But we'll be here for two days.
- This place must be big.

252
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.293
This place must be big.

253
00:20:09.293 --> 00:20:13.486
No. It's small, but it's very beautiful.

254
00:20:13.486 --> 00:20:18.493
We'll take a look around as a group
today, and freely tomorrow.

255
00:20:19.504 --> 00:20:22.406
Do you see the bronze statue
on top of the church?

256
00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:23.777
I don't see it.

257
00:20:24.793 --> 00:20:26.533
- I don't see it.
- Yes.

258
00:20:26.533 --> 00:20:30.741
The statue that is hard to see
is Saint Michael the Archangel.

259
00:20:30.741 --> 00:20:36.053
<i>The bishop said he was ordered
to build this monastery in his dream.</i>

260
00:20:36.053 --> 00:20:39.415
First, he didn't listen
because it was just a dream.

261
00:20:39.415 --> 00:20:44.197
But it showed up again,
and the third time he dreamt it

262
00:20:44.197 --> 00:20:47.013
<i>he pressed his forehead
because he didn't want to listen.</i>

263
00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:51.334
And that finger sparked,
which woke him up from his dream.

264
00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:56.380
A similar legend was told in Italy
in the fourth century...

265
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.998
There are many legends like that.

266
00:20:58.998 --> 00:21:01.034
There are many all over the world.

267
00:21:01.034 --> 00:21:04.273
That's when they began
to build the monastery.

268
00:21:04.273 --> 00:21:09.197
The most beautiful product of
God's revelation and human belief

269
00:21:09.197 --> 00:21:11.592
is Mont Saint-Michel.

270
00:21:11.592 --> 00:21:13.764
Let's go inside.

271
00:21:17.906 --> 00:21:19.312
Hurry up.

272
00:21:20.938 --> 00:21:23.043
Is that real gold?

273
00:21:23.043 --> 00:21:25.274
- Look at them.
- Why?

274
00:21:25.274 --> 00:21:28.061
- There's something up between them.
- What do you mean?

275
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:31.246
There is. I'm sure of it. I smell it.

276
00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:34.045
Hey, you smell worse. Go take a poop.

277
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:38.181
- You...
- Hello?

278
00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:40.235
Geez, Big Brother.

279
00:21:40.235 --> 00:21:43.447
Yes, I'm in France. Yes.

280
00:21:43.447 --> 00:21:46.526
What happened with my ticket?
I told my company I'd be back today.

281
00:21:46.526 --> 00:21:50.745
They'll send a car at 1 p.m.,
so you can leave after lunch.

282
00:21:50.745 --> 00:21:53.024
I'll check if it left yet.

283
00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:59.630
But, is it so urgent that
you have to leave now?

284
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.223
It's because of work.

285
00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:05.793
- The rest of your trip...
- I know, it's not refundable.

286
00:22:05.793 --> 00:22:09.463
It's not that. Don't feel bad
about missing the rest of it.

287
00:22:09.463 --> 00:22:11.505
If you do, it'll become your prison.

288
00:22:11.505 --> 00:22:14.207
- I'm going to prison?
- No.

289
00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:17.707
People tend to get stuck
in places they haven't been.

290
00:22:17.707 --> 00:22:21.265
I heard that happens to people
who go back home midway.

291
00:22:28.632 --> 00:22:32.896
Who the heck is calling me?

292
00:22:38.121 --> 00:22:40.531
Hello, So So.

293
00:22:44.302 --> 00:22:49.516
I checked the ticket exchange,
so don't forget to send the car by 1 p.m.

294
00:22:49.516 --> 00:22:53.438
I got it. Did you tell him
it's not refundable?

295
00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.449
Of course.

296
00:22:55.449 --> 00:22:59.815
He agreed to pay for the ticket
processing fee and car rental.

297
00:23:00.315 --> 00:23:01.899
I'm going to start the tour now.

298
00:23:07.611 --> 00:23:10.507
- Boss.
- Yeah?

299
00:23:10.507 --> 00:23:11.956
Where is she?

300
00:23:13.428 --> 00:23:17.258
I think she's at Mont Saint-Michel.

301
00:23:17.258 --> 00:23:20.159
There was a problem there.

302
00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:22.448
I need to send a car by 1 p.m.

303
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:25.252
Got that?

304
00:23:51.421 --> 00:23:55.396
<i>Is she worth this effort?
She abandoned her family and ran away.</i>

305
00:23:56.266 --> 00:23:58.545
<i>She's just as bad as that punk.</i>

306
00:24:10.588 --> 00:24:12.889
It's starting. Be quiet.

307
00:24:12.889 --> 00:24:14.349
I'm quiet.

308
00:24:33.726 --> 00:24:35.553
Hey, sit down.

309
00:24:40.322 --> 00:24:41.966
Hey, you son of a bitch!

310
00:24:44.905 --> 00:24:46.197
Hey!

311
00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:50.619
Honey, stop him! Why are you here?

312
00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:54.089
Where's my sister?
Where did you abandon her?

313
00:24:54.089 --> 00:24:56.321
I said I'll kill you.

314
00:24:56.321 --> 00:24:59.226
- Oh my goodness!
- Hey!

315
00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:03.213
Hey! Hey! Hey!

316
00:25:03.213 --> 00:25:05.332
- What's wrong with him?
- Hey!

317
00:25:05.332 --> 00:25:08.640
<i>If God let me kill two people</i>

318
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.373
<i>I'd kill this bastard twice.</i>

319
00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:25.197
<i>Wait, how do I get to Mont Saint-Michel?</i>

320
00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:32.656
<i>As I guide, I've heard this
the most often.</i>

321
00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:35.834
<i>France is alive thanks
to their ancestors.</i>

322
00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:41.376
<i>France earns a lot of money,
just from their cultural assets.</i>

323
00:25:43.969 --> 00:25:47.976
<i>However, France is lucky to have
their descendants rather than ancestors.</i>

324
00:25:47.976 --> 00:25:52.030
<i>The descendants' efforts to protect
and preserve everything</i>

325
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.204
<i>created the France that exists today.</i>

326
00:25:55.204 --> 00:25:58.466
<i>With redevelopment and reconstruction</i>

327
00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:03.107
<i>they prevented their history
from being destroyed.</i>

328
00:26:06.476 --> 00:26:10.063
A healthcare business started
during the Napoleonic era.

329
00:26:10.063 --> 00:26:15.435
And at that time, a female chef
invented an omelet.

330
00:26:15.435 --> 00:26:20.265
It became really famous,
and established it as her specialty.

331
00:26:20.265 --> 00:26:24.282
We're going to have lunch here.
Shall we take a look around?

332
00:26:24.282 --> 00:26:26.056
Is it good?

333
00:26:26.056 --> 00:26:28.861
- Is it good or not?
- Stop it.

334
00:26:39.507 --> 00:26:41.669
It's a world famous cuisine now

335
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:45.639
but they still use the methods
they used 128 years ago.

336
00:26:45.639 --> 00:26:47.746
And they make it themselves.

337
00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.002
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E04 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

338
00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:08.242
- Take your time.
- Yes.

339
00:27:12.222 --> 00:27:13.697
Hurry up!

340
00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:18.139
We're almost there.

341
00:27:24.448 --> 00:27:28.284
<i>This is Bertrand du Guesclin's house.</i>

342
00:27:28.284 --> 00:27:30.418
<i>It's a military official's house.</i>

343
00:27:30.418 --> 00:27:33.642
<i>And it looks the same as it did
in the Middle Ages.</i>

344
00:27:36.928 --> 00:27:41.498
<i>Bertrand du Guesclin's wife
was a fortune teller.</i>

345
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:44.319
<i>Before her husband went off to war</i>

346
00:27:44.319 --> 00:27:49.214
<i>she read his fortune
to predict their outcome.</i>

347
00:27:49.214 --> 00:27:54.027
There's a movie that was a hit in Korea.
Have you seen "Mad Max"?

348
00:27:54.027 --> 00:27:57.052
- Yes, I have.
- With whom?

349
00:27:57.052 --> 00:27:59.207
Mind your own business.

350
00:27:59.207 --> 00:28:03.025
You see this in that movie.
This is a chastity belt.

351
00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:06.318
During the Crusades,
when the soldiers went off to war

352
00:28:06.318 --> 00:28:08.319
they put these on their wives.

353
00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:11.524
It was to prevent them
from cheating on them.

354
00:28:11.524 --> 00:28:17.554
But they say the wives called
the locksmith to unlock it afterward.

355
00:28:17.554 --> 00:28:19.816
Can people complete
their daily routine with that on?

356
00:28:19.816 --> 00:28:22.325
I'm not sure. I haven't tried it.

357
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:26.771
Take some pictures, and meet me
at the entrance in 10 minutes.

358
00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:29.698
- Yes.
- Who did you watch it with?

359
00:28:29.698 --> 00:28:31.613
You don't have to know.

360
00:28:46.216 --> 00:28:48.870
Why aren't they coming out?
We should hurry over to the next place

361
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.803
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet.

362
00:28:50.803 --> 00:28:53.488
It's time, so he'll be out soon.

363
00:28:53.488 --> 00:28:55.897
Geez, that punk.

364
00:28:55.897 --> 00:28:59.313
Would you like to hear a funny story?

365
00:29:03.939 --> 00:29:06.697
<i>It's a legendary story around here.</i>

366
00:29:06.697 --> 00:29:10.697
Five years ago,
a visitor tried on the chastity belt.

367
00:29:10.697 --> 00:29:12.668
Wh... what?

368
00:29:13.207 --> 00:29:16.024
He must have been a curious person.

369
00:29:17.195 --> 00:29:20.785
<i>You know the kinds of people
who need to try it out themselves.</i>

370
00:29:20.785 --> 00:29:22.001
<i>That's right.</i>

371
00:29:28.502 --> 00:29:31.949
But you mustn't put it on.

372
00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:33.632
There's no key.

373
00:29:43.274 --> 00:29:47.414
The police, mayor, and minister
came and caused a fuss.

374
00:29:47.414 --> 00:29:52.564
But he had to keep it on for
five hours until the locksmith came.

375
00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.186
Damn it.

376
00:29:59.822 --> 00:30:04.043
<i>They tried to take a picture with
the fool of Mont Saint-Michel's history</i>

377
00:30:04.043 --> 00:30:06.748
- but he ran away.
- He wasn't Korean, right?

378
00:30:06.748 --> 00:30:09.804
- Thankfully not.
- That's a given.

379
00:30:09.804 --> 00:30:11.093
It'd taint our reputation.

380
00:30:11.093 --> 00:30:14.122
We need to head over
to our next destination.

381
00:30:15.536 --> 00:30:18.791
He's late every time.
He's a repeat offender.

382
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:20.630
I'll be right back.

383
00:30:23.764 --> 00:30:25.361
Geez, seriously.

384
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:27.378
Geez, seriously...

385
00:30:31.883 --> 00:30:34.354
We need to get going.
Everyone is waiting.

386
00:30:34.354 --> 00:30:36.853
- Pardon?
- Come down.

387
00:30:36.853 --> 00:30:38.139
So So!

388
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.109
What is it?

389
00:30:40.727 --> 00:30:43.699
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Come down.

390
00:30:44.831 --> 00:30:46.312
Wait...

391
00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:56.565
What are you doing? You should
look around and go back to Korea.

392
00:30:57.348 --> 00:30:58.751
Help me.

393
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.003
You're driving me crazy.

394
00:31:09.755 --> 00:31:13.953
Why did you put that on? What do we do?

395
00:31:17.593 --> 00:31:20.534
Why isn't she coming back?

396
00:31:20.534 --> 00:31:22.293
I'm sure she'll be back.

397
00:31:23.296 --> 00:31:26.598
- Wait here. I'll go check.
- Hey, don't do that.

398
00:31:26.598 --> 00:31:29.803
This vacation was too expensive
to waste time in the streets!

399
00:31:29.803 --> 00:31:31.659
I'll go, sir.

400
00:31:33.421 --> 00:31:34.861
There are a lot of stairs.

401
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:43.244
He's a good fellow.
People should be like him!

402
00:31:45.408 --> 00:31:47.488
- Wait.
- Stay still.

403
00:31:47.488 --> 00:31:49.517
I'll take it off.

404
00:31:49.517 --> 00:31:51.925
- Why isn't it coming off?
- Go slowly.

405
00:31:52.484 --> 00:31:53.813
Wait.

406
00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.860
- Wait.
- Stay still.

407
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.733
I'll take it off.

408
00:32:00.733 --> 00:32:03.318
- Why isn't it coming off?
- Go slowly.

409
00:32:03.829 --> 00:32:05.257
Wait.

410
00:32:12.955 --> 00:32:16.646
How did you do this? Gosh, seriously.

411
00:32:16.646 --> 00:32:19.064
I think we can rip it off.

412
00:32:19.064 --> 00:32:24.024
This is a 700-year-old cultural asset.
It's worth more than your house.

413
00:32:24.657 --> 00:32:26.607
Let me see.

414
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.382
I saw this coming.

415
00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:50.139
I knew you'd do this.

416
00:32:51.467 --> 00:32:53.377
Gosh, seriously.

417
00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.473
Hey!

418
00:33:00.421 --> 00:33:01.950
Geez, damn it.

419
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.034
- Why are you alone?
- The thing is...

420
00:33:05.034 --> 00:33:06.938
she told me not to tell anyone.

421
00:33:06.938 --> 00:33:10.594
- Tell us what?
- Don't tell them I told you.

422
00:33:10.594 --> 00:33:13.726
- He put it on!
- What?

423
00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:16.181
That!

424
00:33:17.206 --> 00:33:18.842
What?

425
00:33:18.842 --> 00:33:22.283
He put it on as
the first Korean in history!

426
00:33:22.283 --> 00:33:25.216
- The chastity belt?
- What?

427
00:33:25.216 --> 00:33:26.623
Would you like to see?

428
00:33:27.598 --> 00:33:29.601
Hurry up.

429
00:33:32.506 --> 00:33:34.905
Stay in line!

430
00:33:36.888 --> 00:33:38.060
Yes.
(In French)

431
00:33:41.773 --> 00:33:42.773
Yes, yes.

432
00:33:44.296 --> 00:33:45.449
You can't!

433
00:33:46.402 --> 00:33:51.252
You can't dent it. I'm talking
to City Hall, so stay still.

434
00:33:55.388 --> 00:33:56.611
Yes, yes...

435
00:34:02.335 --> 00:34:05.190
You get into all sorts of trouble.

436
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.226
What does your father do?

437
00:34:07.226 --> 00:34:09.291
Why are you asking him that?

438
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:11.159
What does your father do?

439
00:34:11.876 --> 00:34:14.867
- He's a public official.
- Where?

440
00:34:14.867 --> 00:34:16.365
City Hall.

441
00:34:17.392 --> 00:34:20.610
- I talked to City Hall.
- They can't take it off, right?

442
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.564
They will report it to the police.

443
00:34:25.626 --> 00:34:27.434
Wow, seriously.

444
00:34:35.713 --> 00:34:37.948
Turn to the right.

445
00:34:41.564 --> 00:34:43.177
Turn to the left.

446
00:35:00.977 --> 00:35:03.289
They finished taking the evidence photos.

447
00:35:03.289 --> 00:35:05.599
Don't sit or lie down anywhere.

448
00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:09.535
If you leave this place
with that on, you'll be arrested.

449
00:35:10.061 --> 00:35:14.202
And they want to know why you did it.
Were you trying to steal it?

450
00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:17.608
No, I just wanted to know how it felt.

451
00:35:28.887 --> 00:35:33.505
Are you obsessed with female products
or do you have a unique sexual fantasy?

452
00:35:33.505 --> 00:35:37.876
I'm not a pervert. Doesn't everyone
want to try it just once?

453
00:35:37.876 --> 00:35:39.541
- No.
- No.

454
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:41.631
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not perverted.

455
00:35:41.631 --> 00:35:43.293
Gosh, stop it.

456
00:35:43.293 --> 00:35:45.135
You should be embarrassed.

457
00:35:45.865 --> 00:35:47.932
I thought everyone felt that way.

458
00:35:55.802 --> 00:35:59.419
The locksmith employed
by the cultural center is in Paris

459
00:35:59.419 --> 00:36:02.385
so he'll be here in five hours.

460
00:36:02.385 --> 00:36:04.081
Five hours?

461
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:06.336
I have to leave. Can't they hurry?

462
00:36:06.336 --> 00:36:07.945
That's the best they can do.

463
00:36:16.943 --> 00:36:20.992
They'd like to know if they can
take a few more pictures.

464
00:36:24.784 --> 00:36:28.244
- Yes.
- Is it really okay?

465
00:36:28.244 --> 00:36:30.057
Yes, it's fine.

466
00:36:30.744 --> 00:36:33.057
Okay.

467
00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:45.890
Wait, So So.

468
00:37:01.068 --> 00:37:04.349
<i>It takes four hours by car
to Mont Saint-Michel.</i>

469
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:06.782
<i>I'll be late if I take the bus or train.</i>

470
00:37:06.782 --> 00:37:08.465
<i>If I take a taxi...</i>

471
00:37:09.671 --> 00:37:12.936
<i>it'll cost between
600,000 won to 700,000 won.</i>

472
00:37:12.936 --> 00:37:14.606
<i>I don't have time.</i>

473
00:37:16.206 --> 00:37:17.874
<i>I don't have money, either.</i>

474
00:37:44.689 --> 00:37:49.809
Then, since we're all together by fate,
why don't we introduce ourselves?

475
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.169
Sir, why don't you go first
as the eldest?

476
00:37:54.914 --> 00:37:58.307
Sure, I can do that.
We should introduce ourselves.

477
00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:06.380
I'm the president of
a chicken and duck restaurant

478
00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.863
called Gapyeong Garden.
I'm Oh Gab Soo.

479
00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:14.081
You should clap, shouldn't you?

480
00:38:18.343 --> 00:38:20.744
And this is my wife.

481
00:38:20.744 --> 00:38:23.488
- I'm...
- Her name is Han Bok Ja.

482
00:38:23.488 --> 00:38:25.566
She's the vice president
of Gapyeong Garden.

483
00:38:25.566 --> 00:38:29.131
Our restaurant serves
native chicken and duck...

484
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:31.122
I already told them.

485
00:38:32.407 --> 00:38:35.358
I'm sorry for many reasons.

486
00:38:35.358 --> 00:38:37.651
Please visit our restaurant.

487
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.769
I currently work at Cooperate,
and my name is Jung Yeon Sung.

488
00:38:45.769 --> 00:38:48.434
- And she's...
- Cooperate?

489
00:38:48.434 --> 00:38:50.876
Isn't that a forwarding company?

490
00:38:51.657 --> 00:38:54.028
You know our field.

491
00:38:54.028 --> 00:38:57.648
You sent two containers to Africa
earlier in the year, right?

492
00:38:57.648 --> 00:39:01.200
I think we sent more than
100 containers...

493
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.293
- Pharmaceutical containers.
- Pharmaceuticals?

494
00:39:04.293 --> 00:39:06.157
World Pharmaceuticals.

495
00:39:06.588 --> 00:39:07.914
Yes.

496
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:14.970
I didn't expect to meet the best here.

497
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.767
We promise optimal service
with sincerity and courtesy.

498
00:39:19.767 --> 00:39:22.334
I'm the head chief of Cooperate,
Jung Yeon Sung.

499
00:39:22.334 --> 00:39:25.530
Please look favorably upon me.

500
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:29.305
Yes, I'm... one moment.

501
00:39:32.584 --> 00:39:34.372
I'm San Ma Ru.

502
00:39:36.532 --> 00:39:41.318
Wow, this man works at the top
pharmaceutical company in our country.

503
00:39:41.318 --> 00:39:45.805
World Pharmaceuticals. He works in
strategic planning. The best of the best.

504
00:39:45.805 --> 00:39:48.740
He's San Ma Ru.
Give him a round of applause.

505
00:39:50.778 --> 00:39:51.851
Call me.

506
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:54.586
<i>Chastity Belt King
of World Pharmaceuticals.</i>

507
00:39:57.278 --> 00:39:59.715
What the heck is this?

508
00:40:00.188 --> 00:40:05.104
A real-time report of social media posts
with our company tagged in them.

509
00:40:06.198 --> 00:40:08.367
I know that!

510
00:40:08.367 --> 00:40:11.459
It says World Pharmaceuticals
released the Chastity Belt King!

511
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:17.191
What's wrong with this bastard?
Why did he go there to do this?

512
00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:21.068
How did you teach your juniors?

513
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.865
- I apologize.
- Geez.

514
00:40:24.865 --> 00:40:26.825
How do I turn this off?

515
00:40:31.923 --> 00:40:36.110
Byung Sae, what's wrong with you?
How didn't you get my permission first?

516
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:39.597
Real-time social media reports
need to be gathered in real time.

517
00:40:39.597 --> 00:40:42.503
I told you to report to me first!

518
00:40:42.503 --> 00:40:45.197
I apologize. I won't do that again.

519
00:40:55.655 --> 00:40:58.369
<i>[World Pharmaceuticals
released the Chastity Belt King.]</i>

520
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.829
Hello, I'm Kim Kyung Jae.

521
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:11.925
I operate a small company.

522
00:41:11.925 --> 00:41:14.838
Are you the boss? You succeeded.

523
00:41:14.838 --> 00:41:16.860
Yes, well...

524
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.298
This is my girlfriend.

525
00:41:19.298 --> 00:41:21.794
I'm Han So Ran. I'm a company employee.

526
00:41:21.794 --> 00:41:24.785
- Your name is noisy too.
- Pardon?

527
00:41:24.785 --> 00:41:27.892
Your face is pretty, just like your name.

528
00:41:27.892 --> 00:41:30.508
You should visit our
restaurant some time.

529
00:41:30.508 --> 00:41:31.796
Okay.

530
00:41:41.347 --> 00:41:43.302
Yeah, it's me.

531
00:41:43.302 --> 00:41:47.387
- What are you doing right now?
- I booked a flight for tonight

532
00:41:47.387 --> 00:41:49.298
but something came up.

533
00:41:49.298 --> 00:41:54.166
That's your problem. Why do you always
get into trouble? Get yourself together!

534
00:41:54.166 --> 00:41:55.642
What's wrong?

535
00:41:58.836 --> 00:42:01.843
That's my question.
Is this the time to play?

536
00:42:01.843 --> 00:42:03.765
Who's playing?

537
00:42:03.765 --> 00:42:05.320
I said I'm going back.

538
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.883
Ma Ru, I'll make myself clear.

539
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.559
I love you. You're the only one.

540
00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:15.358
- I feel the same way.
- But...

541
00:42:15.358 --> 00:42:18.932
I can't be with someone...
who gave up on his future.

542
00:42:18.932 --> 00:42:20.669
What do you mean?

543
00:42:21.311 --> 00:42:24.669
It seems like you gave up on your future.

544
00:42:24.669 --> 00:42:28.287
Get yourself together! I'm hanging up!

545
00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:38.003
Damn it!

546
00:42:42.448 --> 00:42:47.307
Please eat lunch first,
and freely look around today.

547
00:42:47.307 --> 00:42:49.956
I need to stay here as his testifier.

548
00:42:49.956 --> 00:42:52.352
Of course, you should do that.

549
00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:54.903
We should consider his situation.

550
00:42:54.903 --> 00:42:57.894
That's strange. Why are you
considering his situation?

551
00:42:57.894 --> 00:43:00.622
It's the person who matters,
not our tour.

552
00:43:01.769 --> 00:43:03.515
It looks good on you.

553
00:43:04.064 --> 00:43:05.494
Thank you.

554
00:43:05.494 --> 00:43:08.798
Talk to me later, okay?

555
00:43:08.798 --> 00:43:13.517
And don't tell anyone
you're Korean. It's embarrassing.

556
00:43:14.626 --> 00:43:15.898
Okay.

557
00:43:16.472 --> 00:43:19.282
- Let's go down.
- Yes.

558
00:43:20.343 --> 00:43:24.206
- I'm sorry.
- Wait here for a moment.

559
00:43:32.287 --> 00:43:34.613
Watch your head. It's this way.

560
00:43:34.613 --> 00:43:36.624
Yes.

561
00:43:37.352 --> 00:43:39.307
Can we leave him up there alone?

562
00:43:39.307 --> 00:43:42.336
That's okay. I'll be back.

563
00:43:53.586 --> 00:43:56.751
- Wow, look at this.
- Wow.

564
00:43:56.751 --> 00:44:00.294
We'll continue our schedule
tomorrow morning.

565
00:44:00.294 --> 00:44:02.965
That's okay.
We should help each other out.

566
00:44:02.965 --> 00:44:06.952
You're right. The workers
in the area went on strike last year

567
00:44:06.952 --> 00:44:10.289
so the public transportation
into Mont Saint-Michel was cut off.

568
00:44:10.289 --> 00:44:15.858
But the people who earn money
from the visitors supported the strike.

569
00:44:15.858 --> 00:44:20.037
I realized that people understand
each other's situations in France.

570
00:44:20.037 --> 00:44:24.267
But they shouldn't have gone on strike.
The economy keeps the country alive

571
00:44:24.267 --> 00:44:26.720
and we need to country for us to live.

572
00:44:27.255 --> 00:44:29.970
- Yes.
- Strikes are the problem.

573
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:31.273
Am I wrong?

574
00:44:31.273 --> 00:44:33.418
I'll get going first.

575
00:44:33.418 --> 00:44:34.711
Wait...

576
00:44:35.963 --> 00:44:38.631
- Enjoy your food.
- How do I eat this? Try it.

577
00:44:40.872 --> 00:44:42.229
Try it.

578
00:44:50.289 --> 00:44:54.305
Aren't you hungry?
I didn't bring you anything.

579
00:44:54.305 --> 00:44:56.858
I don't have the right to eat.

580
00:44:56.858 --> 00:45:00.782
It's not that. I don't want to
make you go to the washroom.

581
00:45:04.336 --> 00:45:06.700
I don't know why I came to France.

582
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.898
I shouldn't have come all the way here.

583
00:45:09.568 --> 00:45:13.767
I feel that way too.
I don't know why I came here.

584
00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:15.090
Why?

585
00:45:17.066 --> 00:45:20.081
We all regret our past choices.

586
00:45:20.997 --> 00:45:22.628
I understand.

587
00:45:22.628 --> 00:45:27.189
All the choices we've made
were made when we were younger.

588
00:45:27.189 --> 00:45:31.809
Whether it was 10 years ago
or 10 minutes ago, we were younger.

589
00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:36.345
Is that why you put that on?
Were you too young to know better?

590
00:45:37.039 --> 00:45:39.825
We don't know everything
from just guessing.

591
00:45:39.825 --> 00:45:42.619
I make a lot of mistakes
from trying everything

592
00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:44.394
but I'm not embarrassed.

593
00:45:56.867 --> 00:45:59.885
- Is it the locksmith?
- No, they're tourists.

594
00:45:59.885 --> 00:46:02.115
<i>There are people up there.
Should we check it out?</i>

595
00:46:02.115 --> 00:46:04.352
- Are there lots of them?
- Yes.

596
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:07.088
- Men?
- Women.

597
00:46:07.088 --> 00:46:10.256
<i>- It's narrow.
- It is.</i>

598
00:46:10.256 --> 00:46:12.131
<i>It's fascinating.</i>

599
00:46:14.669 --> 00:46:17.521
- What's that?
- It's a chastity belt.

600
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:20.751
- What do we do?
- Go and ask him.

601
00:46:20.751 --> 00:46:23.758
- Is he Korean?
- Yeah, I think so.

602
00:46:24.827 --> 00:46:26.977
Are you Korean?

603
00:46:26.977 --> 00:46:28.880
I guess he's not.

604
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.887
- He must be a pervert.
- Take a picture.

605
00:46:33.276 --> 00:46:35.709
Wait, no, no.

606
00:46:37.195 --> 00:46:39.300
I'm sorry.

607
00:46:40.523 --> 00:46:42.311
Could you take a picture for me?

608
00:46:43.329 --> 00:46:45.193
- Sure.
- Yeah?

609
00:46:49.316 --> 00:46:50.642
Smile.

610
00:46:52.197 --> 00:46:56.014
I'll take it in one, two, kimchi!

611
00:47:01.773 --> 00:47:05.901
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

612
00:47:20.898 --> 00:47:22.459
Ma Ru.

613
00:47:29.965 --> 00:47:32.224
Gosh, I'm sorry.

614
00:47:36.526 --> 00:47:37.773
I'm sorry.

615
00:47:39.392 --> 00:47:41.260
I'm really sorry.

616
00:47:48.356 --> 00:47:51.646
- Is something the matter?
- It's nothing.

617
00:47:51.646 --> 00:47:53.990
Then what's wrong?

618
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.488
- Why are you being like that again?
- Again?

619
00:47:56.488 --> 00:47:59.642
You were too mad to talk last night.
All you did today was talk on the phone.

620
00:47:59.642 --> 00:48:03.006
- It's because of work.
- I thought nothing was wrong.

621
00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.414
- Let's stop.
- Stop what?

622
00:48:06.414 --> 00:48:10.939
Can't we walk around quietly?
Do you want to fight in France?

623
00:48:10.939 --> 00:48:12.822
What did I do?

624
00:48:14.285 --> 00:48:15.706
- Let's go.
- Where?

625
00:48:15.706 --> 00:48:17.347
I don't care. Are we going to stay here?

626
00:48:17.347 --> 00:48:20.715
- Can you stop acting that way?
- Let's stop.

627
00:48:20.715 --> 00:48:23.298
Let's try to stay in a good mood.

628
00:48:26.198 --> 00:48:28.593
- I'm going back.
- Where?

629
00:48:28.593 --> 00:48:30.787
The hotel. My head hurts.

630
00:48:32.858 --> 00:48:34.354
Fine, go back.

631
00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:24.439
Take it.

632
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.914
You worked overtime before
your vacation. Would you like a ride?

633
00:49:28.914 --> 00:49:32.468
- No, that's okay.
- I'll give you a ride.

634
00:49:51.994 --> 00:49:56.398
- Where do you live?
- You can drop me off at the station.

635
00:49:57.148 --> 00:49:59.715
We might have to go
all the way to your neighborhood.

636
00:50:00.227 --> 00:50:01.840
I have something to say.

637
00:50:02.823 --> 00:50:04.606
What is it?

638
00:50:10.401 --> 00:50:12.963
<i>[President]</i>

639
00:50:14.197 --> 00:50:16.662
Don't you have to answer
the president's call?

640
00:50:16.662 --> 00:50:19.956
- I can get yelled at tomorrow.
- What if it's important?

641
00:50:19.956 --> 00:50:23.019
Our time together right now
is more important.

642
00:50:30.184 --> 00:50:31.968
I'll tell you.

643
00:50:31.968 --> 00:50:36.813
I'm going to propose to you
when you get back from France

644
00:50:38.137 --> 00:50:39.481
Let's date.

645
00:50:42.733 --> 00:50:44.146
This is annoying.

646
00:51:02.543 --> 00:51:06.278
<i>So Ran, I'm sorry. I'll be right there...</i>

647
00:51:06.278 --> 00:51:08.610
<i>[Big Brother Kim Min Ki]</i>

648
00:51:12.662 --> 00:51:16.434
Yes, Big Brother.
Why are you calling at this hour?

649
00:51:17.765 --> 00:51:19.644
Yes.

650
00:51:19.644 --> 00:51:21.476
The investment...

651
00:51:24.256 --> 00:51:26.302
It might not work out?

652
00:51:54.523 --> 00:51:57.883
I can't go back to Seoul, can I?

653
00:51:57.883 --> 00:52:01.003
You missed it a long time ago.

654
00:52:01.003 --> 00:52:06.088
It's all getting messed up. I got into
problems since I left for this trip.

655
00:52:06.863 --> 00:52:10.211
I asked for a flight tomorrow evening.

656
00:52:11.231 --> 00:52:13.019
I don't know.

657
00:52:13.019 --> 00:52:18.019
What problem will I run into
tomorrow? Will I be able to leave?

658
00:52:18.019 --> 00:52:20.805
I might be fated to
run into these problems.

659
00:52:20.805 --> 00:52:24.590
Don't believe in fate. It doesn't exist.

660
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:28.363
What do you mean? I believe in fate.

661
00:52:28.363 --> 00:52:31.102
I think fate depends on our feelings.

662
00:52:31.102 --> 00:52:36.166
It's fate if we feel that way.
If we don't feel that way, it's not.

663
00:52:38.193 --> 00:52:41.662
I don't feel like this is fate at all.

664
00:52:41.662 --> 00:52:43.640
But here I am.

665
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:53.218
- The locksmith is here.
- Is he here?

666
00:52:53.218 --> 00:52:56.577
But I was called to meet the mayor,
so I have to go.

667
00:52:56.577 --> 00:53:00.131
- The mayor of this place?
- Yes.

668
00:53:00.131 --> 00:53:03.903
I don't know why he would
ask to speak to a guide.

669
00:53:05.767 --> 00:53:09.854
- Do you think it's bad?
- I don't think it's good.

670
00:53:09.854 --> 00:53:11.238
I'll be back.

671
00:53:42.838 --> 00:53:47.715
Hello. I'm a travel guide
at Eurobike Tour. I'm Yoon So So.

672
00:53:47.715 --> 00:53:51.077
It's a pleasure. I'm the mayor
of Mont Saint-Michel.

673
00:53:51.077 --> 00:53:55.695
Welcome to Mont Saint-Michel.
Can we talk for a moment?

674
00:54:14.305 --> 00:54:15.827
The photo?

675
00:54:15.827 --> 00:54:19.240
Yes, this tourist could have
damaged our cultural asset

676
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.938
so we kept this photo as evidence.

677
00:54:21.938 --> 00:54:23.200
I see.

678
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:28.095
We will use this photo however we want,
because it belongs to us.

679
00:54:28.095 --> 00:54:31.122
We will display this photo in an article.

680
00:54:31.122 --> 00:54:35.110
It will become a clear message
to other travelers.

681
00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.831
Why do you have to go this far?

682
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:41.606
We want even our
warning messages to have history.

683
00:54:41.606 --> 00:54:44.677
This is Mont Saint-Michel, after all.

684
00:54:44.677 --> 00:54:47.640
But this person might feel ashamed
for the rest of his life.

685
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:54.164
In return, we will open the stairs
to the angel's feet, just for you.

686
00:54:54.164 --> 00:54:58.539
If you know history, you'll understand.

687
00:54:58.539 --> 00:55:01.347
We've never opened the path
to the angel's feet to anyone.

688
00:55:01.347 --> 00:55:05.383
And we won't after this time.

689
00:55:05.383 --> 00:55:11.356
You could say this man opened
the path to the angel's feet.

690
00:56:05.798 --> 00:56:08.597
<i>Your fortune is the same.</i>

691
00:56:08.597 --> 00:56:10.887
It must be your fate.

692
00:56:10.887 --> 00:56:15.367
You will meet your eternal love
at an angel's feet.

693
00:56:30.805 --> 00:56:33.338
Where are the angel's feet?

694
00:56:33.338 --> 00:56:35.340
I wouldn't know.

695
00:56:35.963 --> 00:56:39.256
It's up there.
Saint Michael the Archangel.

696
00:56:51.684 --> 00:56:54.454
I don't know where that is.
How can I meet him?

697
00:56:54.454 --> 00:56:56.309
Don't worry.

698
00:56:56.945 --> 00:57:02.747
This person will open the path
to the angel's feet.

699
00:58:00.351 --> 00:58:01.818
Did you meet the mayor?

700
00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:07.300
Did you run here?

701
00:58:09.948 --> 00:58:11.414
Is something the matter?

702
00:58:19.302 --> 00:58:20.758
So So.

703
00:58:23.343 --> 00:58:24.885
Who are you?

704
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:27.323
Pardon?

705
00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:33.657
Who... are you?

706
00:58:49.188 --> 00:58:56.188
