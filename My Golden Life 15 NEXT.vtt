3
00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.208
What?

4
00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.348
Think about what you did today.

5
00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.988
You sweet thing, you saved my family.

6
00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.959
- Eun Seok. - No.

7
00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:26.183
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

8
00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:28.299
- What? - I'm...

9
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.468
not Eun Seok.

10
00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:38.709
Are you drunk after just one can?

11
00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:45.008
I am...

12
00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.319
not your sister.

13
00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.548
I'm Seo Ji An.

14
00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:55.258
What?

15
00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.328
The real Eun Seok...

16
00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:03.898
is Ji Soo, my twin sister.

17
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.398
What...

18
00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:13.478
What did you just say?

19
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.179
I am...

20
00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.719
not Choi Eun Seok.

21
00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.288
I am Seo Ji An.

22
00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.418
The real Choi Eun Seok...

23
00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:30.359
is my twin sister, Seo Ji Soo.

24
00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:32.929
Ji Soo...

25
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.299
is the real Eun Seok.

26
00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:42.469
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.709
What do you mean?

28
00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:51.579
My sister is not you, but Seo Ji Soo?

29
00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.819
If she's my sister,

30
00:01:55.978 --> 00:01:58.549
- why are you... - My mom...

31
00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.528
I think my mom lied that it was me.

32
00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.359
You think?

33
00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.259
You think she lied?

34
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.968
That implies that it's only a speculation.

35
00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:13.398
Don't you know that it implies uncertainty?

36
00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.498
I haven't checked,

37
00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:17.709
but I'm certain that I'm not your sister.

38
00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.609
The photo of Choi Eun Seok...

39
00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.808
who went missing 25 years ago.

40
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.049
It wasn't mine. It was Ji Soo's.

41
00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.088
You're claiming that you're not Eun Seok...

42
00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:35.289
just because of a photo when you were young?

43
00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.429
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?

44
00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.829
Can... Can this be possible?

45
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.968
My mom handles things precisely.

46
00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:47.539
She never makes errors.

47
00:02:48.498 --> 00:02:51.039
She wouldn't have brought you home...

48
00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.179
by only someone's word and without a DNA test.

49
00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.408
You must've been mistaken.

50
00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:59.049
When I asked General Manager Min,

51
00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.519
she said that she ran the DNA test.

52
00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:03.489
And what about that?

53
00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.519
At that time, I believed that.

54
00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:08.818
But no. Something has gone wrong.

55
00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.459
You saw the scar on my foot the other day, right?

56
00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.229
I got it right after my first birthday.

57
00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.028
Ask your mom if Eun Seok had a stitch mark...

58
00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:15.558
on her right foot.

59
00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.968
That's why I did all that today.

60
00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:24.338
It's not because I didn't want to disrupt the plan.

61
00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.378
Since I'm not Eun Seok,

62
00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.239
I couldn't let the chairman say that I am.

63
00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:31.248
Do you think what you're saying is possible?

64
00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.949
How can your mother switch her real daughter?

65
00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.688
Could she have done it in her right mind?

66
00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:43.028
Are your parents crazy?

67
00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:44.688
My dad isn't.

68
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.329
Why am I having this dispute with you?

69
00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.498
I can ask them myself.

70
00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:02.438
She's extraordinary.

71
00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.378
She's smart and quick-witted.

72
00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:07.919
How could she have found the shopper...

73
00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.688
and bring in a witness...

74
00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:11.549
in that short amount of time?

75
00:04:11.588 --> 00:04:14.389
We must have pressured her that much.

76
00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.229
You're not going to wait for Eun Seok?

77
00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.998
It's almost 1am.

78
00:04:22.998 --> 00:04:24.328
Yes, it is.

79
00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.938
What is Do Kyung doing?

80
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.909
Everything I said is true.

81
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:31.909
Please hear me out...

82
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.378
before you check with your parents.

83
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:36.409
Brother, please.

84
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.808
How dare you address me as your brother?

85
00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:41.419
You said you're not my sister.

86
00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.649
So you guys deceived my parents,

87
00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:47.518
and switched you with my real sister?

88
00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:48.719
Isn't that right?

89
00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:52.388
Did you really not know?

90
00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:54.198
Is it really true that you didn't know?

91
00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:55.828
If I knew what she did,

92
00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.368
why would I have done all that today?

93
00:04:57.368 --> 00:04:59.099
I stopped the announcement because I wasn't Eun Seok.

94
00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:03.839
When did you find out?

95
00:05:04.568 --> 00:05:07.539
No. Why didn't you tell me once you figured it out?

96
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.279
I was going to tell you after I finished...

97
00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:11.349
preparing the event by the 23rd.

98
00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.979
I couldn't harm the company.

99
00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:14.448
Because of the event?

100
00:05:15.018 --> 00:05:16.419
To not harm the company?

101
00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.549
It's an event for the 40th anniversary.

102
00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.219
I'm turning over the work to Yoon Ha Jung...

103
00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:22.258
so there wouldn't be a problem without me.

104
00:05:22.618 --> 00:05:24.789
That was the earliest date possible.

105
00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:26.328
Please let me tell them about it...

106
00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.099
after I finish the work by then.

107
00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:29.969
You want to tell them by yourself?

108
00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:31.128
Why?

109
00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:33.198
Have you gone mad too? Are you insane?

110
00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:34.638
Why would I let you?

111
00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.839
You wouldn't have known...

112
00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:37.839
if I hadn't confessed to you.

113
00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:41.508
Anyway, I now know too.

114
00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:43.779
But you want me...

115
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.719
to keep deceiving my parents now?

116
00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.789
Do you think I'd do such a thing?

117
00:05:50.388 --> 00:05:52.518
That's why I'm begging you.

118
00:05:53.188 --> 00:05:55.188
Even if your parents find out now,

119
00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:57.328
there's nothing they can possibly do to them.

120
00:05:58.128 --> 00:05:59.188
What?

121
00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:02.659
They have nothing.

122
00:06:05.628 --> 00:06:07.068
They could take away...

123
00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.399
my parents' money or their jobs.

124
00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:12.008
If they were to have any,

125
00:06:12.068 --> 00:06:13.679
I would let them face the consequences...

126
00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.279
for what they have done. However,

127
00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:18.109
they will only be humiliated.

128
00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:20.479
It was my mom who lied in the first place,

129
00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.679
and Dad couldn't stop me in the end.

130
00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.719
Do you know what I told him before coming here?

131
00:06:27.018 --> 00:06:29.289
I crushed and abandoned my dad.

132
00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:33.058
I can't let my dad go through...

133
00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:35.758
that humiliation again. I just can't.

134
00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:37.828
Are you...

135
00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.198
worrying only about your own parents?

136
00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:43.568
Also, your parents would be less angry...

137
00:06:43.568 --> 00:06:44.909
if they heard it from me.

138
00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.839
I'll tell them and ask for their forgiveness.

139
00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.739
So why should I do that for you?

140
00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:51.208
Please try to think in my shoes.

141
00:06:51.248 --> 00:06:53.179
I'm... I'm sincerely sorry.

142
00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.818
(CEO)

143
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:04.758
It's your mother.

144
00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:07.958
Take the call.

145
00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:15.399
It's me.

146
00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:18.008
Eun Seok, where are you?

147
00:07:18.068 --> 00:07:19.808
I'm waiting for you at home.

148
00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:27.349
Mom, this is Do Kyung.

149
00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:30.919
You should've called me if you were with her.

150
00:07:30.948 --> 00:07:32.419
What are you doing?

151
00:07:36.128 --> 00:07:38.828
She had to finish her work before going home.

152
00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:41.498
I didn't think she even had dinner,

153
00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:42.799
so I'm buying her dinner.

154
00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:44.628
Now?

155
00:07:45.368 --> 00:07:47.638
It'd be better if you didn't wait up for us.

156
00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:50.768
Okay. I see.

157
00:07:51.308 --> 00:07:53.208
Then I'll see her tomorrow morning.

158
00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:55.208
Bring her home safely.

159
00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.049
Yes. Goodnight.

160
00:08:01.248 --> 00:08:02.549
Thank you.

161
00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:04.589
Don't get the wrong idea.

162
00:08:05.248 --> 00:08:07.118
I'm not doing you a favor.

163
00:08:08.818 --> 00:08:11.258
They will meet Grandfather in Yangpyeong tomorrow.

164
00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:14.258
I did it because I didn't want to cause trouble now.

165
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:16.399
Okay.

166
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:24.609
Get home quietly.

167
00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:56.568
She's not my sister?

168
00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.938
Nice to meet you. I'm Choi Do Kyung.

169
00:09:01.978 --> 00:09:04.009
I'm your brother.

170
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.519
Address me as your brother when you're ready.

171
00:09:06.549 --> 00:09:09.218
I'll let you skip the title until then.

172
00:09:13.488 --> 00:09:15.318
No matter how expensive it is,

173
00:09:15.818 --> 00:09:18.058
I can buy that necklace again,

174
00:09:18.488 --> 00:09:20.098
but your life can't be replaced.

175
00:09:20.098 --> 00:09:21.259
Eun Seok.

176
00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:23.029
Go study abroad.

177
00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.338
You couldn't do it because you lived in that house.

178
00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:27.438
Again.

179
00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:30.208
You are Choi Do Kyung's sister. Who are you?

180
00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:32.509
Choi Eun Seok.

181
00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:06.029
I'll say you're sleeping, so don't go out.

182
00:11:06.838 --> 00:11:08.968
They must be determined to see you.

183
00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:12.639
What if they look for me?

184
00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:16.549
I should keep it a secret until the 23rd?

185
00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:20.318
Do you think you can keep avoiding them like this?

186
00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.889
Come out after they've gone to work.

187
00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:36.828
Good morning.

188
00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:39.098
Where is Eun Seok?

189
00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:42.468
She needed some sleep, so I told her to do so.

190
00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.438
She was too tired to even get up.

191
00:11:44.669 --> 00:11:47.509
She's only a human too. You did the right thing.

192
00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:49.549
I also told her to come late to the office.

193
00:11:50.348 --> 00:11:51.978
I will have to see her tomorrow then.

194
00:11:52.308 --> 00:11:54.019
Aren't you coming back today?

195
00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:55.549
Whenever Grandfather comes back to Korea,

196
00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:57.749
we spend a night with him. Don't you know that?

197
00:11:58.488 --> 00:12:00.619
Then is he leaving so soon?

198
00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.259
I thought he'd stay longer...

199
00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:04.488
since we found Eun Seok.

200
00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:55.379
(Do Kyung)

201
00:13:00.578 --> 00:13:01.848
Hello?

202
00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:04.049
Mother and Father left.

203
00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:07.159
I'm going to work now. Come in whenever you want.

204
00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.328
When I asked General Manager Min,

205
00:13:19.328 --> 00:13:21.238
she said that she ran the DNA test.

206
00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:26.379
Right, Ms. Min.

207
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:30.948
When you were testing Eun Seok's DNA,

208
00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:33.049
where did you get the samples?

209
00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:35.179
Why do you ask so suddenly?

210
00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:37.419
I don't know. I just became curious.

211
00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:40.558
Is there a secret you can't tell me?

212
00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:42.828
Did you do something illegal to obtain it?

213
00:13:42.828 --> 00:13:44.029
No.

214
00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:46.899
Someone sent us the two sisters' tooth brushes.

215
00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:48.999
Right. Tooth brushes?

216
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:50.728
What else?

217
00:13:50.828 --> 00:13:51.828
What?

218
00:13:51.828 --> 00:13:54.499
You said there were two, each from one sister.

219
00:13:54.738 --> 00:13:56.409
I don't know what happened after that.

220
00:13:56.968 --> 00:13:59.169
When your mother went to meet Mr. Seo's wife,

221
00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:01.578
she was certain when she came out.

222
00:14:02.238 --> 00:14:03.608
I see.

223
00:14:04.348 --> 00:14:05.549
I'll go to work.

224
00:14:05.909 --> 00:14:07.049
All right, sir.

225
00:14:48.818 --> 00:14:49.828
Tae Soo.

226
00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:51.858
Hey, Hae Ja.

227
00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.929
Seeing you in a suit brings back old memories.

228
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:59.468
Is everything going well?

229
00:14:59.769 --> 00:15:03.108
Yes. Where are you going this early?

230
00:15:03.438 --> 00:15:04.869
Well...

231
00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.509
I was going to see a friend.

232
00:15:07.909 --> 00:15:09.108
I was bored.

233
00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:12.249
Hae Ja.

234
00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:14.379
It's tough being alone, isn't it?

235
00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:19.049
Tae Soo.

236
00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:22.488
You shouldn't stay alone and just go to Vietnam.

237
00:15:23.058 --> 00:15:25.629
It's not good for a couple to stay apart too long.

238
00:15:26.328 --> 00:15:29.828
That's why I told you to follow Seok Doo before.

239
00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.068
Maybe I should have done that.

240
00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:35.999
Regardless of his age, a man is like a child.

241
00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:38.769
So when his ego is hurt, he goes off the track.

242
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.179
Wait a little.

243
00:15:43.549 --> 00:15:45.149
I have to catch the train. How about you?

244
00:15:45.808 --> 00:15:47.779
I have to catch the bus.

245
00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:49.348
I will get going then.

246
00:16:03.468 --> 00:16:05.869
Tae Soo's back looked so pitiful.

247
00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.598
It's because he's old.

248
00:16:07.598 --> 00:16:10.169
When you get old, your back bends, you know.

249
00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:13.679
No, he still looked great in a suit.

250
00:16:14.438 --> 00:16:17.409
Mi Jung, he might become successful again.

251
00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:19.078
Perhaps you shouldn't open the restaurant after all.

252
00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:22.419
Hae Ja, don't spoil my opening day.

253
00:16:23.848 --> 00:16:25.448
Never mind.

254
00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:27.419
There's nobody like Tae Soo, you see.

255
00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:28.988
He's so consistent.

256
00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:31.828
He's warm and sweet.

257
00:16:32.188 --> 00:16:35.558
Your husband has been earning well all along,

258
00:16:35.558 --> 00:16:37.068
so you look for other things to be jealous of.

259
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:39.429
A good-hearted man who is incompetent...

260
00:16:40.098 --> 00:16:41.299
is very frustrating.

261
00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:43.838
I used to feel that too.

262
00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:46.478
But money wasn't everything.

263
00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:49.409
Live like me for a year, and you won't say that.

264
00:16:50.049 --> 00:16:51.208
Unless you've been through what it's like...

265
00:16:51.208 --> 00:16:52.249
to live each day without any hope,

266
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:53.919
you wouldn't understand.

267
00:16:54.478 --> 00:16:57.249
What? Try living a year with a man...

268
00:16:57.619 --> 00:16:59.119
who gives nothing but money.

269
00:17:03.358 --> 00:17:04.788
Where did I put it?

270
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:11.129
My goodness. This cannot be happening.

271
00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.938
I think I saw the recipe note...

272
00:17:15.938 --> 00:17:17.938
when I was making a sandwich for Ji An.

273
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:19.978
Where did I put it?

274
00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.319
Ji Soo.

275
00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:35.188
Yes?

276
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:41.129
What is it? You told me to hurry off.

277
00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.069
Why did you...

278
00:17:44.069 --> 00:17:46.169
beg me not to go?

279
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:47.738
What?

280
00:17:48.198 --> 00:17:49.468
You said you wouldn't go...

281
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.639
if you were in my position.

282
00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:54.609
Would you really have not gone if you were me?

283
00:17:57.379 --> 00:17:58.849
Of course not.

284
00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:03.488
Right.

285
00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:05.819
If it happened to you,

286
00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:09.458
you wouldn't have left after you found out...

287
00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:13.198
that your real parents are very rich.

288
00:18:14.329 --> 00:18:15.859
That's why you must've told me not to go to them.

289
00:18:17.268 --> 00:18:19.498
Why are you bringing that up now?

290
00:18:20.298 --> 00:18:21.399
I am sorry.

291
00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:23.639
About what?

292
00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:26.639
I am sorry that I didn't listen to you.

293
00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:30.309
I am sorry.

294
00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:34.349
Is she regretting it now?

295
00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.688
Are they giving her a hard time?

296
00:18:39.788 --> 00:18:42.659
Come to think of it, she didn't look so well.

297
00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:49.629
- Ji Soo. - Yes?

298
00:18:51.028 --> 00:18:52.569
Are you going somewhere, Mom?

299
00:18:53.139 --> 00:18:56.339
Yes. I got a job.

300
00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:57.738
Today is my first day.

301
00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:59.478
You got a job?

302
00:18:59.879 --> 00:19:01.409
Then why didn't you tell me?

303
00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:05.079
Nothing. It's just my first time to work, right?

304
00:19:05.609 --> 00:19:08.579
You're already too weak. Why would you work?

305
00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:11.649
You get sick after helping Hae Ja make kimchi.

306
00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:13.619
That's why I just wanted to give it a try.

307
00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.788
Where is it? Where do you work?

308
00:19:16.089 --> 00:19:17.988
I will tell you later. I'll be late.

309
00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:21.329
I already cooked some food for dinner. Eat that.

310
00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:23.468
- See you later. - Okay.

311
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.399
Mom got a job,

312
00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:30.139
and Dad leaves early to do his business.

313
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.778
Is our family going to be rich again?

314
00:19:36.248 --> 00:19:37.379
Here.

315
00:19:37.379 --> 00:19:39.048
(Seo Tae Soo)

316
00:19:39.048 --> 00:19:41.748
I am Seo Tae Soo. I've visited before.

317
00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:46.159
I am the CEO of S.D. Chang Korea.

318
00:19:47.258 --> 00:19:49.958
- So what do you do? - Well,

319
00:19:50.089 --> 00:19:52.188
we are a merchandising company based in Vietnam.

320
00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.659
I've come to ask about the price...

321
00:19:55.758 --> 00:19:58.228
of the sanghwang mushroom extract here.

322
00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:18.919
I wanted to give it to her on our date.

323
00:20:23.788 --> 00:20:24.988
Did you call for me, sir?

324
00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:27.698
Please wrap this as a gift.

325
00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:41.639
Gosh, what should I do?

326
00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:50.248
"Congratulations on your wedding anniversary."

327
00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:51.319
Please put a ribbon on it.

328
00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:52.419
Sure.

329
00:20:52.748 --> 00:20:54.988
But I think it needs more flowers.

330
00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:56.629
Gosh.

331
00:20:57.258 --> 00:20:58.389
We meet again.

332
00:20:58.389 --> 00:21:00.399
Yes. It seems so.

333
00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:02.559
I didn't get to ask last time.

334
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:03.698
I believe your husband is well?

335
00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:07.399
- Yes. - Right.

336
00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:08.968
And your kids are well too?

337
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:14.478
And this. Please add this.

338
00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:16.008
You must really love your wife.

339
00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:18.309
Wife? Wife?

340
00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:20.819
Are you here to buy flowers too?

341
00:21:21.778 --> 00:21:22.819
No.

342
00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:25.218
I see. Goodbye then. Now, let's see...

343
00:21:33.829 --> 00:21:34.998
This is strange.

344
00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:37.329
Why is it more delicious today?

345
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:39.798
Your cooking skills must improve each day.

346
00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.869
Don't mention it.

347
00:21:41.899 --> 00:21:42.938
By the way,

348
00:21:42.938 --> 00:21:45.369
how did you come up with pumpkin hotteok?

349
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:47.978
The dough is more chewy and sweet.

350
00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:51.679
Some girl who studies food nutrition said...

351
00:21:52.048 --> 00:21:53.679
that she likes ugly pumpkins,

352
00:21:53.778 --> 00:21:55.948
despite her looks.

353
00:21:57.488 --> 00:22:01.419
They say opposite people attract each other.

354
00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:03.589
That's why a bright, beautiful college girl...

355
00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:06.958
is attracted to a blunt, boring man like you.

356
00:22:08.758 --> 00:22:09.768
My goodness.

357
00:22:11.768 --> 00:22:14.639
They say we're the Beauty and the Beast.

358
00:22:15.998 --> 00:22:17.008
Who said that?

359
00:22:17.109 --> 00:22:18.438
Who do you think?

360
00:22:22.978 --> 00:22:25.409
When you are on your way to class, don't drop by.

361
00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:27.079
Why not?

362
00:22:27.948 --> 00:22:30.248
The rumor will spread, and I feel sorry for that.

363
00:22:31.718 --> 00:22:32.958
Go now. Hurry.

364
00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:40.298
He was so shy.

365
00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:43.528
And he's changed so much.

366
00:22:45.028 --> 00:22:46.298
I lived my whole life...

367
00:22:47.498 --> 00:22:49.968
feeling like something was stuck in my chest...

368
00:22:51.738 --> 00:22:52.879
since I felt sorry to him.

369
00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:03.548
I am sorry. I'm late.

370
00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.788
You're here.

371
00:23:05.248 --> 00:23:06.458
(Happy Wedding Anniversary)

372
00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:08.389
"Happy Wedding Anniversary"?

373
00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.758
But you're not married, right?

374
00:23:14.629 --> 00:23:16.228
Didn't you buy too much?

375
00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:19.198
Our breads are freshly baked every day.

376
00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:21.599
It's better if you finish it within the day.

377
00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:24.508
But you just came in.

378
00:23:24.508 --> 00:23:26.639
How can you say that you made them today?

379
00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:27.738
No.

380
00:23:27.738 --> 00:23:29.309
He made everything early this morning.

381
00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:30.948
He just went out to get some flowers.

382
00:23:31.048 --> 00:23:34.319
We make all of our bread every day ourselves.

383
00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:37.389
It's warm.

384
00:23:37.589 --> 00:23:38.849
Please enjoy.

385
00:23:39.048 --> 00:23:40.258
Hello.

386
00:23:43.629 --> 00:23:46.458
Mr. Kang, have you seen my recipe note?

387
00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:47.958
No, I haven't seen it.

388
00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:51.569
If it's not here, where could it be?

389
00:23:55.498 --> 00:23:56.508
Looking at the sales,

390
00:23:56.508 --> 00:23:58.268
I think it'd be too tough for you alone.

391
00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:00.738
I can still manage.

392
00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:10.319
You're here.

393
00:24:12.488 --> 00:24:13.889
Hello.

394
00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:19.389
- Hello, ma'am. - Welcome.

395
00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:20.899
I'll take that.

396
00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:27.498
Here's the invoice.

397
00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:31.768
But my boss wants cash instead of bank transfer.

398
00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:33.079
Cash?

399
00:24:33.309 --> 00:24:34.778
Why doesn't he want us to send it to his account?

400
00:24:36.079 --> 00:24:38.048
I don't know why,

401
00:24:38.048 --> 00:24:40.119
but he says that he needs cash.

402
00:24:40.778 --> 00:24:42.889
But you can pay anytime you want.

403
00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:45.688
And he's giving you a 10 percent discount.

404
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:49.389
He's a nice man, isn't he?

405
00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.698
I'll get going now, ma'am.

406
00:24:53.758 --> 00:24:54.758
Okay.

407
00:24:55.099 --> 00:24:56.099
Bye.

408
00:24:56.798 --> 00:24:59.298
Okay, bye.

409
00:24:59.569 --> 00:25:00.599
Right.

410
00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:03.109
Ji Soo.

411
00:25:03.738 --> 00:25:05.309
Isn't this yours?

412
00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:06.938
What? My goodness.

413
00:25:07.609 --> 00:25:09.448
Why... Why is this here?

414
00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.208
When I asked for additional orders,

415
00:25:11.208 --> 00:25:13.948
it was in the bread bag. I forgot about it.

416
00:25:13.978 --> 00:25:14.978
I am sorry.

417
00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:16.188
It's all right.

418
00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:18.748
This is my treasure number two.

419
00:25:18.889 --> 00:25:21.389
And I was so upset thinking that I'd lost it.

420
00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:23.859
What's your treasure number one then?

421
00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:25.629
My family.

422
00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:29.829
I'll get going now. Bye.

423
00:25:35.498 --> 00:25:37.038
That frame is lovely.

424
00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:42.238
Ma'am, where did you buy that frame?

425
00:25:42.778 --> 00:25:44.478
You can...

426
00:25:44.649 --> 00:25:45.879
go here for the frames.

427
00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:47.518
Wait. Gosh.

428
00:25:47.718 --> 00:25:50.188
I... I love this makeup table.

429
00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:53.518
Would a makeup table be better than a frame?

430
00:25:53.988 --> 00:25:57.329
Well, it's a wedding gift for your brother.

431
00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.899
The makeup table is only for your sister-in-law.

432
00:25:59.998 --> 00:26:01.859
They can use it together.

433
00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:05.798
What? Does this have to be assembled too?

434
00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:08.968
All of these here need to be assembled.

435
00:26:10.038 --> 00:26:12.639
But I am terrible at those things.

436
00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:16.879
Shall I ask our manager to help you?

437
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:18.778
No. Never.

438
00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:20.718
You would never have to do that.

439
00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:22.849
There is an assembly instruction right here.

440
00:26:22.849 --> 00:26:24.448
I think I can handle it.

441
00:26:24.619 --> 00:26:27.059
Gosh. This looks very easy.

442
00:26:31.688 --> 00:26:33.228
Please let me tell them about it.

443
00:26:33.899 --> 00:26:35.859
It's an event for the 40th anniversary.

444
00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:37.028
I'm turning over the work to Yoon Ha Jung...

445
00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:38.899
so there wouldn't be a problem without me.

446
00:26:39.329 --> 00:26:41.198
Please let me tell them after the event.

447
00:26:41.268 --> 00:26:42.698
Please let me tell them about it.

448
00:26:47.538 --> 00:26:49.909
I know her as Gustav Mahler's wife.

449
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:51.208
Although he remarried several times...

450
00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:53.419
after she passed away.

451
00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:56.149
You truly are my daughter.

452
00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:03.389
This is a big problem.

453
00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:06.698
Did you make the second profile file...

454
00:27:06.698 --> 00:27:07.798
for the customer model?

455
00:27:07.929 --> 00:27:09.159
No. Not yet.

456
00:27:09.498 --> 00:27:10.869
Please hurry up and make it.

457
00:27:10.968 --> 00:27:13.369
We have to get votes from people.

458
00:27:13.369 --> 00:27:14.569
Ji An.

459
00:27:14.738 --> 00:27:17.409
The vice president wants an update.

460
00:27:17.468 --> 00:27:19.139
He's coming in half an hour.

461
00:27:19.169 --> 00:27:21.139
An update?

462
00:27:21.208 --> 00:27:22.409
Mr. Lee,

463
00:27:22.478 --> 00:27:25.048
why is he asking for an update?

464
00:27:25.048 --> 00:27:26.849
Doesn't it mean...

465
00:27:26.849 --> 00:27:28.448
that he can't trust us?

466
00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:30.419
That's impossible.

467
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:33.458
Doesn't he trust Ji An the most?

468
00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:41.599
60 percent of the vendors have already signed.

469
00:27:41.859 --> 00:27:43.169
We chose 50 contestants...

470
00:27:43.169 --> 00:27:45.429
for the customer fashion show,

471
00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:47.498
and we will soon hold the final evaluation.

472
00:27:47.569 --> 00:27:49.968
We are hiring singers for the concert.

473
00:27:50.238 --> 00:27:52.208
We thought we should narrow down the topic...

474
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.379
to fairytale characters...

475
00:27:53.379 --> 00:27:55.038
for the hand-printing design contest.

476
00:27:55.038 --> 00:27:56.038
So we are currently...

477
00:27:56.038 --> 00:27:57.379
discussing it with the design team.

478
00:27:58.048 --> 00:28:00.018
Among the undecided topics,

479
00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:02.048
which are important?

480
00:28:05.748 --> 00:28:07.988
- What is this? - Didn't you get the call?

481
00:28:08.518 --> 00:28:10.488
We are going to include behind-the-scene clips...

482
00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:11.589
to the promotion video.

483
00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:14.528
I am sorry. I forgot to inform you.

484
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:16.869
You may film this.

485
00:28:19.569 --> 00:28:22.238
You can tell me what is undecided yet.

486
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:25.708
Today, we are having a meeting with...

487
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:27.079
the vendors related to the Violet Scent,

488
00:28:27.079 --> 00:28:29.448
and then we'll decide on the items and names.

489
00:28:29.879 --> 00:28:31.448
We will change the event venue...

490
00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:34.248
and are contacting three natural dyeing vendors.

491
00:28:34.278 --> 00:28:37.048
We are still searching for Mr. Jung Kang Soo.

492
00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:39.718
Isn't the event supposed to be held at our park?

493
00:28:39.988 --> 00:28:41.819
That was the original plan,

494
00:28:41.819 --> 00:28:43.788
but I thought it would be too cold at night.

495
00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:46.559
I think it would be better if it were held indoors.

496
00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.629
What do you think, Ms. Yoon?

497
00:28:50.198 --> 00:28:51.698
If the venue changes,

498
00:28:51.768 --> 00:28:53.468
I assume the layout will change a lot too.

499
00:28:54.968 --> 00:28:57.438
Ms. Seo is in charge of that.

500
00:28:58.208 --> 00:29:00.278
Aren't you supposed to be in charge together?

501
00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:02.238
If you are co-directing it,

502
00:29:02.238 --> 00:29:03.809
you should be able to make decisions...

503
00:29:04.079 --> 00:29:06.518
in case of Ms. Seo's absence.

504
00:29:07.548 --> 00:29:09.919
I am trying hard to catch up with her.

505
00:29:12.188 --> 00:29:13.819
I guess the budget will change as well.

506
00:29:14.488 --> 00:29:17.859
Yes. I am coming up with the revised budget plan.

507
00:29:23.899 --> 00:29:25.599
Ms. Seo, bring the revised budget plan...

508
00:29:25.698 --> 00:29:27.998
and the list of natural dyeing vendors...

509
00:29:28.069 --> 00:29:29.238
to my office.

510
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:30.968
I will do that.

511
00:29:38.248 --> 00:29:40.179
It seems like you can't leave the project...

512
00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:42.379
just like you said.

513
00:29:44.288 --> 00:29:46.488
But that doesn't mean we can't hold the event.

514
00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:50.429
I thought about the favor you asked.

515
00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:53.129
I understand your situation,

516
00:29:53.599 --> 00:29:55.298
and I feel bad for you too.

517
00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:58.798
You were fooled by your parents too.

518
00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:00.599
However,

519
00:30:01.369 --> 00:30:03.569
I can't promise you that I'll do as you asked.

520
00:30:06.508 --> 00:30:08.309
This is not such a simple problem.

521
00:30:09.038 --> 00:30:10.879
You were already introduced at the gallery.

522
00:30:11.649 --> 00:30:13.048
They weren't just nobodies.

523
00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:14.379
They were people whom...

524
00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.349
Mother and Grandfather consider most important.

525
00:30:19.248 --> 00:30:21.288
You want to delay telling them the truth for work?

526
00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:24.359
It's not something I can decide alone.

527
00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:27.728
This is something big even for my family.

528
00:30:29.258 --> 00:30:30.369
So...

529
00:30:30.768 --> 00:30:32.968
don't expect me to do you a favor.

530
00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:35.399
I'll make my decision...

531
00:30:35.968 --> 00:30:37.139
and consider from...

532
00:30:37.768 --> 00:30:40.109
only my parents' and my family's point of view.

533
00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:45.079
Even if you tell the truth and apologize first,

534
00:30:46.048 --> 00:30:47.448
your parents won't be forgiven.

535
00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:51.218
You dared to deceive our entire family.

536
00:30:51.448 --> 00:30:52.889
But now, you don't want them to be humiliated?

537
00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:55.288
They actually deserve more than that.

538
00:30:57.089 --> 00:30:58.329
What your parents did...

539
00:30:59.028 --> 00:31:00.228
is a crime.

540
00:31:01.429 --> 00:31:02.458
I know.

541
00:31:04.768 --> 00:31:07.099
I'm not asking you to forgive my parents.

542
00:31:08.298 --> 00:31:09.298
I know...

543
00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:11.238
that I can't ask for forgiveness.

544
00:31:12.569 --> 00:31:14.278
I'll tell them to turn themselves in.

545
00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:18.948
Then why would you tell my parents yourself?

546
00:31:19.248 --> 00:31:20.478
You didn't know about it.

547
00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:23.288
I didn't want to ruin the 40th anniversary too.

548
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:25.419
If I did,

549
00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:29.059
I'd be so sorry and ashamed.

550
00:31:30.988 --> 00:31:34.228
I can prepare everything thoroughly by the 23rd.

551
00:31:34.728 --> 00:31:36.829
Then there'd be no big problem for the event.

552
00:31:38.268 --> 00:31:40.198
I just wish your parents...

553
00:31:41.798 --> 00:31:44.569
wouldn't be so mad by considering my efforts.

554
00:31:46.478 --> 00:31:47.478
The reason why...

555
00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:50.048
my mom and dad...

556
00:31:51.048 --> 00:31:52.708
had to make such a decision.

557
00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:55.849
It's all because of me. If I told them about it,

558
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:58.419
maybe they might trample on my parents a bit less.

559
00:31:58.988 --> 00:32:00.218
That's why.

560
00:32:01.288 --> 00:32:02.288
Do you...

561
00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:05.089
want to defend your parents...

562
00:32:06.198 --> 00:32:07.359
after they did all this to you?

563
00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:08.929
You also know...

564
00:32:09.998 --> 00:32:12.268
what Mother and Father will do to my parents.

565
00:32:12.268 --> 00:32:14.399
Don't call my parents Mother and Father.

566
00:32:16.508 --> 00:32:17.839
I'm sorry.

567
00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:23.208
I've told you what I had to say, so get out.

568
00:32:26.248 --> 00:32:27.619
Yes, sir.

569
00:32:32.188 --> 00:32:33.188
However,

570
00:32:34.089 --> 00:32:35.819
if you can't wait until the 23th,

571
00:32:36.458 --> 00:32:38.389
at least let me tell the truth myself.

572
00:32:38.829 --> 00:32:40.298
That's the least I ask of you.

573
00:32:56.778 --> 00:32:58.278
I brought you the vegetables and meat.

574
00:32:58.278 --> 00:33:00.319
- Put them in the kitchen. - Okay.

575
00:33:02.018 --> 00:33:04.218
The meat and vegetables look so fresh.

576
00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:08.458
We get fresh ingredients delivered every morning.

577
00:33:09.859 --> 00:33:11.359
She does sound like the owner already.

578
00:33:12.998 --> 00:33:14.498
Thank you. Goodbye.

579
00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:18.968
Thank you. Goodbye.

580
00:33:20.569 --> 00:33:22.909
Hello. Please have a seat here.

581
00:33:23.609 --> 00:33:24.809
- Clean up the table. - Gosh.

582
00:33:25.409 --> 00:33:27.309
They say office changes manners.

583
00:33:28.309 --> 00:33:29.809
Mi Jung looks good.

584
00:33:29.809 --> 00:33:31.879
Ma'am, we're running out of ingredients.

585
00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:33.079
- What should we do? - Gosh.

586
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:35.119
- I'll place an order. - Okay. Thank you.

587
00:33:39.089 --> 00:33:40.458
Okay, bye.

588
00:33:44.258 --> 00:33:45.889
You said you'd make just a short phone call.

589
00:33:47.028 --> 00:33:49.528
This is good when hot, but it's cold now.

590
00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:51.228
I was looking for our wedding hall.

591
00:33:52.369 --> 00:33:53.768
Our wedding hall?

592
00:33:54.468 --> 00:33:57.639
I saw this place the other day and really liked it.

593
00:33:57.869 --> 00:33:59.538
It's called a "Picnic Wedding".

594
00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:01.438
It's an outdoor wedding hall in a park.

595
00:34:01.879 --> 00:34:04.179
But why is it called "Picnic Wedding"?

596
00:34:05.649 --> 00:34:07.749
You go on a picnic with your friends and family...

597
00:34:07.749 --> 00:34:09.619
and have a wedding ceremony there.

598
00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.548
That sounds wonderful.

599
00:34:12.588 --> 00:34:13.718
I know, right?

600
00:34:14.959 --> 00:34:17.289
But the place is fully reserved until December...

601
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.588
except for one day.

602
00:34:19.898 --> 00:34:21.599
When is it?

603
00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:23.298
A week later.

604
00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:24.999
Someone just cancelled their reservation.

605
00:34:24.999 --> 00:34:26.298
A week later?

606
00:34:27.269 --> 00:34:29.139
Gosh, that's disappointing.

607
00:34:30.838 --> 00:34:33.979
But I just made a provisional contract.

608
00:34:34.378 --> 00:34:35.378
What?

609
00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.948
My parents aren't coming anyway.

610
00:34:37.948 --> 00:34:40.048
We'll see them in Canada on our honeymoon.

611
00:34:40.718 --> 00:34:42.548
If your parents are okay with it, it'll be fine.

612
00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:45.689
And it's free.

613
00:34:46.858 --> 00:34:50.128
Do you want to get married in a week since it's free?

614
00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.389
No way.

615
00:34:51.729 --> 00:34:53.128
I only said, "And".

616
00:34:54.758 --> 00:34:57.528
You said you don't want to live too shabby.

617
00:34:58.168 --> 00:34:59.539
You said you don't want a wedding like that.

618
00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:02.139
Now, I know that I'm more shabby...

619
00:35:02.369 --> 00:35:05.409
without Seo Ji Tae than living in a shabby house.

620
00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:07.838
You know that I'm cool.

621
00:35:09.909 --> 00:35:10.948
You're being so cool...

622
00:35:11.648 --> 00:35:12.679
that it breaks my heart.

623
00:35:14.218 --> 00:35:16.689
It's your turn. You had something to tell me.

624
00:35:20.619 --> 00:35:23.088
You met my sister the other day.

625
00:35:24.988 --> 00:35:27.059
In fact, she's not my biological sister.

626
00:35:28.198 --> 00:35:29.869
She's not your biological sister?

627
00:35:30.729 --> 00:35:33.568
Yes. So she doesn't live with us now.

628
00:35:34.338 --> 00:35:36.369
She moved in to her biological parents' house.

629
00:35:37.209 --> 00:35:38.209
So?

630
00:35:38.668 --> 00:35:41.579
This is all I can tell you now.

631
00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:44.579
If you want to know more...

632
00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:46.378
Does it have something to do with our marriage?

633
00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:48.249
With our marriage?

634
00:35:49.718 --> 00:35:51.389
No, not really.

635
00:35:52.889 --> 00:35:54.119
Then I'm fine with it.

636
00:35:54.959 --> 00:35:56.258
I don't want to force you...

637
00:35:56.258 --> 00:35:58.329
to tell me something you don't want to say.

638
00:35:59.289 --> 00:36:02.459
I don't think couples are one in body and soul.

639
00:36:07.668 --> 00:36:10.809
Then please make a list of these, and send it to me.

640
00:36:10.809 --> 00:36:12.778
Okay. I'll send it to you immediately.

641
00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:14.309
I should get going then.

642
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:21.448
Hello?

643
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.988
Hey, Seo Ji An.

644
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.749
Myung Shin.

645
00:36:32.729 --> 00:36:34.159
What happened to you?

646
00:36:34.528 --> 00:36:36.628
Why did you change your number without telling me?

647
00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:38.599
I'm sorry.

648
00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:40.499
Tell me why you did that first.

649
00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:44.809
I'd understand it...

650
00:36:44.809 --> 00:36:46.309
if you went off the grid for having a hard time.

651
00:36:46.809 --> 00:36:48.439
But you got a permanent position at Haesung.

652
00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:51.278
I was shocked when I heard it from Ha Jung.

653
00:36:58.519 --> 00:36:59.718
Ji An.

654
00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:10.229
How could that be?

655
00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.398
I don't even know what to say.

656
00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.838
If I were you, I would've ran off.

657
00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:19.909
How can you even stay at that house now?

658
00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:23.579
I'm actually terrified to death.

659
00:37:24.878 --> 00:37:27.948
Then you should just tell your parents.

660
00:37:28.918 --> 00:37:30.918
It's not something you did.

661
00:37:31.318 --> 00:37:34.619
You can't deal with that family alone.

662
00:37:36.628 --> 00:37:37.988
Because it was for me.

663
00:37:39.128 --> 00:37:40.128
What?

664
00:37:40.128 --> 00:37:41.459
My mom...

665
00:37:42.358 --> 00:37:44.769
lived in my dad's shadow as a housewife.

666
00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:47.639
She's so timid and tenderhearted.

667
00:37:48.738 --> 00:37:51.909
I know. She's like a little girl.

668
00:37:52.709 --> 00:37:54.579
But why did she do that?

669
00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:58.809
How could she even do such a thing? Why?

670
00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:02.519
And my dad...

671
00:38:06.988 --> 00:38:09.358
He came to see me and stop me.

672
00:38:09.959 --> 00:38:11.128
Ji An.

673
00:38:12.028 --> 00:38:14.398
You shouldn't go there.

674
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:15.829
You...

675
00:38:17.568 --> 00:38:19.668
You don't want to go, right?

676
00:38:20.499 --> 00:38:21.769
I want to go.

677
00:38:22.668 --> 00:38:24.238
But I told Dad...

678
00:38:25.769 --> 00:38:27.079
that I wanted to go.

679
00:38:29.008 --> 00:38:30.878
I even blamed him for stopping me.

680
00:38:32.008 --> 00:38:35.349
Dad thought that I just said that...

681
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:38.648
because I was having a hard time to find a job.

682
00:38:39.559 --> 00:38:41.459
It's not because you must,

683
00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:44.128
but... But you want to go?

684
00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:45.929
Why?

685
00:38:47.128 --> 00:38:48.258
Why?

686
00:38:48.398 --> 00:38:50.068
You... You want to go?

687
00:38:50.729 --> 00:38:52.798
I know you suffered much,

688
00:38:53.738 --> 00:38:56.468
but do you really want to leave so easily like this?

689
00:38:56.639 --> 00:38:57.769
Yes.

690
00:38:58.668 --> 00:38:59.878
I want to go.

691
00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:01.738
I suffered so much.

692
00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:05.309
I wanted to kill myself. There's nothing I can do.

693
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:06.519
Living like this...

694
00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.119
is making me sick.

695
00:39:09.278 --> 00:39:11.849
Why can't I be a daughter of a rich family?

696
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.358
I mean,

697
00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:14.918
why did you...

698
00:39:15.258 --> 00:39:16.858
even pick me up in the first place?

699
00:39:19.358 --> 00:39:20.858
I criticized my dad.

700
00:39:23.198 --> 00:39:24.898
As if it was all his fault.

701
00:39:25.769 --> 00:39:28.838
Like I was leaving because of him.

702
00:39:30.008 --> 00:39:31.809
I made him speechless.

703
00:39:34.108 --> 00:39:35.209
Your father...

704
00:39:36.378 --> 00:39:38.309
must've been really shocked.

705
00:39:42.619 --> 00:39:44.519
Do you know how I've been doing with my new family?

706
00:39:46.988 --> 00:39:48.659
I was overwhelmed.

707
00:39:49.258 --> 00:39:50.659
I was intimidated and dispirited.

708
00:39:51.258 --> 00:39:52.459
I just did as I was told.

709
00:39:54.229 --> 00:39:56.968
I struggled to be a person fit for a rich family.

710
00:39:58.599 --> 00:39:59.898
Without knowing that I don't belong to them.

711
00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.209
But it's not your fault.

712
00:40:07.639 --> 00:40:09.709
When I failed to get a job in a large firm,

713
00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:13.979
I pretended to be the most unhappy girl in the world.

714
00:40:15.548 --> 00:40:17.689
Maybe that's why Mom did such a thing.

715
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:20.218
But still, Ji An,

716
00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:23.059
blaming this on yourself...

717
00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:24.628
won't solve anything.

718
00:40:26.929 --> 00:40:28.059
It's my fault.

719
00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:30.168
If I hadn't said...

720
00:40:31.769 --> 00:40:34.369
that I wanted to live with them so quickly,

721
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.508
it wouldn't have come this far.

722
00:40:38.168 --> 00:40:40.439
I bet my mom said it on an impulse.

723
00:40:40.539 --> 00:40:43.909
She knew I'd want to go, so she said it.

724
00:40:43.909 --> 00:40:47.318
Defending your mom won't change anything.

725
00:40:47.318 --> 00:40:48.679
I'm not defending her.

726
00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:51.119
I can't defend her from those people.

727
00:40:54.389 --> 00:40:55.858
I'm talking about me.

728
00:40:57.858 --> 00:40:59.898
I feel so ashamed and regretful.

729
00:41:01.929 --> 00:41:03.568
I'm talking about me.

730
00:41:04.499 --> 00:41:05.668
To tell the truth,

731
00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:09.039
I wanted to go as soon as I found out.

732
00:41:11.568 --> 00:41:12.909
Right away?

733
00:41:13.479 --> 00:41:14.579
When Mom told me...

734
00:41:15.108 --> 00:41:17.378
that the owners of Haesung were my real parents,

735
00:41:18.378 --> 00:41:19.679
as soon as I heard it,

736
00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:22.988
I wanted to move in.

737
00:41:24.249 --> 00:41:26.119
To meet my real family?

738
00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:27.189
No.

739
00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:29.789
Their money.

740
00:41:30.929 --> 00:41:32.229
Their affluence.

741
00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:35.258
That's what I wanted.

742
00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:39.698
That's why it's my fault...

743
00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:41.668
and I deserve to suffer first.

744
00:41:43.238 --> 00:41:45.668
I've experienced them first-hand.

745
00:41:45.909 --> 00:41:48.439
I know what those people are like,

746
00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.209
so I can prepare myself.

747
00:41:55.448 --> 00:41:57.648
Mom and Dad will never survive.

748
00:41:59.488 --> 00:42:01.619
They'll never imagine...

749
00:42:02.459 --> 00:42:04.988
what'll happen and how they'll end up.

750
00:42:11.468 --> 00:42:13.668
I need to talk to the Haesung people...

751
00:42:13.668 --> 00:42:15.039
and beg for forgiveness...

752
00:42:16.369 --> 00:42:18.968
so they'll be less angry with my parents.

753
00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:24.909
How scary are they?

754
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:27.448
No one can imagine...

755
00:42:29.318 --> 00:42:30.389
how terrifying they are.

756
00:42:36.729 --> 00:42:38.929
(Cork)

757
00:42:41.698 --> 00:42:45.869
Wouldn't it be fun to make a triangular coffee table?

758
00:42:45.869 --> 00:42:48.639
Is your imagination running wild again?

759
00:42:52.439 --> 00:42:53.439
What is it?

760
00:42:53.878 --> 00:42:55.338
A local bakery...

761
00:42:55.338 --> 00:42:56.679
ordered a makeup table.

762
00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:57.778
A bakery?

763
00:42:57.979 --> 00:42:59.048
Yes.

764
00:43:01.448 --> 00:43:03.548
(Seo Ji Soo)

765
00:43:04.318 --> 00:43:05.648
It's nearby.

766
00:43:05.648 --> 00:43:07.789
Drop it off on the way to the factory...

767
00:43:07.789 --> 00:43:09.119
to save the shipping fee.

768
00:43:10.358 --> 00:43:11.429
I will.

769
00:43:12.329 --> 00:43:14.758
You'll actually drop it off?

770
00:43:14.898 --> 00:43:16.628
We're neighbors.

771
00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:19.698
And I'm in debt.

772
00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:25.668
Hello.

773
00:43:25.668 --> 00:43:27.378
I'm from Mamdaero.

774
00:43:28.338 --> 00:43:29.948
What did you bring?

775
00:43:30.278 --> 00:43:33.519
You ordered a DIY makeup table.

776
00:43:37.318 --> 00:43:39.488
I made the order not so long ago.

777
00:43:39.488 --> 00:43:41.289
Why is it here already?

778
00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:43.159
Doesn't it take a few days?

779
00:43:43.159 --> 00:43:45.488
We're neighbors, so I brought it over...

780
00:43:45.488 --> 00:43:47.698
to save time and shipping fees.

781
00:43:48.898 --> 00:43:50.269
I see.

782
00:43:51.769 --> 00:43:53.838
Thanks so much,

783
00:43:53.838 --> 00:43:55.968
but I didn't ask for Mr. Baker's permission...

784
00:43:55.968 --> 00:43:59.039
to assemble this here yet.

785
00:43:59.608 --> 00:44:01.539
Isn't it for your boss?

786
00:44:01.709 --> 00:44:03.479
No, it's not.

787
00:44:03.479 --> 00:44:04.979
It's a surprise wedding gift...

788
00:44:04.979 --> 00:44:06.579
for my brother.

789
00:44:06.679 --> 00:44:08.548
I'll get found out if I make it at home.

790
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:12.289
Shall I take it back then?

791
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:13.358
- Well... - No.

792
00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:15.918
Leave it here.

793
00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:17.758
Mr. Baker.

794
00:44:18.429 --> 00:44:20.798
It's a surprise. It'll be fun.

795
00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.999
Just don't do it during working hours.

796
00:44:22.999 --> 00:44:25.668
Really? Thank you.

797
00:44:26.168 --> 00:44:27.398
If it's your first time,

798
00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.869
this will be tough to make.

799
00:44:28.939 --> 00:44:29.939
Shall I do it for you?

800
00:44:29.939 --> 00:44:32.008
No, I'm good at this.

801
00:44:32.008 --> 00:44:33.409
I'm very experienced.

802
00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:35.778
Are you? Goodbye then.

803
00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:38.309
I'll be leaving.

804
00:44:40.448 --> 00:44:41.878
Thank you.

805
00:44:43.718 --> 00:44:47.189
The kid grew up well.

806
00:44:51.258 --> 00:44:53.829
Thank you. Goodbye.

807
00:44:54.499 --> 00:44:55.929
Look at you.

808
00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:58.499
You were always saying...

809
00:44:58.499 --> 00:45:01.568
"Hello, good morning" to yourself in the dark.

810
00:45:02.539 --> 00:45:05.369
All that practice actually helped.

811
00:45:06.778 --> 00:45:09.749
You managed to talk without freezing up.

812
00:45:10.008 --> 00:45:11.079
I did, didn't I?

813
00:45:12.378 --> 00:45:14.349
Maybe it's because I let it go.

814
00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.218
You let it go?

815
00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:17.689
Yes.

816
00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:21.389
I told myself to stop being pathetic.

817
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:25.128
If it were that easy,

818
00:45:25.128 --> 00:45:27.698
why would there be so many deities?

819
00:45:29.968 --> 00:45:33.099
Anyway, I won't help you with any tools.

820
00:45:41.209 --> 00:45:42.639
All you can eat.

821
00:45:43.749 --> 00:45:46.079
All you can eat. Thank you.

822
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:49.448
All you can eat beef.

823
00:45:49.889 --> 00:45:50.889
Thanks.

824
00:46:04.898 --> 00:46:06.639
(Jang Seok Doo)

825
00:46:08.568 --> 00:46:09.769
Hi, Seok Doo.

826
00:46:09.769 --> 00:46:12.809
Tae Soo, you did research on sanghwang mushrooms,

827
00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:14.608
a lifting pack,

828
00:46:14.608 --> 00:46:17.148
and motorcycle accessories.

829
00:46:17.148 --> 00:46:18.749
The locals are interested,

830
00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.249
so find out more about them.

831
00:46:20.479 --> 00:46:21.948
Are they?

832
00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:24.488
Then I'll call you back...

833
00:46:24.488 --> 00:46:26.159
when I get the lowest price.

834
00:46:26.189 --> 00:46:27.358
Okay, bye.

835
00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:31.789
(Ji Tae)

836
00:46:33.528 --> 00:46:34.858
Hey, Ji Tae.

837
00:46:35.398 --> 00:46:36.968
She'll visit again?

838
00:46:37.329 --> 00:46:38.729
At what time?

839
00:46:39.028 --> 00:46:40.298
Around 9pm.

840
00:46:40.539 --> 00:46:43.668
We had to take care of a few things first.

841
00:46:44.039 --> 00:46:45.738
Oh, okay.

842
00:46:46.639 --> 00:46:49.278
What should I do? Ji Tae is coming home at 9pm.

843
00:46:49.749 --> 00:46:51.778
Didn't you tell him you got a job?

844
00:46:51.778 --> 00:46:52.778
I didn't.

845
00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:55.378
And he's bringing his fiancee.

846
00:46:55.749 --> 00:46:57.218
What fiancee?

847
00:46:57.218 --> 00:46:59.659
Didn't I tell you? He's engaged.

848
00:46:59.659 --> 00:47:01.659
Gosh, he's getting married?

849
00:47:01.659 --> 00:47:02.659
With whom?

850
00:47:02.659 --> 00:47:05.429
Can you watch the counter for me?

851
00:47:05.429 --> 00:47:07.659
The dinner rush is over, so it's quiet.

852
00:47:07.659 --> 00:47:10.829
I'll rush home and come back in a taxi.

853
00:47:11.468 --> 00:47:12.999
I must watch the counter?

854
00:47:12.999 --> 00:47:15.668
I'll pay you more than enough. Okay?

855
00:47:19.338 --> 00:47:21.139
- A week? - A week?

856
00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:24.378
It's a beautiful outdoor venue.

857
00:47:24.909 --> 00:47:25.948
Look.

858
00:47:26.519 --> 00:47:28.849
Gosh, it's really pretty.

859
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:32.718
It's in the World Cup Park.

860
00:47:32.718 --> 00:47:34.519
It's managed by the city.

861
00:47:34.858 --> 00:47:36.858
It looks amazing.

862
00:47:36.858 --> 00:47:37.858
Doesn't it?

863
00:47:37.858 --> 00:47:40.528
I went there for a wedding and fell in love with it.

864
00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:42.968
I don't like the fact that it's free...

865
00:47:42.968 --> 00:47:44.429
and in a week's time.

866
00:47:44.429 --> 00:47:46.269
That's not the issue, Mom.

867
00:47:46.269 --> 00:47:48.468
The one opening they have is for January.

868
00:47:48.468 --> 00:47:49.838
We'll freeze to death.

869
00:47:49.939 --> 00:47:51.968
That's why we'd rather rush things.

870
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:54.378
A week's still too soon.

871
00:47:54.378 --> 00:47:56.209
There's a lot to prepare.

872
00:47:56.209 --> 00:47:58.079
There isn't much to prepare, Mother.

873
00:47:58.479 --> 00:48:00.249
Gosh, you can't say that.

874
00:48:00.249 --> 00:48:02.718
A wedding isn't child's play.

875
00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:05.389
Even if you have a simple ceremony,

876
00:48:05.389 --> 00:48:08.088
you shouldn't hurry things like this.

877
00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:10.088
What about Soo A's work...

878
00:48:10.088 --> 00:48:11.588
and parents?

879
00:48:11.588 --> 00:48:13.198
Her parents invited us to Canada...

880
00:48:13.198 --> 00:48:14.398
for our honeymoon,

881
00:48:14.398 --> 00:48:15.798
and I checked on my schedule,

882
00:48:15.798 --> 00:48:17.128
and I think it'll be fine.

883
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:19.398
Even so.

884
00:48:19.468 --> 00:48:21.238
What about the dowry?

885
00:48:21.338 --> 00:48:24.608
We want to spend as little as possible...

886
00:48:24.608 --> 00:48:26.378
so we can move to a place of our own.

887
00:48:26.378 --> 00:48:27.608
Would that be okay?

888
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:29.849
I'm not saying that...

889
00:48:29.849 --> 00:48:32.008
because I expect a dowry.

890
00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:34.849
I can't even give you much myself.

891
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:39.088
I just think it's wrong to rush a wedding like this.

892
00:48:39.148 --> 00:48:41.318
Mom, is there a law that says...

893
00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.059
how weddings should be held?

894
00:48:43.059 --> 00:48:45.229
Right. Ji Soo has a point.

895
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:47.559
It's totally up to you.

896
00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:50.929
We only need a new bed.

897
00:48:50.929 --> 00:48:52.028
How about we get you...

898
00:48:52.068 --> 00:48:55.139
a new fridge and a washing machine?

899
00:48:55.298 --> 00:48:58.139
It's fine, forget about it.

900
00:48:58.209 --> 00:49:00.238
I can't even give you any jewelry.

901
00:49:00.238 --> 00:49:02.849
I don't deserve a fridge and a washing machine.

902
00:49:07.548 --> 00:49:09.718
Yes, I'm looking at it now.

903
00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:11.249
Each location's different,

904
00:49:11.249 --> 00:49:13.389
so we might have to change the layout.

905
00:49:13.389 --> 00:49:14.689
Please send some options.

906
00:49:16.289 --> 00:49:17.829
Yes. Goodbye.

907
00:49:21.229 --> 00:49:22.599
(Whiner)

908
00:49:23.229 --> 00:49:24.829
You're line's busy.

909
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:27.668
Ji Tae's getting married next Tuesday.

910
00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:37.878
Ji Soo, what do you mean?

911
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:40.148
It's so hard to talk to you.

912
00:49:40.179 --> 00:49:42.718
He's getting married next Tuesday?

913
00:49:42.818 --> 00:49:44.289
Why so soon?

914
00:49:44.519 --> 00:49:46.218
Are you sure? Is it confirmed?

915
00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:49.119
Yes. They already booked the venue.

916
00:50:07.479 --> 00:50:08.709
Mr. Choi.

917
00:50:09.008 --> 00:50:10.909
Are you going to pick up your sister?

918
00:50:10.909 --> 00:50:11.909
(Seo Ji An)

919
00:50:12.778 --> 00:50:14.619
No, I'm not.

920
00:50:25.858 --> 00:50:27.599
- Hello... - Are you at home?

921
00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:29.059
We must talk urgently.

922
00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:31.198
Where are you?

923
00:50:41.709 --> 00:50:42.948
I have a bad feeling about this.

924
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:50.148
It's never good when you go first...

925
00:50:50.148 --> 00:50:51.548
My brother's getting married.

926
00:50:52.718 --> 00:50:53.718
What?

927
00:50:53.988 --> 00:50:55.659
He's getting married next Tuesday.

928
00:50:57.059 --> 00:50:58.628
Why are you telling me that?

929
00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:00.528
Can you please...

930
00:51:01.028 --> 00:51:03.429
wait until after the wedding?

931
00:51:05.298 --> 00:51:06.939
It's getting worse and worse.

932
00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:08.869
If your parents find out,

933
00:51:09.709 --> 00:51:11.539
there won't be a wedding.

934
00:51:11.838 --> 00:51:13.039
Too bad.

935
00:51:13.738 --> 00:51:15.039
I've made up my mind.

936
00:51:16.148 --> 00:51:17.148
What?

937
00:51:17.148 --> 00:51:18.878
The only thing I can do for you is...

938
00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:22.349
to let you tell my parents when they return tomorrow.

939
00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:25.648
No. Ji Tae did nothing wrong.

940
00:51:25.818 --> 00:51:27.889
Just one week. That's all I need.

941
00:51:27.889 --> 00:51:29.758
Not telling what I know.

942
00:51:30.289 --> 00:51:32.059
Do you know how serious that is?

943
00:51:32.729 --> 00:51:34.358
Postpone your brother's wedding.

944
00:51:34.358 --> 00:51:35.698
You know...

945
00:51:36.269 --> 00:51:37.769
how terrifying your parents are.

946
00:51:38.229 --> 00:51:39.798
Especially your mother.

947
00:51:41.539 --> 00:51:43.338
They'll tear my family apart.

948
00:51:43.709 --> 00:51:45.539
My mom will be imprisoned for fraud...

949
00:51:45.539 --> 00:51:47.909
and my dad will lose his mind with guilt.

950
00:51:48.909 --> 00:51:50.508
My brother and sister...

951
00:51:51.079 --> 00:51:53.519
will be so ashamed of our parents, right?

952
00:51:54.079 --> 00:51:57.648
I left them and came here, so I can't console them.

953
00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:00.858
And Ji Soo...

954
00:52:02.258 --> 00:52:03.628
I can't even imagine...

955
00:52:03.628 --> 00:52:06.198
how badly hurt she'll be and how she'll react.

956
00:52:07.329 --> 00:52:09.698
Ji Tae can't get married after that.

957
00:52:12.939 --> 00:52:13.939
Please.

958
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.139
Please. Please.

959
00:52:16.838 --> 00:52:19.269
You don't know me that well, Seo Ji An.

960
00:52:20.738 --> 00:52:21.778
Once I make...

961
00:52:22.278 --> 00:52:23.979
a very cautious decision,

962
00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:26.479
I never change my mind.

963
00:52:28.148 --> 00:52:29.789
I'm part of the Haesung family,

964
00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:31.789
and we...

965
00:52:32.289 --> 00:52:33.818
have our own rules.

966
00:52:34.619 --> 00:52:36.588
I won't break them for you,

967
00:52:37.628 --> 00:52:38.959
and I shouldn't.

968
00:52:40.729 --> 00:52:41.798
I know.

969
00:52:42.628 --> 00:52:43.929
I know that very well.

970
00:52:44.898 --> 00:52:46.838
But could you please think about it?

971
00:52:46.838 --> 00:52:48.398
Consider it just once more...

972
00:52:48.939 --> 00:52:50.869
before your parents return.

973
00:52:52.608 --> 00:52:53.909
You really...

974
00:52:54.639 --> 00:52:57.048
make things hard for me.

975
00:52:59.008 --> 00:53:00.418
I beg you.

976
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:28.039
How much is there?

977
00:53:28.608 --> 00:53:30.378
I don't know. Gosh.

978
00:53:30.378 --> 00:53:32.378
- Let's see. - Gosh.

979
00:53:36.588 --> 00:53:37.619
My goodness.

980
00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:41.789
Hello there.

981
00:53:43.159 --> 00:53:44.459
We're full tonight.

982
00:53:44.459 --> 00:53:46.358
Cinderella's back after a while.

983
00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:47.659
Cinderella?

984
00:53:47.659 --> 00:53:49.968
It's always busy when she shows up.

985
00:53:50.099 --> 00:53:51.128
She must have something.

986
00:53:51.168 --> 00:53:53.198
She comes here too?

987
00:53:53.439 --> 00:53:55.499
I saw her at a club in Cheongdam-dong.

988
00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:56.939
She goes everywhere.

989
00:53:56.939 --> 00:53:58.508
That's why many men are interested in her...

990
00:53:58.639 --> 00:53:59.809
because they are curious.

991
00:54:01.179 --> 00:54:03.749
She's just making herself look cheap.

992
00:54:04.409 --> 00:54:06.979
Anyway, which section should I serve?

993
00:54:06.979 --> 00:54:08.778
- The front booths. - Thank you.

994
00:54:29.338 --> 00:54:31.309
I want to dance alone. Get lost.

995
00:54:31.508 --> 00:54:32.878
I came to play with you.

996
00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:38.048
Get Mr. Hong and get rid of them.

997
00:54:38.648 --> 00:54:40.479
Escort her to our room.

998
00:54:44.418 --> 00:54:47.358
I'm sorry. Mr. Hong's out at the moment.

999
00:54:47.358 --> 00:54:49.318
Don't you dare pull that on me.

1000
00:54:51.329 --> 00:54:53.459
Come with us and say hi.

1001
00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:55.229
- I'm curious about you. - Let go of me!

1002
00:54:58.128 --> 00:54:59.539
What are you doing here?

1003
00:54:59.898 --> 00:55:01.369
Mr. Hong asked for you.

1004
00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:13.378
That'll do. What's your name?

1005
00:55:13.778 --> 00:55:14.818
100,000 Dollars?

1006
00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:17.988
I'll put in a good word for you to Mr. Hong.

1007
00:55:17.988 --> 00:55:21.519
Mr. Hong, the manager, quit a month ago.

1008
00:55:21.519 --> 00:55:22.559
What?

1009
00:55:22.929 --> 00:55:25.389
After all I paid him to take care of me?

1010
00:55:29.429 --> 00:55:31.099
Hey, you're...

1011
00:55:31.099 --> 00:55:34.439
Gosh, you finally recognize me now?

1012
00:55:34.639 --> 00:55:36.838
Gosh, I knew this would happen.

1013
00:55:37.238 --> 00:55:39.439
I'll get to the point. How much do you want?

1014
00:55:40.008 --> 00:55:41.008
What?

1015
00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:42.979
I knew it when you peeked through our gate.

1016
00:55:43.179 --> 00:55:44.679
You're looking at houses?

1017
00:55:48.048 --> 00:55:50.619
I don't know how you figured out who I am,

1018
00:55:50.619 --> 00:55:53.358
but you checked out my house. So name your price.

1019
00:55:53.358 --> 00:55:57.059
Hey, do you think I was at your house for money?

1020
00:55:58.159 --> 00:55:59.999
I was there to see my sister.

1021
00:56:00.099 --> 00:56:03.099
I saved you because you are my sister's sister,

1022
00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:04.369
you brat.

1023
00:56:04.369 --> 00:56:06.599
What nonsense is that? Why am I your sister's...

1024
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:32.488
(1,000 dollars)

1025
00:56:34.659 --> 00:56:35.798
No thanks.

1026
00:56:36.468 --> 00:56:37.499
Why?

1027
00:56:37.599 --> 00:56:38.798
Can't you just...

1028
00:56:40.068 --> 00:56:41.838
stop going to places like this instead?

1029
00:56:54.579 --> 00:56:56.519
Did you sleep well, ma'am?

1030
00:56:56.749 --> 00:56:58.448
I was just about to wake you.

1031
00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:01.119
Your father is hungry early today.

1032
00:57:01.988 --> 00:57:03.988
He's up already?

1033
00:57:05.128 --> 00:57:07.898
We even went out for a walk.

1034
00:57:09.798 --> 00:57:12.329
Thanks for taking care of him.

1035
00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:15.568
Ms. No.

1036
00:57:16.838 --> 00:57:20.278
I'm not your father's maid.

1037
00:57:21.338 --> 00:57:22.409
I know that.

1038
00:57:22.709 --> 00:57:25.679
You must think I won't become your stepmother.

1039
00:57:26.278 --> 00:57:28.079
But you never know what'll happen.

1040
00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:30.718
Don't draw the line already.

1041
00:57:39.798 --> 00:57:41.628
You don't know my dad.

1042
00:57:47.968 --> 00:57:50.238
This bibimbap is a fascinating dish.

1043
00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:53.909
Foreigners loved it when it was...

1044
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:57.778
served on planes, and now, it's a hit in Vietnam.

1045
00:57:57.979 --> 00:58:01.249
Yes. Our restaurant in Hanoi is very busy.

1046
00:58:01.548 --> 00:58:04.218
We'll open the Ho Chi Minh branch ahead of schedule,

1047
00:58:04.389 --> 00:58:06.818
and we are considering opening one in Danang.

1048
00:58:07.019 --> 00:58:08.289
What do you think?

1049
00:58:08.588 --> 00:58:11.258
Why would you ask me that...

1050
00:58:11.429 --> 00:58:12.829
when there's your husband?

1051
00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:17.099
Vice Chairman Choi, you're now in charge...

1052
00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:19.468
of all the Vietnam restaurants.

1053
00:58:20.298 --> 00:58:21.398
Yes, sir.

1054
00:58:22.639 --> 00:58:26.539
What did you think about MJ's plans for next year?

1055
00:58:28.139 --> 00:58:31.648
Entering Europe and opening a premier hotel?

1056
00:58:32.048 --> 00:58:33.778
It looks more like...

1057
00:58:33.918 --> 00:58:36.448
they're opening a market stall.

1058
00:58:37.689 --> 00:58:39.619
I'll talk to your sister about that.

1059
00:58:39.988 --> 00:58:43.858
That's not the only thing you must discuss with her.

1060
00:58:47.528 --> 00:58:50.068
I was getting bored of the business talk.

1061
00:58:50.999 --> 00:58:52.429
Shall I leave the table?

1062
00:58:54.539 --> 00:58:57.838
Even she wasn't upset. Why are you so riled up?

1063
00:58:57.838 --> 00:58:59.809
It's not about how we like it or not.

1064
00:58:59.809 --> 00:59:01.709
She disobeyed you.

1065
00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:04.878
And she used Eun Seok as bait.

1066
00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:10.318
Do you have proof?

1067
00:59:11.048 --> 00:59:13.358
The two employees who uploaded the photos...

1068
00:59:13.358 --> 00:59:15.059
did nothing wrong that day.

1069
00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:16.929
They were on vacation,

1070
00:59:16.988 --> 00:59:19.258
and they were just smoking under a tree.

1071
00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:22.358
The reporter who wrote the Yangpyeong article...

1072
00:59:22.729 --> 00:59:24.429
got the photo from an anonymous source.

1073
00:59:24.429 --> 00:59:26.468
So we don't have any decisive proof.

1074
00:59:27.439 --> 00:59:30.738
We only know it was planned...

1075
00:59:30.738 --> 00:59:32.439
because it all surfaced online at the same time.

1076
00:59:34.039 --> 00:59:37.979
It's good to see you on the same page for once,

1077
00:59:39.209 --> 00:59:40.318
but let it go.

1078
00:59:41.148 --> 00:59:42.918
- Dad. - Sir.

1079
00:59:43.019 --> 00:59:46.088
Why worry about minions clouding the waters?

1080
00:59:47.159 --> 00:59:51.358
Eun Seok managed to patch things up nicely.

1081
00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:54.159
Myung Soo isn't a minion.

1082
00:59:54.159 --> 00:59:55.959
He's worse than Jin Hee.

1083
00:59:56.028 --> 00:59:58.698
They know we're onto them.

1084
00:59:59.639 --> 01:00:02.168
Let it go this time, okay?

1085
01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:04.139
They're after Do Kyung.

1086
01:00:04.139 --> 01:00:05.608
Yes, Do Kyung.

1087
01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.409
He mentioned something...

1088
01:00:09.409 --> 01:00:11.378
in the business proposal for the second half.

1089
01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:15.179
A premium nightwear brand.

1090
01:00:16.048 --> 01:00:17.389
I like that idea.

1091
01:00:21.988 --> 01:00:25.028
I heard Jung Kang Soo held an exhibition here.

1092
01:00:25.229 --> 01:00:27.258
I was wondering if you have his phone number.

1093
01:00:27.298 --> 01:00:29.429
That was already five years ago.

1094
01:00:29.628 --> 01:00:32.499
I heard he's living in seclusion.

1095
01:00:32.499 --> 01:00:35.939
Then can you tell me his friends if you know any?

1096
01:00:36.139 --> 01:00:39.439
Natural dye helps enhancing skin moisture,

1097
01:00:39.439 --> 01:00:41.939
relieves skin irritation and allergy reactions.

1098
01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:43.409
It also has deodorization properties,

1099
01:00:43.409 --> 01:00:46.008
so it's perfect for premium nightwear.

1100
01:00:46.119 --> 01:00:47.778
But the colors are beautiful too.

1101
01:00:51.088 --> 01:00:53.318
I like this indigo color,

1102
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:55.689
but this isn't it.

1103
01:00:56.988 --> 01:00:59.698
How beautiful was the color you saw?

1104
01:01:00.028 --> 01:01:02.869
Thank you anyway.

1105
01:01:02.869 --> 01:01:05.099
- I like the design. - Sure.

1106
01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:13.579
(Director Park)

1107
01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.249
Yes, Director Park.

1108
01:01:16.249 --> 01:01:17.448
Vice President Choi.

1109
01:01:17.648 --> 01:01:19.918
My wife's a member of Apparel.

1110
01:01:19.918 --> 01:01:21.749
She received a text about the event,

1111
01:01:21.818 --> 01:01:23.318
but the date's incorrect.

1112
01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:25.349
What do you mean?

1113
01:01:26.189 --> 01:01:28.258
Yoon Ha Jung. I just found out now.

1114
01:01:28.258 --> 01:01:30.229
- Why is the date wrong? - What do you mean?

1115
01:01:30.229 --> 01:01:31.988
The Satisfying the Five Senses event...

1116
01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.128
begins on the 29th,

1117
01:01:33.128 --> 01:01:35.198
but it says it's the 28th.

1118
01:01:35.528 --> 01:01:36.528
Pardon?

1119
01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.128
It says it's the 28th.

1120
01:01:38.198 --> 01:01:40.298
Didn't you check the date, Ha Jung?

1121
01:01:40.539 --> 01:01:41.639
I thought I did.

1122
01:01:41.639 --> 01:01:43.108
What?

1123
01:01:46.939 --> 01:01:47.939
General Manager Lee.

1124
01:01:49.548 --> 01:01:51.948
What's wrong with the group text on the event?

1125
01:01:52.148 --> 01:01:54.418
I'm sorry. We just found out.

1126
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:57.148
Where's Seo Ji An?

1127
01:01:57.619 --> 01:02:00.258
It wasn't her.

1128
01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:02.588
Ha Jung did it.

1129
01:02:03.959 --> 01:02:05.659
I'm... I'm sorry.

1130
01:02:09.668 --> 01:02:10.668
General Manager Lee.

1131
01:02:10.668 --> 01:02:11.698
Yes.

1132
01:02:11.698 --> 01:02:14.039
How much is the cost of the group text?

1133
01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.338
It's over 100,000 dollars.

1134
01:02:17.409 --> 01:02:18.769
If we send it again,

1135
01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:21.039
we're wasting 100,000 dollars.

1136
01:02:21.179 --> 01:02:22.338
Am I right?

1137
01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:23.979
Yes.

1138
01:02:25.778 --> 01:02:26.979
Ms. Yoon.

1139
01:02:27.218 --> 01:02:29.988
What about the theme for the hand printing contest?

1140
01:02:30.588 --> 01:02:32.488
Have you decided to go with a fairy tale theme?

1141
01:02:32.588 --> 01:02:34.418
Are you done talking with the design team?

1142
01:02:34.519 --> 01:02:36.289
Seo Ji An is in charge of that.

1143
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:37.858
Then when do I get the final screening...

1144
01:02:37.858 --> 01:02:38.889
of the customer fashion show?

1145
01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:40.599
I've distributed the vote,

1146
01:02:40.599 --> 01:02:42.198
but we haven't decided the date yet.

1147
01:02:42.198 --> 01:02:45.528
Are you saying we can wait months for it?

1148
01:02:46.338 --> 01:02:48.198
Is there any increase in social media followers?

1149
01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:50.238
The advertising agency's taking care of it.

1150
01:02:50.238 --> 01:02:51.738
You mean you don't know.

1151
01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:56.148
Then when will the agency get the design ready?

1152
01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.648
Are we getting 2D and 3D together?

1153
01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:00.418
Seo Ji An's in charge of it.

1154
01:03:00.418 --> 01:03:02.218
Anyway, you don't know.

1155
01:03:02.218 --> 01:03:03.218
You said you'll cast...

1156
01:03:03.218 --> 01:03:05.488
a premium Australian candle brand.

1157
01:03:05.488 --> 01:03:07.019
How is that going?

1158
01:03:07.418 --> 01:03:09.789
I haven't checked it yet.

1159
01:03:09.988 --> 01:03:11.088
Manager Jo.

1160
01:03:11.929 --> 01:03:14.099
You said you'll postpone the sales...

1161
01:03:14.099 --> 01:03:15.398
of the new winter season because of the event.

1162
01:03:15.398 --> 01:03:17.668
When can I get the customer analysis report?

1163
01:03:17.668 --> 01:03:20.999
I haven't received the report yet from Ji An.

1164
01:03:21.439 --> 01:03:22.809
Ms. Yoon.

1165
01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:24.968
Who are the sponsors for the event?

1166
01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.309
Ji An's out looking for them.

1167
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:28.209
Where did she go?

1168
01:03:28.209 --> 01:03:29.378
I don't know.

1169
01:03:29.378 --> 01:03:31.749
I heard you two are in charge together.

1170
01:03:31.749 --> 01:03:32.818
It hasn't been that long.

1171
01:03:32.818 --> 01:03:34.479
I didn't have time to learn it.

1172
01:03:34.479 --> 01:03:36.148
Then why did you come to the team dinner?

1173
01:03:38.418 --> 01:03:40.718
I'm trying my best to learn it now.

1174
01:03:40.718 --> 01:03:42.289
I've heard that yesterday.

1175
01:03:43.329 --> 01:03:45.329
Where's Seo Ji An?

1176
01:03:45.358 --> 01:03:46.398
She's out on business.

1177
01:03:46.398 --> 01:03:47.898
Where did she go?

1178
01:03:55.922 --> 01:04:00.922
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1179
01:04:06.179 --> 01:04:07.718
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1180
01:04:13.019 --> 01:04:14.858
(Do Kyung)

1181
01:04:17.128 --> 01:04:18.358
Hello.

1182
01:04:18.628 --> 01:04:20.858
Come straight to the membership club now.

1183
01:04:21.229 --> 01:04:22.798
I'll let the manager know.

1184
01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:24.729
Okay.

1185
01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:35.278
Are you Seo Ji An?

1186
01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:37.479
- Yes. - This way please.

1187
01:04:49.258 --> 01:04:50.289
Sit.

1188
01:04:56.168 --> 01:04:57.468
Where are you coming from?

1189
01:04:58.198 --> 01:04:59.198
No.

1190
01:04:59.568 --> 01:05:00.568
Tell me what you've been doing...

1191
01:05:00.568 --> 01:05:01.668
without coming to the office today.

1192
01:05:03.039 --> 01:05:05.539
I went to a few galleries where Jung Kang Soo...

1193
01:05:05.909 --> 01:05:08.278
held exhibitions and talked to his students...

1194
01:05:08.278 --> 01:05:10.608
to get his number.

1195
01:05:10.979 --> 01:05:12.648
And I was looking around...

1196
01:05:12.648 --> 01:05:14.349
a few convention halls that were changed.

1197
01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:15.378
You.

1198
01:05:16.218 --> 01:05:17.218
You said you wanted me...

1199
01:05:17.218 --> 01:05:18.619
to keep the secret until your brother's wedding.

1200
01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.218
Yes.

1201
01:05:20.258 --> 01:05:21.289
Fine.

1202
01:05:23.488 --> 01:05:24.488
But...

1203
01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.758
under one condition.

1204
01:05:29.499 --> 01:05:31.168
Condition?

1205
01:05:56.858 --> 01:05:59.528
(My Golden Life)

1206
01:06:00.329 --> 01:06:02.329
From now on, I'll be in charge...

1207
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:03.599
of the foundation event.

1208
01:06:03.628 --> 01:06:05.329
Did you do something wrong, Ji An?

1209
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:06.999
My real sister, Ji Soo.

1210
01:06:06.999 --> 01:06:07.999
What's she doing now?

1211
01:06:07.999 --> 01:06:09.738
- What? - What a coincidence.

1212
01:06:09.738 --> 01:06:10.968
Gosh. Really.

1213
01:06:11.008 --> 01:06:12.838
Let's get this clear.

1214
01:06:12.838 --> 01:06:14.579
You and I aren't siblings anymore.

1215
01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:15.709
We aren't related.

1216
01:06:15.939 --> 01:06:17.548
Hi, Cinderella.

1217
01:06:17.548 --> 01:06:18.548
Be careful.

1218
01:06:18.548 --> 01:06:19.979
So many guys are after you.

1219
01:06:19.979 --> 01:06:21.648
I have a bodyguard now.

1220
01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:22.918
Unbelievable.

1221
01:06:22.918 --> 01:06:24.548
Does he have amnesia?

1222
01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:25.619
Okay. Okay.

1223
01:06:25.619 --> 01:06:27.218
Father will be disappointed...

1224
01:06:27.218 --> 01:06:28.758
if he doesn't get to see Eun Seok.

1225
01:06:28.758 --> 01:06:30.559
Yes, Grandfather.

1226
01:06:30.559 --> 01:06:32.429
Come to Yangpyeong after work.

1227
01:06:32.429 --> 01:06:34.329
Today? To Yangpyeong?
