Let's bet the most precious thing in life.

4
00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:14.995
Something you can't change even if you die.

5
00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:17.266
Something you can't throw out even if you die.

6
00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:18.996
Something you can't erase...

7
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.536
even if you die.

8
00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:21.965
What's that?

9
00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.106
This time, let's bet our family.

10
00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:31.075
It's okay. It'll be all right.

11
00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:34.345
Kim Bum Joon!

12
00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.315
No!

13
00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:49.025
No!

14
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.336
No!

15
00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:01.205

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:02.376
Kim Min Joon.

17
00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:04.645
Next time, call me your brother, okay?

18
00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:11.615
My brother.

19
00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:13.356
Get away.

20
00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:15.856
(Mortuary)

21
00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:18.455
Open this!

22
00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:21.496
Kim Bum Joon's brother. Come out.

23
00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:22.865
Come out!

24
00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:25.796
Come out!

25
00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:28.806
Kim Bum Joon's brother. Come out.

26
00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:30.065
Nice to meet you.

27
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:33.535
I'm the younger brother of Kim Bum Joon,

28
00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:35.776
who was an assistant pilot of Juhan Air Flight 801,

29
00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:37.445
Kim Min Joon.

30
00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:47.085
Are you that kid?

31
00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.356
November 22, 2015, Incheon Airport.

32
00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:55.266
You were at the airport on the day of I departed.

33
00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:58.735
And on February 20, 2016, at Schmitten,

34
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:01.606
you met Hans Gebauer and Mi Ja Gebauer,

35
00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:03.365
my foster parents, right?

36
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:07.806
You spent so much money to fly over there,

37
00:02:07.906 --> 00:02:09.746
but you couldn't even get a picture of me.

38
00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:10.845
Why?

39
00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.575
Because you didn't know the Gebauers...

40
00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:15.716
already abandoned me 12 years ago.

41
00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:23.056
Are you here to die?

42
00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:26.255
You can try to kill me.

43
00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:32.496
What?

44
00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:37.535
What's wrong with this?

45
00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:40.945
What's going on?

46
00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.095
You idiot.

47
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:03.165
Did you think I'd be threatened by this?

48
00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:04.436
Then what about those?

49
00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:27.926
Should we all...

50
00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:30.595
fall into a bottomless pit?

51
00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.436
That was a great decision.

52
00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:47.246
Right?

53
00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:50.845
You shouldn't dishonor Professor Byeon's name...

54
00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:54.186
or get Nurse Oh Seo Ra fired from the hospital,

55
00:03:54.486 --> 00:03:55.545
don't you think so?

56
00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:00.456
Oh, Detective Jo would face the biggest problem.

57
00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:02.885
If he gets fired, who's going to pay for...

58
00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:04.255
his sick daughter's hospital bills?

59
00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:06.695
Why are you here?

60
00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.426
I wanted you to bring me...

61
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.265
what I want.

62
00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:11.736
Do you think we'll do that?

63
00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:15.336
Did you think...

64
00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:18.176
you would let go of me up until 30 seconds ago?

(Park Moo Shin)

66
00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:27.015
Kang Woo, are you insane?

67
00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:28.815
Why would you send me a cake?

68
00:04:30.955 --> 00:04:32.916
Why would I send him a cake?

69
00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:36.356
That's not the only one I sent.

70
00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:40.465
One to the manager of Taeyang Insurance.

71
00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:43.025
One to an inspector at Daemyeong Police Station.

72
00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:46.496
One to the human resources of Hanju Hospital.

73
00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:49.106
A total of three.

74

(Public Official ID Card)

76
00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:32.346
Can you roll up my sleeves?

77
00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:34.486
What about your sun allergy?

78
00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:36.645
Are you sure?

79
00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:00.945
Oh, you. You can't do that today. Go.

80
00:06:00.945 --> 00:06:02.806
I don't care if you dance naked here. Go.

81
00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:05.075
Why would I dance naked? Do you think I'm insane?

82
00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:08.546
Hey, Player Jang, aren't you here to see me?

83
00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:09.815
Not even in your dreams.

(Criminal Squad 1, 2, 3, Serious Crime Squad 3)

85
00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:16.126
Hey, you. How did you get in here?

86
00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.856
The front calls us for any packages.

87
00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:21.765
We used to just come in to deliver.

88
00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:23.626
I told you not to do that.

89
00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:24.936
Is that for the inspector?

90
00:06:24.936 --> 00:06:25.936
Yes.

91
00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:29.106
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

92
00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:33.476
(Greetings, there is a gift in the cake.)

93
00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:36.575
In the cake?

94
00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:38.346
All of you.

95
00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:39.746
You.

96
00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:41.145
What will you do about my brother?

97
00:06:41.145 --> 00:06:43.515
Soon Jung, I think I'm going to die.

98
00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:45.515
Is it because of our dermatologist?

99
00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:48.186
If not, why would I be here?

100
00:06:48.186 --> 00:06:49.385
First, you must go to the administration...

101
00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:50.395
Why would I do that?

102
00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:52.096
Bring the dermatologist and the administration...

103
00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:53.695
to this place!

104
00:06:54.926 --> 00:06:55.996
Oh, my blood pressure.

105
00:06:57.096 --> 00:06:59.395
- Oh, gosh, my back. - Are you okay?

106
00:06:59.395 --> 00:07:00.606
Oh, gosh, my blood pressure.

107
00:07:00.606 --> 00:07:02.606
My gosh, he's an old man. Soon Jung!

108
00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:04.005
- Gosh, I'm dying. - Soon Jung.

109
00:07:04.005 --> 00:07:05.376
- Call someone. - Hurry.

110
00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:06.376
- Hurry. - It's an emergency.

111
00:07:06.376 --> 00:07:08.145
My gosh, he's an old man.

112
00:07:08.145 --> 00:07:10.645
I'm going to die. Give me the medicine.

113
00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:11.645
Right.

(Taeyang Insurance)

115
00:07:15.246 --> 00:07:16.686
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

116
00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:20.455
Mr. Choi, I'm seeing you quite often.

117
00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:22.585
Yes, is it your birthday?

118
00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:24.426
It's for Manager Park.

119
00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:25.895
Oh, really?

120
00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:27.465
I'll take it and bring it to him.

121
00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:29.465
- Would you do that? - What are you doing?

122
00:07:36.465 --> 00:07:37.736
Why are you coming all the way to my office?

123
00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:39.275
You should be at the chairman's room.

124
00:07:41.376 --> 00:07:42.445
Why would I go there?

125
00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:46.445
I know that you were there recently.

126
00:07:46.876 --> 00:07:49.885
It's me, Manager Park of Claims Examination Team.

127
00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:51.315
You're so brazen.

128
00:07:51.315 --> 00:07:53.155
Why are you lurking around our office?

129
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.655
You, Jang Ha Ri, and the other guys.

130
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.655
People who break the law like you...

131
00:07:57.655 --> 00:07:59.695
can never return to the insurance industry.

132
00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:01.996
I'll make sure I find a definite proof...

133
00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:05.135
to get you all locked up in jail.

134
00:08:07.405 --> 00:08:08.436
Moo Shin.

135
00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:12.135
What if I turn myself in?

136
00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:16.205
What are you trying to pull?

137
00:08:25.015 --> 00:08:26.015
Hey!

138
00:08:26.616 --> 00:08:27.856
What are you doing?

139
00:08:29.556 --> 00:08:30.825
I just wanted to have a taste.

140
00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:32.726
Thanks for the cake.

141
00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:37.866
He's completely insane.

142
00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:48.206
How was it?

143
00:08:48.505 --> 00:08:50.106
That's from a famous bakery in Gangnam.

144
00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:51.116
It was sweet.

145
00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:55.346
I'm sure the original is somewhere else.

146
00:08:57.015 --> 00:08:58.316
If you want the original,

147
00:08:58.316 --> 00:09:00.486
just do as I ask, Mr. Choi.

148
00:09:01.956 --> 00:09:03.586
That's what dogs do.

149
00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:06.155
They smell something and follow the smell.

150
00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:08.496
Their owner is the one who does the hunting.

151
00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:12.496
I get why I have to do this,

152
00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:14.366
but why are you doing this?

153
00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:15.405
I wonder that too.

154
00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:17.805
Why am I doing this?

155
00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:22.675
Tick-tock, tick-tock. Time is ticking.

156
00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:36.525
Kim Min Joon, that punk...

157
00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:38.395
These wiretaps...

158
00:09:42.226 --> 00:09:44.096
Should I make him disappear?

159
00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:47.665
You're just an ex-convict. You can't murder people.

160
00:09:47.836 --> 00:09:50.106
Do you want to get beat up by an ex-con...

161
00:09:50.435 --> 00:09:51.775
and die?

162
00:09:51.775 --> 00:09:52.976
I'll probably get locked up in jail...

163
00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:54.675
before you beat me up.

164
00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:13.596
Why?

165
00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:16.525
Why did Kim Min Joon show up now?

166
00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:33.446
What do Young Mi and Se Yoon have in common?

167
00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:35.915
I basically made them popular.

168
00:10:36.616 --> 00:10:39.155
In case of Young Mi, she became popular...

169
00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:41.755
after she started going to my hair salon.

Auntie, I'm going to take one.

172
00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:47.226
Okay.

173
00:10:51.295 --> 00:10:52.665
What about the others?

174
00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:54.236
They already ate.

175
00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:56.336
This is your first meal of the day, right?

176
00:10:59.435 --> 00:11:02.106
Yes. I'm hungry...

177
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:03.505
like a beggar.

178
00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:05.775
Because you're a human.

179

180

that you're a living, breathing human being.

181
00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:12.316
I know that.

182

What should we do?

183
00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:01.206

199
00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:48.476
Yes. What's your name?

I'm looking at Choi Kang Woo.

208
00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:28.816
Mr. Choi.

209
00:14:29.915 --> 00:14:31.216
Go ahead and follow me.

210
00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:34.456
But you know you're only allowed to sniff.

211

213
00:14:39.826 --> 00:14:40.866
Pardon?

214
00:14:41.466 --> 00:14:42.496
Hey.

215
00:14:44.135 --> 00:14:45.466
Why is it taking so long?

216
00:14:45.736 --> 00:14:48.005
What does this guy do?

217
00:14:48.005 --> 00:14:50.476
This lock is ancient. It's from the 80s.

218
00:14:50.535 --> 00:14:52.275
Remember what you told me in jail?

219
00:14:52.275 --> 00:14:54.005
"There isn't a door I can't unlock."

220
00:14:54.005 --> 00:14:55.805
"I'm a global talent."

221
00:14:56.545 --> 00:14:57.545
Be quiet.

222
00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:02.486
I got it.

223
00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:03.545
Did you unlock it?

224
00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:04.785
Yes, I did.

225
00:15:22.305 --> 00:15:23.775
Soon Jung, check the computer.

226
00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:24.775
Yes, sir.

Shall I call the insurance?

237
00:17:28.826 --> 00:17:30.026
Just go, Jang Ha Ri.

238
00:17:30.026 --> 00:17:31.635
Wait. Stop.

You might report me as hit-and-run later.

Okay. Say we have a mutual agreement...

241
00:17:39.276 --> 00:17:41.945
and that you won't hold me responsible.

And she's pregnant.

302

So he didn't die of an accident?

303

A lot of people think he committed suicide.

304
00:22:32.695 --> 00:22:34.836
He killed himself leaving his pregnant wife behind?

305

he set himself on fire?

This country wasn't built overnight, you see.

340
00:24:16.405 --> 00:24:18.836
It must be so exciting to watch.

341
00:24:19.576 --> 00:24:22.846
Those nobodies are running wild.

342
00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:26.276
You must be aware of this.

343
00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:28.316
It's said people from their party...

344
00:24:28.316 --> 00:24:30.245
will be appointed as a chief of anti-corruption,

345
00:24:30.245 --> 00:24:31.856
a chief of public peace,

346
00:24:31.856 --> 00:24:33.556
a director of public prosecutions,

347
00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:35.286
and a chief of Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

348
00:24:36.326 --> 00:24:37.626
Is that right?

349
00:24:38.155 --> 00:24:39.326
Of course,

350
00:24:40.225 --> 00:24:41.766
I'm working my very best...

351
00:24:41.766 --> 00:24:43.425
to help you come back to Seoul.

352
00:24:46.695 --> 00:24:47.766
Let me pour you a drink.

353
00:24:50.106 --> 00:24:52.135
Introduce me...

354
00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:55.245
to a nice sashimi restaurant in Busan.

355
00:24:57.546 --> 00:25:00.816
I should visit at least once while you are there.

356
00:25:01.185 --> 00:25:03.415
How is the chairman's health?

357
00:25:04.556 --> 00:25:05.556
Well...

358
00:25:06.485 --> 00:25:07.786
He's gotten much better.

359
00:25:07.955 --> 00:25:09.256
Has it been two years?

360
00:25:09.256 --> 00:25:11.096
It was right after the Juhan airplane accident.

361
00:25:11.096 --> 00:25:12.096
So you're about right.

362
00:25:13.126 --> 00:25:14.225
I'm sorry.

363
00:25:14.626 --> 00:25:16.965
He became like that after hearing the news.

364
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.435
I was thoughtless.

365
00:25:18.965 --> 00:25:20.465
No, it's okay.

366
00:25:21.006 --> 00:25:23.536
Actually, he has gotten so much better...

367
00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:25.435
that he might be able to wake up soon.

368
00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:26.905
That's good to hear.

369
00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:30.106
Excuse me.

370
00:25:38.786 --> 00:25:41.556
Chairman Cha, it's nice to see you here.

371
00:25:42.026 --> 00:25:44.056
I came here to have a meal with my daughter.

372
00:25:44.326 --> 00:25:46.395
I decided to come in since it wouldn't be polite...

373
00:25:46.526 --> 00:25:48.395
not to say hello, knowing you're here.

374
00:25:49.296 --> 00:25:52.435
Congratulations on your appointment, Chief On.

375
00:25:57.076 --> 00:25:58.635
(On Joo Sik has been appointed as the Chief.)

376
00:26:01.675 --> 00:26:03.376
Congratulations, Chief On.

377
00:26:03.915 --> 00:26:05.175
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

378
00:26:05.576 --> 00:26:07.586
Congratulations on your appointment,

379
00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:08.786
Chief On.

380
00:26:12.616 --> 00:26:13.685
Let's...

381
00:26:14.225 --> 00:26:15.385
end this dinner here.

382
00:26:15.485 --> 00:26:17.425
We still have many dishes on our table.

383
00:26:17.425 --> 00:26:19.126
Will you provide me...

384
00:26:19.126 --> 00:26:21.026
a ticket to Busan tomorrow?

385
00:26:21.026 --> 00:26:23.526
It's my honor, sir.

386
00:26:42.786 --> 00:26:44.756
I won't forget about what you did for me this time.

387
00:26:45.516 --> 00:26:47.485
I didn't do anything.

388
00:26:47.485 --> 00:26:49.685
Don't mention it, sir.

389
00:26:51.796 --> 00:26:53.895
Will Chairman Joo Jung Pil wake up soon?

390
00:26:53.965 --> 00:26:55.225
I don't know.

391
00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:57.796
I haven't heard anything about it.

392
00:27:02.536 --> 00:27:05.135
He sees no further than his nose.

393
00:27:05.475 --> 00:27:06.635
Chairman Joo must be worried so much...

394
00:27:06.635 --> 00:27:08.475
even after he dies.

395
00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:09.475
I'll start driving.

396
00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:10.475
Okay.

397
00:27:11.915 --> 00:27:13.215
Goodbye.

398
00:27:20.685 --> 00:27:23.425
Gosh, he just ruined my party.

399
00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:24.995
Chairman Cha's impressive.

400
00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:27.296
I wouldn't have stayed still...

401
00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:28.495
if he hadn't been your dad.

402
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:31.895
I don't know...

403
00:27:31.895 --> 00:27:33.635
how a mere chairman of an insurance company...

404
00:27:33.635 --> 00:27:35.536
lured the chief with.

405
00:27:35.766 --> 00:27:37.876
The daughter of a mere chairman...

406
00:27:37.876 --> 00:27:38.876
will go now.

407
00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:41.046
Where do you think you're going?

408
00:27:41.046 --> 00:27:42.376
I'll give you a ride. Let's go together.

409
00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:43.945
Let me go.

410
00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:47.086
Entertain me, Hong Joo.

411
00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:49.786
You know I'll lose my dad soon.

412
00:27:49.786 --> 00:27:52.316
I'm going to be very depressed.

413
00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:54.885
What's wrong with you?

414
00:27:54.885 --> 00:27:56.586
Don't you feel sorry to your dad?

415
00:27:56.586 --> 00:27:57.655
For what?

416
00:27:58.526 --> 00:28:00.826
I mean, I'm keeping him alive...

417
00:28:00.826 --> 00:28:02.326
when he was supposed to die a long time ago.

418
00:28:02.326 --> 00:28:03.326
He should be the one to thank me.

419
00:28:03.326 --> 00:28:04.566
What's there to feel sorry?

420
00:28:07.766 --> 00:28:09.165
(Kang Woo)

421
00:28:10.266 --> 00:28:12.106
What? Who's this?

422
00:28:12.606 --> 00:28:13.606
Hello?

423
00:28:15.006 --> 00:28:17.346
Where are you going? I'm not done talking.

424
00:28:19.116 --> 00:28:21.316
Both the father and daughter are an eyesore.

425
00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:25.655
Who's the guy by the way?

426
00:28:29.725 --> 00:28:31.626
What's gotten into you...

427
00:28:31.626 --> 00:28:32.655
that you called me first?

428
00:28:32.955 --> 00:28:34.225
I have a favor to ask of you.

429
00:28:34.425 --> 00:28:35.465
What is it?

430
00:28:35.766 --> 00:28:37.026
Please check...

431
00:28:37.026 --> 00:28:38.836
if Kang Eun Joo took out an insurance...

432
00:28:38.836 --> 00:28:39.895
for Lee Soo Oh.

433
00:28:41.235 --> 00:28:42.705
I guess it's something important.

434
00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:46.506
Okay.

435
00:28:53.516 --> 00:28:55.846
It better be very important.

436
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:58.256
I'm leaking...

437
00:28:58.455 --> 00:29:00.685
our internal information now.

438
00:29:01.455 --> 00:29:02.586
It's important.

439
00:29:05.155 --> 00:29:06.655
"Insured, Lee Soo Oh".

440
00:29:06.655 --> 00:29:08.126
"Beneficiary, Kang Eun Joo".

441
00:29:08.126 --> 00:29:09.826
He signed up on July 16, 2015.

442
00:29:10.536 --> 00:29:11.695
So there is.

443
00:29:12.296 --> 00:29:13.965
- What? - Send me the file,

444
00:29:13.965 --> 00:29:15.066
please.

445
00:29:16.235 --> 00:29:17.276
Kang Woo.

446
00:29:21.776 --> 00:29:23.475
(Insured: Lee Soo Oh, Beneficiary: Kang Eun Joo)

447
00:29:23.675 --> 00:29:25.245
The insured, Lee Soo Oh.

448
00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:26.816
The beneficiary, Kang Eun Joo.

449
00:29:26.816 --> 00:29:29.016
He signed up on July 16, 2015...

450
00:29:29.485 --> 00:29:30.715
for a life insurance that gives...

451
00:29:30.715 --> 00:29:32.516
100,000 dollars for normal deaths,

452
00:29:32.516 --> 00:29:33.955
and 400,000 dollars for accidental deaths.

453
00:29:33.955 --> 00:29:37.395
Then he died on July 23, 2017.

454
00:29:37.395 --> 00:29:39.425
Even if you kill yourself, you can still...

455
00:29:39.425 --> 00:29:41.566
receive the compensation after two years, right?

456
00:29:41.566 --> 00:29:42.725
You're right.

457
00:29:43.995 --> 00:29:45.495
July 23 is...

458
00:29:45.495 --> 00:29:47.766
just a week after it marked the two years.

459
00:29:48.465 --> 00:29:50.705
There's a high possibility he committed suicide...

460
00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:52.006
for the insurance money...

461
00:29:52.006 --> 00:29:53.235
like someone I know.

462
00:29:55.205 --> 00:29:56.945
Tell us about the incident.

463
00:30:00.046 --> 00:30:02.385
July 23, 2017.

464
00:30:02.385 --> 00:30:03.415
11:30am.

465
00:30:03.415 --> 00:30:06.316
The deceased, Lee, met his friend, Han Seong Jin.

466
00:30:06.316 --> 00:30:08.086
They had a drink for about an hour.

467
00:30:08.086 --> 00:30:09.786
Lee got completely drunk,

468
00:30:10.185 --> 00:30:12.155
and Han left that place.

469
00:30:12.495 --> 00:30:13.725
About an hour later...

470
00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:16.225
Excuse me, sir.

471
00:30:26.306 --> 00:30:29.106
It looked like he was completely drained.

472
00:30:29.106 --> 00:30:31.316
He had such a grim look on his face.

473
00:30:31.715 --> 00:30:33.715
He found himself a seat in a dark corner,

474
00:30:33.715 --> 00:30:35.346
and I think he just had a glass of soju,

475
00:30:35.346 --> 00:30:36.885
then he was knocked out.

476
00:30:37.485 --> 00:30:39.016
Didn't you see the accident?

477
00:30:39.016 --> 00:30:40.786
It was a really hot day.

478
00:30:40.786 --> 00:30:42.385
We had the air conditioner on and windows closed,

479
00:30:42.385 --> 00:30:43.586
then I heard a loud noise...

480
00:30:46.756 --> 00:30:48.566
I have a heart condition,

481
00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:50.965
and it's been unstable ever since that day.

482
00:30:52.066 --> 00:30:54.066
I can't even sleep at night.

483
00:30:56.635 --> 00:30:58.106
Have you seen a doctor?

484
00:30:58.576 --> 00:31:00.776
I was busy making a living.

485
00:31:00.776 --> 00:31:02.546
But you should still get a check-up.

486
00:31:02.546 --> 00:31:06.175
You're handsome and sweet.

487
00:31:07.086 --> 00:31:08.945
Make sure you visit a doctor on your day off.

488
00:31:10.415 --> 00:31:13.655
I don't believe that con artist.

489
00:31:14.955 --> 00:31:16.955
He put on quite a show.

490
00:31:17.955 --> 00:31:19.395
Is that his know-how?

491
00:31:19.955 --> 00:31:21.026
What know-how?

492
00:31:21.096 --> 00:31:23.836
Something you could never know, Cheetah.

493
00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:26.836
Stop calling me Cheetah. Show some respect.

494
00:31:28.405 --> 00:31:30.006
Let's get the security footage...

495
00:31:30.006 --> 00:31:31.435
and interview the eyewitnesses.

496
00:31:31.435 --> 00:31:33.475
Then let's ask Detective Jo to get...

497
00:31:36.675 --> 00:31:38.616
Yes, why don't we ask Detective Jo for help?

498
00:31:38.675 --> 00:31:40.816
I've been wanting to meet him.

499
00:31:41.215 --> 00:31:42.816
We'll take care of it. Mind your own business.

500
00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:51.326
Anyway, where is our dear Mr. Choi?

501
00:31:51.596 --> 00:31:52.955
He went to meet a teacher.

502
00:31:53.155 --> 00:31:54.925
A teacher? Who?

503
00:31:55.126 --> 00:31:56.495
That's none of your business.

504
00:31:57.165 --> 00:31:58.235
Is that so?

00:32:16.385 --> 00:32:17.616
I'm sorry for the trouble.

508
00:32:18.215 --> 00:32:20.556
I have to move around to have an easy childbirth.

509

(Mad Dog, Choi Kang Woo)

510
00:32:22.955 --> 00:32:25.326
If you aren't affiliated with an insurance company,

511
00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.955
how did you know...

512
00:32:28.465 --> 00:32:29.965
Do you know who Kim Min Joon is?

513
00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:32.266
He referred me to you.

514
00:32:33.036 --> 00:32:34.465
I heard you two are well-acquainted.

515
00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:36.306
Oh, Min Joon?

516
00:32:36.866 --> 00:32:38.635
He's a kid I know from church.

517
00:32:38.836 --> 00:32:40.905
I heard you two have known each other for long.

518
00:32:41.205 --> 00:32:43.445
It's only been a few months.

519
00:32:43.705 --> 00:32:45.715
Is that what he said?

520
00:32:46.376 --> 00:32:47.715
I guess I heard him wrong.

521
00:32:48.715 --> 00:32:50.185
Isn't Min Joon such a nice kid?

522
00:32:50.556 --> 00:32:53.185
He's very faithful too. He's a good person.

523
00:32:55.026 --> 00:32:57.895
You seem like a nice person too.

524
00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:00.495
I'm not sure.

525
00:33:02.766 --> 00:33:05.395
Mr. Choi, will you please help me?

526
00:33:05.965 --> 00:33:07.606
Soo Oh didn't kill himself.

527
00:33:07.606 --> 00:33:10.405
But the police and Taeyang Insurance...

528
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:11.635
all say he killed himself.

529
00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:14.145
But he wouldn't do that.

530
00:33:15.175 --> 00:33:18.175
He's been waiting dearly to see our baby.

531
00:33:19.215 --> 00:33:21.945
He wouldn't do that, leaving us behind.

532
00:33:24.155 --> 00:33:25.385
Please reveal the truth.

533
00:33:27.086 --> 00:33:29.256
Please help me, Mr. Choi.

534
00:33:38.435 --> 00:33:41.006
Be ready before you watch the footage.

535
00:33:41.165 --> 00:33:42.205
Thanks.

536
00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:44.705
The case may get closed with a suicide.

537
00:33:44.705 --> 00:33:45.806
Did the detective in charge say that?

538
00:33:46.876 --> 00:33:49.376
The deceased was by himself when he died,

539
00:33:49.376 --> 00:33:51.475
and the day he died marked two years and a week...

540
00:33:51.475 --> 00:33:53.475
after he signed up for that life insurance.

541
00:33:53.475 --> 00:33:55.346
That way, he could...

542
00:33:55.346 --> 00:33:57.955
leave the compensation even if he kills himself.

543
00:34:00.586 --> 00:34:01.756
Can you...

544
00:34:02.885 --> 00:34:04.326
run a background check?

545
00:34:05.856 --> 00:34:07.165
Was someone at the crime scene?

546
00:34:14.506 --> 00:34:15.606
Thank you.

547
00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:19.636
Kang Eun Joo.

548
00:34:20.776 --> 00:34:22.406
Isn't this the deceased's wife?

549
00:34:22.475 --> 00:34:23.606
Is she the killer?

550
00:34:23.606 --> 00:34:25.046
I need her family's address,

551
00:34:25.046 --> 00:34:26.515
and any other residence she stayed in until today.

552
00:34:27.845 --> 00:34:30.515
You must be determined to get me fired.

553
00:34:30.515 --> 00:34:32.316
Things got very harsh for breaking...

554
00:34:32.316 --> 00:34:33.856
the Public Service Ethics Act.

555
00:34:33.856 --> 00:34:35.725
You just have to run her social security number...

556
00:34:36.285 --> 00:34:39.455
Okay, fine. Don't do it. My gosh.

557
00:34:39.825 --> 00:34:42.526
So is she the killer?

558
00:34:44.095 --> 00:34:45.836
I have no idea.

559
00:34:46.296 --> 00:34:49.106
Why can't I see anything clearly?

560
00:34:49.106 --> 00:34:50.935
It's all so murky.

561
00:34:54.575 --> 00:34:56.606
My gosh, this won't help clear things up.

562
00:34:56.606 --> 00:34:59.046
Hey, this is really the last time, okay?

563
00:35:01.785 --> 00:35:03.046
Thanks.

564
00:35:05.356 --> 00:35:07.685
(Mad Dog, Jang Ha Ri)

565
00:35:09.156 --> 00:35:10.526
It's my fault.

566
00:35:12.225 --> 00:35:13.926
Only if I had taken him home.

567
00:35:14.765 --> 00:35:16.526
Then why did you leave first?

568
00:35:16.725 --> 00:35:18.395
My lunchtime was over.

569
00:35:18.836 --> 00:35:20.236
I had a lot of work,

570
00:35:20.636 --> 00:35:22.765
so I barely made time to have lunch with him.

571
00:35:24.475 --> 00:35:26.276
I thought he would wake up after a bit.

572
00:35:28.645 --> 00:35:30.106
I should've taken him home.

573
00:35:33.946 --> 00:35:35.015
Professor.

574
00:35:35.015 --> 00:35:36.486
Oh, did I spray you?

575
00:35:36.886 --> 00:35:37.915
Sorry.

576
00:35:42.126 --> 00:35:43.486
What's the seat made of?

577
00:35:43.756 --> 00:35:45.026
Artificial leather.

578
00:35:45.256 --> 00:35:46.995
Artificial leather is made of plastic,

579
00:35:47.066 --> 00:35:48.595
so it burns very quickly.

580
00:35:48.665 --> 00:35:51.535
So you can't get an ignition point.

581
00:35:51.865 --> 00:35:53.095
At the time of the fire,

582
00:35:53.095 --> 00:35:55.906
no one else was around except for the victim.

583
00:35:56.265 --> 00:35:57.876
How did the fire get started?

584
00:35:59.035 --> 00:36:00.075
Remotely?

585
00:36:00.276 --> 00:36:03.145
Goodness, Hollywood has ruined a generation.

586
00:36:03.305 --> 00:36:04.546
Did you find anything...

587
00:36:04.546 --> 00:36:06.515
that could've been used to put it on fire remotely?

588
00:36:13.156 --> 00:36:14.325
That's not it.

589
00:36:15.156 --> 00:36:16.386
Do you think he killed himself?

590
00:36:16.555 --> 00:36:18.126
Hey, former medical examiner.

591
00:36:18.595 --> 00:36:20.725
Have you seen anyone set himself on fire like this?

592
00:36:20.725 --> 00:36:21.865
No.

593
00:36:22.696 --> 00:36:23.836
What about you, Fire Truck?

594
00:36:23.836 --> 00:36:25.736
Me either.

595
00:36:26.336 --> 00:36:28.566
People determined to set fire on themselves...

596
00:36:28.566 --> 00:36:31.006
tend to use catalysts like gasoline.

597
00:36:31.575 --> 00:36:33.336
It takes a long time...

598
00:36:33.336 --> 00:36:34.745
for a body to burn.

599
00:36:34.745 --> 00:36:37.075
And it's unbelievably painful.

600
00:36:37.475 --> 00:36:38.915
If he set himself on fire,

601
00:36:38.915 --> 00:36:40.745
that means he was still conscious.

602
00:36:40.745 --> 00:36:42.216
He couldn't have stood it.

603
00:36:42.216 --> 00:36:44.055
He was still conscious...

604
00:36:46.756 --> 00:36:47.785
Stop.

605
00:36:48.386 --> 00:36:50.696
This was what caused the explosion.

606
00:36:50.696 --> 00:36:52.055
Isn't it?

607
00:36:52.455 --> 00:36:54.325
Do you think this lighter is the catalyst?

608
00:36:54.325 --> 00:36:56.225
It's not like that's a gas tank.

609
00:36:56.225 --> 00:36:58.495
You can't tell when it'll explode.

610
00:36:58.495 --> 00:37:01.165
If the lighter exploded, there would've been...

611
00:37:01.165 --> 00:37:04.075
loud sound, bright light, and it must've been hot.

612
00:37:04.136 --> 00:37:06.376
Why didn't he get out of the car?

613
00:37:07.176 --> 00:37:08.205
Noo Ri.

614
00:37:08.546 --> 00:37:09.645
Rewind.

615
00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:12.145
Play.

616
00:37:14.946 --> 00:37:15.946
Again.

617
00:37:18.285 --> 00:37:19.356
Again.

618
00:37:25.725 --> 00:37:26.926
A flash.

619
00:37:28.595 --> 00:37:29.865
A seizure.

620
00:37:33.365 --> 00:37:35.066
- Professor Byeon. - What?

621
00:37:35.265 --> 00:37:36.966
Is there an illness...

622
00:37:36.966 --> 00:37:38.376
that gives you a seizure...

623
00:37:38.975 --> 00:37:40.106
whenever you see a bright flash?

624
00:37:42.176 --> 00:37:44.546
Oh, there is one.

625
00:37:44.975 --> 00:37:46.176
Lafora disease.

626
00:37:49.216 --> 00:37:52.156
It's a disease caused by gene mutation.

627
00:37:52.785 --> 00:37:55.285
It weakens a person against bright light.

628

<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E03 Mad Dog "Playing Cat & Mouse"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

629
00:38:07.506 --> 00:38:09.205
If you wear specialized goggles,

630
00:38:09.506 --> 00:38:11.606
you could stay in a room even if it's bright.

631
00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:17.075
But you would have to live in darkness.

632
00:38:28.086 --> 00:38:29.986
It gets developed during one's teenage years,

633
00:38:30.395 --> 00:38:32.756
so I doubt he could've signed up for insurance.

634
00:38:36.796 --> 00:38:37.895
Did Mr. Lee Soo Oh...

635
00:38:38.535 --> 00:38:39.935
suffer from Lafora disease?

636
00:38:40.906 --> 00:38:41.935
Mr. Choi.

637
00:38:42.435 --> 00:38:43.736
Don't be scared.

638
00:38:43.975 --> 00:38:45.906
You'll get the money. They'll pay you.

639
00:38:48.276 --> 00:38:50.876
Even if he signed up hiding his disease,

640
00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:52.216
even if it was insurance fraud,

641
00:38:52.946 --> 00:38:54.546
the law says...

642
00:38:54.546 --> 00:38:56.645
if he did not die due to that disease,

643
00:38:56.645 --> 00:38:58.115
you will receive the insurance money.

644
00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:01.126
100,000 for suicide, 400,000 for accidents.

645
00:39:01.685 --> 00:39:03.185
Mr. Lee knew that, didn't he?

646
00:39:04.095 --> 00:39:05.426
No, Mr. Choi.

647
00:39:06.926 --> 00:39:09.466
He's not someone who would kill himself for money.

648
00:39:09.466 --> 00:39:10.566
There are many people...

649
00:39:11.566 --> 00:39:12.995
who kill themselves for money.

650
00:39:13.935 --> 00:39:15.466
And your husband is one of them.

651
00:39:15.636 --> 00:39:16.805
No!

652
00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:21.276
You met Han Seong Jin, didn't you?

653
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:22.946
It's him.

654
00:39:22.946 --> 00:39:24.816
He killed my husband.

655
00:39:24.816 --> 00:39:26.716
Research results for new Lafora drugs.

656
00:39:27.345 --> 00:39:29.345
That man was after...

657
00:39:29.345 --> 00:39:31.685
what Soo Oh devoted his life to.

658
00:39:32.615 --> 00:39:34.256
Yes, that's him.

659
00:39:35.586 --> 00:39:36.886
It's him!

660
00:39:39.296 --> 00:39:40.296
Kim Min Joon.

661
00:39:40.995 --> 00:39:42.196
What's your relationship with him?

662
00:39:42.825 --> 00:39:45.136
I know him from church.

663
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:46.196
Kim Min Joon.

664
00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:49.106
What's your relationship with him?

665
00:39:49.705 --> 00:39:51.376
- Church... - Kim Min...

666
00:39:52.276 --> 00:39:53.475
Kim Min Joon.

667
00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:56.676
What's your relationship with him?

668
00:39:57.816 --> 00:40:00.015
He said he'd help.

669
00:40:02.415 --> 00:40:05.886
He said he'd listen to my story.

670
00:40:20.265 --> 00:40:21.935
You knew I'd come, didn't you?

671
00:40:24.276 --> 00:40:25.736
He just told me to let...

672
00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:27.035
Choi Kang Woo in if he came.

673
00:40:27.205 --> 00:40:30.046
He said you'd take care of everything then.

674
00:40:30.145 --> 00:40:31.475

Please help me.

678
00:40:42.555 --> 00:40:44.555
I don't work with scammers.

Until I clear Soo Oh's name,

685
00:41:10.555 --> 00:41:12.515
I won't take the insurance money.

My baby and I...

687

688
00:41:24.296 --> 00:41:25.435

How can you use a person like her?

A person like her? Who?

The insurance scammer?

700

Why did you drag us into this?

Why?

705
00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:10.676
Because it's an insurance scam?

706
00:43:12.035 --> 00:43:14.205
You should still uncover the truth.

She looks completely innocent.

But she hid the medical history...

717
00:43:41.705 --> 00:43:42.906
and applied for insurance.

718

You can't tell someone by their appearance.

719

Probably not because it's a scam case.

00:44:06.526 --> 00:44:08.926
What about the USB containing all the clips?

728

It's a different version.

739
00:44:41.966 --> 00:44:42.995
Kang Woo is in the story.

740
00:44:42.995 --> 00:44:45.236
Don't do it.

On August 27,

761
00:45:36.415 --> 00:45:37.415
you were...

762
00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:39.685
caught speeding.

Who was this guy...

765
00:45:45.555 --> 00:45:47.066
in the passenger seat?

766
00:45:48.895 --> 00:45:50.466
A man died!

767

It's a murder.

Set Byul.

771
00:45:58.606 --> 00:45:59.705
It's this man.

772
00:46:01.106 --> 00:46:02.276
This man is a gangster.

773
00:46:02.276 --> 00:46:03.546
He's an ex-convict.

774
00:46:03.546 --> 00:46:06.245
I was too scared of him.

775
00:46:06.245 --> 00:46:08.245
So I just did what he told me to.

776
00:46:09.415 --> 00:46:10.486
Set Byul.

777
00:46:10.886 --> 00:46:12.356

Why are you doing this to me?

782
00:46:20.395 --> 00:46:21.426
I quit being a gangster,

783
00:46:21.765 --> 00:46:24.365
so I could live with you happily.

784

785
00:46:26.595 --> 00:46:28.435

Park Soon Jung.

791
00:46:41.745 --> 00:46:43.886
I was released on November 21, 2007.

792
00:46:43.886 --> 00:46:45.285
I have a criminal record for violence.

00:46:56.825 --> 00:46:57.935
It was me.

794
00:46:58.765 --> 00:47:00.035
Set Byul, no...

795
00:47:01.566 --> 00:47:03.336
Oh Mi Ja didn't do anything wrong.

796
00:47:04.006 --> 00:47:05.176
I did everything.

797
00:47:15.446 --> 00:47:16.946
Park Soon Jung. Come out.

798
00:47:17.415 --> 00:47:19.515
A false confession is obstructing investigation.

799
00:47:19.515 --> 00:47:21.656
Get out before I change my mind.

800
00:47:33.035 --> 00:47:34.205
Gosh.

801
00:47:34.836 --> 00:47:36.466
Why did you say you did it...

when there was no proof?

803

Without Choi Kang Woo from Taeyang Insurance,

804
00:47:40.236 --> 00:47:42.406
you would've been sent to jail for 10 years.

805
00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:43.975
Come out and thank him.

806
00:47:49.185 --> 00:47:50.345
Set Byul...

807
00:47:50.756 --> 00:47:51.756
I mean...

808
00:47:52.856 --> 00:47:53.955
Where is Mi Ja?

809
00:47:54.026 --> 00:47:55.526
She's in Cambodia with Na Jong Gu.

810
00:48:02.566 --> 00:48:03.595
Eat something.

811
00:48:13.106 --> 00:48:14.106
Why did you...

812
00:48:15.046 --> 00:48:16.645
set a criminal free?

813
00:48:18.345 --> 00:48:20.145
Love isn't a crime.

814
00:48:21.886 --> 00:48:22.886
It is...

815
00:48:23.915 --> 00:48:25.086
for me.

816
00:48:30.086 --> 00:48:31.095
You're a good man.

817
00:48:33.595 --> 00:48:34.865
You're a very good man.

818
00:48:35.365 --> 00:48:36.395
Park Soon Jung.

819
00:48:49.975 --> 00:48:51.216
That was the first time...

820
00:48:52.645 --> 00:48:54.285
someone called me a good man.

821
00:48:57.115 --> 00:48:58.115
Kang Woo.

822
00:48:59.086 --> 00:49:01.126
Are we off the Lee Soo Oh case?

823
00:49:01.555 --> 00:49:03.256
It's a fraud case.

824
00:49:03.256 --> 00:49:04.555
Yes, it is.

825
00:49:04.955 --> 00:49:06.955
But you can't tell just by its appearance.

826
00:49:14.736 --> 00:49:16.205
Goodness.

827
00:49:21.546 --> 00:49:23.705
I'm home.

828
00:49:42.595 --> 00:49:44.595
Hey, Detective Jo.

829
00:49:45.595 --> 00:49:47.535
Why did you call me at this hour?

830
00:49:47.765 --> 00:49:49.566
You asked me to find out about something...

831
00:49:49.566 --> 00:49:51.276
regarding the case you're investigating on now.

832
00:49:51.836 --> 00:49:53.035
Was it Kang Eun Joo?

833
00:49:53.276 --> 00:49:54.645
She's almost due, right?

834
00:49:55.106 --> 00:49:56.145
What about her?

835
00:49:56.145 --> 00:49:57.975
She's in our station now for assaulting someone.

836
00:50:02.845 --> 00:50:03.856
She keeps visiting me...

837
00:50:03.856 --> 00:50:05.816
and claims that I killed her husband.

838
00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:07.386
It's driving me crazy.

839
00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:12.225
I felt pity on her, so I held it in until now.

840
00:50:15.426 --> 00:50:18.165
I'm going to sue her this time for certain.

841
00:50:18.365 --> 00:50:19.895
Still, she's pregnant.

842
00:50:19.895 --> 00:50:21.705
Why don't you let it slide?

843
00:50:21.836 --> 00:50:23.736
I have a four-year-old daughter too.

844
00:50:23.736 --> 00:50:25.836
She's scared to death.

845
00:50:29.506 --> 00:50:32.245
Ma'am. Say something, will you?

846
00:50:32.645 --> 00:50:34.486
You could be sent to a detention center.

847
00:50:43.725 --> 00:50:44.895
Crazy witch.

848
00:50:47.265 --> 00:50:48.265
Excuse me.

849
00:50:54.336 --> 00:50:56.836
Ma'am. Think of your baby.

850
00:50:56.836 --> 00:50:59.305
Call someone who can vouch for you.

851
00:50:59.305 --> 00:51:00.446
Don't you have anyone?

852
00:51:04.615 --> 00:51:05.975
I'm her guardian.

853
00:51:07.285 --> 00:51:08.685
Oh, hello.

854
00:51:26.466 --> 00:51:27.506
Sir.

855
00:52:00.035 --> 00:52:01.305
Are you Choi Kang Woo?

856
00:52:01.305 --> 00:52:02.705
Yes, I am.

857
00:52:03.035 --> 00:52:05.006
I'm Choi Chang Min, an ambulance worker.

858
00:52:05.435 --> 00:52:07.546
I called you because I found your business card.

859
00:52:08.245 --> 00:52:09.676
Do you know Kang Eun Joo?

860
00:52:13.046 --> 00:52:14.845
She called an ambulance herself,

861
00:52:14.845 --> 00:52:17.216
but she was unconscious when we got there.

862
00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:30.095
No.

863
00:52:30.966 --> 00:52:33.736
Soo Oh didn't do it Please help me.

864
00:52:37.676 --> 00:52:39.776
I don't work with scammers.

865
00:52:51.555 --> 00:52:53.825
I heard things were crazy because of...

866
00:52:53.825 --> 00:52:55.785
- the emergency patient. - Yes.

867
00:52:55.785 --> 00:52:57.126
How is she?

868
00:53:00.356 --> 00:53:03.395
(Obstetrics)

869
00:53:06.466 --> 00:53:07.466
Ma'am.

870
00:53:07.935 --> 00:53:09.636
The baby is getting better.

871
00:53:10.676 --> 00:53:12.236
The mother is the problem.

872
00:53:12.836 --> 00:53:15.145
She had a long cardiac arrest during the surgery.

873
00:53:15.475 --> 00:53:16.745
We're not sure...

874
00:53:16.745 --> 00:53:18.216
if she'll wake up from a coma.

875
00:53:20.546 --> 00:53:22.386
Was it you who caused the trouble?

876
00:53:22.386 --> 00:53:23.685
That's not true.

877
00:53:24.156 --> 00:53:25.785
We didn't do anything.

878
00:53:25.785 --> 00:53:27.225
Then what's wrong with you all?

879
00:53:27.225 --> 00:53:29.586
I saw your boss being by her side.

880
00:53:30.895 --> 00:53:31.926
That's...

881
00:53:33.455 --> 00:53:34.926
It's because we didn't do anything.

882
00:53:42.336 --> 00:53:44.406
Only a few numbers were saved in her phone.

883
00:53:44.406 --> 00:53:45.676
They all said they couldn't come.

884
00:53:50.615 --> 00:53:51.615
Mr. Choi.

885
00:53:52.716 --> 00:53:54.515
Kang Eun Joo has no family.

886
00:53:55.785 --> 00:53:56.845
She's an orphan.

887
00:53:57.785 --> 00:54:00.685
It seemed like she called you at dawn.

888
00:54:01.126 --> 00:54:02.325
You didn't take it, did you?

889
00:54:09.066 --> 00:54:10.265
(1 voice mail from Kang Eun Joo)

890
00:54:10.265 --> 00:54:11.696
(1 voice mail from Kang Eun Joo)

891
00:54:11.696 --> 00:54:14.365
Mr. Kang. This is Eun Joo.

892
00:54:15.006 --> 00:54:16.906
I'm sorry about earlier today.

893
00:54:17.535 --> 00:54:19.876
I guess I wanted to keep the petty pride of mine.

894
00:54:20.805 --> 00:54:22.705
I hope you aren't upset.

895
00:54:24.946 --> 00:54:28.015
I kept thinking about it.

896
00:54:28.886 --> 00:54:31.415
What if he really did that?

897
00:54:31.915 --> 00:54:33.455
If he killed himself...

898
00:54:33.856 --> 00:54:35.725
leaving me and our baby behind...

899
00:54:36.026 --> 00:54:38.856
But Mr. Kang. He didn't.

900
00:54:40.426 --> 00:54:42.626
He really wanted to live.

901
00:54:43.325 --> 00:54:45.736
He wanted to live at least for one more day.

902
00:54:47.035 --> 00:54:48.736
It's all in his laptop.

903
00:54:49.165 --> 00:54:50.676
The research about Lafora disease...

904
00:54:50.676 --> 00:54:52.106
and his diary too.

905
00:54:52.435 --> 00:54:54.276
Please read it.

906
00:54:54.845 --> 00:54:56.606
I only have you.

907
00:54:58.276 --> 00:55:00.376
Please help me.

908
00:55:43.555 --> 00:55:44.626
Hey.

909
00:55:45.595 --> 00:55:46.856
What are you doing here?

910
00:55:49.725 --> 00:55:50.935
What do you mean?

911
00:55:51.495 --> 00:55:54.336
I'm looking for useful evidence.

912
00:56:04.776 --> 00:56:06.276
Where's the laptop?

913
00:56:06.316 --> 00:56:07.515
What laptop?

914
00:56:09.515 --> 00:56:10.955
There's not much in here.

915
00:56:11.316 --> 00:56:12.486
(Mother's Note)

916
00:56:13.055 --> 00:56:15.026
You crazy punk.

917
00:56:22.426 --> 00:56:23.526
Hey, Min Joon.

918
00:56:23.966 --> 00:56:27.265
You're looking for useful evidence?

919
00:56:27.535 --> 00:56:28.805
This isn't...

920
00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:30.935
what you're looking for.

921
00:56:32.535 --> 00:56:34.475
- Then what is it? - Kim Bum Joon!

922
00:56:35.845 --> 00:56:37.975
You must wonder...

923
00:56:38.475 --> 00:56:40.276
whether he's the killer or not.

924
00:56:41.446 --> 00:56:42.685
People all say this...

925
00:56:43.245 --> 00:56:45.316
about the Juhan Air 801 accident.

926
00:56:45.785 --> 00:56:46.955
Some lunatic crashed a plane...

927
00:56:46.955 --> 00:56:49.285
with 190 passengers onboard.

928
00:56:49.926 --> 00:56:51.696
67 people died...

929
00:56:52.395 --> 00:56:54.095
and 123 people got injured.

930
00:56:54.495 --> 00:56:56.466
And that lunatic is your brother.

931
00:57:02.066 --> 00:57:03.205
Do you want me...

932
00:57:04.006 --> 00:57:05.876
to tell you what Bum Joon...

933
00:57:06.876 --> 00:57:08.176
really did?

934
00:57:08.745 --> 00:57:09.805
Tell me.

935
00:57:10.446 --> 00:57:12.216
Kim Yong Joo was 23 years old.

936
00:57:12.716 --> 00:57:14.515
Since she was in high school,

937
00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:17.256
she never got to go on a trip to Jeju Island.

938
00:57:17.716 --> 00:57:19.716
She didn't want to burden her mom...

939
00:57:19.716 --> 00:57:21.026
who cleaned bathrooms for a living.

940
00:57:21.886 --> 00:57:23.285
Her best friends,

941
00:57:23.285 --> 00:57:24.656
Mi Kyung and Sun Min,

942
00:57:25.555 --> 00:57:27.095
were going on a trip to Jeju.

943
00:57:27.095 --> 00:57:28.395
And her mom...

944
00:57:29.696 --> 00:57:31.935
saved money on eating expenses...

945
00:57:33.466 --> 00:57:35.636
and bought a ticket which was to depart...

946
00:57:36.336 --> 00:57:38.435
at 10:40am on October 11, 2015.

947
00:57:40.506 --> 00:57:41.506
She bought...

948
00:57:42.906 --> 00:57:45.115
a dress worth 30 dollars for her daughter too.

949
00:57:46.645 --> 00:57:48.216
She liked it so much.

950
00:57:49.185 --> 00:57:50.245
And that dress...

951
00:57:51.615 --> 00:57:53.515
was found in her bag.

952
00:57:55.526 --> 00:57:56.555
It became...

953
00:57:58.225 --> 00:57:59.856
her shroud.

954
00:58:01.995 --> 00:58:03.325
Yong Joo's mom...

955
00:58:04.365 --> 00:58:05.736
sent her away...

956
00:58:06.995 --> 00:58:08.765
and followed her only after two months.

957
00:58:11.106 --> 00:58:12.975
Why didn't I die?

958
00:58:14.446 --> 00:58:16.305
Why didn't I follow my family?

959
00:58:19.446 --> 00:58:20.685
Because of you.

960
00:58:21.816 --> 00:58:24.816
A jerk like you received 3.4 million dollars...

961
00:58:24.816 --> 00:58:26.685
and is living in luxury.

962
00:58:26.685 --> 00:58:28.285
So how can I die?

963
00:58:31.926 --> 00:58:33.256
Scums like you...

964
00:58:35.196 --> 00:58:37.495
must all be sent to prison.

965
00:58:39.196 --> 00:58:41.836
Those punks who attempt to live off others' lives...

966
00:58:43.975 --> 00:58:45.705
must all be put in jail.

Breathe and do nothing all your life.

970
00:58:58.386 --> 00:58:59.685
Don't do anything.

971
00:58:59.955 --> 00:59:00.986
Just...

972
00:59:02.086 --> 00:59:03.955
breathe only.

973
00:59:05.796 --> 00:59:07.265
Otherwise...

974
00:59:07.265 --> 00:59:08.865
Otherwise, you punk.

975
00:59:20.845 --> 00:59:22.276
You'll die.

976
00:59:35.986 --> 00:59:37.526
Hey, can we please meet somewhere far?

977
00:59:37.526 --> 00:59:38.656
It'd be better if we never meet.

978
00:59:38.955 --> 00:59:40.426
Where's Kang Eun Joo's personal information?

979
00:59:41.926 --> 00:59:43.026
Her original address is in Gimpo.

980
00:59:43.026 --> 00:59:44.365
She's got no family.

981
00:59:45.095 --> 00:59:47.236
- Are you sure? - She's an orphan.

982
00:59:47.506 --> 00:59:48.966
She grew up in Gimpo,

983
00:59:49.035 --> 00:59:50.906
then moved out to Donam-dong.

984
00:59:50.906 --> 00:59:52.276
After that, she continued to live there.

985
00:59:54.406 --> 00:59:55.805
Okay, I'll call you later.

986
00:59:55.845 --> 00:59:56.946
Hey, wait.

987
00:59:57.176 --> 00:59:58.716
- What is it? - What?

988
00:59:58.716 --> 01:00:00.915
Are you sure you're after the fire incident?

989
01:00:01.046 --> 01:00:02.285
What is it? Be honest.

990
01:00:02.486 --> 01:00:03.615
Why are you investigating like crazy?

991
01:00:05.256 --> 01:00:07.386
I'll get this jerk first, then I'll call you.

992
01:00:07.386 --> 01:00:09.026
So who is that jerk?

993
01:00:09.325 --> 01:00:10.325
Hey...

994
01:00:12.256 --> 01:00:13.765
Find out where Kim Min Joon has been to.

995
01:00:13.765 --> 01:00:15.966
See if he's been to Gimpo or Donam-dong.

996
01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:19.165
He's...

997
01:00:20.035 --> 01:00:21.466
in Gimpo right now.

01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:46.895
Did you do your homework?

1001
01:00:47.926 --> 01:00:48.966
Yes.

1002
01:00:49.495 --> 01:00:51.395
The director was looking for you.

1003
01:00:51.395 --> 01:00:52.495
You should go find her.

1004
01:01:05.276 --> 01:01:08.345
Bum Joon, I'll be a good boy.

1005
01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.555
Please take me with you to aunt's place.

1006
01:01:11.656 --> 01:01:12.656
Go.

1007
01:01:13.156 --> 01:01:14.586
I'm not your brother anymore.

The cause of Flight JH 801's crash...

1012
01:02:07.406 --> 01:02:08.776
is most likely a suicide crash of...

the assistant pilot Kim,

01:02:10.615 --> 01:02:14.015
aiming to take insurance money.

1015
01:02:14.015 --> 01:02:15.816
Also, Ms. Lee,

1016
01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:17.785
who used to be his insurance planner,

1017
01:02:17.785 --> 01:02:21.656
hung herself to death last October 23.

1018
01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:24.395
Her suicide is giving more attention to the crash.

1019
01:02:48.546 --> 01:02:51.515
(Mad Dog)

1020
01:02:52.086 --> 01:02:54.356
Try to change the way you think.

1021
01:02:54.356 --> 01:02:55.886
Something that is odd,

1022
01:02:55.886 --> 01:02:58.196
something you cannot possibly accept.

1023
01:02:58.455 --> 01:03:00.196
I need to look for the dead.

1024
01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:01.765
How does Lee Soo Oh's case...

1025
01:03:01.765 --> 01:03:03.595
tie in with Lee Mi Ran?

1026
01:03:03.595 --> 01:03:05.035
Where is he right now?

1027
01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.865
I'll find out everything there is about you...

1028
01:03:07.865 --> 01:03:10.636
to show your true colors. Look forward to it.

1029
01:03:10.975 --> 01:03:13.406
So Moo Shin met with Han Seong Jin?

1030
01:03:13.406 --> 01:03:15.606
Are you going to let Kim Min Joon join us?

1031
01:03:15.705 --> 01:03:16.805
The more foolish I look,

1032
01:03:16.805 --> 01:03:18.075
the more they will let their guard down.

1033
01:03:18.075 --> 01:03:19.075
Good job.

1034
01:03:19.276 --> 01:03:21.486
It's mission impossible. Should we get going?

1035
01:03:21.486 --> 01:03:23.245
- The virus! - Min Joon?

1036
01:03:23.446 --> 01:03:26.115
Some other person also asked about you.

1037
01:03:26.156 --> 01:03:27.825
Who's that teacher?
