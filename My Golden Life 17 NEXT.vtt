3
00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:09.932
Are you done yet? You said you've seen the movie.

4
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:14.342
Seo Ji An, this is too dangerous.

5
00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:15.571
Get out, will you?

6
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:16.911
Just a moment.

7
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:19.382
I'll just bribe my aunt's driver.

8
00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:20.641
Get out from under there.

9
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.911
I did it.

10
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:23.281
You did it?

11
00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:29.992
Look.

12
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.791
You did it.

13
00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:45.815
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

14
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:56.581
I did it.

15
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:03.192
You did it.

16
00:01:03.192 --> 00:01:06.992
The car won't start with this one wire missing.

17
00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:09.222
But try it just in case.

18
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:11.231
Okay.

19
00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:20.871
If it doesn't work, we'll have to push the car.

20
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:22.171
I see.

21
00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:25.912
- See? It won't start. - Right.

22
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:27.711
What a relief.

23
00:01:28.942 --> 00:01:31.181
Don't laugh. How could you laugh now?

24
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.052
I'll move the rocks behind.

25
00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:37.121
Hey. That's too dangerous. No. Hey.

26
00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:40.461
Hey, that's too dangerous. You know that, right?

27
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:43.632
(No Jin Hee)

28
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:45.931
It's my aunt.

29
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.231
Hello.

30
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:53.102
I've called my driver. You don't need to come.

31
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:55.371
You don't need us?

32
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.811
There's a traffic jam due to an accident on the way.

33
00:01:57.811 --> 00:01:59.272
We must get going now.

34
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:01.612
Put Eun Seok on the phone.

35
00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:05.151
Grandfather wants to talk with Eun Seok.

36
00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:06.882
Sure.

37
00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:10.791
They're leaving early due to a traffic jam.

38
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:18.991
Hello.

39
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:21.632
I won't get to see you before I leave.

40
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:24.301
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:26.942
I'll see you when I come back...

42
00:02:26.942 --> 00:02:27.942
for the anniversary event.

43
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:31.372
Please take care.

44
00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:35.382
That's why I'm leaving. To stay healthy.

45
00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:39.182
Goodbye.

46
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:50.132
What is it?

47
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:52.162
I'm just surprised.

48
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:55.361
I mean, look at your face. Gosh.

49
00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:02.241
Oh, no. This is hard to wash off.

50
00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:10.852
What are you doing?

51
00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:12.821
What?

52
00:03:13.282 --> 00:03:15.981
Hey, why did you insist when you couldn't do it?

53
00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:18.421
You're so stubborn.

54
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:20.321
If you gave up when I told you to,

55
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.092
the car wouldn't have broken down.

56
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:26.432
You're right.

57
00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:28.801
What do you mean I'm right?

58
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.402
Your car broke down for nothing.

59
00:03:32.902 --> 00:03:34.301
I know you're upset.

60
00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:36.741
Do you think I'm that cheap?

61
00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:38.671
Just for this car when it can be fixed?

62
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:43.081
Then are you upset because I did something...

63
00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:46.652
that you couldn't do?

64
00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:47.752
Why would I?

65
00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:50.521
You're the oddball to be able to do that.

66
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.261
Am I the oddball for not being able to do that?

67
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.331
I mean, why must I know about cars?

68
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:58.391
I pay people to do it for me.

69
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.731
Not all men are car experts.

70
00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:06.002
I used to work at a driving school...

71
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:07.801
until I started attending university.

72
00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:11.641
I got all the free driving licenses available.

73
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.182
I used to drive buses when I was off school.

74
00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:18.611
That's how I know the location of the engine.

75
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:21.481
You had so many jobs.

76
00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:24.991
Sorry for breaking your car.

77
00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:27.691
Stop.

78
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:29.691
Don't touch it.

79
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:34.431
Secretary Yoo,

80
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:36.702
I'll send you my location. Send me a cab,

81
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:39.272
and get my car fixed.

82
00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:42.402
But your insurance will give us a ride back.

83
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:49.652
Let's go.

84
00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.311
Where are we going?

85
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.852
To the main road so we can get a cab easily.

86
00:04:58.291 --> 00:04:59.691
He's very angry.

87
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:26.481
I should get back to work.

88
00:05:26.782 --> 00:05:27.981
I must work on the advertisement...

89
00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:30.652
of our Satisfying the Five Senses event...

90
00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:33.191
Haesung Corporation main office, please.

91
00:05:48.272 --> 00:05:49.342
You should go in.

92
00:05:49.842 --> 00:05:50.912
Yes.

93
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.681
I'm sorry you couldn't even have dinner.

94
00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:36.121
I'm glad I didn't have to face the chairman.

95
00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.871
(40th anniversary event date)

96
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.282
Ji Tae's getting married next Tuesday.

97
00:07:05.012 --> 00:07:07.881
Now it looks like it's for a newlywed couple, right?

98
00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:10.191
Right. Your father did a great job.

99
00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:14.262
Does she like the vanity table Ji Soo brought?

100
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.092
I showed her the picture. She said she likes it.

101
00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:19.262
Of course. I chose it myself.

102
00:07:20.102 --> 00:07:23.001
Right. Just think of this place...

103
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:26.501
as a free, temporary shelter.

104
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:30.311
Ji An.

105
00:07:31.572 --> 00:07:34.282
You just called when we're all together.

106
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:38.881
Ji Soo. I'm busy, so I'll be quick.

107
00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:42.082
I can't make it to Ji Tae's wedding...

108
00:07:42.082 --> 00:07:43.522
because of work.

109
00:07:44.152 --> 00:07:46.191
You can't make it to Ji Tae's wedding?

110
00:07:48.262 --> 00:07:49.861
Is there a problem there?

111
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:53.762
Can't you just tell them and stop by?

112
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:56.501
I was already scheduled to go on a business trip.

113
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:58.472
Ji Tae didn't give me a heads up.

114
00:07:59.072 --> 00:08:02.072
I'll call Ji Tae later. Bye.

115
00:08:08.212 --> 00:08:11.051
Ji An says she can't make it to the wedding.

116
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:13.952
She's going on a business trip.

117
00:08:15.551 --> 00:08:17.251
So this is how we drift apart.

118
00:08:18.022 --> 00:08:20.022
She said she'll call you later.

119
00:08:21.092 --> 00:08:22.291
I'm home.

120
00:08:23.092 --> 00:08:26.702
Let's jump with a pair of new shoes

121
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:29.602
Here. A wedding gift for you and your wife.

122
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:32.901
How could you buy them shoes without asking?

123
00:08:32.972 --> 00:08:35.771
Don't you believe me, Mother?

124
00:08:35.942 --> 00:08:38.771
I sent the pictures to his wife,

125
00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:40.981
and she chose it herself.

126
00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.751
Hey, where did you get that money?

127
00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:46.381
I saved up.

128
00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:54.322
What were you thinking?

129
00:08:54.322 --> 00:08:55.792
No son-in-law...

130
00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:57.731
takes his father-in-law to the airport every time.

131
00:08:57.731 --> 00:08:59.231
He's the chairman.

132
00:08:59.231 --> 00:09:00.462
He's also my father-in-law.

133
00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:06.141
Since when did you find my father so comfortable?

134
00:09:08.102 --> 00:09:09.741
Tell me if you have any problems.

135
00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:13.312
Don't be swayed by your emotions and act foolish.

136
00:09:13.312 --> 00:09:14.981
Foolish... Did you just say foolish?

137
00:09:14.981 --> 00:09:16.981
You said my sister and I are disgusting.

138
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:20.582
How could you say that to me?

139
00:09:20.582 --> 00:09:22.222
It's the chairman's fault.

140
00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:26.292
You should know your limit.

141
00:09:26.792 --> 00:09:29.462
You sisters are entangled like snakes.

142
00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:30.861
I'm so sick of it.

143
00:09:32.332 --> 00:09:33.631
Choi Jae Sung.

144
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:36.432
I didn't want to send off your dad if enjoys this.

145
00:09:36.702 --> 00:09:38.172
Must I send him off even if I hate doing it?

146
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:41.172
It took us 25 years to find our daughter.

147
00:09:41.172 --> 00:09:42.442
It's already hard to see...

148
00:09:42.442 --> 00:09:44.812
my daughter becoming like you and your sister.

149
00:09:44.942 --> 00:09:46.111
I hate it.

150
00:09:49.852 --> 00:09:51.582
Are you doing this because you're afraid...

151
00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:54.381
that Father might not give you the chairmanship?

152
00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:59.891
You know nothing about me.

153
00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:02.092
You know nothing at all.

154
00:10:04.592 --> 00:10:06.361
Are you claiming that I don't know you at all?

155
00:10:07.361 --> 00:10:09.631
I know everything there is to know about you.

156
00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:51.031
Hee.

157
00:11:51.332 --> 00:11:53.141
You should hire a part-timer for the cafe.

158
00:11:54.302 --> 00:11:55.501
Can I?

159
00:11:55.672 --> 00:11:57.641
Yes, you've reached the break-even point.

160
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:00.042
But I'm going to interview the part-timer with you.

161
00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:01.682
A lot of them tend to be quite lazy.

162
00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:04.682
Hyuk.

163
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:09.552
Can you completely get over with someone...

164
00:12:09.552 --> 00:12:11.292
you once loved?

165
00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:16.592
To the point that person becomes an acquaintance.

166
00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:18.692
Could that happen?

167
00:12:18.932 --> 00:12:20.001
Of course.

168
00:12:20.702 --> 00:12:23.031
If you don't love or have no interest in him,

169
00:12:23.031 --> 00:12:24.332
you won't even hate him.

170
00:12:24.802 --> 00:12:27.371
There's a fine line between love and hate.

171
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:30.572
That's why the antonym of revenge is indifference.

172
00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:32.542
Indifference?

173
00:12:32.881 --> 00:12:35.011
It implies that he's completely over you.

174
00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:37.751
He has no desire for love, hatred, or revenge.

175
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:40.182
That would make him a true winner.

176
00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:42.682
I see.

177
00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:18.391
Mr. Baker, why are you in a suit?

178
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:19.562
Are you going somewhere?

179
00:13:19.962 --> 00:13:21.161
I'm going out for lunch.

180
00:13:21.722 --> 00:13:23.391
You're not going to eat cup noodles?

181
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:27.231
There's no law that says I must eat cup noodles.

182
00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:29.531
Then while you're out,

183
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:31.472
can I bake a cake here?

184
00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:32.501
Sure.

185
00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:34.001
Mr. Baker.

186
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:35.072
What is it?

187
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:37.511
Will you really not...

188
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:39.741
teach me how to make the dough?

189
00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:41.481
How many times must I tell you?

190
00:13:41.481 --> 00:13:43.981
If that's the case, I'll stop working here.

191
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:46.822
- What? - I really...

192
00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:48.521
like your bread.

193
00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:51.192
They are my favourite food in this entire world.

194
00:13:51.192 --> 00:13:53.062
So I wanted to learn from you,

195
00:13:53.062 --> 00:13:55.121
and I came here every day...

196
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.962
for three months to get a job here.

197
00:13:57.231 --> 00:14:00.361
But if you truly have no intentions of teaching me,

198
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:02.972
there's no reason for me to stay here anymore.

199
00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:06.102
Is that so?

200
00:14:06.342 --> 00:14:07.401
Yes.

201
00:14:07.572 --> 00:14:09.072
I will quit my job here...

202
00:14:09.072 --> 00:14:11.611
and learn baking from my second favourite baker.

203
00:14:16.411 --> 00:14:18.812
Go ahead then. Suit yourself.

204
00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:25.692
He won't even budge.

205
00:14:28.822 --> 00:14:30.731
Must I quit now?

206
00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:43.572
Hey.

207
00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:45.871
Goodness.

208
00:14:47.182 --> 00:14:49.241
I didn't know you worked here.

209
00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:53.881
No, I don't work here.

210
00:14:53.922 --> 00:14:55.352
This is my cafe.

211
00:14:55.452 --> 00:14:57.092
Is that so?

212
00:14:58.052 --> 00:14:59.322
What about your husband?

213
00:15:00.521 --> 00:15:02.562
I run this for the fun of it. I was bored.

214
00:15:02.562 --> 00:15:04.261
You do this for fun.

215
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:06.432
I'm glad to hear that.

216
00:15:06.602 --> 00:15:08.401
I heard that it's common for a woman...

217
00:15:08.401 --> 00:15:11.332
to get a job after her husband retires now.

218
00:15:12.031 --> 00:15:13.702
It's not like that between us.

219
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:17.042
My husband's business is really booming.

220
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.442
That's why I said I was glad.

221
00:15:20.411 --> 00:15:23.381
But what brings you here?

222
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.812
I came here to drink coffee.

223
00:15:24.812 --> 00:15:26.722
Someone told me the coffee here is great.

224
00:15:33.422 --> 00:15:36.161
What is your specialty coffee here?

225
00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:39.901
Vanilla latte and cappuccino are good here.

226
00:15:39.901 --> 00:15:41.631
I'd like an americano.

227
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:43.271
Make it hot, please.

228
00:15:45.371 --> 00:15:47.542
I will bring it to you once you take a seat.

229
00:15:48.342 --> 00:15:49.842
I'll take my coffee to go.

230
00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:55.411
Then you should've told me that earlier.

231
00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:58.251
Other cafés usually ask first.

232
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:00.952
Whether it's for here or to go.

233
00:16:02.722 --> 00:16:04.422
Please wait for a moment.

234
00:16:23.042 --> 00:16:24.172
Here you go.

235
00:16:26.042 --> 00:16:27.241
Have a good day.

236
00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:29.141
Oh, right. What about my coupon?

237
00:16:41.621 --> 00:16:43.462
Does he work around this area?

238
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:52.741
Is this enough?

239
00:16:53.572 --> 00:16:55.741
- It's not enough at all. - Goodness.

240
00:16:55.842 --> 00:16:58.011
That didn't take so long.

241
00:16:58.141 --> 00:17:00.141
Gosh.

242
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:04.312
Give it to me.

243
00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:28.401
The appearance is the key for wedding cakes.

244
00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:31.171
Mr. Baker, you're good at baking cakes too.

245
00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:33.681
If I can't bake something,

246
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:35.141
then no one can.

247
00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:38.711
But why are you making the wedding cake today?

248
00:17:38.711 --> 00:17:39.752
Is the wedding tomorrow?

249
00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:41.881
I'm just practicing today.

250
00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:44.022
I was going to bake the real one tomorrow morning.

251
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:46.562
Can you help me tomorrow?

252
00:17:46.562 --> 00:17:48.292
The decoration is too hard for me.

253
00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:50.431
Why would I do that? You said you're quitting.

254
00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:52.802
Fine. Forget about that then.

255
00:17:53.201 --> 00:17:55.431
But I can still bake it here tomorrow, right?

256
00:17:55.431 --> 00:17:57.201
We don't open tomorrow anyway.

257
00:17:58.072 --> 00:17:59.232
Suit yourself.

258
00:18:06.012 --> 00:18:07.941
He doesn't even drink coffee.

259
00:18:09.312 --> 00:18:10.352
What?

260
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.891
Really? Where is he staying?

261
00:18:17.822 --> 00:18:18.951
Sewol-ri...

262
00:18:19.721 --> 00:18:20.961
in Pyeongchang-gun?

263
00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:22.661
After you pass the village hall,

264
00:18:22.661 --> 00:18:24.461
there's a small trail on the left.

265
00:18:24.461 --> 00:18:25.631
It's a single trail.

266
00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:27.602
Once you go up the trail for 30 minutes,

267
00:18:27.602 --> 00:18:29.161
you'll see his house.

268
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:30.901
Follow the path for 30 minutes?

269
00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:34.842
But are you sure that he lives there?

270
00:18:35.141 --> 00:18:36.671
I heard that his pupil met him there last week.

271
00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:39.911
Is that so? Thank you.

272
00:18:40.542 --> 00:18:42.082
Yes. Bye.

273
00:18:42.881 --> 00:18:44.681
Did you finally find Mr. Jung Kang Soo?

274
00:18:44.681 --> 00:18:45.752
Yes.

275
00:18:47.782 --> 00:18:50.092
General Manager Lee, may I use the company car?

276
00:18:50.092 --> 00:18:52.191
I found Mr. Jung's whereabouts.

277
00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:53.262
I heard you.

278
00:18:53.262 --> 00:18:54.921
Wait. I'll get you the company car.

279
00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:55.921
Thank you.

280
00:18:56.992 --> 00:18:58.431
I heard it was fruitless yesterday.

281
00:18:58.431 --> 00:19:00.062
What if it's the same today?

282
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.732
Send the final version of the script...

283
00:19:02.732 --> 00:19:04.272
and the cue sheet to the agency.

284
00:19:04.272 --> 00:19:06.102
Get the labelling stickers for the candles...

285
00:19:06.102 --> 00:19:07.401
and diffusers from the design team.

286
00:19:07.602 --> 00:19:09.641
Yes, Ms. Supervisor-in-charge.

287
00:19:09.641 --> 00:19:11.512
I will do as you say.

288
00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:14.441
But only after I have my lunch.

289
00:19:24.891 --> 00:19:26.292
Where is she going now?

290
00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:29.691
Who cares?

291
00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:40.042
Tell the marketing team to send me the report.

292
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:41.272
Yes, sir.

293
00:19:42.711 --> 00:19:43.842
How about your lunch?

294
00:19:44.512 --> 00:19:46.881
- Get me some salad. - Okay.

295
00:19:50.552 --> 00:19:52.211
(Seo Ji An)

296
00:19:56.121 --> 00:19:57.792
Yes. This is Do Kyung.

297
00:19:59.861 --> 00:20:02.592
What? You found Jung Kang Soo?

298
00:20:02.832 --> 00:20:05.161
Yes. I am on the way to meet him.

299
00:20:05.691 --> 00:20:06.901
Where is he?

300
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:08.961
He's in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province.

301
00:20:09.262 --> 00:20:10.502
He's far away.

302
00:20:11.602 --> 00:20:14.542
I want to go with you, but I have an appointment.

303
00:20:14.772 --> 00:20:16.941
It's all right. I can go alone.

304
00:20:16.941 --> 00:20:18.871
Going alone is not the problem.

305
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:20.381
Persuading him is.

306
00:20:20.482 --> 00:20:21.911
I will do whatever I can to persuade him.

307
00:20:22.082 --> 00:20:25.552
Okay. Then call me as soon as you meet him.

308
00:20:26.582 --> 00:20:28.252
Here's what you asked for.

309
00:20:28.881 --> 00:20:30.592
- Have a great day. - You too.

310
00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:34.262
Can I get a brochure for the insurance?

311
00:20:34.592 --> 00:20:35.621
Of course you can.

312
00:20:36.532 --> 00:20:38.092
There are many different kinds.

313
00:20:38.532 --> 00:20:39.661
Please review them...

314
00:20:40.701 --> 00:20:42.361
and contact this person.

315
00:20:44.171 --> 00:20:45.532
- I will give a call. - All right.

316
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:52.171
You're excited, aren't you?

317
00:20:52.911 --> 00:20:55.042
Why didn't you get married sooner?

318
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:03.721
Hello?

319
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:05.621
Hey, Ji An.

320
00:21:06.421 --> 00:21:09.431
I am sorry that I can't make it to your wedding.

321
00:21:11.931 --> 00:21:13.002
Don't say that.

322
00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:15.931
It's my fault that we suddenly set the date.

323
00:21:17.131 --> 00:21:20.072
Let's meet up after our honeymoon.

324
00:21:21.242 --> 00:21:22.502
Okay.

325
00:21:23.812 --> 00:21:25.641
Congratulations. I mean it.

326
00:21:41.322 --> 00:21:42.621
(Free tasting)

327
00:21:42.621 --> 00:21:46.302
"For those who're hungry. Made by an assistant."

328
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:52.102
I guess we are slowly growing apart.

329
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:55.072
It's Ji Tae's wedding.

330
00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:01.842
Right.

331
00:22:02.582 --> 00:22:04.681
(Assailant's Sister)

332
00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:15.062
- Hello? - Hello.

333
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:17.832
It's Ji An's sister, Ji Soo.

334
00:22:17.832 --> 00:22:19.361
I know you.

335
00:22:20.562 --> 00:22:23.931
I called because I have a favor to ask.

336
00:22:24.102 --> 00:22:27.242
A favor? What is it? Tell me.

337
00:22:27.871 --> 00:22:31.641
Can you let Ji An attend Ji Tae's wedding?

338
00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:35.542
I hope she will drop by even for a short while.

339
00:22:35.881 --> 00:22:38.181
Ji An said she had to go on a business trip.

340
00:22:39.852 --> 00:22:40.982
Did she say she can't go?

341
00:22:41.221 --> 00:22:43.052
Yes. The wedding will be held at the outdoor...

342
00:22:43.052 --> 00:22:45.052
wedding hall of World Cup Park.

343
00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:46.921
Can't you let her attend it?

344
00:22:50.032 --> 00:22:51.332
I'm afraid she can't.

345
00:22:52.032 --> 00:22:55.401
But you're the vice president.

346
00:22:55.701 --> 00:22:58.471
She must've had her reasons for saying it.

347
00:22:59.102 --> 00:23:01.072
Attending the wedding is not everything.

348
00:23:01.772 --> 00:23:02.941
You should understand.

349
00:23:04.742 --> 00:23:07.141
All right.

350
00:23:08.482 --> 00:23:09.552
Bye.

351
00:23:12.451 --> 00:23:14.451
He sounds scary when he's serious.

352
00:23:21.421 --> 00:23:24.732
(Seo Ji An)

353
00:23:47.782 --> 00:23:50.752
Ms. Oh, the overall design is too similar...

354
00:23:51.252 --> 00:23:53.121
to the design of other existing brands.

355
00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:56.262
Sleepwear designs are more or less the same.

356
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:59.092
Isn't it because you set the limit?

357
00:24:00.532 --> 00:24:02.431
But sleepwear is just sleepwear.

358
00:24:02.602 --> 00:24:03.701
No. No.

359
00:24:04.302 --> 00:24:07.802
You wear health to sleep, not sleepwear.

360
00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:10.111
I want that direction.

361
00:24:11.012 --> 00:24:12.742
We found Mr. Jung Kang Soo,

362
00:24:12.982 --> 00:24:15.911
and we're making him natural-dye our fabrics.

363
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:19.982
What's wrong with the weather?

364
00:24:26.592 --> 00:24:28.092
The temperature is abnormal.

365
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:30.661
It's snowing in some provinces.

366
00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:31.792
Snowing?

367
00:24:38.502 --> 00:24:40.072
She should've arrived by now.

368
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:42.342
- Excuse me. - Sure.

Oh, no.

No.

375

Don't do this to me.

376
00:25:20.141 --> 00:25:22.681
Don't do this.

Please.

(7 calls to Seo Ji An)

382
00:25:42.631 --> 00:25:43.772
Sir,

383
00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:46.941
the temperature in Gangwon dropped to negative 2℃.

384
00:25:47.342 --> 00:25:48.602
Negative 2℃?

385
00:25:57.611 --> 00:25:59.881
She left in the daytime.

386
00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:02.121
The GPS predicted 2 hours and 30 minutes.

387
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:03.792
If you speed, you could shorten it to two hours.

388
00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:05.252
I told her to call me as soon as she arrives.

389
00:26:05.492 --> 00:26:06.562
But three hours have already passed.

390
00:26:06.562 --> 00:26:07.592
What's this situation?

391
00:26:07.592 --> 00:26:08.592
It's an emergency situation.

392
00:26:08.592 --> 00:26:09.762
What kind of emergency?

393
00:26:09.762 --> 00:26:13.161
If the call is not going through,

394
00:26:13.262 --> 00:26:16.871
it means she's in the area where there's no signal.

395
00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:18.002
Then?

396
00:26:18.002 --> 00:26:20.471
It means she's isolated in a deserted area.

397
00:26:20.471 --> 00:26:21.671
In this weather?

398
00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:24.411
If she stays in the car, she won't freeze to death.

399
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:27.312
How can she stay all night in the car?

400
00:26:27.982 --> 00:26:29.552
I didn't say she should.

401
00:26:30.151 --> 00:26:31.411
Something must have happened.

402
00:26:34.451 --> 00:26:35.651
Sir.

403
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:41.421
I will pay tomorrow.

404
00:26:48.032 --> 00:26:49.671
The number you have dialled...

406
00:26:52.671 --> 00:26:54.572
I heard it's a 30-minute drive in the mountain.

407
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:56.471
That's all I know.

408
00:27:07.421 --> 00:27:09.592
I don't want to see him enjoying that situation.

409
00:27:09.592 --> 00:27:11.951
Can't I not do what I don't like?

410
00:27:17.332 --> 00:27:18.661
Sir, here's the report...

411
00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:19.961
on the establishment of the Europe office.

412
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:23.171
Mr. Hong.

413
00:27:23.171 --> 00:27:25.431
Haven't I been acting strangely these days?

414
00:27:25.631 --> 00:27:28.901
I don't understand what you mean, sir.

415
00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:31.471
All right. You may go.

416
00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:48.592
My daughter whom I found after 25 years started...

417
00:27:48.762 --> 00:27:49.961
turning like you sisters as soon as she set...

418
00:27:49.961 --> 00:27:53.461
foot in this house, and it's tough watching her.

419
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:55.201
You don't understand me.

420
00:27:55.332 --> 00:27:57.002
You don't understand me at all.

421
00:28:00.042 --> 00:28:01.502
After all these years...

422
00:28:04.742 --> 00:28:07.141
After all these years, you can't wait any longer.

423
00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:17.951
This is so frustrating.

424
00:28:19.151 --> 00:28:22.522
Until when do we have to live like prisoners?

425
00:28:24.232 --> 00:28:27.631
We get paid 3,000 dollars a month for doing this.

426
00:28:28.762 --> 00:28:32.742
Look. It says I should go outside.

427
00:28:36.512 --> 00:28:37.512
We can't live here for 30 years...

428
00:28:37.512 --> 00:28:39.171
to get a million dollars.

429
00:28:40.842 --> 00:28:42.242
Have you got any good ideas?

430
00:28:55.092 --> 00:28:57.461
Excuse me.

431
00:28:58.391 --> 00:29:01.102
Do you know Mr. Jung Kang Soo?

432
00:29:01.332 --> 00:29:02.772
I don't know.

433
00:29:03.171 --> 00:29:05.871
He's the one who does natural dyeing.

434
00:29:06.171 --> 00:29:07.502
We don't know.

435
00:29:07.502 --> 00:29:10.411
Please try to remember it.

436
00:29:11.171 --> 00:29:13.312
If I don't find him, someone might die.

437
00:29:13.782 --> 00:29:15.782
She left to go there, but she's gone missing.

438
00:29:16.012 --> 00:29:17.482
She's only got a thin cardigan.

439
00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:20.621
And she went deep into the woods.

440
00:29:20.822 --> 00:29:22.082
Deep into the woods?

441
00:29:22.482 --> 00:29:24.822
Right. The strange house.

442
00:29:25.292 --> 00:29:26.391
Do you know?

443
00:29:28.822 --> 00:29:32.232
As soon as you leave this community center,

444
00:29:32.232 --> 00:29:34.502
on the left is the path that leads to that house.

445
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:37.032
From there to the peak,

446
00:29:37.032 --> 00:29:38.931
it's about 4km.

447
00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:41.602
The road is very bumpy,

448
00:29:41.602 --> 00:29:43.012
so it takes a good half an hour by car.

449
00:29:43.012 --> 00:29:44.012
(Timer)

450
00:29:44.542 --> 00:29:46.542
Perhaps she's arrived safely.

451
00:29:46.881 --> 00:29:48.381
Am I overreacting?

452
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:52.151
Perhaps...

453
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:53.651
she can't call me because there's no signal.

454
00:29:54.421 --> 00:29:55.782
Darn it.

455
00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:20.512
It's still far away. Why is the car here?

456
00:30:26.582 --> 00:30:28.621
Where did she go?

457
00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:32.191
Did she go somewhere to get reception?

458
00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:33.921
Ji An!

459
00:30:35.062 --> 00:30:36.361
Ji An!

460
00:30:41.431 --> 00:30:42.832
She didn't go down.

461
00:30:44.401 --> 00:30:45.901
Did she walk up?

462
00:30:46.802 --> 00:30:48.371
Is she mad?

463
00:31:37.891 --> 00:31:39.921
I should've let them know where I was.

464
00:31:40.522 --> 00:31:41.822
What do I do?

465
00:31:45.762 --> 00:31:47.002
Ji An!

466
00:31:48.762 --> 00:31:49.971
Ji An!

467
00:31:51.832 --> 00:31:53.102
Ji An!

468
00:31:57.171 --> 00:31:58.542
Mom.

469
00:31:59.111 --> 00:32:00.441
Ji An!

470
00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:03.951
Do Kyung?

471
00:32:07.482 --> 00:32:08.681
Do Kyung.

472
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:11.191
Ji An!

473
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:13.421
You're mad.

474
00:32:14.062 --> 00:32:15.421
How did you...

475
00:32:27.602 --> 00:32:29.611
You should've taken a scarf.

476
00:32:30.042 --> 00:32:31.671
How can you dress so lightly?

477
00:32:32.512 --> 00:32:33.611
Wear it.

478
00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:37.151
Hurry up and wear it.

479
00:32:39.982 --> 00:32:41.022
Here.

480
00:32:41.221 --> 00:32:43.792
I will... I will do it.

481
00:32:52.032 --> 00:32:53.762
How can you think about...

482
00:32:53.832 --> 00:32:55.602
coming up here dressed like this?

483
00:32:56.401 --> 00:32:57.502
I...

484
00:32:58.772 --> 00:33:00.842
I got the permission.

485
00:33:02.171 --> 00:33:03.211
What?

486
00:33:03.342 --> 00:33:05.342
Mr. Jung Kang Soo...

487
00:33:06.911 --> 00:33:07.941
is going to do it.

488
00:33:10.711 --> 00:33:11.911
Who are you?

489
00:33:14.482 --> 00:33:15.982
It's nice to meet you.

490
00:33:15.982 --> 00:33:18.151
My name is Seo Ji An.

491
00:33:18.151 --> 00:33:20.661
I've come to meet Mr. Jung Kang Soo,

492
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:22.522
the master of natural dyeing.

493
00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:24.832
I've come to meet him.

494
00:33:24.992 --> 00:33:26.901
Are you the lady who looked...

495
00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:28.762
all over for me...

496
00:33:28.762 --> 00:33:31.532
10 years ago?

497
00:33:31.532 --> 00:33:33.971
Yes. That's me. My goodness.

498
00:33:37.141 --> 00:33:39.042
Did you walk up here?

499
00:33:39.312 --> 00:33:41.982
Yes, my car fell into a ditch.

500
00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:44.611
Can I make one phone call?

501
00:33:44.611 --> 00:33:47.082
My phone died on the way here.

502
00:33:47.852 --> 00:33:51.092
You have to go up 100m...

503
00:33:51.352 --> 00:33:53.421
and go up to the summit.

504
00:33:54.391 --> 00:33:57.092
That's why you were out of reach.

505
00:33:58.131 --> 00:33:59.961
There's someone who's desperately...

506
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:02.332
waiting to hear about you.

507
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:03.471
About me?

508
00:34:07.072 --> 00:34:09.442
You should head back before it gets dark.

509
00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:12.371
If you don't give me permission,

510
00:34:12.511 --> 00:34:14.582
I have to sleep here.

511
00:34:14.982 --> 00:34:16.681
You are a grown-up lady,

512
00:34:17.382 --> 00:34:20.221
and as old as I may be, I'm still a man.

513
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:22.551
If I fail to get your permission,

514
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:24.121
I won't have any energy to walk back down.

515
00:34:24.652 --> 00:34:26.661
I don't even have any energy to walk.

516
00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:30.132
If you wish hard enough, your wish comes true.

517
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:33.562
You should get up and head back.

518
00:34:34.462 --> 00:34:37.672
Are you giving me the permission then?

519
00:34:42.272 --> 00:34:44.272
Tie your shoe with that.

520
00:34:46.112 --> 00:34:47.411
Thank you.

521
00:34:50.152 --> 00:34:51.951
I don't have any clothes to give you.

522
00:34:52.681 --> 00:34:55.082
Wrap this around your neck.

523
00:34:56.292 --> 00:34:57.551
Thank you.

524
00:35:05.692 --> 00:35:07.832
Did you go all the way there?

525
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:11.971
I didn't know that it was that far.

526
00:35:12.301 --> 00:35:14.341
Are you reckless or stupid?

527
00:35:15.102 --> 00:35:16.112
By the way,

528
00:35:16.712 --> 00:35:18.471
how did you find out this place?

529
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:20.612
I only told you the name of the village.

530
00:35:21.781 --> 00:35:24.051
I had to know whether we could work with...

531
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:25.112
Mr. Jung or not.

532
00:35:25.112 --> 00:35:27.252
How could I just wait for your call?

533
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:30.192
Our success depended on him.

534
00:35:31.991 --> 00:35:32.991
Right.

535
00:35:35.362 --> 00:35:36.431
What's that?

536
00:35:37.391 --> 00:35:38.531
Oh, this.

537
00:35:38.962 --> 00:35:41.301
He gave me this to wrap around my neck.

538
00:35:41.301 --> 00:35:42.732
Then why didn't you wear it?

539
00:35:42.732 --> 00:35:44.201
It's so cold.

540
00:35:45.602 --> 00:35:47.741
I couldn't waste it. I wanted to show you.

541
00:35:50.312 --> 00:35:51.971
You are so foolish.

542
00:35:53.181 --> 00:35:54.212
Let's go.

543
00:35:54.411 --> 00:35:56.781
Okay. You should go first.

544
00:35:59.312 --> 00:36:00.382
I will assist you.

545
00:36:00.382 --> 00:36:02.551
It's all right.

546
00:36:05.321 --> 00:36:07.161
This is perfect. This will do.

547
00:36:09.891 --> 00:36:11.192
You go down first then.

548
00:36:12.161 --> 00:36:13.201
Why?

549
00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:14.862
You said your phone ran out of battery.

550
00:36:16.031 --> 00:36:18.301
I will light the path from the back.

551
00:36:34.082 --> 00:36:35.551
I am sorry.

552
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.152
This wouldn't have happened...

553
00:36:37.152 --> 00:36:38.551
if the car didn't fall into the ditch.

554
00:36:40.922 --> 00:36:43.661
You are coming, aren't you?

555
00:36:45.261 --> 00:36:46.332
I am.

556
00:36:47.062 --> 00:36:49.431
Don't just light my path.

557
00:36:49.431 --> 00:36:51.301
I got this. Just keep going.

558
00:36:52.571 --> 00:36:53.602
Okay.

559
00:37:12.862 --> 00:37:14.022
I'm okay.

560
00:37:15.462 --> 00:37:16.962
Are you jinxed?

561
00:37:17.062 --> 00:37:18.832
Or are you not meant to drive?

562
00:37:19.062 --> 00:37:21.261
This car is not broken.

563
00:37:22.062 --> 00:37:24.172
You can drive. I will push from the back.

564
00:37:24.471 --> 00:37:26.002
You look too weak to eat porridge.

565
00:37:26.002 --> 00:37:27.701
How can you push a car?

566
00:37:27.971 --> 00:37:30.212
Then I will drive.

567
00:37:30.212 --> 00:37:31.812
Will you push it?

568
00:37:31.812 --> 00:37:33.181
You're mad.

569
00:37:33.442 --> 00:37:34.841
Why would I do that?

570
00:37:35.042 --> 00:37:36.051
Get on my car.

571
00:37:36.051 --> 00:37:37.411
I will call a tow truck.

572
00:37:37.852 --> 00:37:39.451
It's the company car,

573
00:37:39.451 --> 00:37:41.082
so I'll feel better if I take the car back.

574
00:37:41.082 --> 00:37:43.022
You want me to wait until the tow truck gets here?

575
00:37:43.022 --> 00:37:44.391
No way.

576
00:37:45.252 --> 00:37:47.121
Then you should go first.

577
00:37:47.121 --> 00:37:49.161
I will wait in the car with the heater on.

578
00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:51.031
Listen to yourself.

579
00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:52.761
How can I leave a female employee here?

580
00:37:52.761 --> 00:37:55.102
What if something happens to you?

581
00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:57.431
I will be fired for being an immoral boss.

582
00:37:57.431 --> 00:37:59.542
Get in the car. I have to get to the appointment.

583
00:38:34.102 --> 00:38:35.502
I must be mad.

584
00:38:38.212 --> 00:38:40.212
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

585
00:38:41.042 --> 00:38:43.112
I am okay. I am not hungry.

586
00:38:43.411 --> 00:38:45.852
You have to get to the appointment.

587
00:38:46.852 --> 00:38:48.022
You're not hungry?

588
00:38:48.022 --> 00:38:50.051
Not at all.

589
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.462
Really? Then I'll eat alone.

590
00:38:59.132 --> 00:39:00.431
Thank you.

591
00:39:08.602 --> 00:39:11.571
Can you eat that?

592
00:39:11.971 --> 00:39:13.181
What's wrong with this?

593
00:39:14.442 --> 00:39:16.852
It looks like it was cooked a long time ago.

594
00:39:17.312 --> 00:39:20.382
I am so hungry...

595
00:39:20.382 --> 00:39:21.922
that I could eat anything.

596
00:39:36.772 --> 00:39:37.902
Why are you staring at me?

597
00:39:38.772 --> 00:39:40.102
Nothing.

598
00:39:51.051 --> 00:39:52.551
This soup really hits the spot.

599
00:39:52.652 --> 00:39:53.781
I like this place.

600
00:40:28.422 --> 00:40:30.891
Don't you like it as it's not newly cooked?

601
00:40:31.692 --> 00:40:32.962
No, that's not it.

602
00:40:33.562 --> 00:40:35.192
I just have no appetite.

603
00:40:38.991 --> 00:40:40.102
Let's go then.

604
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:42.261
Okay.

605
00:40:46.442 --> 00:40:48.272
You should go straight home tonight.

606
00:40:49.911 --> 00:40:51.241
It's quite late,

607
00:40:52.341 --> 00:40:54.312
and you can't go to the office looking like that.

608
00:40:55.482 --> 00:40:56.712
Oh, right.

609
00:40:57.681 --> 00:41:00.982
We can use fermented leaves for dyeing.

610
00:41:02.121 --> 00:41:03.422
Look.

611
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:06.661
This cloth is dyed with fermented ones. It's good.

612
00:41:06.661 --> 00:41:07.821
I know.

613
00:41:07.922 --> 00:41:10.891
I know we can't use fresh leaves after September.

614
00:41:16.602 --> 00:41:17.832
Are you still cold?

615
00:41:18.031 --> 00:41:19.201
Should I turn the heater up?

616
00:41:19.442 --> 00:41:21.002
No, I'm okay.

617
00:41:21.442 --> 00:41:24.571
Maybe I ate too much, or this jacket is too warm.

618
00:41:25.141 --> 00:41:27.112
I think I'm running a fever.

619
00:41:33.882 --> 00:41:35.951
Oh, right.

620
00:41:36.922 --> 00:41:41.161
I'm supposed to get cloth for the dyeing event.

621
00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:44.161
And I need to send a car to pick up the dyes...

622
00:41:44.161 --> 00:41:46.502
on the day before the event.

623
00:41:46.502 --> 00:41:49.801
Okay. We can talk about it at the office tomorrow.

624
00:41:50.602 --> 00:41:51.801
Just get some rest.

625
00:41:52.201 --> 00:41:54.902
I should do that. I'm a little sleepy.

626
00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:31.571
Ji An.

627
00:43:24.661 --> 00:43:25.732
Ji An.

628
00:43:28.632 --> 00:43:29.732
Ji An.

629
00:43:31.402 --> 00:43:32.531
Wake up.

630
00:43:36.911 --> 00:43:38.042
We're here.

631
00:43:38.971 --> 00:43:40.042
Okay.

632
00:43:41.382 --> 00:43:42.781
We can't go home together.

633
00:43:43.612 --> 00:43:45.982
They think I went to the meeting of N-Gaon.

634
00:43:47.951 --> 00:43:49.022
Okay.

635
00:43:50.352 --> 00:43:52.022
I told them about your situation though.

636
00:43:52.721 --> 00:43:54.661
I told them you went to Mr. Jung...

637
00:43:54.661 --> 00:43:56.591
and got lost in the mountains.

638
00:43:57.661 --> 00:43:59.031
When did you do that?

639
00:43:59.902 --> 00:44:01.602
While you were fast asleep.

640
00:44:02.562 --> 00:44:04.402
General Manager Min will take care of your shoes.

641
00:44:05.002 --> 00:44:08.102
Just go to your room saying you're tired.

642
00:44:09.442 --> 00:44:10.511
Okay.

643
00:44:21.781 --> 00:44:23.152
Hang on a second.

644
00:44:35.832 --> 00:44:37.801
I'll get going then.

645
00:45:35.522 --> 00:45:36.632
You're home.

646
00:45:37.491 --> 00:45:38.931
I'm home, Mother.

647
00:45:40.301 --> 00:45:42.232
Gosh, look at your face.

648
00:45:42.772 --> 00:45:44.602
You must be having a tough time working.

649
00:45:45.772 --> 00:45:48.772
I just made a mistake while driving.

650
00:45:50.042 --> 00:45:52.371
It's okay. Just go to your room and get some rest.

651
00:45:52.911 --> 00:45:53.982
Just go.

652
00:45:59.152 --> 00:46:01.382
Ms. Min. Please run a bath for her.

653
00:46:01.382 --> 00:46:02.382
Yes, ma'am.

654
00:46:30.582 --> 00:46:31.951
What's wrong with me?

655
00:46:40.692 --> 00:46:41.862
What's going on?

656
00:46:43.062 --> 00:46:44.862
What on earth is wrong with me?

657
00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:20.931
(Prenuptial Agreement)

658
00:47:27.672 --> 00:47:29.442
We're not having children.

659
00:47:29.911 --> 00:47:31.511
This will never change.

660
00:47:31.971 --> 00:47:34.641
I know. I'm the one who suggested it.

661
00:47:35.042 --> 00:47:38.352
You suggested it, and I agree with it.

662
00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:45.152
"Soo A holds the purse strings in our family."

663
00:47:46.161 --> 00:47:48.221
"Ask for understanding on loans."

664
00:47:50.761 --> 00:47:53.161
I'll leave all my salary with you, but...

665
00:47:53.962 --> 00:47:56.971
I want you to let me keep paying my family's debt.

666
00:47:59.672 --> 00:48:00.871
I don't want to.

667
00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:04.971
I understand that.

668
00:48:05.812 --> 00:48:08.042
I don't want to hold the purse strings.

669
00:48:08.181 --> 00:48:09.312
Look at number four.

670
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:11.551
"We both hold the purse strings."

671
00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:15.551
You make 10,000 dollars a year more than me.

672
00:48:15.852 --> 00:48:17.692
We'll fully amortize the loan...

673
00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:19.891
and pay 10,000 dollars a year.

674
00:48:20.121 --> 00:48:22.321
And put your salary into our joint account...

675
00:48:22.462 --> 00:48:24.931
as much as mine to pay our living expenses.

676
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:28.462
Can you really do that?

677
00:48:28.602 --> 00:48:30.672
If you clear the debt with the extra money,

678
00:48:30.672 --> 00:48:32.132
it doesn't mean I'm paying it.

679
00:48:33.301 --> 00:48:35.371
I'd feel more comfortable that way.

680
00:48:36.542 --> 00:48:40.212
I was just going to get an allowance from you.

681
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:42.341
I thought about it too. Look.

682
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:44.712
We get 300 dollars a month as an allowance.

683
00:48:44.882 --> 00:48:46.852
Credit cards are for emergency use only.

684
00:48:47.221 --> 00:48:48.882
We'll use each other's credit cards though.

685
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:51.491
If I use your credit card, you'll get a text message.

686
00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:53.922
If you do that, I'll get one as well.

687
00:48:54.121 --> 00:48:56.431
You used to spend all you earned. Can you do that?

688
00:48:56.531 --> 00:49:01.201
I didn't think about the future back then.

689
00:49:02.362 --> 00:49:04.272
What about you? Are you okay with that?

690
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:09.571
We need to move out in two years.

691
00:49:10.741 --> 00:49:13.212
And now that I live with you, I don't need money.

692
00:49:13.982 --> 00:49:15.442
- I'm okay. - Okay?

693
00:49:17.312 --> 00:49:19.621
So we both agreed on the important issues.

694
00:49:20.121 --> 00:49:23.152
Check my list and confirm the details.

695
00:49:23.152 --> 00:49:26.121
- I'll check your list. - Okay.

696
00:49:35.732 --> 00:49:36.931
I'm happy.

697
00:49:38.832 --> 00:49:40.741
So am I, a lot.

698
00:49:48.582 --> 00:49:52.011
No formalities, no lighting the candles,

699
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:53.852
no formal dress.

700
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:57.652
They only get married once.

701
00:49:59.192 --> 00:50:01.462
It's the trend.

702
00:50:01.462 --> 00:50:02.891
They cut out the formalities...

703
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:04.862
and are accentuating their individualities.

704
00:50:05.192 --> 00:50:08.632
The parents should be the hosts.

705
00:50:10.002 --> 00:50:12.272
We can do nothing but sit still.

706
00:50:13.741 --> 00:50:15.902
Be grateful they're letting us sit in.

707
00:50:16.272 --> 00:50:18.471
It took a lot of courage on their part.

708
00:50:26.721 --> 00:50:27.922
(Jang Seok Doo)

709
00:50:29.891 --> 00:50:31.192
Hi, Seok Doo.

710
00:50:31.192 --> 00:50:32.591
Seo Tae Soo.

711
00:50:32.591 --> 00:50:35.221
You researched motorcycle accessories too?

712
00:50:35.221 --> 00:50:37.732
I heard that half the Vietnamese...

713
00:50:37.732 --> 00:50:39.661
population ride motorcycles.

714
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:41.931
Why?

715
00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:43.371
Is someone interested?

716
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:46.241
Yes. Send some samples over tomorrow.

717
00:50:46.301 --> 00:50:48.471
They'll check and sign a contract right away.

718
00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:50.911
Okay, okay.

719
00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:52.571
I'll send you some money.

720
00:50:52.571 --> 00:50:53.812
Text me your bank details.

721
00:50:53.812 --> 00:50:55.112
No, it's fine.

722
00:50:55.112 --> 00:50:57.112
I can afford to buy the samples.

723
00:50:57.112 --> 00:50:58.652
I'll send them tomorrow...

724
00:50:58.652 --> 00:50:59.882
after Ji Tae's wedding.

725
00:51:00.121 --> 00:51:02.181
Okay, take care. Bye.

726
00:51:19.741 --> 00:51:21.102
I caught a cold.

727
00:51:44.362 --> 00:51:45.531
Welcome.

728
00:51:46.062 --> 00:51:47.462
I have a slight cough.

729
00:51:47.462 --> 00:51:49.471
Give me some cold medicine...

730
00:51:49.471 --> 00:51:50.732
that works fast.

731
00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:52.531
Sure, just a moment.

732
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:56.042
And an energizer too.

733
00:51:56.042 --> 00:51:57.241
Okay.

734
00:52:01.781 --> 00:52:03.051
Here you go.

735
00:52:07.022 --> 00:52:08.382
Give me 10 of these.

736
00:52:08.922 --> 00:52:10.991
(Closed)

737
00:52:24.371 --> 00:52:26.341
Who is it on my day off?

738
00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:44.391
Let me in.

739
00:52:53.902 --> 00:52:55.362
My goodness.

740
00:52:55.701 --> 00:52:57.301
I'm in shock.

741
00:52:57.732 --> 00:52:58.801
Why?

742
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:00.602
I had no idea if...

743
00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:02.301
you were male or female.

744
00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:04.511
If you were a talking dog or cat.

745
00:53:04.542 --> 00:53:06.281
I was really confused.

746
00:53:06.712 --> 00:53:09.411
Are you saying I look okay?

747
00:53:12.652 --> 00:53:14.252
You don't look okay.

748
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:17.252
You should tie your hair if you want to bake.

749
00:53:17.491 --> 00:53:19.051
What a mess.

750
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:20.491
I can't.

751
00:53:20.491 --> 00:53:23.491
If I tie my hair back, it'll leave a mark.

752
00:53:23.692 --> 00:53:25.462
My brother's getting married today.

753
00:53:25.462 --> 00:53:26.602
Here.

754
00:53:29.801 --> 00:53:30.902
Awesome.

755
00:53:37.442 --> 00:53:40.612
Mr. Baker's so kind.

756
00:53:44.152 --> 00:53:45.312
A gift from me...

757
00:53:45.312 --> 00:53:47.821
to keep you energized until the very end.

758
00:53:47.882 --> 00:53:49.352
Thank you so much.

759
00:53:49.352 --> 00:53:52.121
Have one each and cheer up.

760
00:53:52.422 --> 00:53:53.422
Here you go.

761
00:53:54.362 --> 00:53:55.422
Thank you.

762
00:53:56.862 --> 00:53:59.232
More energy. Thank you.

763
00:54:06.002 --> 00:54:07.542
What's today's schedule?

764
00:54:07.641 --> 00:54:10.542
Ha Jung will type up Mr. Jung's profile...

765
00:54:10.542 --> 00:54:11.971
for the PR Team.

766
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:14.482
Mr. Jo will arrange for a car to pick up...

767
00:54:14.482 --> 00:54:16.451
the jars of dye and materials.

768
00:54:16.482 --> 00:54:18.781
I'll book Mr. Jung a suite,

769
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:19.951
then go to the hall...

770
00:54:19.951 --> 00:54:22.022
for a final meeting with the event team.

771
00:54:22.022 --> 00:54:23.551
I'll check the stage,

772
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:25.852
then type up a press release.

773
00:54:26.562 --> 00:54:27.962
Can you let Ji An...

774
00:54:27.962 --> 00:54:30.292
come to Ji Tae's wedding?

775
00:54:30.891 --> 00:54:32.462
You have a long day.

776
00:54:32.462 --> 00:54:33.701
Double-check everything...

777
00:54:33.701 --> 00:54:35.661
so there are no mistakes.

778
00:54:36.071 --> 00:54:37.071
Yes, sir.

779
00:54:37.071 --> 00:54:38.102
Goodbye.

780
00:54:39.741 --> 00:54:40.801
Thank you.

781
00:54:42.402 --> 00:54:43.741
We'll do our best.

782
00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:46.241
Welcome.

783
00:54:47.382 --> 00:54:48.411
My gosh.

784
00:54:51.551 --> 00:54:52.781
Hello.

785
00:54:53.621 --> 00:54:55.451
I almost didn't recognize you.

786
00:54:55.522 --> 00:54:57.951
You look different with your hair like that.

787
00:54:57.951 --> 00:55:01.391
My older brother's getting married today.

788
00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:03.991
The wedding's today?

789
00:55:04.362 --> 00:55:05.661
I made this...

790
00:55:05.661 --> 00:55:08.261
while making the wedding cake.

791
00:55:08.502 --> 00:55:10.602
Please give it to Mr. Sun.

792
00:55:10.931 --> 00:55:12.701
I don't mean anything else.

793
00:55:12.701 --> 00:55:15.442
He assembled the vanity for me.

794
00:55:15.442 --> 00:55:16.871
I wanted to thank him.

795
00:55:17.212 --> 00:55:18.241
I'll give it to him.

796
00:55:18.741 --> 00:55:20.312
Can we order now?

797
00:55:20.482 --> 00:55:22.951
When can I get my vanilla latte?

798
00:55:23.112 --> 00:55:24.181
Right now.

799
00:55:24.951 --> 00:55:26.551
I'll take the order.

800
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:28.482
I have some time before the wedding.

801
00:55:28.482 --> 00:55:29.991
What would you like?

802
00:55:31.692 --> 00:55:33.292
Your latte is coming.

803
00:55:33.292 --> 00:55:34.562
What's your order?

804
00:55:34.562 --> 00:55:36.431
A toast and...

805
00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:41.031
Here are your coffees.

806
00:55:48.641 --> 00:55:50.612
I told her to hire a part-timer.

807
00:55:58.551 --> 00:56:00.621
Did you hire a part-timer?

808
00:56:01.181 --> 00:56:02.451
A part-timer?

809
00:56:02.621 --> 00:56:03.692
Over there.

810
00:56:14.431 --> 00:56:15.902
Hello.

811
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:18.172
I thought you were someone else.

812
00:56:19.232 --> 00:56:20.471
It suits you.

813
00:56:21.902 --> 00:56:24.741
My older brother's getting married today.

814
00:56:25.442 --> 00:56:27.212
Oh, the vanity?

815
00:56:28.042 --> 00:56:31.011
Yes. My sister-in-law liked it.

816
00:56:31.252 --> 00:56:32.882
Thank you so much.

817
00:56:33.482 --> 00:56:35.152
You're welcome.

818
00:56:35.152 --> 00:56:37.192
She can call me if there's a defect.

819
00:56:37.621 --> 00:56:38.721
Okay.

820
00:56:39.792 --> 00:56:41.091
I'll tell her.

821
00:56:41.321 --> 00:56:42.391
Excuse me.

822
00:56:42.391 --> 00:56:43.391
Yes?

823
00:56:47.602 --> 00:56:49.132
Aren't you working her too hard?

824
00:56:49.402 --> 00:56:51.531
I didn't ask for her help.

825
00:56:52.632 --> 00:56:54.371
She's quick-witted and helpful.

826
00:56:54.871 --> 00:56:57.112
I should tell her to go now that you're here.

827
00:57:02.181 --> 00:57:03.281
A caramel macchiato.

828
00:57:03.281 --> 00:57:04.882
I'll get it for you.

829
00:57:04.882 --> 00:57:06.152
- Excuse me. - Yes?

830
00:57:06.152 --> 00:57:08.382
- Can we have some water? - Sure.

831
00:57:15.661 --> 00:57:17.462
Put safety first when you...

832
00:57:17.462 --> 00:57:19.761
set everything out tomorrow.

833
00:57:19.832 --> 00:57:21.362
Send an estimate for the extra...

834
00:57:21.362 --> 00:57:22.502
lighting and sound costs.

835
00:57:22.502 --> 00:57:23.701
Sure, I will.

836
00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:25.031
- Thank you. - Bye.

837
00:57:26.971 --> 00:57:29.471
(Do Kyung)

838
00:57:29.672 --> 00:57:31.241
I didn't change his name.

839
00:57:34.712 --> 00:57:36.011
Hello, sir.

840
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:37.181
Where are you?

841
00:57:37.352 --> 00:57:38.511
The convention hall.

842
00:57:38.511 --> 00:57:40.681
The Australian candle company deal.

843
00:57:40.681 --> 00:57:42.451
The buyer called.

844
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:44.692
You're in charge. I need you to come along.

845
00:57:45.391 --> 00:57:47.161
The Australian buyer called?

846
00:57:47.922 --> 00:57:50.062
I didn't get a call.

847
00:58:09.382 --> 00:58:11.911
What are we doing here?

848
00:58:12.011 --> 00:58:13.982
The meeting is at Sangam DMC...

849
00:58:13.982 --> 00:58:15.281
and we're too early.

850
00:58:15.352 --> 00:58:16.721
Let's kill some time.

851
00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:19.292
Here?

852
00:58:19.292 --> 00:58:21.821
Should we go to a cafe together?

853
00:58:21.891 --> 00:58:23.362
It's better to stay outdoors.

854
00:58:23.491 --> 00:58:24.562
If we're that early,

855
00:58:24.562 --> 00:58:26.261
I could've come on my own.

856
00:58:27.832 --> 00:58:29.701
And kill time here on my own?

857
00:58:50.721 --> 00:58:52.391
Parks are nice in the autumn.

858
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:55.022
Seo Ji An.

859
00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:57.292
Have you been here before?

860
00:58:58.161 --> 00:58:59.161
No.

861
00:59:00.902 --> 00:59:02.261
Neither have I.

862
00:59:03.531 --> 00:59:05.402
Enjoy your walk.

863
00:59:05.402 --> 00:59:07.201
I'll wait at DMC.

864
00:59:07.772 --> 00:59:08.841
Why?

865
00:59:09.672 --> 00:59:10.911
I don't want to walk.

866
00:59:11.241 --> 00:59:12.612
Why don't you want to walk?

867
00:59:13.781 --> 00:59:15.411
Do you not want to walk with me?

868
00:59:16.312 --> 00:59:17.382
It's both.

869
00:59:17.911 --> 00:59:19.212
How cruel.

870
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:21.882
We might never get to...

871
00:59:21.882 --> 00:59:23.221
walk together again.

872
00:59:26.862 --> 00:59:28.821
Take just 10 more steps.

873
00:59:29.692 --> 00:59:31.431
I want to show you something.

874
00:59:38.172 --> 00:59:39.332
You said that...

875
00:59:40.042 --> 00:59:41.672
your brother's innocent.

876
00:59:42.871 --> 00:59:44.011
Yes.

877
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:47.212
So are you.

878
00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:58.121
I want to...

879
00:59:58.621 --> 01:00:00.962
show you something you shouldn't miss.

880
01:00:08.301 --> 01:00:09.332
That.

881
01:00:56.051 --> 01:00:57.212
You're so pretty.

882
01:01:21.442 --> 01:01:22.812
When did you prepare that?

883
01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:39.991
Let go.

884
01:01:40.091 --> 01:01:41.161
You want to watch.

885
01:01:41.891 --> 01:01:43.362
Not in hiding.

886
01:01:44.531 --> 01:01:46.132
Then go up there.

887
01:01:47.232 --> 01:01:48.332
What?

888
01:01:48.832 --> 01:01:50.332
I want you to.

889
01:01:51.902 --> 01:01:53.841
It'll be hard to face your parents,

890
01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:57.371
but it's your brother's special day.

891
01:01:59.112 --> 01:02:02.712
You smiled to my parents for your parents' sakes.

892
01:02:03.812 --> 01:02:05.082
I want you to smile...

893
01:02:05.781 --> 01:02:07.221
for your brother.

894
01:02:09.451 --> 01:02:10.591
Aren't you...

895
01:02:11.091 --> 01:02:12.692
going to go back to them?

896
01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:15.522
They're your family.

897
01:02:17.232 --> 01:02:18.732
Don't do something you'll regret.

898
01:02:28.902 --> 01:02:31.672
We will share a bed, whatever happens,

899
01:02:32.212 --> 01:02:35.542
and Seo Ji Tae will always take out the trash.

900
01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:37.082
- Yes! - No, Ji Tae!

901
01:02:37.082 --> 01:02:38.812
- Do it together! - Nice one!

902
01:02:40.781 --> 01:02:44.321
Lee Soo A will not compare our lives with others...

903
01:02:44.321 --> 01:02:46.962
and find our own way to be happy.

904
01:02:47.321 --> 01:02:48.761
Good for you!

905
01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:53.862
Those were some very memorable vows.

906
01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:57.402
Now, Mr. Seo Tae Soo, the father of the groom...

907
01:02:57.502 --> 01:03:00.672
will read the proclamation of marriage.

908
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:05.641
Wait.

909
01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:10.152
I want to ask for a favor before you read...

910
01:03:10.281 --> 01:03:12.011
the proclamation of marriage.

911
01:03:12.852 --> 01:03:15.321
Before the proclamation, it's customary for...

912
01:03:15.321 --> 01:03:17.451
both parents to bless the couple.

913
01:03:17.721 --> 01:03:21.192
My parents live in Canada and couldn't attend.

914
01:03:22.192 --> 01:03:24.931
We planned the wedding a week ago,

915
01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:26.661
so they couldn't have.

916
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:31.571
Ji Tae's parents said we should...

917
01:03:32.002 --> 01:03:34.602
skip with the blessings to be fair,

918
01:03:35.602 --> 01:03:38.071
but Mr. Seo played a huge part in this.

919
01:03:38.272 --> 01:03:41.112
I'd like you to bless us.

920
01:03:48.082 --> 01:03:49.451
Come on, Dad.

921
01:03:51.922 --> 01:03:54.121
- Come on. - Do it.

922
01:04:00.332 --> 01:04:05.002
I'm Seo Ji Tae's father, Seo Tae Soo.

923
01:04:10.612 --> 01:04:13.781
I'd never seen my son...

924
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:18.181
with shoulders drooped so low.

925
01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:22.422
I'd never seen him so discouraged.

926
01:04:23.522 --> 01:04:24.821
He looked as if...

927
01:04:25.491 --> 01:04:27.261
he'd lost the whole world.

928
01:04:27.891 --> 01:04:29.161
Then I found out...

929
01:04:30.761 --> 01:04:34.761
it was because he had broken up with Soo A.

930
01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:39.741
That's why today...

931
01:04:44.341 --> 01:04:48.082
Today, I am so very happy.

932
01:04:48.312 --> 01:04:50.511
I want to thank you.

933
01:04:51.812 --> 01:04:53.922
Thank you both...

934
01:04:54.252 --> 01:04:55.721
for being courageous.

935
01:04:57.522 --> 01:05:00.221
From now on, live with that courage...

936
01:05:00.621 --> 01:05:04.862
and make a good life, focusing on each other.

01:05:12.502 --> 01:05:14.902
- Be happy! - Good luck!

939
01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:31.991
Your mail, sir.

01:05:44.571 --> 01:05:45.672
Who's this?

943
01:05:46.102 --> 01:05:47.701
A scholarship recipient?

944
01:05:48.201 --> 01:05:51.612
Gather around and smile. I'll take your photo.

945
01:05:51.612 --> 01:05:53.612
1, 2, 3.

946
01:05:53.612 --> 01:05:54.911
Wait for me.

947
01:05:56.082 --> 01:05:57.582
Seo Ji An.

948
01:05:57.582 --> 01:05:58.652
Ji An.

949
01:05:59.582 --> 01:06:00.681
Ji An.

950
01:06:01.852 --> 01:06:03.621
- Ji Ho. - You made it.

951
01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:09.531
Can I congratulate you after we take the photo?

952
01:06:09.962 --> 01:06:11.462
Come and join us.

953
01:06:16.402 --> 01:06:18.031
1, 2, 3.

(My Golden Life)

957
01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:15.721
Why do you always say thank you and sorry to me?

958
01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:19.261
- You're back. - The coffee was good.

959
01:07:19.801 --> 01:07:21.562
You're the same age.

960
01:07:21.562 --> 01:07:23.272
We can be friends.

961
01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:24.371
What?

962
01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:26.201
Do you know Judo Man?

963
01:07:26.201 --> 01:07:28.871
He can pick up any girl he wants.

964
01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:32.071
How did you confirm Ji An's Eun Seok?

965
01:07:32.312 --> 01:07:34.112
- Pardon? - Where's Jo Soon Ok?

966
01:07:34.112 --> 01:07:35.582
I'd like to see her.

967
01:07:35.741 --> 01:07:37.852
It'll be all over in five days.

968
01:07:37.852 --> 01:07:39.082
You did great.

969
01:07:39.181 --> 01:07:41.252
You felt like a real brother now.
