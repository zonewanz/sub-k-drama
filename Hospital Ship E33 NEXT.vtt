(Geoje Jeil Hospital, a certified medical institution)

3
00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:53.037
Thank you for coming all the way here.

4
00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:54.637
I'm Kim Su Kwon, the director.

5
00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:55.667
Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:58.537
I'm sure you're all busy.

7
00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:01.247
You didn't have to come down here to greet an old man.

8
00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:03.917
Not at all. Shall we go inside?

9
00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:05.417
Before we do,

10
00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:08.346
there is someone I should see.

11
00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:11.057
Someone you should see? Who do you mean?

12
00:01:24.137 --> 00:01:25.236
It's been a long time,

13
00:01:26.036 --> 00:01:27.236
Doctor Song Eun Jae.

14
00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.176
Hello.

15
00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:31.637
It must be hard for someone...

16
00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:34.007
as competent as you to work at a place like this.

17
00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:36.777
No, it's not.

18
00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:40.247
I'm grateful that I can work here.

19
00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:43.516
You're still humble as well.

20
00:01:44.217 --> 00:01:45.417
I'm flattered.

21
00:01:45.986 --> 00:01:47.057
Anyway,

22
00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:50.926
Doosung Group is going to work with this hospital.

23
00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:54.327
Let's see how we can improve this place.

24
00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:58.596
I'll see you again, Doctor Song.

(MOU Signing Ceremony)

31
00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:44.877
They'll establish nonprofit medical foundation?

32
00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:46.046
Yes.

33
00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:48.546
Doosung Group and our hospital will work on it together?

34
00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:50.787
That's right. We'll also establish...

35
00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:53.187
a partnership with Seoul Daehan Hospital.

36
00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:55.857
Why did the director decide to do this all of a sudden?

37
00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:58.857
It's not sudden. He's been looking for a partner for a while.

38
00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:00.266
What's the reason?

39
00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:02.366
What do you think?

40
00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:04.996
Is it what I think it is?

41
00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:06.607
Obviously.

42
00:03:08.537 --> 00:03:10.176
Is the hospital losing that much money?

43
00:03:10.877 --> 00:03:13.206
The biggest cause is this ER.

44
00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:16.516
I specialize in emergency medicine,

45
00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:20.546
but I even suggested that we close the ER before we go bankrupt.

46
00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:22.417
If we keep the ER open,

47
00:03:22.646 --> 00:03:24.556
the hospital will suffer that much deficit.

48
00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:27.287
But if we close it...

49
00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:31.496
The patients will die on the street.

50
00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:34.296
If they establish the foundation,

51
00:03:35.127 --> 00:03:36.466
will they avoid having deficits?

52
00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:39.137
Yes, that's likely.

53
00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:41.137
What are their terms?

54
00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:44.107
- Terms? - What does Doosung Group want?

55
00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:45.806
It's a nonprofit foundation.

56
00:03:46.347 --> 00:03:49.546
Seoul Daehan Hospital is also a nonprofit foundation,

57
00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:51.176
but they try...

58
00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:54.086
awfully hard to make profits.

59
00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:56.046
You know that.

60
00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:01.657
Doosung Group is a conglomerate. Does it make sense...

61
00:04:01.787 --> 00:04:04.097
that the chairman of such company all the way here for nothing?

62
00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:07.366
Maybe he's doing it to serve the community.

63
00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:11.597
You're naiver than I thought.

64
00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:15.167
You're more political than I thought.

65
00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:24.747
I'm surprised you see it that way.

66
00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:42.497
Did you...

67
00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:46.437
reserve this place for me to stay?

68
00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:50.807
I'm sorry, sir. I will get you to a better place.

69
00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:54.507
The problem is this place is too good!

70
00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:57.877
- I'm sorry? - Mr. Oh.

71
00:04:58.547 --> 00:04:59.547
Yes, sir?

72
00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:02.317
Do you think I'm here to enjoy spa...

73
00:05:02.317 --> 00:05:04.617
and idle away my time?

74
00:05:05.817 --> 00:05:08.456
Find another place now!

75
00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:09.697
Right away, sir.

76
00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:30.317
Can you move any slower?

77
00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:32.016
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:33.547 --> 00:05:34.747
How did it go?

79
00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:36.817
Chief Director Jang Sung Ho finished the interview.

80
00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:38.487
The article just has been released.

81
00:05:41.487 --> 00:05:42.487
Let me see it.

82
00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.437
(Remote medical service, the combination of IT and medicine)

83
00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:53.166
Look at this smile on his face.

84
00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:57.177
Why is he grinning like a fool?

85
00:05:58.807 --> 00:06:01.106
Get your act together.

86
00:06:03.047 --> 00:06:04.117
This...

87
00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:07.617
is a battlefield. It's a matter of life or death.

88
00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:09.687
We must push ahead with the bill...

89
00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:13.656
on remote medical service before the next presidential election.

90
00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:16.297
Before this bill passes through,

91
00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:20.797
if someone who thinks the government should...

92
00:06:21.827 --> 00:06:24.666
take care of the citizens' health in the name of universal welfare...

93
00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:26.367
becomes the next president,

94
00:06:26.737 --> 00:06:29.776
we won't be able to start our business on healthcare.

95
00:06:33.047 --> 00:06:34.047
Director Park.

96
00:06:35.077 --> 00:06:36.106
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:38.716
How many diabetic patients are there in Korea?

98
00:06:39.146 --> 00:06:40.547
About seven million.

99
00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:42.086
That's right.

100
00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:44.416
There are seven million diabetic patients.

101
00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:47.156
If the bill on remote medical service passes through,

102
00:06:48.356 --> 00:06:51.656
and we sell one blood sugar level measuring device to each of them,

103
00:06:51.927 --> 00:06:53.497
we'd earn three billion dollars at least.

104
00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:56.026
Our business on healthcare...

105
00:06:56.997 --> 00:06:59.067
will be the golden goose.

106
00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:01.307
It will be the primary engine...

107
00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:04.637
of growth for Doosung Group in the next generation.

108
00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:08.406
Do you understand?

109
00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:10.276
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

"Remote medical service".

113
00:07:32.637 --> 00:07:33.737
No way.

114
00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:37.137
Doosung would want this,

115
00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:41.606
but the director would never agree to this.

116
00:08:00.927 --> 00:08:02.026
What do we do?

117
00:08:10.036 --> 00:08:11.377
Excuse me, sir.

118
00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:14.276
Yes?

119
00:08:14.906 --> 00:08:15.906
What is it?

120
00:08:17.877 --> 00:08:19.947
What are you going to do about the hospital ship?

121
00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:22.617
I believe we should remove the disrupter...

122
00:08:22.617 --> 00:08:25.487
before we start our business on the remote medical service.

123
00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.026
They're doing a good job treating patients on their own.

124
00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:32.996
I can't turn it into scrap metal overnight.

125
00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:35.927
Will you just leave it then?

126
00:08:38.866 --> 00:08:40.537
Are you as dumb as a fish?

127
00:08:45.577 --> 00:08:48.547
I have set out baits here and there.

128
00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:51.846
At least one will take the bait.

129
00:09:03.057 --> 00:09:04.657
Code blue, code blue.

130
00:09:06.057 --> 00:09:07.496
Code blue at NICU.

131
00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:10.366
(NICU, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit)

132
00:09:12.866 --> 00:09:14.937
What happened? Is this baby...

133
00:09:15.206 --> 00:09:17.476
That's right. It's Ms. Hwang In Kyung's baby...

134
00:09:17.476 --> 00:09:18.976
transferred from the hospital ship.

135
00:09:25.376 --> 00:09:26.447
"Respiratory failure"?

136
00:09:27.047 --> 00:09:28.447
Yes, she has a high fever too.

137
00:09:28.447 --> 00:09:29.517
What's the cause?

138
00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:31.657
It's hard to put a finger on it.

139
00:09:45.937 --> 00:09:47.006
Okay.

140
00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:49.636
Sure, very well.

141
00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:53.577
Sir.

142
00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:57.616
Did someone take the bait?

143
00:09:58.017 --> 00:10:00.947
We might be able to solve the issue without getting involved.

144
00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:22.506
What's wrong? Does your leg hurt?

145
00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:26.606
Did I hurt it badly when I last sprained it?

146
00:10:27.077 --> 00:10:28.407
It hurts sometimes.

147
00:10:28.777 --> 00:10:30.577
Sit down. I'll have a look.

148
00:10:30.716 --> 00:10:32.547
- It's fine. - Sit down.

149
00:10:34.447 --> 00:10:35.517
Here?

150
00:10:44.657 --> 00:10:46.567
I don't think it's the bone.

151
00:10:46.827 --> 00:10:48.096
Of course not.

152
00:10:51.037 --> 00:10:52.336
Is it a muscle ache?

153
00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:58.136
You're always on your feet on the ship and in the ER.

154
00:10:58.136 --> 00:10:59.647
No wonder it hurts.

155
00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:03.317
Skip running for a while.

156
00:11:03.677 --> 00:11:05.777
I'll give you a hot compress pack.

157
00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:07.986
I don't need that.

158
00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:10.657
Do as you're told.

159
00:11:10.986 --> 00:11:12.927
Muscle pains need to be cured fast.

160
00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:18.626
What's that look for?

161
00:11:18.626 --> 00:11:21.866
You nag way too much. Almost as much as my mom.

162
00:11:23.596 --> 00:11:24.697
What?

163
00:11:25.496 --> 00:11:26.537
Let's go.

164
00:11:40.517 --> 00:11:41.716
33 times.

165
00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:46.386
That's how many times you sighed on the way back.

166
00:11:50.856 --> 00:11:51.956
34 times.

167
00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:00.236
Is something wrong?

168
00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:06.506
It's Hwang In Kyung's baby.

169
00:12:07.147 --> 00:12:08.376
What about the baby?

170
00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:21.486
Respiratory failure?

171
00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:26.897
What could be the cause?

172
00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:30.797
I'm sure we suctioned her airways properly.

173
00:12:31.797 --> 00:12:35.267
Do you think that could be the problem?

174
00:12:35.407 --> 00:12:37.836
When we transferred them, there was no fever...

175
00:12:37.836 --> 00:12:39.577
and the vitals were stable.

176
00:12:41.307 --> 00:12:42.677
That's true.

177
00:12:44.047 --> 00:12:47.147
The fact that she's premature and under 2kg...

178
00:12:47.647 --> 00:12:49.586
could be the biggest reason.

179
00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:56.297
I put my hand into the incubator because I wanted...

180
00:12:56.557 --> 00:12:58.557
to hold her hand to tell her to be strong,

181
00:12:59.027 --> 00:13:03.167
and she held my finger so tight.

182
00:13:17.677 --> 00:13:20.716
The baby's trying so hard to fight.

183
00:13:22.047 --> 00:13:24.657
That made me feel even smaller.

184
00:13:26.427 --> 00:13:28.187
That tiny baby...

185
00:13:28.657 --> 00:13:31.327
is giving all it has to fight to stay alive.

186
00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:35.966
There's nothing I can do to help as a doctor.

187
00:13:37.197 --> 00:13:38.366
I felt so pathetic.

188
00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.767
I couldn't stand it.

189
00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:52.647
Are you Hwang In Kyung?

190
00:13:56.716 --> 00:13:57.817
I am.

191
00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:00.327
Did you see your baby?

192
00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:03.297
Yes.

193
00:14:04.356 --> 00:14:05.527
How is she?

194
00:14:07.527 --> 00:14:08.726
Who are you?

195
00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:17.677
A lawyer?

196
00:14:18.577 --> 00:14:20.547
- You're a lawyer? - Yes.

197
00:14:22.206 --> 00:14:23.547
Why are you here?

198
00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:25.917
You had a cesarean on the hospital ship.

199
00:14:27.986 --> 00:14:31.017
Done by a general surgeon, not an OBGYN specialist.

200
00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:35.386
Yes, that's right.

201
00:14:38.027 --> 00:14:40.327
I think that disaster is...

202
00:14:40.327 --> 00:14:43.236
the reason your baby is suffering.

203
00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:46.606
What do you think?

204
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.962
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 33 Hospital Ship "What if I Have to Choose One?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

205
00:15:00.586 --> 00:15:01.986
Why is he here?

206
00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:13.667
How are you?

207
00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:19.866
What brings someone of your position here?

208
00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:22.736
I'm here to carry out an inspection.

209
00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:28.577
An inspection?

210
00:15:29.506 --> 00:15:31.777
Yes, an inspection.

211
00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:34.287
Why would there be...

212
00:15:34.287 --> 00:15:36.287
a sudden inspection?

213
00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:38.886
You should give us some time to prepare.

214
00:15:38.886 --> 00:15:41.126
To prepare? For what?

215
00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:43.756
Is there something on your conscience?

216
00:15:43.827 --> 00:15:45.427
Why would there be?

217
00:15:45.427 --> 00:15:47.667
Then you have nothing to worry about.

218
00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:50.267
Just go about your usual business.

219
00:15:50.437 --> 00:15:51.697
Set things up.

220
00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:57.907
Hey... What's this about?

221
00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:00.876
I don't know.

222
00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:05.116
Hello, sis.

223
00:16:06.346 --> 00:16:07.846
Stop calling me that.

224
00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:11.417
You're late.

225
00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:13.726
I am. I had to make a stop.

226
00:16:17.496 --> 00:16:19.797
- Hello? - Ms. Song Eun Jae?

227
00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:21.767
That's me.

228
00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:24.096
This is Geoje Police Station.

229
00:16:27.037 --> 00:16:28.437
The police?

230
00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:36.447
(Geoje Police Station)

231
00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:46.886
You were reported for malpractice.

232
00:16:47.386 --> 00:16:50.126
We need you to come over and give a statement.

233
00:16:50.397 --> 00:16:53.767
(Geoje Police Station)

234
00:16:55.427 --> 00:16:57.937
- Doctor. - Doctor Song.

235
00:16:57.937 --> 00:17:00.136
Did you do a cesarean on the hospital ship?

236
00:17:00.267 --> 00:17:02.136
How was the patient?

237
00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:03.807
You're a liver, gallbladder, pancreas specialist.

238
00:17:03.807 --> 00:17:05.977
Had you performed a cesarean before?

239
00:17:06.376 --> 00:17:08.176
I want an answer. Yes or no.

240
00:17:08.846 --> 00:17:10.616
- No. - It was your first time?

241
00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:12.616
Do you know the patient's baby...

242
00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:14.346
is in serious condition?

243
00:17:14.487 --> 00:17:15.547
I do.

244
00:17:15.547 --> 00:17:16.987
Don't you think...

245
00:17:16.987 --> 00:17:20.186
your inexperience is the biggest cause of the child's condition?

246
00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:32.196
"The hospital ship's doctor of disaster"?

247
00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:35.136
How dare these media jackals blame it on her.

248
00:17:35.436 --> 00:17:37.836
Shall I leave a comment telling them to do their job properly?

249
00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:41.146
Nurse Pyo, what's going on?

250
00:17:42.077 --> 00:17:43.217
It's so strange.

251
00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:47.217
Even we didn't know Doctor Song went in to be questioned.

252
00:17:47.846 --> 00:17:50.186
How do you think the reporters found out?

253
00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:04.666
(Song Eun Jae, the doctor of disaster)

254
00:18:05.596 --> 00:18:06.737
What's this?

255
00:18:08.767 --> 00:18:09.777
Jae Geol.

256
00:18:11.707 --> 00:18:14.376
Hyun, what's going on?

257
00:18:28.457 --> 00:18:31.196
Do you mind if I take the call?

258
00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:33.467
Keep it short.

259
00:18:37.537 --> 00:18:38.797
It's me.

260
00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:41.106
Where are you? The police station?

261
00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:44.007
- Yes. - Why did you go alone?

262
00:18:44.507 --> 00:18:46.106
Why didn't you tell me?

263
00:18:46.507 --> 00:18:48.977
- I didn't need to. - Doctor Song.

264
00:18:50.817 --> 00:18:52.446
I have to go.

265
00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:54.517
I'll come over.

266
00:18:54.987 --> 00:18:56.557
No, don't bother.

267
00:18:56.557 --> 00:18:58.656
It won't change anything.

268
00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:00.156
Why won't it?

269
00:19:02.686 --> 00:19:05.356
See your patients. That's more important.

270
00:19:05.426 --> 00:19:09.596
Do you think this is me being worried about my girlfriend?

271
00:19:10.196 --> 00:19:11.366
Doctor Kwak.

272
00:19:11.537 --> 00:19:14.136
Does it sound like I'm ditching my patients...

273
00:19:14.136 --> 00:19:15.537
to come over?

274
00:19:16.606 --> 00:19:19.477
- No, what I meant was... - Listen carefully.

275
00:19:20.507 --> 00:19:21.606
Doctor Song.

276
00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:25.317
I'm talking not as your boyfriend...

277
00:19:25.817 --> 00:19:28.586
but as a colleague who was in the OR with you.

278
00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:31.017
You shouldn't be under investigation.

279
00:19:31.017 --> 00:19:33.527
If what the reporters wrote is true,

280
00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:36.497
and this is about the baby we delivered,

281
00:19:37.497 --> 00:19:40.196
You shouldn't be interrogated. It should be me.

282
00:19:40.997 --> 00:19:42.626
I treated the baby.

283
00:19:43.836 --> 00:19:45.767
From the moment she was born...

284
00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:49.676
to the moment she was transferred to Jeil Hospital's NICU,

285
00:19:49.977 --> 00:19:51.477
I'm the one who treated her.

286
00:19:52.307 --> 00:19:54.007
Do you understand what I'm saying?

287
00:19:55.247 --> 00:19:58.047
- Yes. - If the detective asks questions,

288
00:19:58.047 --> 00:20:01.247
tell him exactly what I said, and finish the interview.

289
00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:05.757
Okay, I'll do that.

290
00:20:06.757 --> 00:20:07.987
All right.

291
00:20:09.757 --> 00:20:12.926
I'll pick you up as soon as I finish work.

292
00:20:39.557 --> 00:20:42.287
There are only two operations in a month.

293
00:20:42.957 --> 00:20:43.997
Goodness.

294
00:20:45.997 --> 00:20:49.196
Dangerous doctors are always inefficient.

295
00:20:50.497 --> 00:20:51.596
Inefficient?

296
00:20:51.596 --> 00:20:53.666
A doctor's annual salary is over 40,000 dollars.

297
00:20:53.936 --> 00:20:57.037
Despite all the equipment, she performed only...

298
00:20:57.037 --> 00:21:00.747
two operations a month. She did them for free.

299
00:21:00.747 --> 00:21:02.876
How does it make sense?

300
00:21:02.876 --> 00:21:06.176
Those operations saved two lives.

301
00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:07.886
Or should I say three?

302
00:21:07.886 --> 00:21:11.257
Do you think those lives worth only 40,000 dollars?

303
00:21:11.257 --> 00:21:13.156
One of them was a mafia leader.

304
00:21:13.156 --> 00:21:16.126
Isn't his life worth anything?

305
00:21:16.356 --> 00:21:19.057
It doesn't matter whose life we save.

306
00:21:19.057 --> 00:21:22.267
What's important is whether it's a patient or not.

307
00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:24.067
Amazing.

308
00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:28.906
Is it because you sail over the open sea every day?

309
00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:31.936
You're such a romantic.

310
00:21:32.307 --> 00:21:34.646
- Sir. - Let's see if...

311
00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:37.946
the local council agrees with you.

312
00:21:37.946 --> 00:21:39.116
The local council?

313
00:21:39.116 --> 00:21:42.747
The head of the council filed a complaint about...

314
00:21:42.747 --> 00:21:45.356
the operation of this hospital ship.

315
00:21:45.356 --> 00:21:47.257
What are we?

316
00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:50.696
Why are you cornering the hospital ship all of a sudden?

317
00:21:50.696 --> 00:21:52.856
Who's cornering who?

318
00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:55.866
To operate the city economically and efficiently,

319
00:21:56.267 --> 00:21:59.336
we're trying to reduce all frivolous costs.

320
00:21:59.537 --> 00:22:00.537
On top of that,

321
00:22:01.366 --> 00:22:04.077
the result of the audit will be important.

322
00:22:04.676 --> 00:22:05.936
What do you think, Mr. Chu?

323
00:22:10.616 --> 00:22:13.346
"The Height of Inefficiency"...

324
00:22:13.346 --> 00:22:15.217
"is the hospital ship"?

325
00:22:15.217 --> 00:22:16.886
I told the reporter...

326
00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:19.356
to include this in Song Eun Jae's article.

327
00:22:20.027 --> 00:22:21.987
You're not completely incompetent.

328
00:22:21.987 --> 00:22:23.196
Thank you, sir.

329
00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:27.827
Can you drive any faster? The governor is waiting.

330
00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:28.926
Yes, sir.

331
00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:34.366
(Jurisdiction in the island area)

332
00:22:34.366 --> 00:22:36.876
- Thank you. - Thank you.

333
00:22:36.876 --> 00:22:40.946
The island area is selected to be a remote medical service area.

334
00:22:41.707 --> 00:22:45.116
Remote medical service is necessary in areas...

335
00:22:45.217 --> 00:22:47.346
such as isolated islands or villages in the mountains.

336
00:22:48.487 --> 00:22:50.856
It's a necessary support system...

337
00:22:50.856 --> 00:22:53.386
for those who have no access to medical care.

338
00:22:53.827 --> 00:22:55.356
(Remote medical support business)

339
00:22:55.356 --> 00:22:58.027
Business to support remote medical service...

340
00:22:58.027 --> 00:23:00.067
is something I'd like...

341
00:23:00.626 --> 00:23:03.196
to establish before I retire.

342
00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:05.596
It's my last task.

343
00:23:06.537 --> 00:23:09.106
All the employees at Doosung Group...

344
00:23:09.977 --> 00:23:12.977
will do their best to establish...

345
00:23:13.577 --> 00:23:16.317
the remote medical service system.

346
00:23:20.247 --> 00:23:22.747
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

347
00:23:23.257 --> 00:23:24.416
What are you doing?

348
00:23:24.757 --> 00:23:26.586
It's called remote something.

349
00:23:27.787 --> 00:23:30.497
- Remote medical service? - That's it.

350
00:23:30.497 --> 00:23:33.626
They said that they'll start it and gave me this.

351
00:23:34.027 --> 00:23:36.866
My grandson will love it, don't you think?

352
00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:42.106
Let me check your blood pressure and sugar level.

353
00:23:45.936 --> 00:23:50.017
Do I still have to go to the clinic if I use the remote thing?

354
00:23:50.817 --> 00:23:51.846
Yes.

355
00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:54.787
You need to check your blood sugar level at the clinic every day.

356
00:23:55.086 --> 00:23:57.186
You also need to watch your diet.

357
00:23:57.616 --> 00:24:00.787
If you don't take care of yourself, you may get diabetic shock.

358
00:24:01.227 --> 00:24:02.886
It could be dangerous.

359
00:24:03.297 --> 00:24:06.997
I heard that it's not necessary if I use this.

360
00:24:11.297 --> 00:24:13.436
Hello, ma'am.

361
00:24:13.436 --> 00:24:15.567
Please put your arm through here.

362
00:24:15.567 --> 00:24:18.176
- Pull this and attach it. - I see.

363
00:24:18.176 --> 00:24:21.446
- Now can you push this button? - What's going on?

364
00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:24.317
- Which one? - It's the one right here.

365
00:24:24.317 --> 00:24:26.247
- This? - The one next to it.

366
00:24:26.446 --> 00:24:28.717
- This one? - It's the blue button.

367
00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:30.856
- She won't be able to do it. - Push this one.

368
00:24:30.856 --> 00:24:32.457
Come out of the frame.

369
00:24:35.356 --> 00:24:37.497
- Gosh. - What did she say again?

370
00:24:40.426 --> 00:24:42.797
- Good job. - That's right.

371
00:24:42.797 --> 00:24:45.267
- That was correct. - Good job.

372
00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:46.807
Let's move on.

373
00:24:51.136 --> 00:24:53.406
- Are you done? - How is Ms. Seo Soon Ae?

374
00:24:53.906 --> 00:24:56.646
- I was kicked out immediately. - Kicked out?

375
00:24:57.047 --> 00:25:00.217
They were filming a promotion video for the remote medical service.

376
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:01.886
A promotion video?

377
00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:05.017
After they distributed laptops to everyone,

378
00:25:05.116 --> 00:25:07.787
everyone seemed so excited.

379
00:25:07.787 --> 00:25:09.287
They were so grateful.

380
00:25:11.497 --> 00:25:15.797
I overheard what the public clinic administrator said on my way here.

381
00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:21.106
A total of 26 islands will try remote medical service.

382
00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:22.977
26?

383
00:25:24.537 --> 00:25:28.077
Strangely enough, all those islands...

384
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:31.547
are the islands that the hospital ship visits.

385
00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:40.126
By the way,

386
00:25:40.386 --> 00:25:42.997
is remote medical service even possible?

387
00:25:43.327 --> 00:25:47.297
It's a system to diagnose and prescribe medicine on video.

388
00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:48.467
How can it be possible?

389
00:25:49.096 --> 00:25:51.237
Auscultation and physical contact with the patient...

390
00:25:51.636 --> 00:25:54.267
aren't enough to eliminate possibilities of missed diagnosis.

391
00:25:54.567 --> 00:25:57.477
How can we diagnose and treat patients on screen?

392
00:25:57.477 --> 00:25:58.676
Right?

393
00:25:59.577 --> 00:26:00.977
Like in science fiction,

394
00:26:01.277 --> 00:26:04.477
doctors could be replaced by artificial intelligence.

395
00:26:04.777 --> 00:26:08.287
Diagnosing and treating patients through video can't be possible.

396
00:26:09.017 --> 00:26:10.257
Right?

397
00:26:11.116 --> 00:26:14.386
I'm not sure, but current medicine law won't allow it either.

398
00:26:16.997 --> 00:26:19.666
Have you talked to Dr. Song?

399
00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:26.507
She must be under investigation.

400
00:26:26.507 --> 00:26:28.507
I know she's strong,

401
00:26:28.507 --> 00:26:30.106
but police can put on pressure.

402
00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:32.277
She must be scared.

403
00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:35.146
I'll go there as soon as possible.

404
00:26:36.646 --> 00:26:39.446
Go as soon as possible, and bail her out.

405
00:26:40.846 --> 00:26:41.946
I'm leaving.

406
00:26:49.596 --> 00:26:51.626
The pregnant woman was brought by her mother.

407
00:26:52.126 --> 00:26:54.827
I found out that the umbilical cord had prolapsed.

408
00:26:55.327 --> 00:26:56.866
If ignored,

409
00:26:57.166 --> 00:26:59.436
the baby loses access to oxygen.

410
00:26:59.936 --> 00:27:02.606
In the worst case, the baby could die.

411
00:27:03.807 --> 00:27:05.807
I had to perform an emergency operation.

412
00:27:05.807 --> 00:27:08.346
- Did you explain it to her mother? - Of course.

413
00:27:08.446 --> 00:27:10.547
She said that you didn't.

414
00:27:10.846 --> 00:27:12.176
That can't be.

415
00:27:12.876 --> 00:27:16.116
There's no operation agreement.

416
00:27:17.356 --> 00:27:18.987
Did she sign the agreement?

417
00:27:20.656 --> 00:27:22.426
Did she or not?

418
00:27:22.626 --> 00:27:24.096
I don't think she did.

419
00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:27.866
However, I explained thoroughly.

420
00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:30.096
She gave a verbal agreement.

421
00:27:30.596 --> 00:27:31.696
How can I believe that?

422
00:27:31.797 --> 00:27:34.767
Nurse Cho Mi Yang was present at the time.

423
00:27:35.067 --> 00:27:36.237
We can't trust that.

424
00:27:36.436 --> 00:27:38.336
After an operation without agreement,

425
00:27:38.336 --> 00:27:40.946
- you could agree on the same alibi. - Detective.

426
00:27:40.946 --> 00:27:43.717
You should have asked to sign the agreement beforehand.

427
00:27:44.217 --> 00:27:48.116
Isn't that the basics for a surgeon?

428
00:27:49.217 --> 00:27:50.356
Tell me.

429
00:27:50.787 --> 00:27:53.287
You couldn't think clearly because you've never done the operation?

430
00:27:55.626 --> 00:27:57.696
What about suctioning after she was born?

431
00:27:58.626 --> 00:28:01.797
You were flustered then, weren't you?

432
00:28:01.797 --> 00:28:03.366
What do you want to ask?

433
00:28:03.467 --> 00:28:06.567
Wasn't that why you couldn't complete the suction thoroughly?

434
00:28:06.567 --> 00:28:08.866
That's why the baby is in critical condition.

435
00:28:08.866 --> 00:28:09.977
That's not true.

436
00:28:11.406 --> 00:28:13.676
- What do you mean? - It's unfortunate that...

437
00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:15.047
the baby is in critical condition.

438
00:28:15.047 --> 00:28:18.077
We can't say that the reason is simply due to the suction.

439
00:28:18.176 --> 00:28:21.946
Can it be one of the reasons?

440
00:28:23.057 --> 00:28:24.757
Before the investigation,

441
00:28:25.057 --> 00:28:27.186
I asked for the opinions from some experts.

442
00:28:27.186 --> 00:28:28.656
During the process of suction,

443
00:28:28.787 --> 00:28:32.426
if substances such as feces or amniotic fluid remains in the lungs,

444
00:28:32.426 --> 00:28:35.396
it could cause the baby lung problems.

445
00:28:35.696 --> 00:28:37.997
Can you guarantee that there were no problems...

446
00:28:37.997 --> 00:28:39.666
during the suction?

447
00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:42.606
No, nothing can be guaranteed.

448
00:28:42.606 --> 00:28:46.037
There may have been problems during the suction, right?

449
00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:49.247
However, we can't be sure of it.

450
00:28:49.777 --> 00:28:51.616
In many cases of infantile respiratory distress syndrome,

451
00:28:52.116 --> 00:28:54.717
reasons are often unclear.

452
00:28:54.717 --> 00:28:57.686
Sometimes we take a look at how the baby is treated afterwards.

453
00:28:57.686 --> 00:28:59.116
More than anything,

454
00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:00.656
Hwang In Kyung's baby...

455
00:29:01.057 --> 00:29:04.196
weighs only 1.9kg. That could be the biggest reason...

456
00:29:04.196 --> 00:29:05.557
Forget it.

457
00:29:05.856 --> 00:29:08.426
Explain the suction process.

458
00:29:08.727 --> 00:29:09.737
Pardon me?

459
00:29:10.537 --> 00:29:13.207
- Explain? - After cutting the umbilical cord,

460
00:29:13.207 --> 00:29:15.767
what happened during the suction process?

461
00:29:16.277 --> 00:29:17.507
Explain it to me.

462
00:29:19.807 --> 00:29:22.146
- That's... - What is it?

463
00:29:24.247 --> 00:29:26.116
Why can't you explain?

464
00:29:42.896 --> 00:29:44.737
This isn't something you should be questioned over.

465
00:29:53.876 --> 00:29:55.047
I treated the baby.

466
00:29:56.346 --> 00:29:58.146
From the moment she was born...

467
00:29:58.146 --> 00:30:00.047
to the moment she was transferred...

468
00:30:00.047 --> 00:30:01.916
to Jeil Hospital's NICU,

469
00:30:04.317 --> 00:30:05.386
I'm the one who treated her.

470
00:30:09.356 --> 00:30:10.426
Ms. Song Eun Jae.

471
00:30:13.327 --> 00:30:14.366
Doctor Song!

472
00:30:15.196 --> 00:30:16.267
Why can't you answer me?

473
00:30:16.497 --> 00:30:19.237
Were you flustered while you suction as well?

474
00:30:20.136 --> 00:30:21.237
Or was it...

475
00:30:22.366 --> 00:30:23.606
someone else who did it?

476
00:30:29.905 --> 00:30:32.805
(Episode 34 will air shortly.)
