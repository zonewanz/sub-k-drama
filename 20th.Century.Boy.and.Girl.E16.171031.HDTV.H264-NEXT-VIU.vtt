00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.315
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:16.416
Oh, goodness.

3
00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.536
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:47.045
He didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable, but I insisted.

5
00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.356
I thought it would be better for you two to get closer.

6
00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.195
Aren't you going to give me some credit?

7
00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.456
Oh, great job.

8
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.926
I got to come over thanks to Ji Won.

9
00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:01.536
This is great.

10
00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.136
- Me too. - I know it's inconvenient for you,

11
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.965
but I just decided to come.

12
00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:08.176
No, it's inconvenient because my place isn't much.

13
00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:09.635
It's better than his place.

14
00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.805
I don't care if I live in a palace. It's still worse than his.

15
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.406
Oh, sure.

16
00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:16.816
Had I known you were coming, I would've made some dinner.

17
00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:19.685
No, it takes too long to cook, and delivery food tastes much better.

18
00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:23.256
I'm the one who couldn't bring anything...

19
00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:25.055
because I came in a hurry. I'm sorry.

20
00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.656
No. Don't worry about it. I love your present.

21
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.366
I can't believe I lived to see a day like this.

22
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.866
I got a present from you.

23
00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:36.736
Oh, this is...

24
00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:43.075
You should give it to her.

25
00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:44.945
No, you should.

26
00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:47.745
She'll be much happier if she gets it from you.

27
00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:51.185
A present is only meaningful if the receiver is happy.

28
00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:55.616
What is this?

29
00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:00.126
She needs to water it once a week, right?

30
00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:02.355
Oh, yes.

31
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:05.626
Don't kill it.

32
00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:08.335
Even if a war breaks out and I die, this won't die.

33
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.565
It'll live longer than pine trees.

34
00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:15.176
Anthony, wait just a little. It'll bloom flowers very soon.

35
00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.176
I'm pretty lucky, you know.

36
00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:19.845
I'll give you all of my luck.

37
00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.976
- You should keep it. - No.

38
00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:27.146
I'll keep the tree and give you all the luck.

39
00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.285
No, you can keep both.

40
00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.555
You both can keep that luck.

41
00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:36.525
- Or the three of us. - Okay.

42
00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.495
Do you need anything else?

43
00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:41.035
Is the food okay?

44
00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:43.896
Is it too strong? Do you want some pepper powder?

45
00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.905
Oh, do you take vinegar with your pickled radish?

46
00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:51.745
Everything is great as long as you're happy.

47
00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:56.116
Jin Jin.

48
00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:59.646
What about me? Do you have any questions for me?

49
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:01.285
I do.

50
00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:03.285
What is it?

51
00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:05.456
Why do you keep wearing that color?

52
00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:09.326
Why? Is it weird?

53
00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:11.565
Yes, that color is definitely not for you.

54
00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.495
And what did I tell you? What should men wear in fall?

55
00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.136
- Burgundy? - Yes.

56
00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:19.965
Colin Firth wears burgundy and so does Leonardo DiCaprio.

57
00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:21.005
What about me?

58
00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:26.146
The way you look in burgundy is...

59
00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:28.516
the best in the universe.

60
00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:41.896
There's nothing special.

61
00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:46.025
There are a lot of plates, but nothing's worth eating.

62
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.366
What a waste of money. Look at all this.

63
00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.606
It doesn't even taste good.

64
00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:54.476
Food tastes best when eaten at home.

65
00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:56.275
We should've stayed at home.

66
00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:59.375
What are we doing all this for?

67
00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:02.976
We barely found this place.

68
00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:05.785
Nothing on this trip is to my liking.

69
00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:10.185
Okay.

70
00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:14.125
Where's the galbi? I'll go and check.

71
00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:27.606
It tastes fine.

72
00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:31.346
I thought you'd tasted something horrible.

73
00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:33.046
You can't tell sweet from salty...

74
00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:35.116
when I boil salt water to cook with.

75
00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:36.276
What?

76
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.885
Why are you acting like a four-year-old?

77
00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:41.356
Our son drove us all the way to Jeonju...

78
00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:42.986
and looked up a restaurant.

79
00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:45.286
He's doing his utmost best.

80
00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:49.195
Do you think he enjoys travelling with his parents?

81
00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:52.195
What upset you and made you take it out on him?

82
00:04:52.395 --> 00:04:54.866
- You're worse than him. - I am not.

83
00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:57.166
You're such a troublemaker.

84
00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:00.976
I got to get some fresh air, away from the oil,

85
00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:03.736
and I love eating food that someone else prepared.

86
00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:05.976
What a nuisance.

87
00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:12.185
It's my greatest treasure.

88
00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:14.455
The photo we took when I debuted.

89
00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:15.755
That's cute.

90
00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:18.656
Right? Weren't you so cute?

91
00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:22.995
No, you.

92
00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:27.866
- I was cute. - She looked so childish.

93
00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:31.106
How old was I here?

94
00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.106
You were 22.

95
00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:35.736
You topped the chart with Wild Rose.

96
00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:38.145
And got the Golden Cup for being number one 5 weeks in a row.

97
00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:41.445
Terius cried so much that day.

98
00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.745
It was your birthday too.

99
00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.815
It was that more special.

100
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:53.926
You left to go somewhere, didn't you?

101
00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:02.765
(2001)

102
00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:05.005
Anthony. Are you here?

103
00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:07.836
- He isn't here. - He's not here.

104
00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:12.645
- Anthony disappeared. - Why?

105
00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:16.046
To get his girlfriend who broke up with him.

106
00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:17.945
Right now? Before a live show?

107
00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.745
Is he a lunatic?

108
00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:22.116
Oh no. He must've lost his mind.

109
00:06:22.356 --> 00:06:24.726
How could he disappear? Stop nudging me.

110
00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:32.866
It was that day.

111
00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.666
- Are you curious? - A bit.

112
00:06:38.935 --> 00:06:41.875
Jin Jin, I want to ask you something too.

113
00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:43.106
Okay.

114
00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:47.106
- Can I use the bathroom? - Yes.

115
00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:48.745
- It's over there. - Okay.

116
00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:49.916
Wait.

117
00:06:57.656 --> 00:06:59.226
He uses the bathroom?

118
00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.205
Yes. He's human too.

119
00:07:16.606 --> 00:07:19.106
He's not a fairy. He's a human.

120
00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:21.445
He's not a fairy. He's a human.

121
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:23.846
He's not a fairy. He's a human.

122
00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:11.195
Hey, Gong Ji Won.

123
00:08:11.296 --> 00:08:13.695
- What? Why? - "Why"?

124
00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:17.096
Did you suffer from a belated heat stroke?

125
00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:20.435
You should've told me or asked if it's okay to bring him over.

126
00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:22.135
Would I be flustered or not...

127
00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:24.645
when I opened the door to see him standing there?

128
00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:27.645
We were having dinner anyway. We just needed another seating.

129
00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:30.745
Isn't it great to be able to share a meal?

130
00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:33.745
I thought you were a little more generous.

131
00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:36.556
You may learn to love or hate a person,

132
00:08:36.556 --> 00:08:38.356
but you cherish those you eat with.

133
00:08:38.356 --> 00:08:39.785
That's just nonsense.

134
00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:43.226
He's in my house, in my bathroom,

135
00:08:43.226 --> 00:08:44.596
and I wasn't prepared.

136
00:08:44.596 --> 00:08:47.466
Let's not take life so seriously.

137
00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:50.096
What's the fun in being prepared for every situation?

138
00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.265
What are you talking about?

139
00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:54.106
I'm saying I need to prepare mentally.

140
00:08:54.106 --> 00:08:55.976
I need to be psyched up to welcome him.

141
00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:57.545
What? Forget about that.

142
00:08:57.545 --> 00:09:00.005
He crossed the threshold that I cross every day.

143
00:09:00.005 --> 00:09:02.716
We ate at the table that I eat at every day.

144
00:09:02.716 --> 00:09:05.915
We're chatting in the living room where I watch TV.

145
00:09:05.915 --> 00:09:08.456
I never imagined that in my wildest dreams.

146
00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:10.486
Fine.

147
00:09:11.086 --> 00:09:14.226
So what if you imagined it beforehand. What does that change?

148
00:09:14.226 --> 00:09:16.856
After thousands of mental simulations,

149
00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.826
I'd be able to deal with any situation perfectly.

150
00:09:26.606 --> 00:09:28.836
Anthony, would you like some coffee?

151
00:09:29.505 --> 00:09:31.306
You don't like coffee.

152
00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:33.375
I have tea. Would you like some?

153
00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.116
Anything will do.

154
00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:37.216
With dessert or cookies.

155
00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:42.515
Oh, coffee, tea, dessert, cookies, that's what you meant...

156
00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.425
when you talked about plans.

157
00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:47.385
Sa Jin Jin.

158
00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.505
Dad.

159
00:10:02.806 --> 00:10:05.175
Why didn't you stay with your mom?

160
00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:06.545
Just because.

161
00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:09.275
Go back inside. You'll catch a cold.

162
00:10:10.716 --> 00:10:11.816
Stop it.

163
00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:14.716
Dad, shall we go over there?

164
00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:19.686
- Is your mom in bed? - Just you and me.

165
00:10:23.895 --> 00:10:26.525
This is a shop-beer stall.

166
00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:29.135
It's a store during the day,

167
00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:31.005
and at night, they sell beer.

168
00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:33.236
It's a new thing, a trend.

169
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.236
They have this in Seoul now,

170
00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:38.946
but it started here in Jeonju in the 80s.

171
00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:41.415
Oh, I see.

172
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.545
It's just my style.

173
00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:47.145
You should have a drink.

174
00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:50.316
Let's have a drink my son pours me.

175
00:11:01.736 --> 00:11:03.366
It tastes great.

176
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.236
The moon's bright too.

177
00:11:08.275 --> 00:11:10.035
Since the moon is bright...

178
00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:13.346
Dad.

179
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:18.515
I didn't get the job at the bank, car manufacturer,

180
00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:21.056
or import-export company.

181
00:11:30.025 --> 00:11:32.665
I'm great at frying chicken.

182
00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:37.295
I made a pact with your mom.

183
00:11:39.436 --> 00:11:41.606
I'll go on frying chicken without...

184
00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:44.806
giving into any distractions until your sister's married...

185
00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:46.545
and you find a job.

186
00:11:50.216 --> 00:11:52.586
You have Mom and Dad.

187
00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:57.415
I can't believe I'm envious of you.

188
00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:01.856
Dad.

189
00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:05.925
- How about a love shot? - What?

190
00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:08.966
You should stop being so silly.

191
00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:12.736
Come on. Come on.

192
00:12:13.405 --> 00:12:14.535
What for?

193
00:12:17.275 --> 00:12:18.645
Do you like it?

194
00:12:20.545 --> 00:12:23.316
(Streetside Supermarket)

195
00:12:25.285 --> 00:12:27.716
The friends who were at the wedding?

196
00:12:27.716 --> 00:12:30.816
Yes, Ah Reum and Young Shim. We're the Four Bongos.

197
00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:32.525
We rode the same Bongo van.

198
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.425
I see. I'm envious.

199
00:12:41.566 --> 00:12:43.736
I'll walk you to the taxi stand.

200
00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:45.535
Hey, take him home.

201
00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:46.736
It's fine.

202
00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:48.806
- Why... - Go on.

203
00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:52.375
- It's fine. - Seriously?

204
00:12:53.946 --> 00:12:56.415
- Hello. - Hooray.

205
00:12:56.946 --> 00:12:58.245
My goodness.

206
00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:01.255
- Hello. - What's going on?

207
00:13:02.186 --> 00:13:03.385
Thanks for the meal.

208
00:13:03.755 --> 00:13:05.956
What do you like, Jin Jin?

209
00:13:07.755 --> 00:13:10.456
I like what you like.

210
00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:14.736
Let's eat something we both like next time.

211
00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:16.765
Okay.

212
00:13:28.716 --> 00:13:31.116
Don't talk like that about Anthony.

213
00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:32.415
It can't be me.

214
00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:34.285
He deserves...

215
00:13:35.255 --> 00:13:37.116
someone really great.

216
00:13:37.456 --> 00:13:41.196
A woman from a happy family who grew up without hardships.

217
00:13:41.525 --> 00:13:45.895
Someone who can comfort him even when he has a hard time.

218
00:13:46.265 --> 00:13:47.596
That's you, perfectly.

219
00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:51.535
Let's put our hands on our hearts.

220
00:13:54.106 --> 00:13:56.206
You like Anthony...

221
00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:57.706
as a man.

222
00:13:58.346 --> 00:14:00.946
As a man? You mean I like him?

223
00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:05.385
That's why you get so annoyed whenever there's a rumor about him.

224
00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:08.155
Who was that? Yes, Hwang Hye Jung.

225
00:14:08.155 --> 00:14:10.616
You threatened to burn your photos of Anthony.

226
00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.755
When he was rumored to date Choi Min Kyung,

227
00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:14.356
you threatened to raid his house.

228
00:14:14.356 --> 00:14:15.895
You even said...

229
00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:19.765
you'd go to prison for him if he ever broke the law.

230
00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:21.736
Love is merciless.

231
00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:25.106
Do you think I'm in love?

232
00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:29.576
- Then what? - A car date or a movie.

233
00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:31.106
It's all fine.

234
00:14:31.106 --> 00:14:32.976
As long as nobody finds out.

235
00:14:33.675 --> 00:14:36.275
I won't accept any scandals or rumors.

236
00:14:36.545 --> 00:14:39.415
How can he date someone in secret?

237
00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:41.586
Why can't he?

238
00:14:41.616 --> 00:14:43.915
I've known him for so many years.

239
00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:45.186
I deserve that much.

240
00:14:45.186 --> 00:14:47.556
Were you being polite when you got a makeover...

241
00:14:47.556 --> 00:14:50.326
each time you went to his concert?

242
00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:52.096
I can do that much for a man...

243
00:14:52.096 --> 00:14:55.035
who worked for months to prepare for a concert.

244
00:14:55.035 --> 00:14:58.135
You once said you wanted to be his sweaty shirt.

245
00:14:59.336 --> 00:15:02.336
Not a shirt that used to stick to his sinewy body?

246
00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:06.076
See, she has a thing for his body.

247
00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:07.476
She likes him for real.

248
00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:10.616
- I do not. - "I do not."

249
00:15:15.086 --> 00:15:16.255
How interesting.

250
00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:18.255
What is?

251
00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:19.856
Jin Jin.

252
00:15:20.326 --> 00:15:23.456
You have no idea. She's hilarious.

253
00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:26.196
She's more a comedienne than an actress.

254
00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:29.165
She could imitate anyone when she was younger.

255
00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:31.706
I laughed until my sides hurt.

256
00:15:34.135 --> 00:15:36.275
You should see her at her best.

257
00:15:36.775 --> 00:15:38.645
There's no escaping her.

258
00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:43.946
I'll be on this live tomorrow.

259
00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:46.216
- As a DJ? - Yes.

260
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.472
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E16 20th Century Boy & Girl "Death Day"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

261
00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:06.165
Yes. Okay.

262
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.436
Stop it.

263
00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:12.306
Okay, okay.

264
00:16:12.775 --> 00:16:14.216
Will you stay the night?

265
00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:20.915
Chul Min.

266
00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:25.556
Do you think I can date someone again?

267
00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.236
Of course.

268
00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:40.665
You'll be fine.

269
00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.535
You suffered a while.

270
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.056
How refreshing.

271
00:17:20.475 --> 00:17:21.975
Looking sharp.

272
00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:28.316
- Are you going swimming? - Yes.

273
00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:33.786
Then I'll read some scripts I got and go to the signing.

274
00:17:34.155 --> 00:17:35.826
It's in Samseong-dong at 4pm.

275
00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:38.326
I think I'll be done around 6pm.

276
00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:41.135
I'll be home around 6:30. 7pm if there's traffic.

277
00:18:00.885 --> 00:18:02.185
Go ahead.

278
00:18:07.596 --> 00:18:09.395
My car's over there.

279
00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:12.066
Mine's this way.

280
00:18:14.465 --> 00:18:15.735
- Go. - Bye.

281
00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:41.155
Sa Jin Jin.

282
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.695
I'll be home a bit after 8pm.

283
00:18:48.866 --> 00:18:50.195
Let's eat dinner together.

284
00:18:50.735 --> 00:18:53.665
Ah Reum's flying to Guam today.

285
00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:55.836
Young Shim's working on a case.

286
00:18:55.836 --> 00:18:57.006
Just us two.

287
00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:03.076
- Okay. - Okay?

288
00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:17.725
I received your recommendation list.

289
00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:20.895
See anyone you like?

290
00:19:22.465 --> 00:19:25.606
In terms of appraising stock value, in my opinion,

291
00:19:25.606 --> 00:19:27.306
CEO Kim Sung Hoon is the best,

292
00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:29.235
although he cares more about money and fame...

293
00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:31.006
rather than company loyalty.

294
00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:35.846
So, working together for the long term will be a problem.

295
00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:41.316
Yes, that is correct. We haven't got the solution yet.

296
00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.756
Every question comes with an answer.

297
00:19:44.286 --> 00:19:45.485
Beg your pardon?

298
00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.556
I found the answer to your question,

299
00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:49.596
but you're holding it with your very own hands.

300
00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:52.895
What do you mean by that?

301
00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:57.266
Mr. Gong, why don't you take charge of National Chemicals?

302
00:20:09.816 --> 00:20:11.316
- Hello. - Hi.

303
00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:13.616
You're visiting your mom in hospital?

304
00:20:14.385 --> 00:20:16.885
Yes, so would you mind if...

305
00:20:17.485 --> 00:20:21.496
I met you at the radio station right before you go on air?

306
00:20:21.496 --> 00:20:24.665
The caretaker said she really has to rush home for a bit.

307
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.496
Please?

308
00:20:26.965 --> 00:20:29.266
- What if I don't? - I lose my job.

309
00:20:30.536 --> 00:20:32.366
Later on,

310
00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.536
wear this.

311
00:20:35.576 --> 00:20:37.606
Why must I dress up to be on radio?

312
00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:40.375
- There's a live camera. - Oh.

313
00:20:43.975 --> 00:20:45.286
Just a shirt?

314
00:20:47.885 --> 00:20:50.185
You're acting like a celebrity now.

315
00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:51.685
Are you complaining about clothes?

316
00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:53.856
What do you want to wear now?

317
00:20:53.856 --> 00:20:55.996
- Is there a specific brand? - No.

318
00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.596
See you later.

319
00:20:57.596 --> 00:20:59.366
What do you want to wear?

320
00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:04.705
We love you.

321
00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:13.346
She's so pretty.

322
00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:20.816
This is great.

323
00:21:21.286 --> 00:21:23.685
(Be mine)

324
00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:28.996
Are you ready?

325
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.296
1, 2, 3.

326
00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:43.905
Hello.

327
00:21:51.246 --> 00:21:53.385
- Thank you. - You're so pretty.

328
00:21:53.385 --> 00:21:55.685
- What's your name? - Kim Hye Ran.

329
00:21:55.685 --> 00:21:58.125
- Hye Ran? - So, my mom...

330
00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:01.326
had a thyroid problem, but she watched your drama...

331
00:22:01.326 --> 00:22:04.056
and laughed a lot. Now, she's cured.

332
00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.965
Is she? That's great.

333
00:22:05.965 --> 00:22:08.836
This isn't much. It's mandarin juice.

334
00:22:08.836 --> 00:22:12.235
Made with this year's first harvest from my dad's orchard.

335
00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:14.475
Thank you.

336
00:22:14.475 --> 00:22:18.205
I took an early morning flight from Jeju Island to bring you this.

337
00:22:18.746 --> 00:22:20.675
Thanks so much. I'll enjoy it.

338
00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:22.715
You have to drink it.

339
00:22:22.715 --> 00:22:24.215
Yes, I will.

340
00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:25.485
Thank you.

341
00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:27.185
Take care.

342
00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:30.056
It was so great to meet you.

343
00:22:32.925 --> 00:22:35.556
Jin Jin. Nice to meet you.

344
00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:37.425
This is for you.

345
00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.465
- What's your name? - Kim Eun Hye.

346
00:22:39.596 --> 00:22:40.895
- Eun Hye? - Yes.

347
00:22:41.195 --> 00:22:43.965
Jin Jin, you're so beautiful.

348
00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:45.366
Thank you.

349
00:22:46.506 --> 00:22:48.175
She looked suspicious.

350
00:22:50.276 --> 00:22:52.846
She did not. You're overreacting.

351
00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:56.576
I told you last time that I'm a great judge of character.

352
00:22:56.645 --> 00:23:01.185
Everyone else told me not to work with a witch like you,

353
00:23:01.185 --> 00:23:04.425
but I knew right away that you were easy-going.

354
00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:06.925
Are you being nice or mean?

355
00:23:06.925 --> 00:23:08.395
- She's being nice. - Yes.

356
00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:10.395
You're that unpredictable.

357
00:23:10.395 --> 00:23:13.125
Listening to me won't hurt.

358
00:23:14.465 --> 00:23:16.836
Don't drink this.

359
00:23:16.836 --> 00:23:19.566
She said her dad made the juice.

360
00:23:19.566 --> 00:23:21.576
She took the first flight from Jeju Island.

361
00:23:21.576 --> 00:23:23.135
I'll drink it if you'll let me.

362
00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:25.806
No.

363
00:23:25.806 --> 00:23:27.945
It looked good. I wanted some all along.

364
00:23:29.546 --> 00:23:30.915
That looks good.

365
00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:43.056
Great job today. Bye.

366
00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:45.695
- Rest well, Jin Jin. - Goodbye.

367
00:23:58.576 --> 00:24:01.276
What do you want for dinner? I'll cook.

368
00:24:02.046 --> 00:24:04.286
Kimchi fried rice? Fried rice with eggs?

369
00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:05.786
Curry? Instant noodles?

370
00:24:11.526 --> 00:24:13.586
Hey, I'm here. Which floor is it?

371
00:24:13.586 --> 00:24:14.725
The third floor.

372
00:24:15.225 --> 00:24:17.695
- Never mind, I'll be there. - Forget it.

373
00:24:17.695 --> 00:24:20.665
- I'll be there soon. - Something doesn't feel right.

374
00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:22.866
Do you remember...

375
00:24:22.866 --> 00:24:25.735
that one stalker who hid under your bed?

376
00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:28.006
I saw someone who looked like her in the parking lot.

377
00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:35.016
You don't know her face, do you?

378
00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:37.945
Hey, if anyone tries to talk to you,

379
00:24:37.945 --> 00:24:40.086
run as fast as you can.

380
00:24:40.086 --> 00:24:42.485
Don't worry about it. Did you say it was third floor?

381
00:24:42.485 --> 00:24:43.616
I'll be there soon.

382
00:24:44.286 --> 00:24:45.856
Anthony.

383
00:24:45.856 --> 00:24:49.425
I'm a fan of yours. Can I get a picture with you?

384
00:24:51.695 --> 00:24:52.826
Sure.

385
00:24:52.826 --> 00:24:54.266
Let's take it.

386
00:25:01.675 --> 00:25:02.836
I'll do it.

387
00:25:08.475 --> 00:25:11.786
Sa Jin Jin's death day? Then will that brat die today?

388
00:25:15.955 --> 00:25:18.556
(Sikhye)

389
00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:25.996
Just drink it.

390
00:25:44.546 --> 00:25:47.246
- It's fine. - Really?

391
00:25:47.616 --> 00:25:48.756
Give it to me.

392
00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:55.256
Gosh, this tastes like nature.

393
00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:17.116
(Gong Ji Won)

394
00:26:37.905 --> 00:26:40.705
I'm sorry. He just said he was at the parking lot.

395
00:26:40.705 --> 00:26:43.205
He'll be here soon. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

396
00:26:49.616 --> 00:26:52.415
Your call cannot be connected.

397
00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:53.546
(Gong Ji Won)

398
00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:06.796
Goodness. Young lady.

399
00:27:06.796 --> 00:27:09.066
Young lady... Hey, Jin Jin!

400
00:27:09.066 --> 00:27:10.866
Jin Jin, what's going on?

401
00:27:10.866 --> 00:27:13.506
Is anyone there?

402
00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:16.375
My goodness, wake up.

403
00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:17.846
Jin Jin!

404
00:27:22.175 --> 00:27:25.945
Mr. Gong, why don't you take charge of National Chemicals?

405
00:27:29.616 --> 00:27:30.786
Ji Won.

406
00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:35.096
Ji Won.

407
00:27:35.996 --> 00:27:38.625
- Yes? - What's on your mind?

408
00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:41.336
Why? What's going on?

409
00:27:41.336 --> 00:27:43.665
- I think that's your case. - What?

410
00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:46.006
Your phone.

411
00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:53.106
(Missed calls: Sa Jin Jin)

412
00:28:39.526 --> 00:28:43.056
(Myeongjin Hospital)

413
00:28:45.796 --> 00:28:48.496
Sa Jin Jin. Where's Jin Jin?

414
00:28:49.935 --> 00:28:51.135
I'm her guardian.

415
00:28:52.935 --> 00:28:54.705
She's over there.

416
00:28:55.006 --> 00:28:56.735
(Visitors restricted in the emergency room)

417
00:29:04.715 --> 00:29:06.185
Excuse me, is Sa Jin Jin...

418
00:29:06.185 --> 00:29:09.016
- Is Sa Jin Jin's guardian here? - She's here.

419
00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:25.205
Are you Ms. Sa's guardian?

420
00:29:27.006 --> 00:29:28.036
Yes.

421
00:30:17.086 --> 00:30:19.385
(Children of 20th Century/20th Century Boy & Girl)

422
00:30:19.385 --> 00:30:22.695
Ji Won. How could you never visit me while I'm sick?

423
00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:25.026
I had to move my stuff, and I was busy with work.

424
00:30:25.026 --> 00:30:27.395
I've been so out of it, so I couldn't visit you there.

425
00:30:27.395 --> 00:30:29.096
I'm Jin Jin's guardian.

426
00:30:29.096 --> 00:30:31.266
Didn't you care that you had work to come to?

427
00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.366
You like Jin Jin, don't you?

428
00:30:32.366 --> 00:30:35.475
Are you going to give up if your brother likes her too?

429
00:30:35.475 --> 00:30:38.205
If I'm considerate towards her, she might feel awkward.

430
00:30:38.205 --> 00:30:40.705
What are you doing? I told you to stay there.

431
00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:42.746
I was going to be there, so you should've waited.

432
00:30:42.746 --> 00:30:45.385
Why won't you listen to me? Why?
