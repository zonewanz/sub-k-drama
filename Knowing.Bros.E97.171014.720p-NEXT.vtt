2
00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:13.000
(After the long holiday weekend
has passed)

3
00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:15.781
(We're back to our busy daily life)

4
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.257
(The brothers here are also busy)

5
00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.617
Jang-hoon landed a big show!

6
00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:26.421
Something like, "Standing on the shoulders
of giants."

7
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.171
- Yeah, about the humanities!

8
00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:31.046
You hate it when we call you "a giant"
but it's totally fine elsewhere?

9
00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:32.695
You've succumbed to capitalism!

10
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.796
It's a known phrase, "On the shoulders
of giants."

11
00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:36.444
I heard Newton said it.

12
00:00:36.484 --> 00:00:38.976
Who doesn't know Newton these days?

13
00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:40.913
Kyung-hoon, tell him!

14
00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:42.890
Newton's that one guy...

15
00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:45.702
An apple dropped and...

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.370
The law of universal gravitation!

17
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.255
Good job, Kyung-hoon!

18
00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.567
It doesn't quite deserve
an applause, really.

19
00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.730
But his explanation was odd,
"An apple dropped..."

20
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.239
"The law of gravitation!"

21
00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:59.060
(That's how he does it!)

22
00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:04.349
Humanities or not, I brought something
that's really hard to solve.

23
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:07.071
I found it on the Internet.

24
00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:09.224
What's this?

25
00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:10.622
- Tyson!
- Tyson!

26
00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:12.599
Everyone know Tyson the Boxer, right?

27
00:01:12.624 --> 00:01:14.224
Then it's Kang Ho-dong.

28
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.771
He's our captain here.

29
00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:17.364
And Brock Lesnar!

30
00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:18.505
He's an MMA fighter.

31
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.365
What is the commonality between
these three?

32
00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:25.435
It's them 3 in the picture, but the middle
one looks just as scary as the other 2!

33
00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.153
(The powerful center-figure)

34
00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:30.411
I'm just as tough!

35
00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.021
He looks even stronger.

36
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.442
4 letters?

37
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.458
Does it end with "um"?

38
00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:39.137
"Being manly"?

39
00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:40.935
No. It should end with "bom."

40
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.685
"Might see blood"!

41
00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.911
Tyson bit someone's ear off
and drew blood.

42
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.169
And you had a nosebleed once.

43
00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:49.810
None of them's got a neck!

44
00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:52.388
Look, none of them have necks!

45
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.638
That is true, too.

46
00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:54.771
No double eyelids.

47
00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:56.864
"Capturing the hearts of women"!

48
00:01:57.858 --> 00:01:59.341
What?

49
00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.958
A lot of people like this style of guys.

50
00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:04.544
It's the funniest thing you said
in recent days!

51
00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.966
He came into the waiting room, acting
so arrogant.

52
00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:09.638
I was just sitting there.

53
00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:13.232
Then he said, "Look over there, my
fans came to visit me."

54
00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:16.005
"Nakrang Princesses" are here,
my fan club.

55
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.896
I just said, "Oh, really," and that's
all I said.

56
00:02:18.943 --> 00:02:23.935
And they came into the waiting room,
and oh my, they were so elegant!

57
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:27.403
Wearing dark sunglasses...

58
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.450
They also brought flower bouquets.

59
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.083
Most fans would give us flowers
like this, being shy.

60
00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:35.544
But his fans brought a huge bouquet,
"Hello Ho-dong, how've you been?"

61
00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:37.575
How old were they?

62
00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.349
They were older than me.

63
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.817
They were just so elegant in how they
carried themselves.

64
00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:46.349
That's why he says things like, "Capturing
the women's hearts."

65
00:02:46.404 --> 00:02:49.005
None of the 3 have double eyelids.

66
00:02:49.154 --> 00:02:53.583
That's the youngest picture of Tyson
I've ever seen.

67
00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.357
He looks young.

68
00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:59.044
When's that picture from? When
you were in high school?

69
00:02:59.084 --> 00:03:00.864
High school?

70
00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:03.708
I was in 3rd grade in middle school.

71
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.739
Really?

72
00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:06.817
Are they pictures from when
they were in middle school?

73
00:03:06.842 --> 00:03:08.509
Middle school graduation?

74
00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:11.052
It's a question about Ho-dong, so
let Ho-dong answer it.

75
00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.825
All 3 were taken when we were
16 years old.

76
00:03:14.084 --> 00:03:15.536
That's correct!

77
00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.138
I was 16 then!

78
00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.403
That's Tyson when he was 16?

79
00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:23.208
(They had gone through some rough years
by the time they turned 16)

80
00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:25.605
I can understand Ho-dong's face,
but the others...

81
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.950
How can you say understand that
about that face?

82
00:03:26.975 --> 00:03:28.044
Tyson's picture looks like it was
taken last year.

83
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:31.185
Imagine we knew each other but didn't
get along when we were 16.

84
00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.177
What if we fought, stuck in
a small room?

85
00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.239
With only one survivor left!

86
00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:38.639
If Ho-dong didn't come a wrestler, we'd
think it's a mobster's mug shot.

87
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.942
A wanted poster for
a crime organization's boss.

88
00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:42.919
I was a teenager, still in middle school!

89
00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:45.700
I was a sensitive kid who liked the ballad
"To J" by Lee Sun-hee.

90
00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.520
(Ho-dong's girly sensibility
when he was 16)

91
00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:51.934
He definitely looked a lot older
than his age then.

92
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.620
That's true.

93
00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:56.410
I'd go to a noodle place
with my friends.

94
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.551
We'd talk among ourselves, "What do you
want to eat?"

95
00:03:58.576 --> 00:04:02.449
And an adult yelled at my friends for
talking to me like we were the same age.

96
00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:04.527
It's for real!

97
00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:06.340
This really happened, a purely true story!

98
00:04:06.372 --> 00:04:07.910
(A face calling for respect)

99
00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.676
But people who look older when they're
young keep that same face.

100
00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:13.207
So later on, they actually look
younger than their age.

101
00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:14.980
That must be true.

102
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.449
You know Ko Chang-seok,
the actor?

103
00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:17.855
You guys are the same age?

104
00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:20.465
And Lee Bong-ju, the marathoner?

105
00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:23.980
Compare our faces together, and I
definitely look the youngest!

106
00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.449
- You were born in '74?
- Same as Leonardo DiCaprio.

107
00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:29.402
- You too, right?
- DiCaprio looks a lot older now.

108
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.473
You should look him up.

109
00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:33.676
On top of that, for me...

110
00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:36.840
Oh wait, who do you think looks
younger? Jang-hoon or me? Honestly.

111
00:04:36.848 --> 00:04:38.215
I look younger.

112
00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:41.137
Both are very difficult faces.

113
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.916
(The new kids to this school,
TVXQ comes in!)

114
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.416
They're the ones who really look young!

115
00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:53.728
You guys should've came in earlier!

116
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.470
The amazing young faces!

117
00:04:55.784 --> 00:04:58.205
What were we saying all this time?

118
00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:00.556
It makes you look so funny.

119
00:05:00.612 --> 00:05:04.228
What's the point of our fighting over
who looks younger, in front of them!

120
00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:07.565
(Being handsome is the completion
of looking young!)

121
00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:09.862
Hey guys, you've been well?

122
00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:14.221
We're making a comeback after
serving for the country for 2 years.

123
00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:16.674
From "King of K-Pop" school...

124
00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:19.963
Hello! We're TVXQ!

125
00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:22.244
(The return of the legend, TVXQ!)

126
00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:24.877
No need to speak using honorific!

127
00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.682
We're all friends of same age here.

128
00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:29.604
That was just to greet you guys, we'll
speak more comfortably now.

129
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:33.963
You two look the same as before
you left to serve in the military.

130
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.588
"You came back looking more
mature and manly" doesn't apply to you.

131
00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.994
I'm especially moved to see Changmin
since we used to be in the same show

132
00:05:41.018 --> 00:05:42.471
together before.

133
00:05:42.503 --> 00:05:44.869
Since you mentioned it, I was so curious...

134
00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:48.643
How did you ruin the show, "Our
Neighborhood Arts and Physical Education"?

135
00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:51.127
I don't think it was my fault
it got ruined.

136
00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:54.268
We left to serve in the military together,
but Changmin came back to find that

137
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.737
he had nowhere to return!

138
00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:56.893
The show finished, yes.

139
00:05:56.948 --> 00:06:00.994
The show went away because
Changmin cried so much in it.

140
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.338
(Ho-dong remembered something)

141
00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.244
He'd throw a bowling ball
then cry.

142
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.901
Also after the ping pong
episode, too.

143
00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:08.769
I can't forget Changmin's tears.

144
00:06:08.793 --> 00:06:10.885
He was on the show with such
a pure heart.

145
00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:13.744
- He worked really hard.
- There was an important match in Daejeon.

146
00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:17.885
He cried so much, we couldn't even air it.
His tears were just pouring out!

147
00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:21.737
Tears were just overflowing
out of his eyes.

148
00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:23.588
- It's because...
- That was in Daejeon.

149
00:06:23.604 --> 00:06:26.471
It's because Changmin was blaming
himself for losing the match.

150
00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:28.065
He felt really bad.

151
00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:30.510
You guys lost because of him?

152
00:06:30.604 --> 00:06:32.018
Yeah, because of him.

153
00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:33.049
I can say it now.

154
00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:34.416
It must've been Changmin's fault.

155
00:06:34.463 --> 00:06:37.166
What got me even more upset then was...

156
00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.940
I did cry because I caused the team
to lose, but

157
00:06:39.956 --> 00:06:42.971
Ho-dong was upset that his team
lost because of me.

158
00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:45.041
(No!)

159
00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:49.807
(A shocking behind-the-scene
story, revealed 4 years after)

160
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.299
It did feel like, "You should've
done it better!"

161
00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:53.721
Stop it!

162
00:06:53.893 --> 00:06:55.526
I can't believe you, Ho-dong.

163
00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:57.619
It's important what you say here.

164
00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.291
You should say, "Ho-dong wouldn't
do something like that."

165
00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.322
(Looking away)

166
00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.494
When we played the 99-seconds game,

167
00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:06.455
he'd get so mad if we lose.

168
00:07:06.487 --> 00:07:09.690
Ho-dong called Jang-hoon over to his
waiting room and slapped him.

169
00:07:09.737 --> 00:07:10.932
Really?

170
00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:12.283
He slapped him!

171
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:13.588
It's similar.

172
00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:17.674
Can't you see that the left side of
my face is different from my right?

173
00:07:19.048 --> 00:07:20.877
(Finally, we know why Jang-hoon's
face looks different)

174
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:23.049
I had a similar worry today.

175
00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:26.971
Ho-dong, how many times do I have to
shake it off today?

176
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.697
- You?
- How many cracks?

177
00:07:28.737 --> 00:07:30.440
For a dance?

178
00:07:30.465 --> 00:07:32.283
- Why? Why?
- Crack what?

179
00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:34.190
You need to crack it at least 108 times.

180
00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:37.744
I say this because I usually prepare
a dance for shows like this.

181
00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:40.599
I do these cool dances
in various styles.

182
00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:43.205
And Ho-dong would stand and watch me.

183
00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:45.572
Then he'd say, "Stop it, don't do that!"

184
00:07:45.597 --> 00:07:49.088
Then he'd say, "Do the cracking one,"
meaning popping dance.

185
00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:51.580
(My throat is burning)

186
00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:54.299
I did that and came back after
a couple of years.

187
00:07:54.315 --> 00:07:56.291
And I did a new, cool dance.

188
00:07:56.316 --> 00:07:57.799
He then came up to me
and whispered in my ear,

189
00:07:57.846 --> 00:07:59.932
"Yunho, not that one."

190
00:07:59.948 --> 00:08:01.548
"Just crack it!"

191
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:03.658
He kept asking me to do that!

192
00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:06.440
It seems like popping is all I've been
doing for the past 14 years!

193
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.682
(Ho-dong only knows popping dance)

194
00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:10.663
OK, one last time today then.

195
00:08:12.557 --> 00:08:13.971
"The last goodbye to popping."

196
00:08:14.018 --> 00:08:15.330
He won't stop!

197
00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:20.119
I gotta say, he's the one I'm the most
thankful for to be on shows like this.

198
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.377
Oh, you don't have to say that.

199
00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:25.768
I did say it first at an interview
that I wanted to be on this show.

200
00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:28.869
The show we'd like to go on is
the hottest show these days,

201
00:08:28.893 --> 00:08:30.666
"Ask Us Anything Brothers."

202
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.987
People think TVXQ is so upright.

203
00:08:34.977 --> 00:08:37.213
We want to break out of that image.

204
00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:39.476
It's weird to say that ourselves.

205
00:08:39.776 --> 00:08:41.096
Sorry about that.

206
00:08:41.464 --> 00:08:45.018
This show's really popular
in the military.

207
00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:46.893
Every soldier watches it,
every week.

208
00:08:46.956 --> 00:08:48.424
So many people watch it.

209
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.783
I asked everyone why they like
it so much.

210
00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:54.932
They first mentioned Ho-dong
as the reason.

211
00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:56.682
I asked, "What about Ho-dong?"

212
00:08:56.706 --> 00:08:59.385
They said, "He's not funny at all."

213
00:08:59.871 --> 00:09:01.346
(How dare they...)

214
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.510
(Damage given twice as much)

215
00:09:04.432 --> 00:09:06.182
(Angrier as he thinks about it)

216
00:09:08.991 --> 00:09:11.127
They like the fact that others
get to make fun of him.

217
00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:13.143
I thought you were talking about me.

218
00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:16.362
I asked them, "What's funny about
the show then?"

219
00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:19.612
They like Soo-geun and Jang-hoon
these days.

220
00:09:19.682 --> 00:09:22.299
The soldiers of Republic of Korea!

221
00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:24.596
(We love you, patriots!)

222
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.315
More than that, Ho-dong's getting
softer and more gentle.

223
00:09:28.346 --> 00:09:30.721
He seems to be more considerate.

224
00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:34.502
Is this your first variety show after
being discharged?

225
00:09:35.018 --> 00:09:36.744
It's our third.

226
00:09:36.784 --> 00:09:37.588
You did something else?

227
00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:39.416
- The first one...
- This isn't the first one?

228
00:09:39.432 --> 00:09:41.682
It was Jae-suk's show.

229
00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:44.172
(A robotic response, "Good job")

230
00:09:44.206 --> 00:09:46.463
Why, because you like Jae-suk more
than Ho-dong?

231
00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:48.150
(Nods)

232
00:09:48.182 --> 00:09:49.588
Changmin answered!

233
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:52.604
Changmin pick, Yoo Jae-suk or
Kang Ho-dong?

234
00:09:53.432 --> 00:09:54.471
Yoo Jae-suk.

235
00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:56.283
(With Ho-dong sitting right
in front of him)

236
00:09:56.308 --> 00:09:59.237
It's because Ho-dong got so mad at you
for losing the bowling match.

237
00:09:59.284 --> 00:10:05.072
I saw it too, I saw Ho-dong hitting
Soo-geun because he was so mad.

238
00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:08.493
Fine, you guys say whatever you want!

239
00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:10.588
(He kindly re-enacts it)

240
00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:14.049
You're saying he hit him like that?

241
00:10:14.607 --> 00:10:16.207
It looks so realistic!

242
00:10:16.852 --> 00:10:18.463
Your words sound so trustworthy!

243
00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:21.330
I went on that show with Ho-dong and
I couldn't say a word

244
00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:23.018
because I was so scared.

245
00:10:23.043 --> 00:10:25.651
So I was thinking, "I should at least
do well in bowling and win."

246
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:28.721
(Changmin felt a lot of pressure
since he was the last bowler)

247
00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:32.557
(He carefully throws the bowling ball)

248
00:10:33.054 --> 00:10:34.705
(Expecting a good result)

249
00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:37.307
(Will he?)

250
00:10:39.194 --> 00:10:41.112
(Failed to score)

251
00:10:41.487 --> 00:10:43.554
(And a sad defeat for the team)

252
00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:47.526
I felt so bad because the team
lost because of me.

253
00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:50.658
Then I saw Ho-dong so mad,
"We should've won..."

254
00:10:50.698 --> 00:10:51.987
He kept saying that.

255
00:10:52.034 --> 00:10:55.674
I was already upset at the loss,
but Ho-dong got me even more upset.

256
00:10:56.778 --> 00:10:58.378
Me?

257
00:10:58.495 --> 00:11:00.276
I was upset at you?

258
00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:05.533
("Looking back sadly
at the fading memory..."

259
00:11:06.607 --> 00:11:08.737
(He was a good captain,
and we said goodbye to him)

260
00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:10.830
How global.

261
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.018
When you were crying, who wiped away
your tears for you?

262
00:11:14.043 --> 00:11:15.520
Probably his stylist.

263
00:11:15.557 --> 00:11:19.322
That's when I felt that you were
all about business, so cold.

264
00:11:19.393 --> 00:11:21.322
Because of the cameras!

265
00:11:21.354 --> 00:11:25.440
He'd yell, "You shouldn't cry over
stuff like this," behind the camera.

266
00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:28.815
But in front of the camera, "Don't cry..."

267
00:11:28.932 --> 00:11:30.532
(Ho-dong's two face)

268
00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:32.791
You're really in trouble though, Ho-dong.

269
00:11:32.831 --> 00:11:36.088
Changmin and I are different, people don't
believe me no matter what I say,

270
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.354
like a boy who cried wolf.

271
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:40.229
But people believe what Changmin says!

272
00:11:40.268 --> 00:11:42.776
I really hope you get super successful.

273
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.932
If you're gonna make me into such
a mean person... You should at least

274
00:11:44.957 --> 00:11:46.643
at least make it big using me.

275
00:11:48.854 --> 00:11:51.190
For all this time I've been in this show,

276
00:11:51.237 --> 00:11:54.690
the TVXQ guys are the first ones
that came that I actually know personally.

277
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.040
You guys are friends?

278
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.533
We played soccer before.

279
00:11:58.565 --> 00:12:01.408
We'd play soccer together, and I didn't
know this before, but we went to

280
00:12:01.433 --> 00:12:03.393
to the same school together.

281
00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:06.291
- High school?
- They went to same college.

282
00:12:06.354 --> 00:12:09.533
You guys went to the same school but
you've never met before?

283
00:12:09.635 --> 00:12:11.940
I'm not so certain, but...

284
00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:16.119
I heard that Kyung-hoon was just
busy dating his girlfriend then.

285
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.307
He was never out?

286
00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:21.471
Kyung-hoon, you should be glad
that you weren't close to Changmin.

287
00:12:21.784 --> 00:12:24.901
Kyung-hoon won't go to classes
but just hang out with his girlfriend!

288
00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:27.346
I'm glad you don't have anything to
say about my past.

289
00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:29.627
What are you, here to blow up
some missiles?

290
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:31.182
You keep bombing us!

291
00:12:31.214 --> 00:12:34.721
The part about me will be forgotten
since this one's more shocking.

292
00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:39.049
A couple more ones like this one,
and it'll completely be forgotten.

293
00:12:39.268 --> 00:12:40.838
Kyung-hoon's sweating.

294
00:12:41.703 --> 00:12:43.565
Did you break up with her?
Or did she?

295
00:12:43.612 --> 00:12:45.760
Is this how you guys are gonna be?

296
00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:49.572
This is all because of you!

297
00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:54.213
He doesn't even know who my girlfriend was!

298
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:55.338
Liar!

299
00:12:55.393 --> 00:12:56.916
Who broke up with whom?

300
00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:59.822
- Who dumped whom?
- It was too long ago, I can't remember.

301
00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:01.815
Then... How about you?

302
00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:07.612
(What a terrible son!)

303
00:13:07.682 --> 00:13:09.494
What kind of a question is that?

304
00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:11.151
It's a different situation!

305
00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:13.447
That was a terrible question.

306
00:13:13.635 --> 00:13:15.369
How you compare my situation
with yours?

307
00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:18.057
Let's not ask questions like that.

308
00:13:19.072 --> 00:13:20.877
(Respect!)

309
00:13:20.964 --> 00:13:22.764
It's a different situation!

310
00:13:23.225 --> 00:13:25.729
It's a little similar,
same context.

311
00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:27.080
(Take courage, Jang-hoon)

312
00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:29.682
One more big laugh, and everyone's
gonna forget what he said about Ho-dong.

313
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:31.174
It's already forgotten!

314
00:13:31.198 --> 00:13:32.979
I already apologized.

315
00:13:34.162 --> 00:13:36.330
I get teary-eyed when I see you
guys though.

316
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.970
All of a sudden?

317
00:13:38.214 --> 00:13:39.979
That was so random.

318
00:13:40.073 --> 00:13:41.673
(Heart-broken)

319
00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:44.705
We shot "Let's Eat Dinner
Together" yesterday.

320
00:13:44.721 --> 00:13:48.151
Kids in elementary school
didn't know who they were.

321
00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:51.024
They were in Japan a lot, that's why.

322
00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:55.252
I think TVXQ needs to go back
to how they first felt before.

323
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:57.424
U-Know Yunho.

324
00:13:57.564 --> 00:13:58.971
Dance, start!

325
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.752
- Crack it!
- Right now? All of a sudden?

326
00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:03.174
Think about how you felt
when you were new!

327
00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:05.369
(TVXQ's dance dedicated to all the kids
in elementary school)

328
00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:06.885
A sudden dance.

329
00:14:07.549 --> 00:14:10.197
(Yunho's "Drop" stage)

330
00:14:10.557 --> 00:14:12.401
Consider yourself a new singer!

331
00:14:12.846 --> 00:14:15.127
(Sharp angles)

332
00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:17.025
Crack'em!

333
00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:23.557
(A 14-year-veteran in popping dance
and how he uses his joints)

334
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.346
(Explosion of charisma on stage)

335
00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:32.291
(The return of the king of dance)

336
00:14:35.002 --> 00:14:36.669
Your pants didn't get ripped?

337
00:14:38.974 --> 00:14:40.416
That happened before?

338
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.040
Yes, with red underwear!

339
00:14:42.175 --> 00:14:43.651
(His pants got ripped recently
from dancing)

340
00:14:43.698 --> 00:14:44.877
It split wide open!

341
00:14:44.902 --> 00:14:47.675
Actually, it was with this same song.

342
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.260
You OK? I think this one's
a little ripped too.

343
00:14:49.284 --> 00:14:50.588
Hm? No it's OK.

344
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.822
That's pretty cool, actually.

345
00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:55.862
Yunho's determined to work hard
like a new singer.

346
00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:57.525
But Yunho...

347
00:14:57.971 --> 00:15:00.955
It's not the dance you used to do
when you had debuted 14 years ago.

348
00:15:01.017 --> 00:15:04.884
- That's true...
- I remember it having bigger movements.

349
00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:07.109
Popping was amazing for that one.

350
00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.588
Music, please.

351
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.924
So this is what he does.

352
00:15:09.956 --> 00:15:12.174
Going back to the early days!

353
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.570
(A sudden change)

354
00:15:14.823 --> 00:15:17.807
It's like watching the old show,
"X-Man" again!

355
00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.385
(He revs up with a song from that era)

356
00:15:21.675 --> 00:15:23.760
(Here's dance magic!)

357
00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:29.494
(X-Man-style reaction)

358
00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:33.588
(Rewriting history
in Korea's dance field)

359
00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:36.065
(U-Know Yunho!)

360
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.408
(TVXQ family is off the hook!)

361
00:15:43.456 --> 00:15:44.979
That was so awesome!

362
00:15:44.995 --> 00:15:47.268
But it makes me a little upset.

363
00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:50.955
After ripping his pants that one time,
he's not moving his legs much.

364
00:15:51.935 --> 00:15:53.791
This is how he used to dance.

365
00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:56.158
Now it's all up on top.

366
00:15:56.675 --> 00:16:01.041
When that happened, his pants ripped
as soon as the song started.

367
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.283
- And he kept going!
- With that fierce red!

368
00:16:04.307 --> 00:16:07.002
He matched the official color
of the fan club, Cassiopeia.

369
00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:09.338
"Cassiopeia, here I am!"

370
00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:12.502
"Look at my pearl red!"

371
00:16:13.021 --> 00:16:17.205
For us, we're gonna wear pearl sapphire
blue underwear for Super Junior's comeback.

372
00:16:17.229 --> 00:16:18.572
And rip our pants.

373
00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:21.143
But how come Changmin doesn't dance?

374
00:16:21.175 --> 00:16:23.518
We're saving him for later.

375
00:16:23.878 --> 00:16:25.854
He's doing a girl-group dance later.

376
00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:27.509
(Just decided)

377
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.502
(We'll look forward to it)

378
00:16:29.643 --> 00:16:31.955
Red Velvet's Red Flavor.

379
00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:34.463
I heard you made this dance move.

380
00:16:34.715 --> 00:16:37.815
(Max Changmin's red flavor
is up next!)

381
00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:41.479
(The king of performance!)

382
00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:43.885
Wait a minute.

383
00:16:43.979 --> 00:16:46.572
Changmin is known as TVXQ's
Seo Jang-hoon?

384
00:16:48.432 --> 00:16:50.635
I really like Jang-hoon.

385
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:56.924
It's difficult to find an athlete who comes
off that intellectual, too.

386
00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.283
You mentioned being an intellectual
athlete, and look at Ho-dong.

387
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:08.440
But I did hear many rumors that women
think Jang-hoon is really sexy.

388
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.737
Cassiopeia!

389
00:17:12.807 --> 00:17:14.407
TVXQ!

390
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:17.971
Show them your Cassiopeia belt.

391
00:17:18.026 --> 00:17:19.971
I'll change into pearl red later.

392
00:17:20.003 --> 00:17:20.940
Quite amazing today.

393
00:17:20.987 --> 00:17:24.096
Everyone's feeling pretty good now,
let's read what you brought.

394
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.720
Yes, bring it out.

395
00:17:27.362 --> 00:17:28.393
Yunho.

396
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.299
You gotta walk with the heart
of a new singer.

397
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:31.931
Don't walk like that.

398
00:17:31.956 --> 00:17:33.612
He really hasn't aged at all.

399
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.213
We're going back to 14 years ago.

400
00:17:40.557 --> 00:17:43.049
(A first transfer student to turn in
his paper with a moon walk!)

401
00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:45.795
(Soo-geun responds)

402
00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:47.823
(Sits with flashy footwork)

403
00:17:48.439 --> 00:17:50.088
(A man never looks back!)

404
00:17:51.442 --> 00:17:53.627
(Returns in a cool way to the end)

405
00:17:53.652 --> 00:17:57.619
I can't believe Yun-ho keeps doing this!
Not just a couple of times!

406
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.432
He's number one in the world to
see the end of something.

407
00:18:00.464 --> 00:18:04.822
But when Changmin made one mistake in
bowling, Ho-dong totally used it.

408
00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:07.307
You're not telling Changmin to do
anything at all.

409
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.846
Here's their transfer request.

410
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:13.455
Name! Oh, they put their real names.

411
00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:15.291
Jung Yun-ho.

412
00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:19.416
Changmin, as you know, is Shim Chang-min.

413
00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:21.522
(He gets water from Hee-chul)

414
00:18:21.987 --> 00:18:24.612
Turn around and don't show the bottle.

415
00:18:24.628 --> 00:18:28.127
We're going for their TV commercial spot,
not you.

416
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:31.455
They'll take it from us with this one shot!

417
00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:37.018
(Protect our water commercial opportunity!)

418
00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:39.354
We've been working on this for 6 months!

419
00:18:39.487 --> 00:18:41.682
(He really turns around and drinks it)

420
00:18:41.729 --> 00:18:43.346
Here are their nicknames.

421
00:18:43.401 --> 00:18:45.479
Yun-ho's got a lot of nicknames.

422
00:18:45.495 --> 00:18:47.010
Passion Mansour,

423
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.057
Passion Rich,

424
00:18:49.104 --> 00:18:50.791
Passion Gene.

425
00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:53.643
I'm that passionate about things,
I believe anything can be achieved

426
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.151
with passion.

427
00:18:56.878 --> 00:18:58.572
You know something? I say this often.

428
00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:02.932
Do you know the worst type of worm
you can have in yourself?

429
00:19:02.979 --> 00:19:05.244
- Parasites.
- Parasites, what else?

430
00:19:05.292 --> 00:19:06.151
Must be something else.

431
00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:07.737
(Changmin's not sure either)

432
00:19:07.768 --> 00:19:09.190
What's worst for yourself.

433
00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:11.057
An insect or a worm that's
bad for you?

434
00:19:11.104 --> 00:19:12.869
- Eating like a worm?
- Larva?

435
00:19:12.878 --> 00:19:14.315
That's not it.

436
00:19:14.331 --> 00:19:16.385
- Not larva?
- No.

437
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.893
The worst type of worm to yourself,
I'm sure you know.

438
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.604
It's do something half-way [pun for worm].

439
00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:26.213
(Enlightened)

440
00:19:27.794 --> 00:19:32.299
(The worst type of worm to a human body
is to do something half-way)

441
00:19:32.346 --> 00:19:35.369
That's true, you gotta finish something
well to the end.

442
00:19:35.417 --> 00:19:37.440
Changmin, you're not saying anything funny.

443
00:19:37.464 --> 00:19:40.580
Yun-ho lives his life to the fullest.

444
00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:44.869
I see him and think, "Does one really
have to live like that?"

445
00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:47.237
I guess you can say that I do things
half-way.

446
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.408
But it's a good balance between us.

447
00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:51.518
Good balance! [pun for worm]

448
00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:55.643
Balance is important.

449
00:19:55.721 --> 00:19:59.096
- Half-way and balance.
- They rhyme!

450
00:19:59.229 --> 00:20:05.127
But what's really cool about Yun-ho is that
he hasn't changed, he stayed the same.

451
00:20:05.152 --> 00:20:07.893
He came to visit other singers his junior
in their rehearsal studios.

452
00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:09.517
He came and...

453
00:20:10.487 --> 00:20:13.549
I'll show you why they call me "the King."

454
00:20:13.737 --> 00:20:15.158
No!

455
00:20:16.028 --> 00:20:17.572
I didn't say that! No!

456
00:20:17.628 --> 00:20:19.049
I never said I was the king!

457
00:20:19.112 --> 00:20:21.112
(Self-introduction on another level)

458
00:20:21.198 --> 00:20:24.041
I didn't call myself the king.

459
00:20:25.643 --> 00:20:27.580
I said, "the Monarch."

460
00:20:29.318 --> 00:20:31.065
(This fan of Asian action mangas
is amazed)

461
00:20:31.175 --> 00:20:33.205
I think "the king" sounds better
than "the monarch."

462
00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:35.200
Monarch is even weirder.

463
00:20:35.385 --> 00:20:38.127
It's because a lot of people call me that,
and I'm grateful.

464
00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:40.096
I do take pride in that nickname though.

465
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.190
It's a nickname of mine,
"the Monarch on Stage."

466
00:20:43.237 --> 00:20:46.416
If Yun-ho is the monarch on stage,
what are you, Changmin?

467
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.869
The guy next to the monarch.

468
00:20:49.346 --> 00:20:51.955
Do fans say, "Yun-ho, the Monarch!"

469
00:20:51.987 --> 00:20:54.088
Then, "The guy next to the monarch!"

470
00:20:54.112 --> 00:20:56.815
On the other hand, Changmin doesn't have
nicknames.

471
00:20:56.878 --> 00:20:59.940
They don't really call me by
different names.

472
00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:01.596
I don't call others either.

473
00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:02.838
I just stay quiet.

474
00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.416
How come you're so passive?

475
00:21:04.441 --> 00:21:07.299
He's lost all his strength after getting
yelled at by Ho-dong earlier.

476
00:21:07.315 --> 00:21:09.213
I developed a fear of people.

477
00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:13.135
That's just how Changmin is!

478
00:21:13.268 --> 00:21:15.807
He feels a little like Min Kyung-hoon.

479
00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:18.072
They are similar, a bit!

480
00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:22.666
Changmin is normally so bright,
laughs a lot and talkative.

481
00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:25.346
- But after Ho-dong yelled at him...
- He's had a traumatic experience.

482
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.860
He told me in the show back then,
"Maybe I should just quit and go

483
00:21:27.885 --> 00:21:29.485
to the army."

484
00:21:30.635 --> 00:21:32.119
Is that why you enlisted early?

485
00:21:32.143 --> 00:21:33.743
I did enlist early.

486
00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:35.783
Why don't we make a nickname for Changmin?

487
00:21:35.808 --> 00:21:37.596
It'll last a long time.

488
00:21:37.604 --> 00:21:38.635
I'd love it if you did!

489
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.393
What angle should we take?

490
00:21:40.479 --> 00:21:42.658
Your fans don't have a nickname for you?

491
00:21:42.744 --> 00:21:45.314
They say that my eyes look like
the eyes of a deer.

492
00:21:45.424 --> 00:21:47.377
They call me "Bambi."

493
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:51.174
It fits him. It's hard for a man
to fit that name.

494
00:21:51.784 --> 00:21:53.384
I love Jang-hoon.

495
00:21:54.135 --> 00:21:54.744
Thanks.

496
00:21:54.753 --> 00:21:56.353
(Came in too suddenly)

497
00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:57.737
A deer.

498
00:21:57.776 --> 00:21:59.440
We'll stick with that species?

499
00:21:59.464 --> 00:22:01.237
An elk!

500
00:22:01.425 --> 00:22:04.580
If an elk is too bland,
about three elks?

501
00:22:07.046 --> 00:22:10.643
"How can it already be three-go?"
[pun for elks]

502
00:22:10.668 --> 00:22:12.322
I like the elk.

503
00:22:12.385 --> 00:22:13.985
Max Elk.

504
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.752
I think some elks are considered
harmful.

505
00:22:18.768 --> 00:22:20.877
(Amazed at his level of knowledge)

506
00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:24.377
They're the biggest enemies
to the farmers.

507
00:22:24.425 --> 00:22:25.822
Wow, you're really smart!

508
00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:30.065
You're the one who responded in the most
positive way to Jang-hoon so far.

509
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.065
Oh, really?

510
00:22:31.104 --> 00:22:32.432
You seem to really love Jang-hoon.

511
00:22:32.448 --> 00:22:34.049
I really am a fan of his.

512
00:22:34.088 --> 00:22:37.737
Who's uglier, Seo Jang-hoon
or Kang Ho-dong?

513
00:22:38.128 --> 00:22:39.158
Kang Ho-dong.

514
00:22:39.183 --> 00:22:40.783
(Shocked)

515
00:22:42.075 --> 00:22:44.432
(He feels like he's got the entire world
at the moment)

516
00:22:44.464 --> 00:22:48.252
Today's such a great day,
it's our first day being a couple!

517
00:22:49.378 --> 00:22:52.283
I'm a fan of Max Changmin, starting
today!

518
00:22:53.118 --> 00:22:55.307
(I'd love it!)

519
00:22:55.447 --> 00:22:56.510
(Celebratory basketball action)

520
00:22:56.534 --> 00:22:58.674
I'm joining Cassiopeia.

521
00:22:58.971 --> 00:23:01.690
They have to do something
for this part of the program.

522
00:23:01.745 --> 00:23:04.033
It's their "strengths and weaknesses" time.

523
00:23:04.042 --> 00:23:05.862
First, we'll start with Yun-ho.

524
00:23:05.932 --> 00:23:08.362
"I'm so passionate that I don't stop
once I start something."

525
00:23:08.385 --> 00:23:09.299
Isn't this a strength?

526
00:23:09.331 --> 00:23:10.987
It's a weakness and a strength
at the same time.

527
00:23:11.003 --> 00:23:12.213
(How so?)

528
00:23:12.237 --> 00:23:15.830
When we'd run into singers our
junior by chance...

529
00:23:15.855 --> 00:23:18.496
Yun-ho would want to say good things
for them as someone who's been

530
00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:20.143
in the industry longer.

531
00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:24.229
But Yun-ho would get so passionate and
others wanted to go back home and rest.

532
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.135
And Yun-ho would keep talking
for 30 minutes to an hour!

533
00:23:26.151 --> 00:23:27.838
It starts to sound like nagging then.

534
00:23:27.876 --> 00:23:29.658
(A tragedy from wanting to help too much)

535
00:23:29.714 --> 00:23:33.065
That's true, I saw it once when we were
all eating together.

536
00:23:33.167 --> 00:23:39.924
We know not to go if Yun-ho, Choi Si-won,
and Choi Min-ho are there.

537
00:23:41.189 --> 00:23:42.487
They are pretty similar.

538
00:23:42.534 --> 00:23:45.315
Even Lee Soo-man wouldn't
go there.

539
00:23:45.354 --> 00:23:47.424
(Embarrassed)

540
00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:51.674
We're the three-most-passionate
in SM Entertainment.

541
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.416
Yun-ho would sit there and act fitting
to be the monarch.

542
00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:57.674
And he talks about being responsible
for the future of the Korean culture.

543
00:23:57.714 --> 00:24:01.697
Cho Si-won really acts like a CEO,
and talks about doing good stuff

544
00:24:01.752 --> 00:24:04.556
like UNICEF, over and over.

545
00:24:04.612 --> 00:24:07.533
Min-ho would listen to them and learn.

546
00:24:08.021 --> 00:24:09.916
He'll show much respect to them.

547
00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.221
Even Lee Soo-man won't go there.

548
00:24:12.253 --> 00:24:14.713
(The unending hell of continuous talk)

549
00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:16.596
Yun-ho's strength is...

550
00:24:17.884 --> 00:24:20.783
It's the funniest thing I've read today.

551
00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:24.158
Let me guess, I don't know
what he put down.

552
00:24:24.198 --> 00:24:27.940
But if Yon-ho brought something, I think
he thought about it for a long time

553
00:24:27.971 --> 00:24:29.627
and tested it first.

554
00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:33.018
He probably watched our show and monitored,
analyzing it completely.

555
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.354
He's not an ordinary person.

556
00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.893
But the result of his analysis...

557
00:24:37.995 --> 00:24:41.026
It feels as if he gave us Pepto-Bismol
for a headache.

558
00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:43.697
He said he's good in hacky sack
with both feet.

559
00:24:43.979 --> 00:24:46.065
But Soo-geun's the best at it!

560
00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:50.354
I did see some videos of Soo-geun playing
hacky sack.

561
00:24:50.362 --> 00:24:51.962
I heard he was good.

562
00:24:52.487 --> 00:24:54.002
But he was kinda whatever.

563
00:24:54.135 --> 00:24:55.776
Oh, thanks.

564
00:24:55.846 --> 00:24:57.572
He's just good in this pool of people.

565
00:24:57.612 --> 00:24:59.760
It's because I only try enough to win.

566
00:25:01.276 --> 00:25:05.088
Soo-geun's the king at that game
because it's just with you guys here.

567
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:09.143
If he's talking like this, it must mean
that he's totally confident.

568
00:25:09.151 --> 00:25:10.471
Yun-ho!

569
00:25:10.518 --> 00:25:11.994
Take it off.

570
00:25:12.034 --> 00:25:14.080
Not the bag, just the watch.

571
00:25:15.729 --> 00:25:17.737
Bring me that watch!

572
00:25:19.009 --> 00:25:21.510
(Mesmerized at his command,
Yun-ho takes off his watch)

573
00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:25.416
By the way, Soo-geun's watch is
worth 5 dollars and 50 cents.

574
00:25:25.479 --> 00:25:26.955
No, it's 12 dollars.

575
00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:28.901
This is a nice one?

576
00:25:30.469 --> 00:25:32.487
(The watch expert steps in)

577
00:25:32.605 --> 00:25:34.205
(Crowding around)

578
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.276
Sang-min, can you tell if this
is a good one?

579
00:25:39.507 --> 00:25:41.107
Wait, hold on!

580
00:25:41.175 --> 00:25:44.105
I was walking over towards
Yun-ho, and saw Changmin walking away.

581
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.908
He's hiding his wrist.

582
00:25:45.932 --> 00:25:47.532
(Taken into custody)

583
00:25:48.292 --> 00:25:51.057
They can get however nice watches
they want.

584
00:25:52.541 --> 00:25:53.572
This one's...

585
00:25:53.604 --> 00:25:55.737
Soo-geun, you should
play Changmin for his watch.

586
00:25:55.753 --> 00:25:57.744
(Caught with a nice watch)

587
00:25:58.405 --> 00:26:00.385
(Excuse me?)

588
00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:03.307
(Hacky sack with both feet)

589
00:26:03.378 --> 00:26:05.479
Switch off one foot after another.

590
00:26:05.504 --> 00:26:07.104
One, two, like this?

591
00:26:07.143 --> 00:26:08.572
OK, fine.

592
00:26:08.651 --> 00:26:11.557
Matching for a professional,
I brought a hacky sack of my own.

593
00:26:11.573 --> 00:26:12.697
You have your own?

594
00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:14.345
No, it's ours.

595
00:26:14.504 --> 00:26:17.307
Darn it... [pun for hacky sack]

596
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:19.681
It's kinda hard to see.

597
00:26:20.175 --> 00:26:21.971
You're really betting your watch?

598
00:26:22.018 --> 00:26:23.533
If I lose?

599
00:26:23.558 --> 00:26:25.932
(Asking the manager if he can
really bet his watch)

600
00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:27.884
This is for real.

601
00:26:28.178 --> 00:26:33.572
We took Zico's watch last time, but
Soo-geun felt bad and gave it back to him.

602
00:26:33.612 --> 00:26:36.502
Some people think I really kept it.

603
00:26:36.527 --> 00:26:38.658
(Thank you, Soo-geun!)

604
00:26:40.154 --> 00:26:43.166
Some people grab my wrist and check.

605
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.799
Yeah, because some viewers only watched
it until he took the watch.

606
00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:49.565
They saw Zico's watch taken away
and went to the bathroom.

607
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.244
Some people wrote comments online,
"Give back Zico's watch!"

608
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.940
OK, if I lose, I'll give you my watch.

609
00:26:55.786 --> 00:26:58.182
You better be careful with your words.

610
00:26:58.229 --> 00:27:01.268
I don't know about others,
but I'm taking yours for sure.

611
00:27:01.432 --> 00:27:04.018
Let's start with Chang-min to warm up.

612
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.479
I'm really not good at this.

613
00:27:05.487 --> 00:27:06.690
With both feet?

614
00:27:09.818 --> 00:27:12.151
(The hacky sack hit his ankle bone)

615
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:16.260
Wow, you really make a big fuss about it.

616
00:27:16.307 --> 00:27:18.119
(It really hurts!)

617
00:27:18.144 --> 00:27:19.713
Ho-dong yelled at him earlier.

618
00:27:19.753 --> 00:27:21.276
Are you OK? Are you OK?

619
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.416
Don't cry, are you OK?

620
00:27:22.425 --> 00:27:24.057
Are you hurt?

621
00:27:25.293 --> 00:27:28.619
(Ho-dong successfully creates a new image
for himself with this chance)

622
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.854
(Chang-min's score: 3!)

623
00:27:29.879 --> 00:27:32.065
Can someone really get injured
from playing hacky sack?

624
00:27:32.096 --> 00:27:33.487
(Kyung-hoon gives it a try)

625
00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:36.424
What's with the hand?

626
00:27:39.997 --> 00:27:42.010
(He's dancing)

627
00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:46.166
(Looked like he's doing kung fu)

628
00:27:46.275 --> 00:27:48.884
(Kyung-hoon's score: 8!)

629
00:27:48.956 --> 00:27:49.846
Good job!

630
00:27:49.854 --> 00:27:51.588
(Ho-dong makes an attempt)

631
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.354
(Ho-dong gets 8, too!)

632
00:27:58.393 --> 00:28:00.593
You and Kyung-hoon are tied at 8.

633
00:28:01.609 --> 00:28:04.658
(Soo-geun catches the hacky sack
with his feet)

634
00:28:04.714 --> 00:28:07.096
(Soo-geun the Hacky Sack Master)

635
00:28:07.737 --> 00:28:09.604
(Getting nervous)

636
00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:13.010
You want me to toss it to you to start?
Or you hold it yourself?

637
00:28:13.035 --> 00:28:14.252
I'll hold it myself.

638
00:28:14.323 --> 00:28:16.088
You got no skill.

639
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.276
(Ridiculed)

640
00:28:18.637 --> 00:28:20.510
(A never-ending battle of words
over hacky sack)

641
00:28:20.557 --> 00:28:22.143
You can toss it too.

642
00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:23.612
You just do it the original way.

643
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.533
About 30 should be enough, right?

644
00:28:25.581 --> 00:28:27.330
No, go for at least 50.

645
00:28:27.378 --> 00:28:28.432
Just 50.

646
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:29.862
(Soo-geun goes first)

647
00:28:38.069 --> 00:28:40.830
(Kyung-hoon's fantastic header)

648
00:28:43.719 --> 00:28:44.940
(Criticism pouring in)

649
00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:46.846
(But he continues)

650
00:28:50.256 --> 00:28:52.674
(Soo-geun's score: 23!)

651
00:28:54.935 --> 00:28:57.682
(People congratulate Kyung-hoon
more than Soo-geun who actually played)

652
00:28:57.737 --> 00:28:59.502
(It's not fair!)

653
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:01.944
I was just standing there.

654
00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:03.809
I think he's a genius!

655
00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:05.572
What is this?

656
00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:08.533
It comes down to if it was
intentional or not.

657
00:29:08.565 --> 00:29:10.424
It wasn't intentional on his end.

658
00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:12.041
He was just standing there.

659
00:29:12.065 --> 00:29:14.465
It just hit his head
then fell off.

660
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:18.791
Or he got scared and was trying to
dodge it, then got hit.

661
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.908
We still need to be fair.

662
00:29:21.862 --> 00:29:25.799
Chang-min can pass it to Yun-ho
with his head twice then.

663
00:29:27.753 --> 00:29:29.174
(Still not so cool)

664
00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:34.104
I'm sure he wouldn't have came on the show
if he couldn't do at least 23.

665
00:29:34.346 --> 00:29:35.744
(Yun-ho's turn)

666
00:29:40.817 --> 00:29:42.502
(Yun-ho's score: 6!)

667
00:29:44.175 --> 00:29:47.518
(The giant goes for the watch right away)

668
00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:49.971
(Crying)

669
00:29:51.776 --> 00:29:54.447
Just one more time...

670
00:29:56.073 --> 00:29:57.744
My watch is nice, it's light.

671
00:29:57.792 --> 00:30:00.197
(Putting on Soo-geun's light watch)

672
00:30:00.354 --> 00:30:02.682
This watch's 10 dollars!

673
00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:05.713
If you want to try again one more time...

674
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.901
Bet Chang-min's watch for it.

675
00:30:09.417 --> 00:30:10.307
Mine?

676
00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:13.854
If you go over 24, you can take
all the watches.

677
00:30:14.009 --> 00:30:15.609
Oh, really?

678
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.112
But I'm totally fine with this one.

679
00:30:18.175 --> 00:30:19.846
(Please...)

680
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.963
- Give him another chance.
- Fine, I'll give you another chance.

681
00:30:23.191 --> 00:30:26.258
If you win, wear both on both
of your wrists.

682
00:30:26.323 --> 00:30:30.565
Start wearing all the watches I took away
from idol stars.

683
00:30:30.612 --> 00:30:33.283
(Will Yun-ho hit 24?)

684
00:30:40.479 --> 00:30:41.674
(Total embarrassment)

685
00:30:41.698 --> 00:30:42.760
Wait!

686
00:30:42.785 --> 00:30:44.744
(My watch...)

687
00:30:45.307 --> 00:30:47.213
(Clinging on)

688
00:30:54.798 --> 00:30:56.658
(But the bus has already left)

689
00:30:58.877 --> 00:31:00.565
23 is hard, right?

690
00:31:00.982 --> 00:31:03.182
(Yun-ho's unofficial record: 14)

691
00:31:03.432 --> 00:31:06.565
- You should buy us dinner!
- Oh, more than dinner!

692
00:31:06.714 --> 00:31:09.151
(A sudden call for group dinner)

693
00:31:10.003 --> 00:31:12.612
(Feeling the new weight on his wrist)

694
00:31:12.682 --> 00:31:15.135
Actually, I'm good with just one foot.

695
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.080
I'll give you a chance later,
come back next time.

696
00:31:17.112 --> 00:31:19.776
Well, I have a strength, too.

697
00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:23.393
Let's have another match
in that category.

698
00:31:23.479 --> 00:31:25.424
Chang-min's strength is...

699
00:31:25.526 --> 00:31:28.197
This won't be so easy to go against
us either.

700
00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.893
Standing long jump.

701
00:31:30.753 --> 00:31:32.143
We need Chi-yeul for this.

702
00:31:32.167 --> 00:31:33.737
You're good at this, Chang-min?

703
00:31:33.776 --> 00:31:37.440
I do jump a little farther compared
to an average person.

704
00:31:37.464 --> 00:31:41.049
But it's too bland if we do it straight.

705
00:31:41.135 --> 00:31:45.096
You know the thing Kyung-hoon's good at?
Spinning while holding your nose.

706
00:31:45.175 --> 00:31:48.330
Spin around 10 times then do
a long jump right away.

707
00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:50.432
- Right away?
- Right away.

708
00:31:50.456 --> 00:31:52.190
Are you good at spinning too?

709
00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:54.854
I don't know if Ho-dong and Soo-geun
remember this, but...

710
00:31:54.885 --> 00:32:01.752
In the show that we used to do together,
I had to spin 80 times by myself.

711
00:32:02.417 --> 00:32:04.432
When I was 33...

712
00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:07.088
I started to spin around to stretch
after I ate,

713
00:32:07.096 --> 00:32:08.752
then I became 34.

714
00:32:10.969 --> 00:32:12.838
It was just last year!

715
00:32:13.876 --> 00:32:16.205
(He's on a roll today!)

716
00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:19.729
That was good!

717
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.471
(The funny spirit is upon him today)

718
00:32:24.197 --> 00:32:26.783
How come the funny spirit only
comes to him?

719
00:32:27.104 --> 00:32:29.304
(All compliment Kyung-hoon's wit)

720
00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:31.111
(My son's the best!)

721
00:32:31.237 --> 00:32:34.947
If Chang-min wins, by any chance,
I'll return this watch.

722
00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:37.579
- OK.
- Yeah, this is too much for me.

723
00:32:38.151 --> 00:32:39.526
This doesn't fit me.

724
00:32:39.565 --> 00:32:42.354
Sang-min, you should take it
before he sees it.

725
00:32:44.026 --> 00:32:46.533
(Spin around and do a long jump)

726
00:32:46.557 --> 00:32:49.424
(Soo-geun practices without spinning first)

727
00:32:50.221 --> 00:32:51.830
I think that's enough to win.

728
00:32:53.089 --> 00:32:55.315
Soo-geun, ready?

729
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.940
(Don't try this at home)

730
00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.057
(Spinning pretty fast)

731
00:33:11.219 --> 00:33:12.776
(Spun well for 10 times then
fell off right away)

732
00:33:12.823 --> 00:33:14.423
(All bruised up)

733
00:33:17.173 --> 00:33:19.369
(He still can't get up)

734
00:33:20.076 --> 00:33:21.947
The floor just came up and hit my face!

735
00:33:21.971 --> 00:33:24.033
(Not an easy match)

736
00:33:25.612 --> 00:33:27.682
The person needs to jump, but the floor
did instead.

737
00:33:27.745 --> 00:33:29.963
(It's scary when the floor attacks you)

738
00:33:31.469 --> 00:33:34.533
It's really hard, I couldn't even
stand straight.

739
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.916
(Yeong-cheol gives it a try)

740
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.230
Good speed!

741
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.350
I'm dizzy!

742
00:33:49.229 --> 00:33:51.408
- That's it!
- That's it, breathe!

743
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.635
(Hops)

744
00:33:53.962 --> 00:33:54.846
(A big bow on his knees)

745
00:33:54.871 --> 00:33:56.346
You jump really slow.

746
00:33:56.385 --> 00:33:58.119
Yeong-cheol, it was funny.

747
00:33:58.214 --> 00:34:00.096
(Embarrassed)

748
00:34:00.542 --> 00:34:02.908
You guys should try it yourselves!

749
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:06.092
The floor's still spinning.

750
00:34:06.229 --> 00:34:07.783
Then it's my turn from our team?

751
00:34:07.807 --> 00:34:09.502
Fight on, Kyung-hoon!

752
00:34:09.565 --> 00:34:11.072
I think he'll be good at this.

753
00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:13.974
(Marks how far he'll jump)

754
00:34:14.643 --> 00:34:17.026
I'm not part of this bet though, right?

755
00:34:21.676 --> 00:34:23.612
That's how he aged a whole year!

756
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.737
(Human time machine!)

757
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.860
Wake up, wake up!

758
00:34:33.403 --> 00:34:35.291
(Struggling)

759
00:34:35.483 --> 00:34:38.268
(The most normal jump today)

760
00:34:38.292 --> 00:34:40.299
(First place so far!)

761
00:34:43.766 --> 00:34:45.627
I didn't fall either, you can't fall!

762
00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:47.112
Got it.

763
00:34:48.006 --> 00:34:49.509
Didn't someone hold you up though?

764
00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:50.346
No, no.

765
00:34:50.385 --> 00:34:51.705
They held him up before he fell.

766
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.360
(Somehow convinced)

767
00:34:53.885 --> 00:34:55.729
Does Yun-ho want to go first?

768
00:34:55.784 --> 00:34:57.229
Oh, it's Chang-min's turn.

769
00:34:57.253 --> 00:34:58.853
(Yun-ho will try first)

770
00:34:59.167 --> 00:35:02.033
I'll give you back your watch
if you do well here.

771
00:35:02.299 --> 00:35:04.463
(I must do this well...)

772
00:35:08.943 --> 00:35:10.543
(Amazing speed)

773
00:35:17.083 --> 00:35:19.041
(Yun-ho jumped the farthest!)

774
00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:20.893
Don't rip your pants.

775
00:35:23.516 --> 00:35:24.463
(Plop)

776
00:35:26.715 --> 00:35:28.291
(A back fall by instinct)

777
00:35:28.448 --> 00:35:30.815
(His second time being embarrassed today)

778
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.682
(What's Yun-ho's record?)

779
00:35:33.953 --> 00:35:37.135
(He's not in second place
from being first)

780
00:35:37.229 --> 00:35:40.237
(Yun-ho's watch seems to be
in Soo-geun's hands more and more)

781
00:35:40.717 --> 00:35:42.479
(Feeling exhausted)

782
00:35:45.917 --> 00:35:47.408
It's dizzy just standing up.

783
00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.533
He jumped pretty far.

784
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.822
- Is your neck OK?
- Yes, I'm OK.

785
00:35:51.853 --> 00:35:53.627
TVXQ is amazing!

786
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.487
Remember the group "Ink"?
It reminded me of the dance Man-bok did.

787
00:35:57.503 --> 00:35:59.049
He'd fall backwards for a dance.

788
00:35:59.089 --> 00:36:00.689
(Embarrassed)

789
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.682
You are definitely qualified
to wear that watch.

790
00:36:02.721 --> 00:36:05.151
(Failed in getting back his watch)

791
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.237
Now Chang-min's the last one to go!

792
00:36:07.587 --> 00:36:09.862
He came all the way here
then fell backwards.

793
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:14.885
Chang-min can really make people laugh
with things like this once in a while.

794
00:36:15.744 --> 00:36:18.182
(Can Chang-min retrieve both
of their watches?)

795
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.627
You just get one chance!

796
00:36:25.721 --> 00:36:27.877
Good speed.

797
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.808
(To take back the lost watch...)

798
00:36:40.919 --> 00:36:44.916
(The Watch Explorers continue
their unending journey)

799
00:36:49.948 --> 00:36:55.166
(Will TVXQ get their watches back?)

800
00:37:02.841 --> 00:37:05.241
(Chang-min falls forward to be safe)

801
00:37:05.776 --> 00:37:08.104
(Expecting victory)

802
00:37:08.635 --> 00:37:10.619
(Dizzy)

803
00:37:11.832 --> 00:37:14.330
(Looking like he's got first place)

804
00:37:14.682 --> 00:37:16.408
(Accepting the result)

805
00:37:16.815 --> 00:37:18.408
Nothing bad to point out.

806
00:37:18.456 --> 00:37:20.096
(He's still dizzy)

807
00:37:20.182 --> 00:37:22.033
It's because Yun-ho went first.

808
00:37:22.487 --> 00:37:24.799
Chang-min realized that he can't
fall backwards.

809
00:37:24.815 --> 00:37:26.619
So he fell forward.

810
00:37:26.713 --> 00:37:28.776
I think he could've jumped farther.

811
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:30.846
He went for a safe distance then
fell forward.

812
00:37:31.042 --> 00:37:33.463
Let's go back to our seats.

813
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:35.291
Then... My watch...

814
00:37:35.463 --> 00:37:38.704
I've seen Chang-min for 14 years.

815
00:37:38.745 --> 00:37:41.182
Today was your most athletic day!

816
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.252
I'll give back Chang-min's watch.

817
00:37:43.873 --> 00:37:46.065
Didn't you say you'll return both?

818
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.049
When?

819
00:37:47.073 --> 00:37:48.893
You said I worked hard earlier.

820
00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:50.885
Well, my watch is valuable to me anyways.

821
00:37:50.893 --> 00:37:52.541
It's a limited edition.

822
00:37:52.974 --> 00:37:56.299
Do you want to trade?
It's limited edition.

823
00:37:56.378 --> 00:37:59.346
He pulled it from a machine, he tried
100 times for it!

824
00:37:59.518 --> 00:38:02.916
(Soo-geun gladly returned
both of their watches)

825
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.182
Sorry, but can you hide your watches now?

826
00:38:06.983 --> 00:38:08.119
They're bothering me.

827
00:38:08.144 --> 00:38:10.088
(They make me want to take them!)

828
00:38:11.031 --> 00:38:13.231
It's so fun being with us, right?

829
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:14.970
Yes, so fun!

830
00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:16.103
Thanks.

831
00:38:16.221 --> 00:38:20.822
I'll be giving you a quiz now.
We put in a lot of thoughts into this.

832
00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:22.485
Hope you do well.

833
00:38:22.573 --> 00:38:23.744
Yun-ho, you go in too.

834
00:38:23.854 --> 00:38:24.814
Where should I sit?

835
00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:27.033
Yeong-cheol will move out
of his seat.

836
00:38:27.565 --> 00:38:29.642
The camera will get you the most there.

837
00:38:30.572 --> 00:38:31.588
You gotta look back at us.

838
00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:34.166
(Ho-dong and Yun-ho are always together)

839
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.892
I'll start the quiz then.

840
00:38:37.276 --> 00:38:39.447
You guys like to drink?

841
00:38:39.845 --> 00:38:42.322
Sometimes I drink alone at home, too.

842
00:38:42.799 --> 00:38:45.799
And I did something to taste it better.

843
00:38:45.838 --> 00:38:47.213
Got it!

844
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.041
I know this 100%!

845
00:38:49.088 --> 00:38:53.580
You get drunk after a few shots
then all every girl you know in your phone.

846
00:38:53.683 --> 00:38:54.400
No?

847
00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.658
And how can a student talk about
drinking alcohol?

848
00:38:58.823 --> 00:39:01.611
You got tired of drinking alone and you
called someone, "I'm tired of

849
00:39:01.635 --> 00:39:03.900
drinking alone. I want your lips now."

850
00:39:03.948 --> 00:39:05.548
(A strong punishment)

851
00:39:07.088 --> 00:39:08.822
You were so lonely that...

852
00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:12.885
You put a big teddy bear across
the table from you.

853
00:39:13.034 --> 00:39:15.181
And you had a conversation
while drinking.

854
00:39:15.315 --> 00:39:16.877
"You take one, I take one."

855
00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:19.049
I know he acts too, so I know the answer.

856
00:39:19.432 --> 00:39:20.900
You played another person.

857
00:39:20.994 --> 00:39:23.939
"Take a shot."
"Oh, you always drink so late!"

858
00:39:24.018 --> 00:39:26.322
You switched seats back and forth.

859
00:39:26.346 --> 00:39:28.517
And you'd stand like this
when you get drunk.

860
00:39:28.595 --> 00:39:29.978
(Embracing himself)

861
00:39:30.166 --> 00:39:31.736
Not my answer, it's his.

862
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.236
(Punished while trying to jump in)

863
00:39:34.495 --> 00:39:37.322
It's true that it's an action from
feeling lonely.

864
00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:38.072
Yeah, see?

865
00:39:38.112 --> 00:39:41.580
If we just follow the manual
and go with the basic rules...

866
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:43.251
You'll need music first.

867
00:39:43.346 --> 00:39:46.486
Maybe a song with a story,
or meaningful melody.

868
00:39:46.643 --> 00:39:48.243
Is it this? I got it.

869
00:39:50.135 --> 00:39:51.603
You take pictures.

870
00:39:51.705 --> 00:39:52.885
What kind of pictures?

871
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.306
Pictures of yourself drinking?

872
00:39:57.619 --> 00:39:59.931
You gotta hit him hard, like you
hit me earlier.

873
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.064
Yes, hit him hard!

874
00:40:01.112 --> 00:40:02.439
It's a TV show, you gotta be fair.

875
00:40:02.479 --> 00:40:04.580
Don't forget, I'm the leader
of our team.

876
00:40:04.651 --> 00:40:06.142
But we're all just friends here.

877
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.221
I'm older than you too! You still
hit me hard.

878
00:40:08.246 --> 00:40:11.830
It's so funny, it's just 2 of us but
there's a leader for some reason.

879
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:13.626
What do you want me to do?

880
00:40:14.268 --> 00:40:16.385
(TVXQ's leader out of 2 gets punished)

881
00:40:17.304 --> 00:40:18.994
Are your pants ripped?

882
00:40:19.284 --> 00:40:21.963
If one person's a leader, what does
the other member do?

883
00:40:22.018 --> 00:40:23.963
I'm just the guy next to the leader.

884
00:40:24.002 --> 00:40:27.080
It's problematic that you didn't become
the leader, from 50:50 chance.

885
00:40:27.265 --> 00:40:29.260
(That sounds right actually)

886
00:40:29.744 --> 00:40:31.275
Yun-ho's older, that's why.

887
00:40:31.315 --> 00:40:33.017
Chang-min's the practical leader.

888
00:40:33.065 --> 00:40:35.642
You should take turns every year.

889
00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:37.244
We should.

890
00:40:37.307 --> 00:40:41.056
They do that in baseball, the captain
wears the "C" badge.

891
00:40:41.182 --> 00:40:42.736
(Convinced by the giant)

892
00:40:42.768 --> 00:40:46.322
It's kinda close to what Ho-dong said.

893
00:40:47.284 --> 00:40:51.455
I always play the rain sound
when I drink alone.

894
00:40:51.588 --> 00:40:52.635
The rain sound?

895
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.885
(Getting close!)

896
00:40:53.916 --> 00:40:57.689
My mind's at peace when I hear
the sound of the rain.

897
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.228
I think the beer tastes better too.

898
00:41:00.276 --> 00:41:02.564
You're just getting old.

899
00:41:02.987 --> 00:41:04.705
The sound of a stream...

900
00:41:05.362 --> 00:41:10.822
You listen to music and start singing
with the singer, like a duet.

901
00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.252
Like a duet song.

902
00:41:13.277 --> 00:41:17.814
What is music? Just pop music?
Or classical?

903
00:41:18.034 --> 00:41:19.963
Is that the only form of music?

904
00:41:20.057 --> 00:41:22.524
The sound of nature can be music too.

905
00:41:22.994 --> 00:41:24.439
Sound of birds chirping!

906
00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:26.252
Sound of thunder!

907
00:41:26.315 --> 00:41:27.931
Sound of pouring drinks!

908
00:41:29.151 --> 00:41:30.299
It's summer.

909
00:41:30.369 --> 00:41:32.471
Sound you can hear on a summer night.

910
00:41:32.689 --> 00:41:36.580
You drink with the sound of crickets
in the background!

911
00:41:36.698 --> 00:41:39.096
Super Junior's, "Sorry, Sorry"!
[pun for sound]

912
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.228
That's wrong.

913
00:41:40.253 --> 00:41:41.783
You're almost there!

914
00:41:42.205 --> 00:41:45.674
You step outside and catch crickets
and frogs.

915
00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:47.978
Then you let them lose in the house.

916
00:41:48.197 --> 00:41:51.611
Then they make their noises
and you drink to their sounds.

917
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.174
The sound of cicadas!

918
00:41:56.182 --> 00:41:57.541
What does that sound like?

919
00:42:00.582 --> 00:42:03.244
There's no tree, I was pretending
to be one.

920
00:42:03.526 --> 00:42:06.603
Yes, that sound, but how do you
think I listen to it as I drink?

921
00:42:06.713 --> 00:42:09.135
A cicada drink? Drink made with cicadas?

922
00:42:10.355 --> 00:42:13.181
So it's not that you go and catch
cicadas yourself.

923
00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:16.431
You download that sound and drink
alone as you listen to it.

924
00:42:16.557 --> 00:42:18.157
(So close, Ho-dong!)

925
00:42:18.893 --> 00:42:21.674
You go out and record the sound of
cicadas yourself.

926
00:42:21.791 --> 00:42:24.213
You record it yourself then play it back.

927
00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.885
You go to your next door neighbor...

928
00:42:26.932 --> 00:42:29.736
He's right! Jang-hoon's right.

929
00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:37.306
When I go home from work
on a summer night...

930
00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:41.705
I take a shower and want to
drink a cold can of beer before I sleep.

931
00:42:41.768 --> 00:42:44.705
I really wanted to enjoy
the summer night feel.

932
00:42:44.916 --> 00:42:47.681
I'd go down to the first floor
of the apartment building.

933
00:42:47.737 --> 00:42:51.681
I look for a place where there are cicadas.

934
00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:55.346
I record that sound on my phone.

935
00:42:55.448 --> 00:42:56.939
(How romantic!)

936
00:42:57.573 --> 00:43:00.830
I come back home and play it back
as I drink.

937
00:43:00.877 --> 00:43:04.775
That's why there were noises sometimes
when he called me at night.

938
00:43:04.823 --> 00:43:08.439
It makes me feel one with
the night in summer.

939
00:43:08.464 --> 00:43:11.119
How about winter? All the animals
are asleep.

940
00:43:11.205 --> 00:43:14.142
In winter, I wrap myself around
in a blanket.

941
00:43:14.182 --> 00:43:17.760
I stay warm and eat tangerines,
and drink.

942
00:43:17.948 --> 00:43:20.947
He's so much like Kyung-hoon!

943
00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:26.541
You guys should do a video chat while
each of you is in your own home, drinking.

944
00:43:26.862 --> 00:43:28.635
I know what Chang-min does
when he gets drunk.

945
00:43:28.705 --> 00:43:30.338
He gets numbers.

946
00:43:30.665 --> 00:43:32.026
(Me? I've never heard that)

947
00:43:32.049 --> 00:43:34.392
And he puts a lot of force
in his eyes.

948
00:43:34.417 --> 00:43:36.478
His eyes get like this when he gets drunk.

949
00:43:36.526 --> 00:43:38.971
Then he gets numbers from all the actresses
who were on the show with him.

950
00:43:38.987 --> 00:43:40.713
(Speechless)

951
00:43:40.738 --> 00:43:45.424
I don't think he actually calls them,
it's just to have good manners.

952
00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:46.549
But he does get their numbers.

953
00:43:46.574 --> 00:43:48.752
It's true that he puts a lot of force
in his eyes when he drinks.

954
00:43:48.838 --> 00:43:51.228
He opens his eyes like this
when he's drunk.

955
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.572
You do lots of things before you get home.

956
00:43:54.916 --> 00:43:55.838
So diligent.

957
00:43:55.884 --> 00:43:57.377
Who's your drinking buddy?

958
00:43:57.463 --> 00:44:00.517
I drink often with Kyu-hyun
from Super Junior.

959
00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:02.611
He drink a lot! You can keep up?

960
00:44:02.651 --> 00:44:04.596
He can, about the same as Kyu-hyun.

961
00:44:05.226 --> 00:44:08.392
(A friendship built on drinking together)

962
00:44:08.643 --> 00:44:12.322
I like beer, soju, and wine.

963
00:44:12.798 --> 00:44:13.767
Kyu-hyun likes wine too.

964
00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:15.096
You have a separate fridge for wine?

965
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:17.080
Yeah, I have a cellar.

966
00:44:17.104 --> 00:44:18.704
A wine cellar!

967
00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.166
I just put everything in my kitchen fridge.

968
00:44:21.244 --> 00:44:24.353
Wine gets so cold there, it makes
my teeth cold.

969
00:44:24.844 --> 00:44:25.783
Just freeze it then.

970
00:44:25.846 --> 00:44:29.111
I can't tell if it's grape juice
or wine it's so cold.

971
00:44:30.994 --> 00:44:34.885
I heard Soo-geun's wine bottles break
from being frozen in the freezer.

972
00:44:34.916 --> 00:44:35.806
Next question!

973
00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:37.446
OK, next question.

974
00:44:37.721 --> 00:44:44.931
What was the most memorable thing
my mother said to me after I debuted?

975
00:44:45.041 --> 00:44:46.641
What's your mother like?

976
00:44:46.877 --> 00:44:50.181
I'm sure many are like that, but
she's still got sensibility like a girl.

977
00:44:50.213 --> 00:44:52.291
A girl's sensibility...

978
00:44:52.573 --> 00:44:55.877
It's something she said when
she was so happy.

979
00:44:55.979 --> 00:45:02.322
"I'm so happy that Max Changmin from
TVXQ is my son!"

980
00:45:02.815 --> 00:45:05.728
You're definitely on the right track.

981
00:45:07.077 --> 00:45:08.861
(Feeling good about himself)

982
00:45:08.909 --> 00:45:10.509
He's really amazing.

983
00:45:10.799 --> 00:45:14.017
"My son is the best looking, he's
the coolest!"

984
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:17.330
"But what's wrong with that leader
guy next to my son?"

985
00:45:17.354 --> 00:45:19.619
"He's really bland, my son's the best!"

986
00:45:19.721 --> 00:45:22.267
My mom really likes Yun-ho.

987
00:45:22.361 --> 00:45:23.463
She said he's really cool.

988
00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:28.455
"Be the most respectful person
in Asia, Chang-min."

989
00:45:31.206 --> 00:45:34.150
(A girlish response to a comment
that really wasn't funny at all)

990
00:45:34.479 --> 00:45:37.119
His pitch climbed up to the 7th octave!

991
00:45:38.885 --> 00:45:42.189
It's not that she was thankful for
my being Max Changmin.

992
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.067
He gave a hint earlier...

993
00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:47.166
Is her liking Yun-ho a hint?

994
00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.533
(Who are these people?)

995
00:45:49.807 --> 00:45:53.408
"I'm so thankful that my son is in the
same team as U-Know Yun-ho!"

996
00:45:53.955 --> 00:45:54.846
Not it.

997
00:45:54.854 --> 00:45:57.369
"Thanks for matching up to Yun-ho!"

998
00:45:57.487 --> 00:45:59.900
"I'd be thankful if I can meet
U-Know Yun-ho in person."

999
00:46:01.143 --> 00:46:04.697
The name of this show can be a hint.

1000
00:46:04.752 --> 00:46:06.392
"Thanks for knowing Yun-ho!"

1001
00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:09.447
"Tell Yun-ho that I'd be thankful if he
lends me 10,000 dollars!"

1002
00:46:10.314 --> 00:46:11.666
"Changmin, my son!"

1003
00:46:11.691 --> 00:46:15.846
"I'm so thankful that I got to know
Yun-ho through you, Chang-min!"

1004
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:18.441
"I'm thankful that you know Yun-ho."

1005
00:46:18.502 --> 00:46:20.385
Correct!

1006
00:46:21.173 --> 00:46:23.197
(Kim Hee-chul gets it right!)

1007
00:46:25.494 --> 00:46:31.009
Yun-ho is really respectful, he treats
older people really well.

1008
00:46:31.112 --> 00:46:34.760
I was drinking with my mother once, and
she said...

1009
00:46:34.916 --> 00:46:37.572
She smiled, and said it jokingly...

1010
00:46:37.971 --> 00:46:41.244
"Thanks for being born a person
who knows Yun-ho."

1011
00:46:41.315 --> 00:46:42.510
That's what she said.

1012
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:45.822
How did you feel when you heard that?

1013
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.463
I have no desire to stand out when
I'm with Yun-ho.

1014
00:46:49.924 --> 00:46:54.666
I just want to go with him,
like a piggy-back ride.

1015
00:46:54.893 --> 00:46:57.299
Even when I don't say anything,
he knows what to say and

1016
00:46:57.324 --> 00:46:58.511
how to resolve things.

1017
00:46:58.534 --> 00:47:01.049
That's why you two get along so well.

1018
00:47:01.377 --> 00:47:02.977
(Passion Mansour Yun-ho)

1019
00:47:03.057 --> 00:47:06.721
She said something similar recently.

1020
00:47:07.221 --> 00:47:10.064
"I'm thankful that you went to the military
with Si-won."

1021
00:47:10.143 --> 00:47:12.189
(Yun-ho and Si-won are equivalent?)

1022
00:47:12.252 --> 00:47:15.056
They're so similar!

1023
00:47:15.432 --> 00:47:19.096
But why? Why did she say that?

1024
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:22.431
No other reason, it's because
Si-won's really rich.

1025
00:47:24.715 --> 00:47:26.627
(Another rich man)

1026
00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:30.947
Ask her today, tell her
you know Jang-hoon now.

1027
00:47:31.385 --> 00:47:33.642
See if she's thankful that you know him.

1028
00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.221
In Si-won's social media, you actually
see a lot of pictures with him

1029
00:47:37.244 --> 00:47:39.611
and businessmen together.

1030
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.978
That's true, he knows so many people.

1031
00:47:43.135 --> 00:47:46.353
She's not thankful that you know
Hee-chul too?

1032
00:47:46.471 --> 00:47:50.611
She just says, "He feels just like
Kim Heung-Gook whenever I see him."

1033
00:47:53.962 --> 00:47:56.619
"Come on, Mom!"

1034
00:47:57.604 --> 00:48:00.221
(She's clear about whom she likes)

1035
00:48:02.424 --> 00:48:05.494
Hee-chul's got a new nickname,
thanks to Chang-min's mother.

1036
00:48:06.823 --> 00:48:12.791
Who do you think is responsible for
this show's success?

1037
00:48:12.909 --> 00:48:15.892
It's all because of the younger members.

1038
00:48:16.057 --> 00:48:20.814
I did hear something memorable about
the show, though I joined the show later.

1039
00:48:20.854 --> 00:48:24.463
Ho-dong told me not to pressure the members
about the rating.

1040
00:48:24.494 --> 00:48:25.572
He told me that too.

1041
00:48:25.635 --> 00:48:28.783
He said that at our last press conference.

1042
00:48:28.932 --> 00:48:33.072
He said we shouldn't have to worry
about the rating,

1043
00:48:33.112 --> 00:48:34.931
it's up to the staff and production.

1044
00:48:34.971 --> 00:48:37.619
(A meeting was called when the show
wasn't doing well)

1045
00:48:37.791 --> 00:48:41.346
The artists shouldn't be concerned
about analysis of things.

1046
00:48:41.393 --> 00:48:43.439
It becomes burdensome.

1047
00:48:43.565 --> 00:48:47.635
But he told me, "Kyung-hoon,
you're responsible for the show too."

1048
00:48:48.284 --> 00:48:50.877
Kyung-hoon needs to feel
more responsible.

1049
00:48:50.939 --> 00:48:54.033
You gotta turn the number of your  fans
from 11,000 to 110,000!

1050
00:48:54.135 --> 00:48:56.408
I didn't know I had that many fans.

1051
00:48:57.354 --> 00:49:00.205
There's a saying, "One who's never fell
off a horse before doesn't know

1052
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:02.017
the pains of a walker."

1053
00:49:02.971 --> 00:49:05.142
What are you guys, brothers?

1054
00:49:06.104 --> 00:49:09.517
Ho-dong felt the pains of his struggles
before, and doesn't want others to

1055
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.963
go through the same pains.

1056
00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:13.721
Nice words from Ho-dong.

1057
00:49:14.565 --> 00:49:16.898
There's a saying I really like too.

1058
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.642
"Boiled pork is no longer afraid
of hot water."

1059
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.721
(Wow, how classy)

1060
00:49:24.798 --> 00:49:26.877
(Cold response)

1061
00:49:27.174 --> 00:49:28.330
It's already been boiled!

1062
00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:31.103
How can the dead pig know that?
It's already dead!

1063
00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:33.150
It's a great saying.

1064
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:36.353
(Yun-ho's the only one
who acknowledges it)

1065
00:49:36.651 --> 00:49:38.103
OK, next question.

1066
00:49:38.182 --> 00:49:42.564
So my mother likes Yun-ho this much.

1067
00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:48.330
But there was a time I was really
embarrassed because of Yun-ho.

1068
00:49:48.454 --> 00:49:52.054
What do you think he did that
embarrassed me so much?

1069
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.275
Can we say this on TV?

1070
00:49:54.463 --> 00:49:58.338
You called me often, and complained
about Yun-ho as you cried.

1071
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.416
He did?

1072
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:04.228
That can happen if you've been
in the same team together for a while.

1073
00:50:04.807 --> 00:50:08.033
You guys don't even share a waiting room
together, you come to ours.

1074
00:50:08.276 --> 00:50:10.072
(Strong punishment for making up stories)

1075
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.713
Yun-ho expresses his emotions a lot, right?

1076
00:50:13.948 --> 00:50:15.088
A lot!

1077
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:18.533
Then... You were at a place
where there were a lot of people.

1078
00:50:19.096 --> 00:50:20.244
He hugged you, and...

1079
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.939
He hugged you and started to cry
uncontrollably.

1080
00:50:23.026 --> 00:50:24.267
"Stop it, Yun-ho."

1081
00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:29.705
But he kept crying, unable to
control his emotions.

1082
00:50:30.205 --> 00:50:31.455
By the way, I don't cry that often.

1083
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.760
It is wrong.

1084
00:50:32.799 --> 00:50:36.353
But Jang-hoon's approach
is really amazing.

1085
00:50:36.385 --> 00:50:40.150
It's normally a cool action,
but it was embarrassing that day.

1086
00:50:41.463 --> 00:50:43.221
You were performing "Rising Sun."

1087
00:50:44.762 --> 00:50:45.947
He let out a big one.

1088
00:50:45.979 --> 00:50:47.697
His fart actually lifted him off a bit.

1089
00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:50.017
(Rising Sun and really rising up
to the sky?)

1090
00:50:50.112 --> 00:50:53.111
You get lifted up in concerts often,
and he really was off the ground.

1091
00:50:53.307 --> 00:50:57.650
But have you ever been pushed up a little?
For real?

1092
00:50:57.713 --> 00:50:59.752
What, from farting?

1093
00:50:59.932 --> 00:51:04.189
I held it for a long time and it just
came out, and it pushed me forward.

1094
00:51:04.252 --> 00:51:05.393
No one else?

1095
00:51:05.393 --> 00:51:06.517
(Only possible with Ho-dong)

1096
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:07.822
While you were bent over.

1097
00:51:07.869 --> 00:51:09.924
I feel like I can kinda remember.

1098
00:51:10.057 --> 00:51:12.189
He did something, then I was like...

1099
00:51:13.174 --> 00:51:14.533
Got it!

1100
00:51:14.963 --> 00:51:19.908
You went to a sauna together
after a concert, since you sweated so much.

1101
00:51:20.018 --> 00:51:22.642
And you were so embarrassed!

1102
00:51:23.073 --> 00:51:25.072
"Oh, this was you?"

1103
00:51:26.642 --> 00:51:28.939
What are you talking about?

1104
00:51:29.932 --> 00:51:33.650
You were so embarrassed,
"How can a human being's..."

1105
00:51:34.534 --> 00:51:36.267
On Chang-min's birthday...

1106
00:51:38.174 --> 00:51:42.408
Yun-ho brought out a cake
as a surprise.

1107
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:46.744
Happy birthday to you...

1108
00:51:47.276 --> 00:51:49.705
It's wrong, but so close.

1109
00:51:49.807 --> 00:51:51.096
I got it!

1110
00:51:51.127 --> 00:51:54.228
Yun-ho was moving quickly to prepare
a surprise for your birthday.

1111
00:51:54.307 --> 00:51:57.119
He got the cake but forgot
to put on his pants.

1112
00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:58.766
Happy birthday...

1113
00:51:59.291 --> 00:52:01.587
He only had his underwear on.

1114
00:52:01.982 --> 00:52:04.201
Totally naked. In red underwear.

1115
00:52:04.279 --> 00:52:07.208
- But he had his socks on.
- Yes, he had socks on.

1116
00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:09.767
He had shiny shoes on as well.

1117
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.474
It was during a music show.

1118
00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:12.673
Answer!

1119
00:52:12.689 --> 00:52:16.294
You guys were in the middle of
performing on a music program...

1120
00:52:16.756 --> 00:52:19.642
and while you guys were
singing, he suddenly...

1121
00:52:19.799 --> 00:52:23.279
- he yells, "Happy birthday, Chang-min"!
- You got it.

1122
00:52:24.732 --> 00:52:28.470
He must've done that while
you guys were singing "Why".

1123
00:52:28.838 --> 00:52:30.716
- During the "Why" song.
- You're right.

1124
00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:34.583
Why did you that while singing?
Why did you do it during that song?

1125
00:52:34.678 --> 00:52:36.612
I just remembered too but...

1126
00:52:36.886 --> 00:52:39.206
I did it was embarrassing afterward too.

1127
00:52:39.324 --> 00:52:41.007
He did it because he really loves you.

1128
00:52:41.179 --> 00:52:42.865
Why was that embarrassing for you?

1129
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:47.241
No, it was because when our
performance would start...

1130
00:52:47.625 --> 00:52:50.929
Yun-ho walked out looking
really cool but...

1131
00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:54.491
I think he was thinking
about something backstage.

1132
00:52:55.007 --> 00:52:59.788
His eyes had the usual glare before
going on stage, like any other day.

1133
00:53:00.433 --> 00:53:02.968
He walked on stage, like this and yelled...

1134
00:53:03.261 --> 00:53:05.726
Happy birthday, Chang-min!

1135
00:53:06.132 --> 00:53:08.777
Happy birthday, Chang-min!

1136
00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:11.069
(Embarrassed)

1137
00:53:14.687 --> 00:53:16.160
I think that's really cool.

1138
00:53:16.425 --> 00:53:21.007
- He loves his little brother. - Yes,
he must really love his little brother.

1139
00:53:21.582 --> 00:53:24.480
The prelude to "Why" is really short.

1140
00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:27.537
It would've been funny if I
just yelled, "Happy birthday".

1141
00:53:27.562 --> 00:53:30.929
I wanted to tell him how I felt,
but the beat was too fast.

1142
00:53:31.004 --> 00:53:32.195
I was in a hurry.

1143
00:53:32.511 --> 00:53:35.982
I thought it would only make an impact,
if I yelled, "Happy birthday, Chang-min".

1144
00:53:36.007 --> 00:53:37.906
Show us the original version.

1145
00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.732
- He had to have so many thoughts
racing through his mind. - Of course.

1146
00:53:41.757 --> 00:53:43.652
We were at a KBS music program.

1147
00:53:43.906 --> 00:53:44.906
Music Bank.

1148
00:53:45.156 --> 00:53:46.894
It's an imposing performance.

1149
00:53:47.063 --> 00:53:48.617
What should I do?

1150
00:53:49.099 --> 00:53:52.460
(He changes suddenly when
he begins his performance)

1151
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:55.644
Happy birthday, Chan-min!

1152
00:53:55.867 --> 00:53:57.144
(That's what happened)

1153
00:53:57.865 --> 00:54:01.035
(He looks like he might take
over Chang-min's birthday)

1154
00:54:01.419 --> 00:54:03.419
(It was just like that)

1155
00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.882
Keep up!

1156
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:06.738
(Passion)

1157
00:54:07.988 --> 00:54:10.035
I bet Chang-min was shocked.

1158
00:54:10.472 --> 00:54:12.745
- Happy birthday!
- Congratulations!

1159
00:54:12.918 --> 00:54:16.804
- I was really thankful but...
- You should've answered back!

1160
00:54:17.179 --> 00:54:18.843
Thank you, Yun-ho!

1161
00:54:19.851 --> 00:54:23.339
- That's right. - Chang-min was
getting ready and said, "Me?".

1162
00:54:24.273 --> 00:54:25.273
Is that how you reacted?

1163
00:54:25.303 --> 00:54:27.078
I was with all the dancers...

1164
00:54:27.343 --> 00:54:29.511
(Was he talking about me, right now?)

1165
00:54:30.238 --> 00:54:33.316
- That's what happened.
- It's still a moving story.

1166
00:54:33.636 --> 00:54:36.050
- I was thankful.
- Yeah, it's a good story.

1167
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.428
- You remembered that. - You can do it for
Yun-ho since his birthday is coming up.

1168
00:54:39.453 --> 00:54:41.912
I'll do that since your birthday
is at the beginning of the year.

1169
00:54:41.937 --> 00:54:42.986
That's good.

1170
00:54:43.011 --> 00:54:44.339
My next problem.

1171
00:54:44.804 --> 00:54:48.722
Not only was I surprised, but
Shinee members were also...

1172
00:54:49.129 --> 00:54:52.546
very surprised by what Yun-ho said on stage.

1173
00:54:52.875 --> 00:54:55.834
- Shinee again?
- They have similar guys on the team.

1174
00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:59.972
- It has to be similar. - Congratulations
on your fifth anniversary, Shinee!

1175
00:55:01.179 --> 00:55:02.816
While he was singing?

1176
00:55:03.304 --> 00:55:05.355
I think Min-ho might have
been sincerely moved.

1177
00:55:05.519 --> 00:55:09.906
Min-ho might have sung, "Thank you, Yun-ho.
Thank you, Yun-ho".

1178
00:55:10.018 --> 00:55:13.453
(Their passionate battle goes
back and forth on stage)

1179
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:16.670
- That's how he answered you.
- Min-ho wouldn't hold back either.

1180
00:55:16.695 --> 00:55:18.671
He would take it sincerely.

1181
00:55:19.265 --> 00:55:21.917
- It was an outdoor concert.
- It was outdoors?

1182
00:55:22.058 --> 00:55:25.460
Yun-ho just said what he wanted
to say at the concert...

1183
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:30.628
but Shinee's members were
in awe when they heard him.

1184
00:55:31.968 --> 00:55:34.386
They thought, "He's that great of a guy?".

1185
00:55:35.105 --> 00:55:38.229
You could say it's was Yun-ho's
extraordinary personality.

1186
00:55:38.367 --> 00:55:39.558
Did he cuss?

1187
00:55:40.855 --> 00:55:43.581
He ended the show when there
were performers left.

1188
00:55:43.879 --> 00:55:45.702
That's all for today!

1189
00:55:46.785 --> 00:55:51.092
The remaining performers probably got
worried as to what would happen next.

1190
00:55:51.117 --> 00:55:53.045
The next performers were probably Shinee.

1191
00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.519
He got so excited by himself,
he shouted to the fans...

1192
00:55:56.597 --> 00:56:00.112
"I'm willing to risk my
life for you guys!".

1193
00:56:01.613 --> 00:56:05.054
- I'm not making it up, but
you're always so close. - Right?

1194
00:56:05.639 --> 00:56:10.322
- You're so close. - I know his personality
now. I think he said something like that.

1195
00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:12.769
"We're only here because of you guys".

1196
00:56:12.832 --> 00:56:14.904
No, that's too weak. I don't think so.

1197
00:56:14.929 --> 00:56:17.398
- It was pouring that day.
- It was raining.

1198
00:56:17.648 --> 00:56:22.999
I got it! It's raining now, but it'll
be sun Shinee in a few moments!

1199
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Nope!

1200
00:56:25.675 --> 00:56:28.644
What? Let's see you come
up with something better.

1201
00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:30.795
I think it's pretty good.

1202
00:56:31.015 --> 00:56:34.901
"I'll dry everyone's body with my passion!"

1203
00:56:36.199 --> 00:56:39.823
- Something like that?
- "Everyone, take your clothes off!".

1204
00:56:39.957 --> 00:56:41.792
That's how far you guys think I'd take it?

1205
00:56:41.879 --> 00:56:45.132
"Nothing will rain on our parade!".

1206
00:56:45.664 --> 00:56:47.737
It's about winning and losing.

1207
00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:50.273
"Everyone..." I'm so astounded.

1208
00:56:50.562 --> 00:56:52.742
- "Everyone...".
- Don't say it, if you're not confident.

1209
00:56:52.767 --> 00:56:54.995
- "Let's win the rain!"
- You got it.

1210
00:56:56.066 --> 00:56:59.249
- Really?
- I said it but I'm dumbfounded.

1211
00:56:59.554 --> 00:57:02.795
- You really said that?
- I'll tell you precisely what he said.

1212
00:57:03.015 --> 00:57:07.573
It was pouring rain and we were
performing with other SM groups.

1213
00:57:07.683 --> 00:57:11.409
- You guys had everyone there.
- Yes, we had junior and senior colleagues.

1214
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:13.971
He wanted to look cool
since everyone was there.

1215
00:57:14.168 --> 00:57:16.623
"Everyone! Let's not lose to the rain!".

1216
00:57:17.613 --> 00:57:19.929
Min-ho probably saw that and
suddenly began singing...

1217
00:57:20.086 --> 00:57:23.155
"I won't lose, I won't lose".

1218
00:57:24.074 --> 00:57:25.480
(It seems plausible)

1219
00:57:25.988 --> 00:57:27.463
I miss Min-ho.

1220
00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:33.218
Let's have a special show with
Min-ho, Si-won and Yun-ho.

1221
00:57:33.445 --> 00:57:35.870
Let's invite all three of them.
It'll be exciting.

1222
00:57:36.308 --> 00:57:37.775
There was a reason I said that.

1223
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.421
As performers, we can't help but
be more careful when it rains.

1224
00:57:41.492 --> 00:57:45.026
The audience members also
become a bit timid as well.

1225
00:57:45.074 --> 00:57:47.273
I wanted to make an impact when I appeared.

1226
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.803
I'm always thinking about what
to say when I'm backstage.

1227
00:57:51.062 --> 00:57:52.186
Original version, please.

1228
00:57:52.211 --> 00:57:56.436
- I looked at the audience and didn't think
it was right. - Because it was raining.

1229
00:57:56.461 --> 00:57:58.127
I asked myself what I should do.

1230
00:57:58.152 --> 00:58:00.838
- It's pouring out here.
- What should we do?

1231
00:58:01.933 --> 00:58:04.155
(I don't think this will do)

1232
00:58:05.097 --> 00:58:07.089
Let's not lose to the rain!

1233
00:58:08.437 --> 00:58:10.459
Let's not lose to the rain!

1234
00:58:10.484 --> 00:58:11.484
(Excited)

1235
00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:13.444
(Full of passion)

1236
00:58:15.093 --> 00:58:17.252
Keep going, keep going!

1237
00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:19.377
(Come on, rain!)

1238
00:58:20.143 --> 00:58:21.502
Say it again for us!

1239
00:58:21.527 --> 00:58:23.514
Let's not lose to the rain!

1240
00:58:24.929 --> 00:58:28.284
He was outside but all the
performers were inside waiting.

1241
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:31.655
Shinee's five members were
waiting on their lift...

1242
00:58:31.788 --> 00:58:33.619
and they hear, "Let's
not lose to the rain!".

1243
00:58:33.644 --> 00:58:35.377
(Let's not lose to what?)

1244
00:58:35.527 --> 00:58:36.811
Let's not lose to the rain?

1245
00:58:36.836 --> 00:58:39.659
You might have been shocked,
but Min-ho was probably moved.

1246
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.323
Min-ho was probably crying in the back.

1247
00:58:42.484 --> 00:58:44.846
Everyone else might have been shocked...

1248
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:46.643
but Min-ho accepted his role.

1249
00:58:46.668 --> 00:58:48.894
"I won't let you down".

1250
00:58:49.511 --> 00:58:51.327
"I won't let the rain win".

1251
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.987
The audience was much happier after that.

1252
00:58:54.277 --> 00:58:56.838
I think you like instigating things.

1253
00:58:57.656 --> 00:59:02.104
The performers after him have it easy
since he's already riled up the crowd.

1254
00:59:02.129 --> 00:59:04.925
He likes being passionate
and saying quotes.

1255
00:59:07.726 --> 00:59:09.311
Let's start. Can I start?

1256
00:59:09.336 --> 00:59:13.284
We're a bit tired from doing the show
and answering Chang-min's questions.

1257
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:14.549
What should we do?

1258
00:59:14.574 --> 00:59:16.428
Can you change the atmosphere?

1259
00:59:16.453 --> 00:59:18.280
Let's never get tired!

1260
00:59:18.976 --> 00:59:21.093
(Loudly shouts: Let's never get tired)

1261
00:59:21.353 --> 00:59:23.128
Okay, let's never get tired.

1262
00:59:23.488 --> 00:59:25.222
I'm not going to get tired!

1263
00:59:25.308 --> 00:59:27.710
- You can't get tired.
- No, I won't.

1264
00:59:29.078 --> 00:59:32.959
I'm sure you know me, now that you've
been solving Chang-min's questions.

1265
00:59:32.984 --> 00:59:36.007
The questions I'll be
asking are pretty similar.

1266
00:59:36.117 --> 00:59:37.217
I guess this would happen.

1267
00:59:37.242 --> 00:59:42.288
I landed on my head while doing a back
flip at a concert in Los Angeles.

1268
00:59:42.859 --> 00:59:45.542
I said something when I fell on the floor.

1269
00:59:45.785 --> 00:59:50.007
- This seems so obvious. - The crowd and
staff all laughed after I said this.

1270
00:59:50.547 --> 00:59:52.472
- What did I say?
- Okay!

1271
00:59:53.019 --> 00:59:54.148
"I'm okay!".

1272
00:59:54.328 --> 00:59:55.796
- No.
- I got it!

1273
00:59:56.957 --> 00:59:58.781
Was I being too loud?

1274
00:59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.627
- You scared me.
- It was too loud.

1275
01:00:00.652 --> 01:00:03.105
- What is it?
- After you bumped your head...

1276
01:00:03.406 --> 01:00:05.695
you said, "I won't lose to the stage!".

1277
01:00:05.941 --> 01:00:07.448
No, you're wrong.

1278
01:00:07.925 --> 01:00:10.452
- No.
- I wish you'd be more intimidated.

1279
01:00:10.656 --> 01:00:12.378
You're being too excessive.

1280
01:00:12.929 --> 01:00:17.390
- That's the first time he got excited.
- Those were his first words today.

1281
01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:20.971
Your voice precedes your reputation as
being the number one entertainer brand.

1282
01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:23.757
- Respect, respect.
- Your energy is the same.

1283
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:26.370
I don't usually talk in long sentences.

1284
01:00:26.765 --> 01:00:29.413
You laughed as soon as
you banged your head.

1285
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:34.577
You didn't want the audience to
realize you made a mistake while...

1286
01:00:34.757 --> 01:00:37.042
flipping since you're a professional.

1287
01:00:37.199 --> 01:00:38.808
Bang! One  more time!

1288
01:00:39.242 --> 01:00:40.691
Bang! One  more time!

1289
01:00:42.811 --> 01:00:45.034
(Acts like it's a part of the performance)

1290
01:00:45.629 --> 01:00:46.796
No, you're wrong.

1291
01:00:47.117 --> 01:00:48.437
(You're the best)

1292
01:00:48.914 --> 01:00:52.014
You do it until you succeed
since you can't make mistakes.

1293
01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:54.226
Think about my passion, very carefully.

1294
01:00:54.515 --> 01:00:56.679
I got it! "I'm all right!".

1295
01:00:57.007 --> 01:01:00.730
(I'm all right these days, I'll
be all right if you leave)

1296
01:01:01.332 --> 01:01:02.694
No. It's similar.

1297
01:01:03.539 --> 01:01:06.241
- Did you like that?
- Think more about "I'm okay".

1298
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500
I'm fine!

1299
01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:11.252
- He must've said something else from
being shocked. - You're very close.

1300
01:01:11.277 --> 01:01:13.995
- I am...
- I am strong!

1301
01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.354
- You're very close.
- I'm strong.

1302
01:01:18.379 --> 01:01:20.808
- You're very close.
- I'm power man!

1303
01:01:21.629 --> 01:01:23.890
- You guys are almost there.
- I'm Superman!

1304
01:01:24.093 --> 01:01:25.534
- I'm tough!
- Armstrong!

1305
01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:26.683
Armstrong!

1306
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:28.214
Armstrong! You got it.

1307
01:01:28.425 --> 01:01:30.378
Yeong-cheol got it right.

1308
01:01:30.496 --> 01:01:31.867
Armstrong?

1309
01:01:32.152 --> 01:01:34.128
I actually said, "I'm strong".

1310
01:01:34.504 --> 01:01:37.249
At the moment, I fell on my head.

1311
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.995
The audience members were worried about me.

1312
01:01:40.332 --> 01:01:43.319
I didn't think it would be right
to let them worry about me.

1313
01:01:43.414 --> 01:01:45.425
- You can't let it get to you.
- Of course, not.

1314
01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:46.916
- You need to take control.
- Yes, take control.

1315
01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:49.605
- You needed to take a hold.
- I needed to lead the audience.

1316
01:01:49.855 --> 01:01:52.494
- Of course. - That's why, I
needed to say, "I'm strong".

1317
01:01:52.519 --> 01:01:56.741
- You made a mistake. - I said it
fast and said, "Armstrong" instead.

1318
01:01:57.132 --> 01:02:02.140
The fans and staff members began calling
me Yun-ho Armstrong after that.

1319
01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:03.918
(They did)

1320
01:02:04.742 --> 01:02:06.808
He's continuing Louis Armstrong's legend.

1321
01:02:07.043 --> 01:02:09.444
The Shinee members probably heard that...

1322
01:02:09.656 --> 01:02:12.389
and Min-ho said to himself,
"I'll be strong too, Yun-ho".

1323
01:02:12.414 --> 01:02:15.066
Si-won would react to that by doing this.

1324
01:02:15.091 --> 01:02:16.886
I really miss Min-ho and Si-won.

1325
01:02:17.222 --> 01:02:20.714
- I'll go with you.
- Yun-ho, I respect you.

1326
01:02:21.285 --> 01:02:22.600
I want to be a strong man too.

1327
01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:26.640
I think every team has one person
that over-reacts to everything.

1328
01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:29.026
I was that one person in Roola.

1329
01:02:29.543 --> 01:02:32.968
One person needs to step up
and keep everyone passionate.

1330
01:02:33.093 --> 01:02:36.248
The team only stays together if
you're constantly passionate.

1331
01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:39.901
When one person does that, everyone's
adrenaline starts pumping.

1332
01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:44.038
- That's why, I look lethargic sometimes.
- That makes sense.

1333
01:02:44.129 --> 01:02:47.456
- Because one person is so passionate.
- You're passionate as well, too.

1334
01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.577
You guys can make him chairman after
you make a group with the other three.

1335
01:02:51.668 --> 01:02:52.668
Chairman Kang.

1336
01:02:52.945 --> 01:02:55.425
We've actually mentioned that before.

1337
01:02:56.289 --> 01:02:57.394
Passion four.

1338
01:02:57.789 --> 01:03:00.843
This is a problem, EXO's Su-ho keep
going over to your side as well.

1339
01:03:00.882 --> 01:03:03.929
- Really?
- Su-ho is kind of like them.

1340
01:03:04.164 --> 01:03:05.472
Su-ho was very serious.

1341
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:07.523
Now, the next question.

1342
01:03:09.187 --> 01:03:11.744
- This is tiring.
- You can't lose to your thirst, Yun-ho.

1343
01:03:11.769 --> 01:03:13.726
- Of course.
- You can't lose to thirst.

1344
01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:17.179
- He used a lot of energy.
- Why would you down that whole bottle?

1345
01:03:17.375 --> 01:03:20.284
- Yun-ho!
- Look at the way he drinks water.

1346
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:22.034
He passionately drank that water.

1347
01:03:22.191 --> 01:03:25.136
He started to down the whole
bottle of water after...

1348
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.702
I mentioned he can't lose to thirst.

1349
01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:29.787
I'll admit to losing to you guys.

1350
01:03:29.812 --> 01:03:33.397
You've jumped off stage into the
crowd many times, haven't you?

1351
01:03:33.422 --> 01:03:35.007
I did a couple of times.

1352
01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:38.225
Remember how you banged your
head while flipping backwards?

1353
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.683
Doesn't it hurt at that moment?

1354
01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:42.265
Are you holding back your pain?

1355
01:03:42.336 --> 01:03:44.948
I once ripped my pants open
on stage before as well.

1356
01:03:45.168 --> 01:03:47.131
All these incidents were correlated.

1357
01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:50.537
I believe the audience will be
embarrassed if I'm embarrassed on stage.

1358
01:03:50.562 --> 01:03:52.865
I believe everyone looking
at me would be embarrassed.

1359
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.511
That's why, I believe you're only
an artist if you lead the crowd...

1360
01:03:56.652 --> 01:03:58.878
after you get hurt or get embarrassed.

1361
01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:03.765
But Chang-min was embarrassed when
you yelled, "Happy birthday" to him.

1362
01:04:04.203 --> 01:04:05.562
I thought he liked it.

1363
01:04:05.734 --> 01:04:09.589
Passionate people like us aren't that
concerned with other people's feelings.

1364
01:04:09.687 --> 01:04:12.601
- That's right. - I release
everything I think is necessary.

1365
01:04:12.699 --> 01:04:16.034
- I love you, it doesn't matter if you
love me back. - It just comes out.

1366
01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:18.635
I'm afraid I'll get sick if I
don't do everything I want to.

1367
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.135
We have release everything. I'm only
doing what my body tells me to do.

1368
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.830
You saw him screaming when he
won his wrestling matches.

1369
01:04:23.855 --> 01:04:28.331
He kept celebrating his win even though
the opponent lost or has fainted.

1370
01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:32.706
Once, he didn't even know
his nose was bleeding.

1371
01:04:32.882 --> 01:04:35.335
That's why his opponent told
him not to be flippant.

1372
01:04:35.449 --> 01:04:39.538
Do you guys remember the awards
show when he got too excited?

1373
01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:43.753
- Dong-yup got shocked.
- Dong-yup couldn't say anything.

1374
01:04:44.425 --> 01:04:47.452
Everyone! Start screaming!

1375
01:04:48.488 --> 01:04:51.905
The backstage is going crazy
since they're so excited.

1376
01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:53.977
The show must go on!

1377
01:04:54.001 --> 01:04:56.503
(He's so passionate, he throws his script)

1378
01:04:56.761 --> 01:05:00.808
I don't care what Dong-yup thinks about me.
I'm just doing what I need to.

1379
01:05:01.004 --> 01:05:02.612
Scream!

1380
01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:06.538
I can identify with that. I used
to go crazy with "Rising Sun".

1381
01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:08.307
I'd yell, "Rising Sun" and go crazy.

1382
01:05:08.332 --> 01:05:12.132
I used to always look from the back,
but "Rising Sun" is a very loud song.

1383
01:05:12.445 --> 01:05:14.054
It's a splendid song.

1384
01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:17.518
During broadcast shows, they'd
especially fire all the fireworks.

1385
01:05:17.543 --> 01:05:19.463
- During the end.
- That was our ending.

1386
01:05:19.488 --> 01:05:22.218
- My hair was short back then.
- That's right.

1387
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:26.115
It was short because all of the
firework embers would land on my head.

1388
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.814
After the song and the fireworks were
ignited, you can see smoke from my hair.

1389
01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:35.150
I couldn't stop showing the audience my
passion since I was the center of my group.

1390
01:05:35.175 --> 01:05:39.218
I felt like I was a general when all
the embers started flying my way.

1391
01:05:39.324 --> 01:05:41.616
- Like a general at war.
- I was willing to take it.

1392
01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:43.437
The embers can't daunt me.

1393
01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:46.784
I'd yell, "Rising Sun" and
bang, the song was over.

1394
01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:51.283
All the embers would fly toward my
head, but I was able to stand it.

1395
01:05:51.308 --> 01:05:52.647
- You can't move.
- No.

1396
01:05:52.672 --> 01:05:53.912
I'm okay since I'm TVXQ.

1397
01:05:53.937 --> 01:05:57.023
Yun-ho and Ho-dong seem to look
at one another with respect...

1398
01:05:57.048 --> 01:05:59.140
but Chang-min is in the middle...

1399
01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:02.011
thinking, "What am I
going to do with him?".

1400
01:06:02.199 --> 01:06:04.308
- It doesn't matter.
- Nope.

1401
01:06:04.582 --> 01:06:06.205
Let's see the original version.

1402
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.374
"Rising Sun".

1403
01:06:08.304 --> 01:06:10.530
Let it go, keep letting it all loose.

1404
01:06:13.355 --> 01:06:15.011
Pretend you're on stage.

1405
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:16.269
This is for real.

1406
01:06:18.472 --> 01:06:20.030
Pretend you're on stage.

1407
01:06:20.379 --> 01:06:21.379
This is for real.

1408
01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:25.585
(He dances like he was really
on stage, like Ho-dong requested)

1409
01:06:25.818 --> 01:06:28.319
(Rising Sun)

1410
01:06:28.692 --> 01:06:30.523
(That's it!)

1411
01:06:30.726 --> 01:06:34.218
(His dance is flashy as
the flashy song)

1412
01:06:36.176 --> 01:06:39.226
(The enemy's arrows are
in front of his eyes)

1413
01:06:40.422 --> 01:06:42.116
You're okay, you're okay.

1414
01:06:43.039 --> 01:06:45.448
- It's getting hot.
- Is he catching on fire?

1415
01:06:45.855 --> 01:06:48.115
- Are you okay?
- I need someone to show me the cut sign.

1416
01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:49.140
- Cut!
- Cut!

1417
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.515
- Cut!
- Ouch, it's hot!

1418
01:06:54.566 --> 01:06:56.776
- It's hot.
- That's so cute.

1419
01:06:56.972 --> 01:07:00.034
My hair kept on getting shorter back then.

1420
01:07:00.737 --> 01:07:02.112
I totally understand.

1421
01:07:02.964 --> 01:07:05.722
I also have a lot of different hobbies.

1422
01:07:06.836 --> 01:07:09.377
- Hobby?
- Yeah, my hobbies are a bit unique.

1423
01:07:09.402 --> 01:07:13.651
I have a hobby that hasn't
changed since I was a trainee.

1424
01:07:14.222 --> 01:07:15.451
What do you think that is?

1425
01:07:15.476 --> 01:07:17.952
Participating in speech competitions.

1426
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:21.183
He competes, no matter what he's doing.

1427
01:07:21.261 --> 01:07:25.554
I'm actually kind of shy talking
to people while standing on stage.

1428
01:07:25.617 --> 01:07:27.092
I have A-blood type.

1429
01:07:27.117 --> 01:07:30.155
I got it! You organize cable wires.

1430
01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:32.073
Organizing wires.

1431
01:07:32.355 --> 01:07:34.722
I'll give you a crucial hint.

1432
01:07:34.964 --> 01:07:37.413
I was enjoying my hobby when I saw...

1433
01:07:39.023 --> 01:07:40.776
Sang-min a while back.

1434
01:07:41.695 --> 01:07:43.878
- Doing your hobby?
- You mean, that?

1435
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.808
Sang-min does a lot of
shopping for sale items.

1436
01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:50.917
- You're almost there.
- That's why...

1437
01:07:51.074 --> 01:07:52.643
Buying the cheapest home appliances.

1438
01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:55.394
You're almost there. You
guys are really close.

1439
01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:57.380
- Jang-hoon is really close.
- Is it about computers?

1440
01:07:57.405 --> 01:07:59.976
- I got it! - You do?
- Home shopping!

1441
01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.409
- You're right!
- Of course, it's home shopping.

1442
01:08:03.691 --> 01:08:06.237
- How did he meet Sang-min?
- Did you do a Home Shopping show?

1443
01:08:06.324 --> 01:08:09.292
Didn't you Dow a show
on exfoliating callous?

1444
01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:12.659
I think the commercial was
shown as a video clip.

1445
01:08:12.972 --> 01:08:15.273
I'm very into researching...

1446
01:08:16.031 --> 01:08:17.362
what I buy.

1447
01:08:17.452 --> 01:08:19.256
I don't buy a lot of things.

1448
01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:22.814
- You're looking for good items on sale.
- You have urges to buy things.

1449
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:24.662
When do you have the most urges?

1450
01:08:24.687 --> 01:08:27.611
- I heard people get nervous when
items are almost sold out. - No.

1451
01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:30.644
More than that, I get weak
on their presentation.

1452
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.890
When I'm watching it, they'll say,
"We don't have much time left!".

1453
01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:35.373
- Set A and Set B?
- Yes, Set A and Set B.

1454
01:08:35.398 --> 01:08:38.701
I'll buy it right away when they start
adding on items to your purchase.

1455
01:08:38.726 --> 01:08:42.042
What was the most successful
item you've ever bought?

1456
01:08:42.343 --> 01:08:43.878
A cordless mop.

1457
01:08:43.931 --> 01:08:46.267
- Oh, that! - You know, right?
- Cordless mop!

1458
01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:48.939
- It's a cordless mop?
- What was the add-on item for that?

1459
01:08:48.964 --> 01:08:52.167
They added an extra four
mops to the mop.

1460
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:55.659
They usually only give 2 extra mops.

1461
01:08:55.838 --> 01:08:57.218
That's why you waited?

1462
01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:59.562
Yeah, because they gave
four instead of two.

1463
01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:02.100
- Timing is important for shopping.
- That's right.

1464
01:09:02.186 --> 01:09:05.943
It's the same number but sometimes
they give out two and sometimes four.

1465
01:09:05.968 --> 01:09:08.998
That's why you need to pay attention
to the time they have sales.

1466
01:09:09.068 --> 01:09:11.595
- 2 and 4 mops are a big difference.
- Yes, they're expensive.

1467
01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:15.283
Some home shopping programs are
recorded and some are live.

1468
01:09:15.308 --> 01:09:16.619
They separated the channels.

1469
01:09:16.644 --> 01:09:21.351
The bigger phone number is recorded
and you can buy it at a later time.

1470
01:09:21.586 --> 01:09:26.170
- They'll add an extra item if you
wait about a week. - That's right!

1471
01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:29.930
That's where professional
shopper and amateurs differ.

1472
01:09:30.152 --> 01:09:33.831
Amateurs begin to get nervous as
soon as the item is released.

1473
01:09:34.047 --> 01:09:37.794
- You shouldn't buy it.
- On the other hand, I'm calm.

1474
01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:39.279
You're laid back.

1475
01:09:39.304 --> 01:09:40.644
I'll keep watching.

1476
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:45.506
- During Thanksgiving, they give an
extra 10 ramens. - You're right!

1477
01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:49.034
You're right! That's exactly right.

1478
01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:53.729
It's no joke when you get
into home shopping programs.

1479
01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:59.128
I also bought some dish washing
scrubbers awhile back as well.

1480
01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:02.846
- You do dishes at home?
- I do, sometimes.

1481
01:10:03.214 --> 01:10:07.261
They were selling 200
scrubbers and added 50 more.

1482
01:10:07.597 --> 01:10:09.769
- As an add-on gift?
- Are you getting ready?

1483
01:10:09.902 --> 01:10:11.628
The problem is...

1484
01:10:12.027 --> 01:10:15.347
I told you, Sang-hoon is
in love with someone!

1485
01:10:15.457 --> 01:10:19.424
The problem was that I bought dish
scrubbers, but don't have any use for them.

1486
01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:21.558
I think Jang-hoon has an eye for items.

1487
01:10:21.886 --> 01:10:24.532
He has an eye for items,
but he needs patience.

1488
01:10:24.557 --> 01:10:27.580
Better items would've been
added-on if you wait a bit longer.

1489
01:10:27.699 --> 01:10:28.699
I didn't know that.

1490
01:10:28.751 --> 01:10:31.735
When did you start getting
into home shopping?

1491
01:10:31.837 --> 01:10:33.587
- Me?
- When did you start home shopping?

1492
01:10:33.665 --> 01:10:36.251
I think I was about 17-years-old.

1493
01:10:36.337 --> 01:10:39.561
My first item was a leather
jacket I bought as a trainee.

1494
01:10:39.853 --> 01:10:42.977
I got hooked onto home shopping
because of that jacket.

1495
01:10:43.181 --> 01:10:46.360
I was watching TV with
Dong-hae and Yun-ho when...

1496
01:10:46.767 --> 01:10:49.460
they were showing us a leather
jacket that wouldn't burn.

1497
01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:51.984
They couldn't set the jacket on fire.

1498
01:10:52.009 --> 01:10:55.641
Yun-ho was amazed by the
jacket and decided to buy it.

1499
01:10:56.048 --> 01:10:57.617
I asked if it really didn't catch on fire.

1500
01:10:57.642 --> 01:11:01.079
I told him it was a lie and the
jacket would burn if we lit it.

1501
01:11:01.384 --> 01:11:03.860
Dong-hae kept asking the
same thing as well.

1502
01:11:03.869 --> 01:11:07.358
Dong-hae kept on saying, "Burn it, burn it.
Try and burn it".

1503
01:11:07.595 --> 01:11:10.266
- He started to light it.
- Try and burn it. Burn it!

1504
01:11:10.587 --> 01:11:13.610
My pride was hurt when
he began saying that.

1505
01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.095
- He began using his dialect too.
- It won't burn.

1506
01:11:16.368 --> 01:11:18.239
No, it won't burn. There's no way.

1507
01:11:18.264 --> 01:11:20.095
All three of us were using dialects.

1508
01:11:20.439 --> 01:11:23.133
While I was asking him, "What are you
going to do if it doesn't burn?".

1509
01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:26.760
He kept egging me on and saying,
"No, it'll burn. Try burning it.".

1510
01:11:26.837 --> 01:11:30.570
I really didn't think it would catch
on fire because of the program.

1511
01:11:30.595 --> 01:11:32.983
As you know, I'm timid
because my blood-type is A.

1512
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:35.112
But I act strong in those situations.

1513
01:11:35.228 --> 01:11:39.944
I kept on saying the jacket wouldn't catch
on fire since it's on a different level.

1514
01:11:40.521 --> 01:11:42.366
It would've been okay if Hee-chul...

1515
01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:45.889
talked to me about it, but his
actions and words of trying to...

1516
01:11:46.282 --> 01:11:49.531
burn the jacket came at the same
time without consulting me.

1517
01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:50.968
Let's try burning that jacket.

1518
01:11:50.993 --> 01:11:54.844
I came out with a lighter while
asking, "Let's try burning it".

1519
01:11:54.985 --> 01:11:56.968
Will it really catch on fire?
I thought it didn't.

1520
01:11:56.993 --> 01:12:00.110
Of course, it won't catch on fire.
That's what they said.

1521
01:12:00.329 --> 01:12:03.351
All this was happening while Dong-hae
kept saying, "Let's try it. Burn it".

1522
01:12:03.376 --> 01:12:07.235
I got a mad and started questioning
whether the jacket would catch on fire.

1523
01:12:07.595 --> 01:12:11.133
Hee-chul lit the jacket while
I was questioning myself.

1524
01:12:11.743 --> 01:12:14.389
I never knew a jacket could burn so easily.

1525
01:12:15.079 --> 01:12:18.790
- Ablaze?
- I can't really go into the details but...

1526
01:12:18.923 --> 01:12:21.719
I've never seen anything burn better.

1527
01:12:22.017 --> 01:12:24.227
At least we spent a warm winter together.

1528
01:12:24.321 --> 01:12:27.227
People will usually take a small
flame and try lighting it...

1529
01:12:27.603 --> 01:12:31.227
but the jacket couldn't withstand
them putting a huge fire against it.

1530
01:12:31.571 --> 01:12:34.250
Yun-ho and I never fought,
but that was our first time.

1531
01:12:34.275 --> 01:12:38.272
- We fought until the very end.
- Did you throw that jacket away?

1532
01:12:38.548 --> 01:12:41.351
- We threw it away, of course.
- What about your money?

1533
01:12:41.376 --> 01:12:45.235
I started to save again after
I threw away the jacket.

1534
01:12:45.329 --> 01:12:47.446
Why didn't you ask them
to buy you another one?

1535
01:12:47.634 --> 01:12:49.063
I know why he didn't.

1536
01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.679
There's a reason he couldn't get mad at us.

1537
01:12:51.704 --> 01:12:54.688
At that time, Yun-ho used a
water bottle as his piggy-bank.

1538
01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:57.493
His piggy-bank was a big water bottle.

1539
01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:01.688
He'd take Dong-hae and my coins and
put it all into his piggy-bank.

1540
01:13:02.267 --> 01:13:04.375
That's what he bought the
leather jacket with.

1541
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.040
One of my hobbies is still
saving coins in a piggy-bank.

1542
01:13:09.587 --> 01:13:12.780
- It brings back memories.
- That's the reason why...

1543
01:13:12.806 --> 01:13:16.618
I became so interested in
home shopping programs.

1544
01:13:16.806 --> 01:13:18.993
- Okay!
- Okay!

1545
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:21.292
(Up next: Ceremony of the Best Duets)

1546
01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:24.393
(A flashy stage...)

1547
01:13:25.414 --> 01:13:27.917
(with bright lights)

1548
01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.467
(Ceremony of the Best Duets)

1549
01:13:30.695 --> 01:13:31.695
(Looking around)

1550
01:13:31.876 --> 01:13:33.915
Is this a broadcasting station?

1551
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:36.297
This way. Come this way.

1552
01:13:36.759 --> 01:13:39.448
- Come sit over here.
- There's a lot of cameras.

1553
01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:41.289
The lights are bright too.

1554
01:13:41.314 --> 01:13:43.805
- Hello.
- Come this way. - Hello.

1555
01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.493
- You're cheating.
- Why?

1556
01:13:46.743 --> 01:13:48.753
The wig looks really good on you.

1557
01:13:49.253 --> 01:13:50.253
(Bushy)

1558
01:13:50.631 --> 01:13:54.242
- My wig is really heavy.
- Can you walk here? - Why is it so heavy?

1559
01:13:54.267 --> 01:13:56.149
I'm nervous. Really nervous.

1560
01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:59.344
I'm really nervous since this is the
first time at a broadcasting station.

1561
01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:00.369
(Surprised)

1562
01:14:01.416 --> 01:14:03.094
Hello, everyone!

1563
01:14:03.478 --> 01:14:05.401
(A man appears along with special effects)

1564
01:14:05.509 --> 01:14:06.944
Hello, everyone!

1565
01:14:06.969 --> 01:14:10.540
Welcome to Korea's Ceremony
of the Best Duets!

1566
01:14:10.565 --> 01:14:14.975
I'll be your host for today, Popeye Lee
Sang-ryong. Nice to meet everyone!

1567
01:14:15.711 --> 01:14:16.711
(Welcoming)

1568
01:14:17.009 --> 01:14:20.034
- Save me, Popeye!
- Help me, Popeye!

1569
01:14:21.126 --> 01:14:24.993
Are you ready to become Korea's
most popular duet groups?

1570
01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.182
(Confidently screams yes)

1571
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:29.579
Yes, I'm sure!

1572
01:14:30.056 --> 01:14:34.626
- Be quiet. - When else am I going to talk?
The producers said I could interrupt.

1573
01:14:34.657 --> 01:14:37.438
- Be quiet.
- Why do you always go a step further?

1574
01:14:37.548 --> 01:14:39.844
Can you two keep it quiet?

1575
01:14:40.369 --> 01:14:42.008
Why are you guys interrupting the emcee?

1576
01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:44.337
Your confidence is amazing.

1577
01:14:44.384 --> 01:14:48.821
I'll begin introducing each of the duet
teams since everyone is so excited.

1578
01:14:48.868 --> 01:14:51.672
The first duet are men, who are charming!

1579
01:14:51.962 --> 01:14:55.469
A duet with both men, Really Men!

1580
01:14:56.556 --> 01:14:59.454
- (I'm going to love)
- Again?

1581
01:15:00.064 --> 01:15:03.256
- (I'm going to love)
- After all the pain you put her through?

1582
01:15:03.392 --> 01:15:04.936
(Continues on)

1583
01:15:06.954 --> 01:15:09.797
- Our groups name is...
- Really Men!

1584
01:15:12.102 --> 01:15:14.635
It means the color of men
is strong on our team.

1585
01:15:14.821 --> 01:15:18.563
We'll show you what it means to be men!
Testosterone!

1586
01:15:19.345 --> 01:15:20.345
TTT!

1587
01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:25.540
We'll show you what test...
tes... testosterone is!

1588
01:15:25.579 --> 01:15:26.986
We'll show what men are made of.

1589
01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:29.915
We'll make sure to show
you everything about men!

1590
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:33.540
- (I'm going to love)
- Again?

1591
01:15:34.485 --> 01:15:38.141
Yes, that was Really Men, who make
us want to fall in love again.

1592
01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:43.383
You can tell our next team is full
of love, just by looking at them.

1593
01:15:43.946 --> 01:15:47.665
A real couple duet named "We're Couples".

1594
01:15:47.899 --> 01:15:52.282
(We lived our lives together
just with affection)

1595
01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:55.758
(The days have passed like a dream)

1596
01:15:55.993 --> 01:15:57.856
- It's passed?
- I won't let you go.

1597
01:15:57.978 --> 01:16:00.055
I won't let you go.

1598
01:16:01.174 --> 01:16:02.174
(Laughing)

1599
01:16:03.071 --> 01:16:04.493
(He can't help but smile)

1600
01:16:05.025 --> 01:16:07.235
- Excuse me.
- Did everyone see that?

1601
01:16:07.485 --> 01:16:09.063
- It must be really hard on you.
- Yes.

1602
01:16:09.228 --> 01:16:11.843
It's not like that. My
husband isn't like that.

1603
01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:14.585
- My husband is...
- I'd like to make sure I can love.

1604
01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:17.235
- I'm rooting for you.
- My husband gets nauseous on TV.

1605
01:16:17.376 --> 01:16:19.883
He's actually very nice and affection...

1606
01:16:19.931 --> 01:16:22.126
but he's nauseous from being nervous.

1607
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:25.563
Aren't we happy? Tell them
how happy we are, honey.

1608
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:26.790
(Laughing)

1609
01:16:27.048 --> 01:16:28.649
Smile, please.

1610
01:16:29.915 --> 01:16:30.915
I'm happy.

1611
01:16:31.485 --> 01:16:34.723
Did you hear that? He said he was happy.
We're happy.

1612
01:16:34.837 --> 01:16:35.946
Let's move on.

1613
01:16:36.048 --> 01:16:37.454
- I can move on?
- Yes.

1614
01:16:37.595 --> 01:16:39.344
- Don't be nervous.
- This is embarrassing.

1615
01:16:39.415 --> 01:16:41.962
- What are you so embarrassed about?
- Can you fight at home?

1616
01:16:42.079 --> 01:16:46.055
- Is this being broadcast?
- Yes, it's being broadcast nation-wide.

1617
01:16:46.095 --> 01:16:47.329
We’re not fighting.

1618
01:16:47.589 --> 01:16:48.679
(Gets affectionate quickly)

1619
01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:52.723
- Kids, we're on television.
- Don't mommy and daddy look happy?

1620
01:16:54.118 --> 01:16:57.204
Let's move onto our next team.
They're a bizarre duet.

1621
01:16:57.689 --> 01:16:59.246
Play with Me!

1622
01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:02.641
Hello, I'm Min-hyuk from "Play with Me".

1623
01:17:02.735 --> 01:17:05.094
Hello, I'm Hee-bin from "Play with Me".

1624
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:09.985
The back! The back! The
back of the fish is blue!

1625
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:15.251
That's fat! That's fat! That's fat!
Ho-dong is really fat!

1626
01:17:16.775 --> 01:17:17.775
(Getting mad)

1627
01:17:18.157 --> 01:17:20.516
Are you making fun of my
husband saying that he's fat?

1628
01:17:20.626 --> 01:17:24.633
It's out! It's out! It's out!
Her lips are protruding out!

1629
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.579
You guys should really stop fighting
and we should love one another.

1630
01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:34.188
- Again?
- This team isn't sincere at all.

1631
01:17:34.314 --> 01:17:36.179
- They're not sincere.
- After you hurt her so much?

1632
01:17:36.204 --> 01:17:40.954
Honey, they're making fun of us saying
you're fat and my lips are protruding out.

1633
01:17:41.071 --> 01:17:44.805
You need to protect us, honey.
Why aren't you doing anything?

1634
01:17:45.915 --> 01:17:46.915
(Flinching)

1635
01:17:47.907 --> 01:17:51.493
Her husband is willing
to put up with so much.

1636
01:17:52.439 --> 01:17:53.439
Next.

1637
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.016
Next is a team that doesn't
need an introduction.

1638
01:17:57.275 --> 01:18:00.860
Gods that were raised in the east, TVXQ!

1639
01:18:01.485 --> 01:18:03.149
(Gods of the east: TVXQ)

1640
01:18:03.853 --> 01:18:07.008
- 1, 2, 3.
- Hello, we're TVXQ.

1641
01:18:07.392 --> 01:18:09.313
What kind of name is TVXQ?

1642
01:18:09.517 --> 01:18:12.524
I don't think I can accept
this duet group's name.

1643
01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:15.055
Their name is too grand.

1644
01:18:15.173 --> 01:18:17.555
- What's TVXQ?
- Shouldn't they change their name?

1645
01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:20.860
Who are you to tell us to keep
changing our group's name?

1646
01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:22.609
What do you mean, who are you?

1647
01:18:22.634 --> 01:18:25.938
We're, "I'm going to love again".

1648
01:18:26.228 --> 01:18:27.337
Again?

1649
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:31.797
Change your name when we tell you to.
The only person...

1650
01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:35.180
that's like a god in the
east is Soo-geun's mom!

1651
01:18:35.337 --> 01:18:38.680
She's can tell fortune, like
no one else in the east.

1652
01:18:38.837 --> 01:18:40.844
Soo-geun seems like the devil.

1653
01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:41.924
(Has no excuses)

1654
01:18:42.095 --> 01:18:44.110
- I know.
- What am I going to...

1655
01:18:44.306 --> 01:18:47.516
That's the mystery. I'm
going to love again.

1656
01:18:47.798 --> 01:18:48.798
Again?

1657
01:18:48.931 --> 01:18:51.219
Who dresses like that, these days?

1658
01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:53.493
You're visually a mis-match.

1659
01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:57.087
Who cuts their hair that these days?

1660
01:18:57.423 --> 01:18:59.110
It's better than your hair!

1661
01:18:59.345 --> 01:19:01.383
You look like a triangular kimbab.

1662
01:19:01.579 --> 01:19:03.094
Now, now! We're on television!

1663
01:19:03.157 --> 01:19:04.507
Please, have a seat.

1664
01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:07.774
We've met four great duet teams
that are very passionate.

1665
01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:11.008
Are you ready to become the best duet team?

1666
01:19:11.165 --> 01:19:12.165
(We're ready)

1667
01:19:12.884 --> 01:19:13.884
Popeye!

1668
01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:14.923
Popeye!

1669
01:19:15.579 --> 01:19:17.188
Popeye! Let loose!

1670
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.297
We'll say our name too! One, two, three!

1671
01:19:20.642 --> 01:19:24.172
"We're Couples". Don't you think
we're the best duet group?

1672
01:19:24.353 --> 01:19:26.140
- Can't you stay quiet?
- Why?

1673
01:19:26.165 --> 01:19:28.180
It's because we're happy.

1674
01:19:28.595 --> 01:19:31.922
I'm getting old these
days, do you know what?

1675
01:19:32.188 --> 01:19:33.188
Why?

1676
01:19:33.213 --> 01:19:35.579
He won't let me go to sleep at night.

1677
01:19:35.759 --> 01:19:37.485
(Are you talking about me?)

1678
01:19:37.954 --> 01:19:41.110
We can't have another. We
already have nine kids.

1679
01:19:41.345 --> 01:19:42.938
We can't have another.

1680
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:45.719
- We have nine kids between us?
- Yes, we have nine kids.

1681
01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:47.766
- You and me?
- Yes, that's right!

1682
01:19:47.962 --> 01:19:49.446
They're true lovers.

1683
01:19:50.618 --> 01:19:51.626
He's a real man.

1684
01:19:51.689 --> 01:19:56.594
He's a true lover that loves
without any terms or conditions.

1685
01:19:56.743 --> 01:19:58.587
- He's a real man.
- Yes, he is.

1686
01:19:58.853 --> 01:20:02.156
There hasn't been a time when I wasn't
pregnant for the past 10-years.

1687
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:03.946
They're all a year apart?

1688
01:20:04.462 --> 01:20:06.954
No! I imagined it. I imagined it.

1689
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:08.110
(Screaming)

1690
01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:13.571
Did you hear his happy screams?
He screams like this often.

1691
01:20:13.993 --> 01:20:18.266
Next, let's see how real
men show their affection!

1692
01:20:18.657 --> 01:20:21.407
- We're all about affection.
- Show them.

1693
01:20:22.212 --> 01:20:24.837
(I bet you're over 6' 5", honey)

1694
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.415
I bet you're over 6' 5", honey.

1695
01:20:28.564 --> 01:20:31.891
(He can't say anything
since he's taken aback)

1696
01:20:32.798 --> 01:20:37.399
Why don't you show me some affection
since we're on television, honey?

1697
01:20:37.704 --> 01:20:40.454
- Stop it.
- Show them how you're so affectionate.

1698
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:42.852
- Stop it.
- Show them.

1699
01:20:42.915 --> 01:20:46.860
- How about you give him a kiss
since he's so shy? - That's right.

1700
01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.672
Can you show him your affection instead?

1701
01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:53.422
I bet you're over 200 pounds, honey.

1702
01:20:54.132 --> 01:20:55.132
(Laughing)

1703
01:20:56.423 --> 01:20:59.008
- I already told you, he's over 300 pounds.

1704
01:20:59.462 --> 01:21:02.989
You should get heavier since
you only look 200 pounds.

1705
01:21:03.235 --> 01:21:04.594
You're so pretty.

1706
01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:06.657
This is getting fatal.

1707
01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:09.430
- I'm sorry, but excuse me!
- Yes?

1708
01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:12.290
Singers shouldn't show off
their affection or talents...

1709
01:21:12.446 --> 01:21:16.516
but their talents should be based
on their singing capabilities.

1710
01:21:16.978 --> 01:21:19.547
- Would you like to sing for us?
- Affection doesn't have any meaning.

1711
01:21:19.681 --> 01:21:20.751
Let's sing our song.

1712
01:21:20.837 --> 01:21:22.383
- We'll win with our song.
- We'll sing first.

1713
01:21:22.431 --> 01:21:25.101
We'll end everything with our performance
since you guys aren't confident.

1714
01:21:25.126 --> 01:21:27.743
It's our hit song, "I'm
Going to Love Again".

1715
01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.351
- Again?
- We'll sing it for you.

1716
01:21:29.376 --> 01:21:32.211
- Again?
- Yeah, we're going to love again.

1717
01:21:33.398 --> 01:21:35.375
(Korea's Ceremony
of the Best Duets)

1718
01:21:35.634 --> 01:21:38.204
Even if I'm heart-broken...

1719
01:21:39.017 --> 01:21:41.340
I'm always ready to love again.

1720
01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:43.975
Really Men is going to sing...

1721
01:21:44.829 --> 01:21:46.983
"I'm Going to Love Again".

1722
01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:49.460
(He's summoning an emotional giant)

1723
01:21:49.485 --> 01:21:54.868
(Now, I'm going to forget you as well)

1724
01:21:55.538 --> 01:21:57.155
(Full of emotions)

1725
01:21:57.696 --> 01:22:01.915
(It's just too hard for me)

1726
01:22:05.407 --> 01:22:10.415
(I hope you don't criticize me)

1727
01:22:10.517 --> 01:22:12.487
You shouldn't do that, you bastard.

1728
01:22:12.829 --> 01:22:17.876
(You might regret it)

1729
01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:26.790
(When time passes, our
immature thought will too)

1730
01:22:28.204 --> 01:22:32.821
(But that will already be too late)

1731
01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:41.946
(Try to be in love where
you can give everything)

1732
01:22:43.342 --> 01:22:50.727
(Not the kind of love, where
you only receive love)

1733
01:22:51.174 --> 01:22:55.063
- (You already know...)
- (You were married once)

1734
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:58.735
- (This doesn't end)
- (Let's try loving again)

1735
01:22:58.837 --> 01:23:03.526
- (We both need to be patient)
- (You need to forget about her!)

1736
01:23:06.235 --> 01:23:09.837
- (I'm going to love again)
- Hello, this is the 9 o'clock news.

1737
01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:13.157
- (I'm going to love again)
- Again?

1738
01:23:13.337 --> 01:23:16.975
(I'll secretly love you...)

1739
01:23:17.561 --> 01:23:20.405
(without letting anyone know)

1740
01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:25.342
- (Please, watch over me)
- (Please, watch over me)

1741
01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:30.561
- (Please, watch over me)
- (Please, watch over me)

1742
01:23:31.866 --> 01:23:35.194
(A love that no one will know)

1743
01:23:35.952 --> 01:23:38.987
(A performance where the
emotions of two men can be felt)

1744
01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:42.139
(Really Men is satisfied with their chorus)

1745
01:23:43.648 --> 01:23:44.952
- Great!
- Thank you!

1746
01:23:45.561 --> 01:23:46.670
That was great.

1747
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:49.116
This must be competition for great duets.

1748
01:23:49.218 --> 01:23:51.350
Thank you for letting
us listen to your song.

1749
01:23:51.405 --> 01:23:53.717
(I'm going to love again!)

1750
01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:59.084
Now, are you guys sure
you're the best duet groups?

1751
01:23:59.163 --> 01:24:02.178
- Yes, we're sure!
- How many times do we need to tell you?

1752
01:24:02.343 --> 01:24:05.592
If you're confident that
you're the best duet groups...

1753
01:24:05.694 --> 01:24:09.061
I think his emcee skills are
similar to Kang Ho-dong.

1754
01:24:09.179 --> 01:24:12.623
This means you guys should know
everything about each other.

1755
01:24:12.671 --> 01:24:15.827
I know everything. I know
my friend so well...

1756
01:24:15.936 --> 01:24:20.694
I even know how many chopsticks,
spoons and bowls he has in his house.

1757
01:24:20.765 --> 01:24:22.583
You know how many spoons I have?

1758
01:24:22.608 --> 01:24:24.729
You had two, but now you only have one.

1759
01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.256
Just one pillow.

1760
01:24:26.515 --> 01:24:28.936
I bet you're taller than 6' 5", honey!

1761
01:24:29.104 --> 01:24:30.843
You're going to get it from me.

1762
01:24:31.265 --> 01:24:33.881
Who else would know you better than me?

1763
01:24:33.983 --> 01:24:36.592
- I'm going to get you.
- Are you okay, honey?

1764
01:24:36.999 --> 01:24:42.053
We'll start our first competition
on deciphering the best duet group.

1765
01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:47.131
The first game will tell us how much
each of you know one another.

1766
01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:51.944
Our first competition's name
is Duet Son Byeong-ho's Game.

1767
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.591
How do we play the game?

1768
01:24:54.616 --> 01:24:56.623
Each person will ask a question...

1769
01:24:56.686 --> 01:25:00.428
and if the question pertains to
you, you'll put down a finger.

1770
01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:03.802
If your partner puts down a
finger, you will do the same.

1771
01:25:03.827 --> 01:25:06.136
I hope you're ready
since the first team to...

1772
01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:08.469
put down all five fingers
will be penalized.

1773
01:25:08.507 --> 01:25:10.436
Please raise your hands!

1774
01:25:10.624 --> 01:25:12.362
We go at the same time, right?

1775
01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.600
(Let's go)

1776
01:25:14.452 --> 01:25:19.342
Put down a finger, if your combined
weight isn't over 400 pounds.

1777
01:25:21.296 --> 01:25:23.911
TVXQ put a finger down
and so did Play with Me.

1778
01:25:23.936 --> 01:25:25.217
Why aren't you putting a
finger down, Really Men?

1779
01:25:25.265 --> 01:25:27.147
- We surpass 400 pounds.
- That's right.

1780
01:25:27.249 --> 01:25:30.592
How do you two weigh over 400 pounds?
- I weigh 152.

1781
01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:36.069
- What about you? - I only need to
weight over 248 if he's 152 pounds.

1782
01:25:36.194 --> 01:25:37.389
Are you doubting him?

1783
01:25:37.444 --> 01:25:41.256
When I used to work out as an
athlete, I weighed over 254 pounds.

1784
01:25:41.507 --> 01:25:43.005
I weigh over 176 pounds.

1785
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:45.756
- Then, if you weigh more than 418...
- You're too late!

1786
01:25:45.921 --> 01:25:47.733
You're already too late.

1787
01:25:47.889 --> 01:25:50.889
- Next is Really Men.
- Really Men!

1788
01:25:51.311 --> 01:25:53.474
Put a finger down, if you have
one kid or more children.

1789
01:25:53.499 --> 01:25:55.272
We have nine kids.

1790
01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:59.162
According to our act, we have nine kids.

1791
01:25:59.225 --> 01:26:02.311
- Nine kids! - No, I meant in real-life!

1792
01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:04.365
You only have one kid in real life.

1793
01:26:04.522 --> 01:26:06.975
- We decided we had nine kids.
- No, that doesn't apply.

1794
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:09.295
- Put your fingers down together.
- You have two down.

1795
01:26:09.436 --> 01:26:12.030
Next, TVXQ will ask their question.

1796
01:26:12.327 --> 01:26:14.709
Put a finger down, if your face...

1797
01:26:16.272 --> 01:26:17.272
(Pausing)

1798
01:26:17.499 --> 01:26:18.834
is bigger than mine.

1799
01:26:18.991 --> 01:26:20.263
is bigger than mine.

1800
01:26:20.288 --> 01:26:21.754
Chang-min's is bigger than yours.

1801
01:26:21.779 --> 01:26:22.779
Let me say that again!

1802
01:26:22.905 --> 01:26:24.900
(Wait a second, time-out)

1803
01:26:24.968 --> 01:26:27.154
(He paused, but killed his
own team without hesitation)

1804
01:26:27.971 --> 01:26:29.623
(No second turns)

1805
01:26:29.999 --> 01:26:32.436
- It's over.
- We're TVXQ!

1806
01:26:32.561 --> 01:26:34.069
(What just happened here?)

1807
01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.647
- That's not what I meant.
- Let's move on.

1808
01:26:36.843 --> 01:26:38.537
Put your fingers down.

1809
01:26:38.936 --> 01:26:41.537
Next, let's move onto the next duet group.

1810
01:26:42.186 --> 01:26:45.217
Fold a finger if you've ever been married.

1811
01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:47.702
They need to fold their fingers too.

1812
01:26:48.171 --> 01:26:49.443
Fold your fingers, We're a Couple.

1813
01:26:49.468 --> 01:26:53.646
We're not putting our fingers down
because of me, but because of Soo-geun.

1814
01:26:53.671 --> 01:26:54.865
Let's just say that.

1815
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:57.311
It's not because of me.
Don't think that way.

1816
01:26:57.561 --> 01:27:00.303
We're folding our fingers
because of me and only me.

1817
01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.327
I bet you're single, honey.

1818
01:27:03.413 --> 01:27:05.451
Your turn again, We're a Couple.

1819
01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:09.592
Put a finger down if you weren't
born in Kyeongsang-dong.

1820
01:27:09.843 --> 01:27:10.843
Kyeongsang?

1821
01:27:11.249 --> 01:27:13.631
We're both from Masan and Ulsan.

1822
01:27:14.241 --> 01:27:15.459
Really Men?

1823
01:27:15.842 --> 01:27:17.459
Fold a finger if both of you are ugly.

1824
01:27:17.679 --> 01:27:19.255
Fold a finger if both of you are ugly.

1825
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.490
- Fold it! Fold it.
- No, I don't think so.

1826
01:27:21.515 --> 01:27:23.475
(Put a finger down, right now!)

1827
01:27:23.569 --> 01:27:25.707
(All the other teams agree)

1828
01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:28.643
Everyone agrees with us
that you're both ugly.

1829
01:27:29.257 --> 01:27:30.932
Put your finger down!

1830
01:27:31.333 --> 01:27:33.863
- Aren't I right about them being ugly?
- Yes!

1831
01:27:34.262 --> 01:27:36.660
I'm okay with one, but
both of us aren't ugly.

1832
01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.488
- You decide, Popeye - I think the
couple needs to put a finger down.

1833
01:27:41.903 --> 01:27:43.262
Good job!

1834
01:27:43.333 --> 01:27:45.973
Let's go, Popeye! Let's go, Popeye!

1835
01:27:46.411 --> 01:27:47.411
Popeye!

1836
01:27:48.090 --> 01:27:51.217
- The two of you...
- Do you want to say bye to me?

1837
01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:53.809
The couple only has one finger left.

1838
01:27:54.294 --> 01:27:55.294
One finger left.

1839
01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.184
It's time for you to ask, TVXQ.

1840
01:27:58.465 --> 01:27:59.465
I can go, right?

1841
01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.402
The couple only has one finger left.

1842
01:28:01.544 --> 01:28:03.301
Whose side will Chang-min choose?

1843
01:28:03.356 --> 01:28:04.895
- Yun-ho!
- Chang-min is for sure!

1844
01:28:04.989 --> 01:28:06.293
Chang-min!

1845
01:28:06.497 --> 01:28:08.942
Anyone with a wig, put a finger down.

1846
01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:11.713
Anyone with a wig, put a finger down.

1847
01:28:12.606 --> 01:28:16.270
If you have a wig on,
please put down a finger!

1848
01:28:16.364 --> 01:28:17.543
I don't have a wig on.

1849
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.262
We lost because of you.

1850
01:28:19.426 --> 01:28:21.486
Just as I thought, you really are the best.

1851
01:28:21.511 --> 01:28:25.824
If Yun-ho said it, he'd say, "Anyone
over 6' 5" put a finger down".

1852
01:28:25.856 --> 01:28:27.387
Chang-min began talking first.

1853
01:28:27.434 --> 01:28:28.800
I'm glad it was Chang-min instead of Yun-ho.

1854
01:28:28.825 --> 01:28:31.506
The two couple will receive
their penalty now.

1855
01:28:31.762 --> 01:28:33.926
You guys have wigs on too!

1856
01:28:34.083 --> 01:28:35.909
- We had a finger left.
- They had a finger left.

1857
01:28:35.934 --> 01:28:37.856
(Make a promise with me)

1858
01:28:38.317 --> 01:28:39.317
(Runs away)

1859
01:28:39.715 --> 01:28:41.057
I'm going to get you.

1860
01:28:41.239 --> 01:28:42.605
Where do you think you're going?

1861
01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:44.721
He might really rip you apart.

1862
01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:47.020
- Why did you mention wig?
- You look like a tiger.

1863
01:28:47.098 --> 01:28:49.324
Wait a second. I'll make
your hair into a wig.

1864
01:28:49.778 --> 01:28:52.520
Come here. I'll peel it
and put it right back.

1865
01:28:52.614 --> 01:28:54.723
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- I'll make you a wig.

1866
01:28:54.825 --> 01:28:56.346
Help me, Popeye!

1867
01:28:56.411 --> 01:29:01.176
Please, don't do that. Now, you
can choose any penalty you want.

1868
01:29:01.223 --> 01:29:04.035
You can have your partner
hit your bare back.

1869
01:29:04.255 --> 01:29:06.808
Two, your partner will
pull your hat string.

1870
01:29:06.833 --> 01:29:09.050
I'll do this and you can
get your back slapped.

1871
01:29:09.075 --> 01:29:10.457
- Okay.
- We'll do both.

1872
01:29:10.551 --> 01:29:13.113
I'll only hurt you as much as you hurt me.

1873
01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.145
- That's it, honey.
- Okay.

1874
01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:17.395
Do as you like. It doesn't matter.

1875
01:29:17.614 --> 01:29:21.426
When anyone starts to pull down
the string on these hats...

1876
01:29:21.559 --> 01:29:24.012
it feels like the string is going
to get embedded in my skin.

1877
01:29:24.114 --> 01:29:26.410
- It's scary.
- Doesn't it feel that way?

1878
01:29:27.078 --> 01:29:28.078
(Scared)

1879
01:29:28.103 --> 01:29:30.793
This is so funny. Why
am I so scared of this?

1880
01:29:32.942 --> 01:29:33.942
Isn't it strange?

1881
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:35.411
Get ready, honey.

1882
01:29:35.645 --> 01:29:37.543
- Here, honey.
- Don't go any further.

1883
01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:39.065
- Should I do it here?
- Yeah.

1884
01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:41.106
One, two, three!

1885
01:29:44.731 --> 01:29:45.731
(Stings)

1886
01:29:46.067 --> 01:29:47.332
Wow, that was pretty strong.

1887
01:29:47.637 --> 01:29:48.637
That was really loud.

1888
01:29:48.754 --> 01:29:50.592
Take it off, take it off.

1889
01:29:51.176 --> 01:29:52.701
(He gives up without a word)

1890
01:29:52.739 --> 01:29:56.168
It feels really shitty
getting hit like that.

1891
01:29:57.567 --> 01:29:58.879
Oh, my god.

1892
01:29:59.590 --> 01:30:02.436
What if his hand comes out of his stomach?

1893
01:30:03.833 --> 01:30:06.387
(He prepares the back
to improve the slap)

1894
01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:08.262
His hand might put a hole in his body.

1895
01:30:08.348 --> 01:30:10.121
Does anyone here have strong hands?

1896
01:30:10.395 --> 01:30:12.737
Chang-min! You show me
how passionate you are.

1897
01:30:12.762 --> 01:30:14.723
- Me? - Chang-min has strong hands.

1898
01:30:15.075 --> 01:30:17.764
Chang-min's finger-flick is even harder.

1899
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.880
Finger-flick.

1900
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:22.920
- This is going to hurt.
- You're putting water on your hands too?

1901
01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:24.465
What am I going to do?

1902
01:30:24.489 --> 01:30:26.074
Okay, I'm going to hit you.

1903
01:30:26.426 --> 01:30:29.850
- He should use a finger-flick.
- Your hand needs to stay on his back.

1904
01:30:31.879 --> 01:30:33.014
(Nice slap)

1905
01:30:34.919 --> 01:30:37.567
We clearly see his hand imprint!

1906
01:30:38.239 --> 01:30:39.850
Can you clean this up, please?

1907
01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.793
- Are you okay, honey?
- I'm okay.

1908
01:30:41.926 --> 01:30:44.059
- How's your neck, honey?
- It still stings.

1909
01:30:44.192 --> 01:30:46.494
It stings? It kind of still stings for me.

1910
01:30:46.802 --> 01:30:49.436
(Festival of the Best Duets)

1911
01:30:50.296 --> 01:30:53.225
(Special performance by
Play with Me: Superman)

1912
01:30:53.597 --> 01:30:55.330
(One, two, one, two)

1913
01:30:56.115 --> 01:30:58.232
(Pokes at the sky)

1914
01:30:59.706 --> 01:31:02.198
(A waste of their good-looks.
Play with Me is starting)

1915
01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:06.215
(Son! Can you protect the earth?)

1916
01:31:06.655 --> 01:31:08.482
(The choreography is spot-on)

1917
01:31:08.692 --> 01:31:13.098
(Father! Don't you worry)

1918
01:31:14.762 --> 01:31:19.598
(My charming points are my
blue tights and red underwear)

1919
01:31:20.325 --> 01:31:24.887
(I'll be running, running, running
while I save, save, save)

1920
01:31:25.051 --> 01:31:27.606
(I'll go around the world 12-times)

1921
01:31:27.684 --> 01:31:30.613
(I have big muscles and my hair
is combed back, I'm Superman)

1922
01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:33.824
(I'm Superman, the earth's friend)

1923
01:31:34.231 --> 01:31:37.973
(Very good-looking and has a
charisma for volunteering)

1924
01:31:38.067 --> 01:31:40.152
(My size is no joke)

1925
01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:43.442
(Anyways, I have bulging
muscles and I'm Superman)

1926
01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:46.590
(I'm Superman, the earth's friend)

1927
01:31:47.114 --> 01:31:50.339
(Please don't be fooled by counterfeits,
I have an "S" in my pentagon)

1928
01:31:50.364 --> 01:31:53.309
(It's 100% spandex from
top to bottom for me)

1929
01:31:55.018 --> 01:31:58.596
(A great performance that will continue
performances by "Butterfly Dreams")

1930
01:31:58.669 --> 01:32:01.574
Yes, Superman! That was Play with Me!

1931
01:32:03.537 --> 01:32:05.645
- Why would we perform?
- We need to!

1932
01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:07.715
This is our last special performance.

1933
01:32:07.965 --> 01:32:09.981
This performance will show...

1934
01:32:10.497 --> 01:32:13.682
happiness and affection during
bad times and good times.

1935
01:32:13.707 --> 01:32:15.338
Let go of me. I'll go.

1936
01:32:16.027 --> 01:32:18.231
Let's listen to "Couple" by We're a Couple!

1937
01:32:18.598 --> 01:32:21.283
Please greet them with a round of applause!

1938
01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:23.535
Let go of me! I'll walk by myself.

1939
01:32:23.809 --> 01:32:25.408
You'll have a hard time stepping down.

1940
01:32:25.505 --> 01:32:28.317
My goodness, let go of my hand.

1941
01:32:29.239 --> 01:32:30.871
Can you give us the music?

1942
01:32:31.122 --> 01:32:33.223
Your wife's body is...

1943
01:32:34.113 --> 01:32:36.592
- very skinny.
- I used to play volleyball.

1944
01:32:38.061 --> 01:32:39.584
(Nervous from being on TV)

1945
01:32:39.794 --> 01:32:44.098
We'll show how strong the
power a couple can be.

1946
01:32:44.512 --> 01:32:46.832
Are you ready, my love?

1947
01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:51.660
I hope you let everyone hear
how great your voice is.

1948
01:32:53.012 --> 01:32:55.924
If you're happy, then
show them you're happy.

1949
01:32:55.949 --> 01:32:58.794
Please express your love to everyone.

1950
01:32:59.114 --> 01:33:00.832
Now, three, four.

1951
01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.723
- (We lived our lives...)
- That's right.

1952
01:33:05.075 --> 01:33:06.723
(with only affection)

1953
01:33:08.144 --> 01:33:11.684
(All the years passed like a dream)

1954
01:33:14.356 --> 01:33:19.543
(Your beautiful face and beautiful eyes...)

1955
01:33:21.051 --> 01:33:23.988
(have wrinkles around them)

1956
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:27.387
You have more wrinkles, honey.
It hurts my feelings.

1957
01:33:27.661 --> 01:33:32.996
(I see the up and down
hills that we had to pass)

1958
01:33:34.153 --> 01:33:39.832
(You were my guiding lamp
because you were next to me)

1959
01:33:40.465 --> 01:33:44.770
(Honey, there's something
I'd like to say to you)

1960
01:33:45.098 --> 01:33:46.885
What would that be?

1961
01:33:47.106 --> 01:33:49.332
- (I love you)
- My goodness.

1962
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:53.176
- (I love you)
- Me too!

1963
01:33:56.848 --> 01:33:57.848
(Laughing)

1964
01:33:58.825 --> 01:33:59.825
(Screaming)

1965
01:34:00.567 --> 01:34:03.293
Please clap for us! My goodness!

1966
01:34:05.668 --> 01:34:06.840
That was great.

1967
01:34:07.817 --> 01:34:09.582
(Totally moved)

1968
01:34:09.919 --> 01:34:13.106
- Let go! - We have to go in together
if we did the finale together.

1969
01:34:13.317 --> 01:34:17.457
- Let go. - You could really feel
their love when they were singing.

1970
01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.082
- It was a beautiful performance. - I
think our 10th child might be made today.

1971
01:34:23.356 --> 01:34:24.713
I can feel the passion.

1972
01:34:24.738 --> 01:34:28.130
What do you think the goal
is for our great duet teams?

1973
01:34:28.364 --> 01:34:30.957
Don't you think it's to
walk on a bed of flowers...

1974
01:34:31.106 --> 01:34:33.449
by trusting and believing each other?

1975
01:34:33.606 --> 01:34:34.606
Bed of flowers!

1976
01:34:34.801 --> 01:34:39.129
That's why, it's now time to
see who has the best teamwork.

1977
01:34:39.543 --> 01:34:44.779
The last competition is walking on a bed
or flowers while giving a piggy-back ride!

1978
01:34:45.481 --> 01:34:47.121
Walking on a bed of flowers!

1979
01:34:47.559 --> 01:34:48.918
How do we play this game?

1980
01:34:49.044 --> 01:34:52.715
One person will be blind-folded and
put the other member on their back.

1981
01:34:53.098 --> 01:34:58.121
The team member on the back will give
instructions on how to where to walk.

1982
01:34:58.497 --> 01:35:01.853
Your goal is to ring the
bell at the end of the road.

1983
01:35:02.801 --> 01:35:04.714
They did a good job of making that.

1984
01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:07.074
My goodness, I think I can smell it.

1985
01:35:07.231 --> 01:35:09.043
Doesn't it seem like it would smell?

1986
01:35:09.223 --> 01:35:11.598
- That's what you like.
- It's very nice.

1987
01:35:11.973 --> 01:35:16.973
This isn't any poop. We'll deduct 10-points
as penalty if you step on the poop.

1988
01:35:17.325 --> 01:35:19.785
We'll deduct 1-point if
you step on a chicken.

1989
01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.371
You must complete this task in 60-seconds.

1990
01:35:23.481 --> 01:35:26.254
Seeing something is scary. It really
does seem like it would smell.

1991
01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:27.873
One, two, three.

1992
01:35:28.325 --> 01:35:30.215
You may start...

1993
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:33.238
- after you yell, "Challenge".
- Go to the left.

1994
01:35:33.348 --> 01:35:35.114
- Challenge.
- Go to the left.

1995
01:35:35.426 --> 01:35:38.238
Okay, let's go. One big step.

1996
01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:40.433
One big step.

1997
01:35:41.598 --> 01:35:42.598
One big step.

1998
01:35:45.516 --> 01:35:46.516
(Mushy)

1999
01:35:46.594 --> 01:35:48.184
Yun-ho just stepped in poop.

2000
01:35:48.387 --> 01:35:49.981
Left. Small step.

2001
01:35:50.231 --> 01:35:51.231
Just a bit.

2002
01:35:51.411 --> 01:35:52.411
Big step!

2003
01:35:54.465 --> 01:35:55.465
Left side.

2004
01:35:56.231 --> 01:35:57.774
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

2005
01:35:59.332 --> 01:36:01.395
All the chickens keep dying.

2006
01:36:01.473 --> 01:36:03.141
How sad. That's very sad.

2007
01:36:03.536 --> 01:36:04.536
Left side.

2008
01:36:04.903 --> 01:36:05.903
Left side.

2009
01:36:07.036 --> 01:36:09.719
- One small step.
- Do we lose if don't step on anything?

2010
01:36:09.926 --> 01:36:11.512
He stepped on poop and
chicken at the same time.

2011
01:36:11.559 --> 01:36:14.551
- It's pooped chicken.
- No, it's chicken poop.

2012
01:36:17.126 --> 01:36:18.519
He rang the bell!

2013
01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:21.738
- You're heavy.
- I feel like fried chicken now.

2014
01:36:21.856 --> 01:36:24.051
- Look.
- How did we do?

2015
01:36:25.628 --> 01:36:27.739
(Play with Me's total: -22 points)

2016
01:36:28.403 --> 01:36:32.496
When you're ready, please shout,
"Challenge" before you start.

2017
01:36:32.521 --> 01:36:33.521
We're ready!

2018
01:36:34.278 --> 01:36:35.809
Ready, go!

2019
01:36:35.895 --> 01:36:37.550
You can go, if I don't say anything.

2020
01:36:37.575 --> 01:36:38.575
Go, go, go.

2021
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:40.332
He's not lifting up his foot!

2022
01:36:40.458 --> 01:36:43.582
- You have to lift up your feet.
- Okay, lift your feet up.

2023
01:36:43.794 --> 01:36:45.190
You have to lift up your feet!

2024
01:36:45.215 --> 01:36:47.159
Lift up your feet, lift up your feet.

2025
01:36:47.184 --> 01:36:49.231
- Keep going.
- You need to lift up your feet.

2026
01:36:49.512 --> 01:36:51.223
Just step on everything and go.

2027
01:36:51.622 --> 01:36:55.104
You usually go straight anyways. He's
not stepping on any poop! Just chicken!

2028
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:56.610
He's almost there!

2029
01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:59.270
Put your hand out. We're at the bell.

2030
01:36:59.450 --> 01:37:02.684
Go down a bit. More, more.
It's towards your left.

2031
01:37:02.801 --> 01:37:04.496
Go down more. A bit to the right.

2032
01:37:04.653 --> 01:37:07.621
- You'll knock over the bell soon.
- Where is it? - In front of you.

2033
01:37:07.903 --> 01:37:10.043
- Ring it. Good.
- He rang the bell.

2034
01:37:10.294 --> 01:37:12.395
- How did we do?
- The chicken was hurt by you.

2035
01:37:12.528 --> 01:37:13.910
How did we do?

2036
01:37:14.323 --> 01:37:16.703
(Really Men's' total: -15-point)

2037
01:37:17.606 --> 01:37:19.032
One, two, three.

2038
01:37:20.755 --> 01:37:22.520
We weigh pretty much the same.

2039
01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:23.630
Ready!

2040
01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:24.965
- Straight, straight.
- Go straight?

2041
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:26.777
- Ready...
- A bit to the right. - Start!

2042
01:37:26.926 --> 01:37:29.238
One step at a time. Go slowly. Good.

2043
01:37:29.395 --> 01:37:30.395
Step on all the chicken.

2044
01:37:30.637 --> 01:37:33.106
You have to go toward the right side.

2045
01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:35.082
What the heck?

2046
01:37:35.692 --> 01:37:37.844
- Can he see?
- Just step on everything.

2047
01:37:37.997 --> 01:37:38.997
Right there.

2048
01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:41.457
Go, go, go. Just keep going straight.

2049
01:37:41.833 --> 01:37:44.274
Right side, right side. This way. Good.

2050
01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:47.309
Right side, right side. This way. Good.

2051
01:37:47.426 --> 01:37:49.652
Right side. Can't you be funny?

2052
01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:52.293
Honey! I just keep stepping on poop.

2053
01:37:53.044 --> 01:37:54.044
Right side.

2054
01:37:54.598 --> 01:37:56.653
Go ahead, just keep stepping on it.

2055
01:37:56.856 --> 01:37:58.950
Be funny by stepping on them!

2056
01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:04.422
Go that way!

2057
01:38:05.309 --> 01:38:06.886
- That way!
- Give good directions!

2058
01:38:06.911 --> 01:38:08.473
You need to come inside the track.

2059
01:38:08.498 --> 01:38:09.745
Which way is, that way?

2060
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:11.707
Go that way! Turn around!

2061
01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:14.449
- What's, that way?
- Not, that way!

2062
01:38:15.247 --> 01:38:18.020
- My goodness!
- I can't see in front of me!

2063
01:38:18.833 --> 01:38:19.833
This way!

2064
01:38:20.106 --> 01:38:21.746
Which way is, this way?

2065
01:38:22.137 --> 01:38:24.262
Tell me right or left!

2066
01:38:24.575 --> 01:38:26.387
Yes, go forward.

2067
01:38:27.035 --> 01:38:29.559
Go forward. Good. Turn around.

2068
01:38:29.973 --> 01:38:32.637
Okay, go. It's over there!

2069
01:38:33.169 --> 01:38:34.817
I stepped on poop again.

2070
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:36.977
That way. Hold on a second.

2071
01:38:37.387 --> 01:38:39.496
Hold on. Go that way.

2072
01:38:40.926 --> 01:38:42.254
He rang the bell.

2073
01:38:42.442 --> 01:38:44.020
You're so heavy.

2074
01:38:44.535 --> 01:38:46.637
You're so strong, honey.

2075
01:38:47.082 --> 01:38:49.301
(We're a Couple's total: -30-points)

2076
01:38:50.122 --> 01:38:51.856
I'll go bare-feet.

2077
01:38:52.825 --> 01:38:55.223
- The perfect guy!
- Passionate!

2078
01:38:55.387 --> 01:38:58.012
- Yun-ho doesn't have any fear.
- Your jacket.

2079
01:38:59.762 --> 01:39:02.457
Should we see if we can
light that jacket on fire?

2080
01:39:02.551 --> 01:39:03.551
Go away!

2081
01:39:04.754 --> 01:39:05.754
(Searching)

2082
01:39:05.864 --> 01:39:09.231
Where's the watch? I haven't
seen his watch for a while.

2083
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:13.395
- Maybe I should've gone your back.
- Ho-dong probably weighs 230.

2084
01:39:13.856 --> 01:39:14.856
Get ready!

2085
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:16.590
- Ready!
- Okay.

2086
01:39:16.661 --> 01:39:18.246
- Let's go!
- Passion!

2087
01:39:19.309 --> 01:39:20.856
Ready, go!

2088
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:23.231
Ready, go!

2089
01:39:23.997 --> 01:39:26.742
Left foot, left foot.
Geez, we just started.

2090
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:29.477
Left foot, left foot.
Geez, we just started.

2091
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:31.434
Take one big step forward.

2092
01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:33.065
(Soo-geun starts as well)

2093
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:34.090
Oh, no!

2094
01:39:35.606 --> 01:39:38.683
Go slowly, Yun-ho. You'll hurt
your feet if you go too fast.

2095
01:39:38.708 --> 01:39:40.524
A big right foot forward.

2096
01:39:40.731 --> 01:39:42.598
Step diagonally. Just a bit.

2097
01:39:45.051 --> 01:39:46.051
(Mushy)

2098
01:39:47.512 --> 01:39:49.277
This doesn't feel good.

2099
01:39:49.458 --> 01:39:52.356
A big step forward. A big
step with your right foot.

2100
01:39:52.637 --> 01:39:53.637
Go forward.

2101
01:39:53.989 --> 01:39:55.680
(Cocka-doodle-doo)

2102
01:39:55.919 --> 01:39:58.559
- What the heck?
- Go at it with passion.

2103
01:39:59.317 --> 01:40:00.317
Okay, okay.

2104
01:40:00.458 --> 01:40:03.102
Go to the left diagonally. Diagonally.

2105
01:40:06.566 --> 01:40:10.081
- Are you sure you're doing this right?
- Yes, we're good. Keep going.

2106
01:40:10.106 --> 01:40:12.067
No, Yun-ho. Turn a bit.

2107
01:40:12.255 --> 01:40:14.176
We need to turn around.

2108
01:40:14.247 --> 01:40:16.551
- Turn around?
- Yeah, turn around. - Like this?

2109
01:40:16.598 --> 01:40:18.348
Turn a bit to the right.

2110
01:40:18.872 --> 01:40:21.629
Turn diagonally to the left again.

2111
01:40:21.872 --> 01:40:24.016
- Diagonally to the front?
- Yeah.

2112
01:40:24.536 --> 01:40:26.629
You went over it, you went over.

2113
01:40:27.161 --> 01:40:28.352
Here?

2114
01:40:28.377 --> 01:40:30.887
- Here? - That's right.
- This doesn't feel right!

2115
01:40:31.067 --> 01:40:32.067
No, no. I'm right.

2116
01:40:32.364 --> 01:40:33.809
- This is right?
- Yes, you're doing great.

2117
01:40:33.864 --> 01:40:34.864
Really?

2118
01:40:34.965 --> 01:40:37.183
But, why is it taking so
much longer than I thought?

2119
01:40:37.208 --> 01:40:39.456
- It's a lot harder than I thought.
- Really?

2120
01:40:39.481 --> 01:40:41.594
He's not stepping on anything.

2121
01:40:42.278 --> 01:40:44.043
That's right.

2122
01:40:44.442 --> 01:40:46.184
- This is odd.
- Go forward.

2123
01:40:46.356 --> 01:40:48.026
(Reaping what he has sown)

2124
01:40:48.051 --> 01:40:49.051
We're done.

2125
01:40:49.403 --> 01:40:51.770
- He's amazing.
- What the heck?

2126
01:40:52.754 --> 01:40:55.043
What the heck did you guys do?

2127
01:40:55.512 --> 01:40:57.707
What's all this?

2128
01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.184
- You're so cool.
- Your passion won.

2129
01:41:02.403 --> 01:41:04.438
Your passion won the competition.

2130
01:41:04.737 --> 01:41:06.582
(TVXQ's total: -124-points)

2131
01:41:07.255 --> 01:41:08.457
Now...

2132
01:41:09.145 --> 01:41:10.473
I will announce

2133
01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.785
our best duet team!

2134
01:41:13.098 --> 01:41:15.004
Total points!

2135
01:41:15.278 --> 01:41:17.512
- Stop it.
- The winning team is...

2136
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:19.176
Stop holding my hand!

2137
01:41:20.794 --> 01:41:25.199
With a total of 200-points, it's TVXQ!

2138
01:41:26.919 --> 01:41:27.919
(We did it)

2139
01:41:29.458 --> 01:41:34.348
With the most amount of point, TVXQ is
the winner of all the best duet teams!

2140
01:41:34.778 --> 01:41:36.949
What did they do to earn 200-points?

2141
01:41:37.176 --> 01:41:40.027
What the heck? How as this judged?

2142
01:41:40.075 --> 01:41:42.559
We'll listen to TVXQ's encore...

2143
01:41:42.715 --> 01:41:47.449
as winners of Popeye's Celebration
of the Best Duet Teams!

2144
01:41:50.114 --> 01:41:52.275
Is this their new song?

2145
01:41:52.687 --> 01:41:54.954
(Ending performance: TVXQ's "Why")

2146
01:41:55.088 --> 01:41:58.208
TVXQ never gets tired. They
don't run out of energy.

2147
01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:00.215
Passion forever.

2148
01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:06.260
(Why, did you leave me so easily?)

2149
01:42:06.974 --> 01:42:09.533
(Why, did I look so easy to you?)

2150
01:42:10.232 --> 01:42:13.200
(Why, was my heart ripped apart?)

2151
01:42:13.776 --> 01:42:15.836
They're no joke. They're going crazy.

2152
01:42:16.088 --> 01:42:18.735
(If you were all my dreams...)

2153
01:42:19.623 --> 01:42:22.036
(and I could hold onto everything...)

2154
01:42:22.564 --> 01:42:25.211
(I hope you're happy)

2155
01:42:30.651 --> 01:42:33.557
- Good job, everyone!
- You too! Respect, respect.

2156
01:42:34.808 --> 01:42:38.407
(A deciding match has found
its way to our school)

2157
01:42:38.898 --> 01:42:43.211
(The two can't avoid this battle)

2158
01:42:46.227 --> 01:42:47.965
(Ignores one another)

2159
01:42:48.416 --> 01:42:49.778
He has his hair up!

2160
01:42:50.096 --> 01:42:51.760
Don't I look taller when
you're walking toward me?

2161
01:42:51.862 --> 01:42:53.939
I think I could win you.

2162
01:42:54.135 --> 01:42:55.352
My pride is hurt.

2163
01:42:55.377 --> 01:42:58.174
How come your face sizes are so different?

2164
01:42:58.432 --> 01:43:00.458
What happened to your body?

2165
01:43:01.128 --> 01:43:02.128
(Screaming)

2166
01:43:02.573 --> 01:43:05.470
I heard I could be a regular
if you put a deposit down.

2167
01:43:05.495 --> 01:43:06.495
Come here.

2168
01:43:06.838 --> 01:43:09.728
- How do I look sitting here?
- You don't look bad.

2169
01:43:09.885 --> 01:43:12.713
- Yeon-soo is so pretty.
- Thank you, Hee-chul.

2170
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:14.627
- That's nice.
- He's still got moves.

2171
01:43:14.737 --> 01:43:16.689
Try and guess the answers, Jung-soo.

2172
01:43:16.799 --> 01:43:19.126
Why did she call me when there's
so many other guys here?

2173
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:20.626
Did you already eat, Yeon-soo?

2174
01:43:20.651 --> 01:43:22.743
(Everyone is interested in Yeon-soo)

2175
01:43:22.768 --> 01:43:25.611
- What are you doing?
- You don't need to do that.

2176
01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:28.986
Yeong-cheol! Did you wait long?

2177
01:43:29.073 --> 01:43:30.073
What am I going to do?

2178
01:43:30.221 --> 01:43:31.912
What the heck is going on?

2179
01:43:31.987 --> 01:43:32.987
(Running away)

2180
01:43:33.143 --> 01:43:34.713
The sinner is the person, who likes it.

2181
01:43:34.901 --> 01:43:36.141
Wasn't that a good line?

2182
01:43:36.166 --> 01:43:39.732
I might be interested in someone,
but I can't contact them.

2183
01:43:40.651 --> 01:43:42.775
He's like a love professor.

2184
01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:46.775
Everyone becomes like
me when they get hurt.

2185
01:43:47.291 --> 01:43:48.595
(Let me wipe away the tears)

2186
01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:49.783
ESBN!

2187
01:43:49.808 --> 01:43:53.081
Exciting Saturday, Burning Night! Yoo-hoo!

2188
01:43:53.151 --> 01:43:55.533
(Don't miss Ask Us Anything
on Saturday nights at 8:50)

2189
01:43:55.643 --> 01:43:58.227
She could cut it if she
doesn't want to go further.

2190
01:43:58.252 --> 01:44:00.157
- She's aggressive.
- They don't look good together.

2191
01:44:00.182 --> 01:44:03.041
- She's going all the way?
- I can't watch this any longer.

2192
01:44:03.104 --> 01:44:04.783
Why did you do that?

2193
01:44:04.807 --> 01:44:06.807
