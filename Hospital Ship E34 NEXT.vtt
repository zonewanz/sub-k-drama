1
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.189
Or was it someone else who did it?

2
00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.430
No. No, it wasn't.

3
00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.699
I did the suction.

4
00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.070
Is that true?

5
00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.899
Why are you hesitating instead of explaining then?

6
00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.790
We may summon you again...

7
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.959
if we need to during the investigation.

8
00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.860
Besides the problem during the suction,

9
00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.699
it's a crime that you did the surgery without...

10
00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.199
her parent's consent.

11
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.169
The problem is...

12
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.040
There's another problem?

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.910
I'm a surgeon, not an OBGYN specialist. So...

14
00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:08.440
So what?

15
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.450
I have never performed a cesarean before.

16
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.619
This is your first time?

17
00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.660
Will you still entrust me with your daughter's life?

18
00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.060
I can't operate without your consent.

19
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.330
I clearly explained it to her.

20
00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.099
I explained all the risks...

21
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.599
without exaggerating or understating.

22
00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.239
Please do it.

23
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.250
My daughter and grandchild.

24
00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.720
Please save them.

25
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.390
I clearly got her consent.

26
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.550
Then why?

27
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.040
Mrs. Hwang.

28
00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.439
Mrs. Hwang, please listen to me.

29
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.480
- I don't want to. - I have something to say to you.

30
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.409
We have nothing to say.

31
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.610
How are you feeling?

32
00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.420
I'm sorry that your baby is in a critical condition.

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.489
But the pediatricians and I...

34
00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.559
will do our best for your child's recovery.

35
00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.260
- I said we have nothing to say. - I just need...

36
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.860
to check a few things.

37
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.869
- No. Please don't. - I won't take up much of your time.

38
00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.070
Mrs. Hwang.

39
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.279
Before the surgery,

40
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.209
didn't I ask for your consent?

41
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.119
I clearly said I'm a surgeon, not an OBGYN.

42
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.559
Don't you remember it?

43
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.559
I don't know. I don't remember hearing it.

44
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.300
- Mrs. Hwang. - Stop.

45
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.600
Stop badgering my mom.

46
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.469
We have nothing to say to you.

47
00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.540
Also, our lawyer told us not to speak with you.

48
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.480
Your lawyer?

49
00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.380
You hired a lawyer?

50
00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.559
Doctor Song Eun Jae.

51
00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:40.399
I'm Jo Seong Min, a lawyer.

52
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.869
You met Ms. Hwang In Kyung, right?

53
00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:45.969
And?

54
00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.570
Please don't bother my client anymore.

55
00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.110
Contact me if you need to talk to her.

56
00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.980
I'm her legal representative.

57
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.740
It's me.

58
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.469
Where are you? Still at the police station?

59
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.479
No, I'm done with the inquiry. I'm at the hospital now.

60
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.649
Hospital? Are you working at the ER tonight?

61
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.380
- No. - Why did you go there then?

62
00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.149
I just needed to check something.

63
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.890
Wait for me then. I'll be right there.

64
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.959
Okay.

65
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.070
"Law firm"?

66
00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:59.940
(Pureun Law Firm)

67
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.149
"The leading law firm of Geoje".

68
00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:07.919
It is a local firm.

69
00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.890
(Jo Seong Min, a specialist in labor law)

70
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.190
"Labor law"?

71
00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.029
Why is a labor law specialist...

72
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.830
handling a medical lawsuit?

73
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.140
(Pureun, Jo Seong Min)

74
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.640
(Lawyer Jo Seong Min legally represents Doosung Heavy Industries)

75
00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.209
Their lawyer is...

76
00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:41.120
someone related to Doosung Group?

77
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.930
Did you wait long?

78
00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.260
No.

79
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.899
- You must be tired. - I'm hungry.

80
00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.500
Do you want to go to eat something good?

81
00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.200
I know what I want to eat.

82
00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:04.570
You picked the food yourself?

83
00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:06.539
A person can change.

84
00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.120
A senior citizen sitting in front of a computer...

85
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.049
measures her blood pressure and blood sugar level...

86
00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:19.789
by herself with a device.

87
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.029
(Your results have been sent.)

88
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:27.560
She sends the measured data to the doctor she wants,

89
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.299
and the doctor consults with her through a video call.

90
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.130
Have you been taking your medicine regularly?

91
00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:33.969
I've been taking my blood pressure medicine.

92
00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:36.409
I don't think you need any other medicine.

93
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.240
Do you have any other problems?

94
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.909
(Seo Soon Ae)

95
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.339
- Isn't this nice? - Yes.

96
00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.479
- It's easy, right? - Yes, it's easy.

97
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:44.779
Goodness.

98
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.719
That's some amazing editing.

99
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.890
Doesn't she look like a real expert?

100
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.060
- She isn't? - My goodness.

101
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.529
Are you naive or stupid?

102
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.729
Ms. Seo Soon Ae can't even use a remote control.

103
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.070
How could she use a laptop?

104
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.570
It looks like she's measuring her own...

105
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.469
blood pressure and blood sugar.

106
00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.440
If they were able to do that,

107
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.479
why would Hyun stay up all night helping them on the phone?

108
00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:15.979
You have a point.

109
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.880
Let's say that by some miracle the elderly learned what to do.

110
00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:24.349
Can we efficiently diagnose patients with that system?

111
00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:25.349
We can't.

112
00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:28.219
Why are they pushing for the remote medical service?

113
00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.289
The whole province is promoting it.

114
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.430
- There must someone behind it. - Like who?

115
00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:39.370
Someone who wants to use health to make money.

116
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.599
Someone who wants to use health to make money?

117
00:07:49.109 --> 00:07:52.549
- Go ahead and eat. - Yes, sir.

118
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.719
Hello, Director Kim.

119
00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:58.320
Did I make you wait?

120
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.520
No, sir, I just got here.

121
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.190
Come on, sit.

122
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.859
- Madam Han. - Yes?

123
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.729
Two oyster soups.

124
00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:09.370
Some fresh and grilled oysters too.

125
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.469
Sure.

126
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:13.899
Business must be good these days.

127
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.599
You serve less food.

128
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:18.339
Don't say that, sir.

129
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.709
He's a very special guest, so treat him well.

130
00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:25.279
Don't you worry. Come over more often.

131
00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:31.319
Do you eat here often?

132
00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.159
I started coming here since...

133
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.960
Doosung Construction broke ground.

134
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.760
That was 30 years ago.

135
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.000
You lead one of Korea's largest companies,

136
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
yet you are so humble.

137
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.399
You have my respect.

138
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.439
Merchants like me don't command respect. That's something...

139
00:08:49.439 --> 00:08:51.740
doctors like you are more deserving of.

140
00:08:52.809 --> 00:08:56.380
Nothing is more revered than treating human lives.

141
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.210
Thank you, sir.

142
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.149
Since we're on the topic...

143
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.689
- Yes? - I heard there was...

144
00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:07.919
an incident at your hospital.

145
00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:09.730
What incident?

146
00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:11.260
You know,

147
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.829
Doctor Song Eun Jae, whom I recently saw.

148
00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:16.329
Yes.

149
00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:18.970
Criminal charges were brought against her.

150
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:23.210
- That issue is... - I also heard that...

151
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.510
she operated on a patient without the guardian's permission.

152
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.380
- She says different. - I'm sure she does.

153
00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:34.350
Even the dead make excuses from the grave.

154
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.689
I strongly dislike disruptions.

155
00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:40.659
This happened...

156
00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:44.689
less than a week after we signed the MOU.

157
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.799
Now I have serious doubts as to whether...

158
00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:51.470
I should invest in your hospital.

159
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.000
Sir.

160
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.470
I know you're a cautious person.

161
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:59.169
I trust you will make the right decision.

162
00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:06.520
Wow, it smells amazing.

163
00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:12.419
Let's taste it.

164
00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:18.630
Yes, this is it.

165
00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:23.069
Eat up.

166
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.189
- Get me one. - Okay.

167
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.319
What's this?

168
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.360
What does this mean?

169
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.460
What is it?

170
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.169
"Base of the remote medical service"?

171
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.010
If Jeil Hospital becomes the base for the remote medical service,

172
00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:43.649
does that mean your dad is using health...

173
00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:45.179
to make a profit too?

174
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.130
Hi, what is it?

175
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.000
The remote medical service.

176
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.130
Don't you know how dangerous that is?

177
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.100
- We'll reduce the risk. - How?

178
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.240
I told the chiefs to find a way.

179
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240
Dad.

180
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.710
Nothing you can say will make me change my mind.

181
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.750
So get out.

182
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.720
- Is it about the money? - I need to save the ER.

183
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.480
It could kill the hospital ship.

184
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.520
Patients will die on the street if we close our ER.

185
00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:29.730
If you...

186
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.029
had to choose between our ER...

187
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.000
and the hospital ship, which would it be?

188
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.100
This isn't a matter of choice.

189
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.600
It is a matter of choice.

190
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.210
Nothing in this world can satisfy both sides.

191
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.880
In the future,

192
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:50.980
you will have to make many more such cruel decisions.

193
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.120
You are now a member of our board.

194
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.350
Dad.

195
00:12:56.289 --> 00:12:57.949
How old are you?

196
00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.860
You're in your 30s.

197
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.990
Stop acting like a child.

198
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.829
Watch and learn.

199
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:06.059
This is what it means to be an adult.

200
00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:36.590
You wanted ramyeon? Out of all things?

201
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.299
Don't say that. Ramyeon is delicious.

202
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.039
No, don't add too much water.

203
00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:47.539
It'll taste bland.

204
00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:52.010
Don't cook it for too long or it'll get soggy.

205
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.610
You nag more than I do.

206
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.419
It looks delicious.

207
00:14:14.443 --> 00:14:17.675
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 34 Hospital Ship "I Got Their Consent"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

208
00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:30.250
Why aren't you eating?

209
00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:32.819
What are you staring at?

210
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.149
Take your time.

211
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.819
Were you that hungry?

212
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:47.159
I was...

213
00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.329
really hungry that day.

214
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.500
Which day?

215
00:14:56.539 --> 00:14:59.439
My first day on the hospital ship.

216
00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.679
(Oh Hye Jung)

217
00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:12.890
I read the entry you'd made in my mom's chart...

218
00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:16.960
and finally saw how sick she had been.

219
00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:29.140
As I sat there alone,

220
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.039
I felt like my heart would explode.

221
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.510
It drove me insane.

222
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.649
I felt so sorry for my mom...

223
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.220
and I missed her.

224
00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:13.620
Do you know what the funny thing was?

225
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.250
Just then, my stomach made a huge rumbling sound.

226
00:16:23.789 --> 00:16:25.429
My mom had died so suddenly.

227
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.929
I lost my job at the hospital.

228
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.799
The operating room was a mess.

229
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.399
You're right.

230
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.510
Most people in that situation wouldn't care about food.

231
00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:43.010
But I was so hungry.

232
00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:49.750
I found a packet of ramyeon that someone had left.

233
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:53.159
Did you cook it?

234
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.789
No.

235
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.189
I couldn't find the power button to the electric stove.

236
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.000
I ate it raw.

237
00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:02.600
With the powder.

238
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.170
That's so sad.

239
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.410
Unfamiliar and awkward.

240
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.309
I felt unwelcome.

241
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.180
That wasn't so long ago,

242
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.279
but that day...

243
00:17:23.889 --> 00:17:25.549
feels like a distant past.

244
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.289
Why?

245
00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.829
Because you feel at home on the hospital ship?

246
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.760
And you have a boyfriend who's willing to cook for you at any time?

247
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.539
I think...

248
00:17:47.139 --> 00:17:48.440
I'll have to...

249
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.079
stop coming on board the hospital ship.

250
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.750
What?

251
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.389
What did you say?

252
00:18:02.389 --> 00:18:03.490
I have to...

253
00:18:04.629 --> 00:18:06.000
get off the ship.

254
00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:07.799
What do you mean?

255
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.270
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.569
I didn't keep my promise.

257
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.240
I told the police...

258
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.039
I suctioned the baby's airway.

259
00:18:21.879 --> 00:18:22.910
What?

260
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.379
That's the story you should go with.

261
00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:26.819
Why'd you do that?

262
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:29.490
That way...

263
00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:32.420
we can protect the ship.

264
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.799
(Didn't she get fired from another hospital for similar reasons?)

265
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.329
The negativity from the news...

266
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.970
is now targeting our ship.

267
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.839
If this is true,

268
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.010
our hospital ship is a dangerous place...

269
00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:53.680
where a psychopathic doctor wields a scalpel...

270
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.480
without a guardian's consent.

271
00:18:56.779 --> 00:18:58.150
That's not all.

272
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.150
What if the town council complains we wasted our budget?

273
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.690
When did we waste our budget?

274
00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.920
We operate on people for free.

275
00:19:07.089 --> 00:19:08.920
That's the first thing they'll say.

276
00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:10.930
People are already saying that.

277
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.160
"Will the hospital ship take out my appendix for free?"

278
00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.099
"You're wasting tax dollars."

279
00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:18.170
"Stop treating people for free."

280
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.569
Do people say that?

281
00:19:19.569 --> 00:19:21.069
Most of them do.

282
00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:24.839
Our governor's having a field day.

283
00:19:25.569 --> 00:19:26.839
He might actually...

284
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.809
decide to put us out of commission.

285
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.819
Put us out of commission?

286
00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:35.180
That's just wrong.

287
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.450
We all know that.

288
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.359
We need to come up with a plan.

289
00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:43.059
What's our plan.

290
00:19:43.889 --> 00:19:46.299
Say something, will you?

291
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.970
It's a cruel thing to say,

292
00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:53.099
but right now,

293
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.440
we need one person to make a sacrifice.

294
00:19:56.839 --> 00:19:58.170
One person?

295
00:19:59.109 --> 00:20:00.379
Who's that?

296
00:20:00.379 --> 00:20:01.579
Do you mean...

297
00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:03.779
Doctor Song?

298
00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:06.879
Is there...

299
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.920
any other way?

300
00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.059
Do you want to see our ship get wrecked?

301
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.029
Oh, my goodness.

302
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.639
Doosung Group will do all it can...

303
00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:29.440
to put us out of service.

304
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.609
We can't afford to give them a reason to.

305
00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:36.379
As of right now,

306
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.420
my resigning from the team...

307
00:20:40.879 --> 00:20:42.150
is the best solution.

308
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.589
They will lose traction...

309
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.319
once they have no reason to attack.

310
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.589
Doctor Song.

311
00:20:49.589 --> 00:20:52.359
Someone has to stay and protect the crew.

312
00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:55.799
If you fail,

313
00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:59.569
all the patients you looked after...

314
00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:02.809
will be forced to use the remote service.

315
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.980
You know better than anyone how dangerous that system is.

316
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.010
Can you handle that?

317
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.750
Give me time.

318
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.750
Two days.

319
00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:21.460
Just one. I need time to think.

320
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.889
Let's make the decision then.

321
00:21:25.389 --> 00:21:26.430
Doctor Kwak.

322
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.500
Please.

323
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.410
Lee Jang Shik.

324
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.410
Lee Jang Shik, come in.

325
00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:41.379
Sit over there.

326
00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:47.779
You can't skip your medication.

327
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.349
Do you think I want to?

328
00:21:51.589 --> 00:21:55.220
I can't help it that I'm so forgetful.

329
00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:56.789
Kim Soon Deok.

330
00:21:58.389 --> 00:22:00.529
Don't eat just anything because it's good for you.

331
00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:03.400
Your liver count went up.

332
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.200
I have no choice. I feel so weak.

333
00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.670
I'll eat anything...

334
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.809
that will give me energy.

335
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.309
I told you to stop pricking the blisters with a toothpick.

336
00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:18.980
If this gets infected, you might end up losing your foot.

337
00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.349
Cure me so that I'll stop having blisters.

338
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.990
You're diabetic. You must watch your blood sugar.

339
00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:27.819
Take your medicine...

340
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.029
and avoid sweet or salty foods.

341
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.000
And apply lotion to keep your skin moist.

342
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:34.629
If I can remember to.

343
00:22:35.829 --> 00:22:37.470
I'll apply a bandage.

344
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.809
There you go.

345
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.309
We're done. You can come down.

346
00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:56.049
Thank you.

347
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.789
Goodbye.

348
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.240
Hello.

349
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.450
Do you remember me?

350
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.480
It's tough, I know.

351
00:24:07.889 --> 00:24:09.289
Did I do something...

352
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:12.730
to make things worse for you?

353
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.700
(Kim Han Sol)

354
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.700
Kim Han Sol.

355
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.910
You have a name now.

356
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.309
Be strong, Han Sol.

357
00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:28.910
You're tiny,

358
00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:32.650
but you fought alongside us.

359
00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:34.819
You clung onto life...

360
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.589
and kept on fighting.

361
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.720
That's how you came into the world.

362
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.990
Please fight.

363
00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:48.599
Just one more time.

364
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.230
This place...

365
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.400
Our world...

366
00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:57.369
can be horribly tough,

367
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.039
but still,

368
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.809
it's a place worth living.

369
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.650
There are...

370
00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:14.619
some great things too.

371
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.270
(NICU)

372
00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:30.670
Did you see the baby?

373
00:25:33.879 --> 00:25:35.339
Her name is Han Sol.

374
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.379
What will you do?

375
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.579
We must...

376
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.750
protect the ship.

377
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.069
(Geoje Police Station)

378
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.819
Detective Kim?

379
00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:14.150
Yes.

380
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.920
I'm Doctor Kwak Hyun from the hospital ship.

381
00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:19.420
Why did you want to see me?

382
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.789
Hwang In Kyung.

383
00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.859
Some facts about her cesarean need...

384
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.099
to be straightened out.

385
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.230
I'm here...

386
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.069
to straighten out the facts.

387
00:26:59.129 --> 00:27:00.599
(Hospital Ship)

388
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.129
Are you okay if the hospital ship closes?

389
00:27:03.129 --> 00:27:05.470
Telling the truth to the patients and their guardian.

390
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.839
I can't neglect such duty.

391
00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:08.500
The public believes the press.

392
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.210
Were you afraid that the hospital would lose its reputation?

393
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.579
My baby is sick because of you.

394
00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:14.779
Starting today,

395
00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:16.980
you will no longer work in the ER.

396
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.010
I tried my best to smile,

397
00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:21.549
but it doesn't help me.

398
00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:24.250
Don't try to fight alone from now on.
