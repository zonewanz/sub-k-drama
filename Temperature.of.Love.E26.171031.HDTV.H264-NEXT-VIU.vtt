00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.250
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.129
The overall balance is good.

3
00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.500
Above all, it's delicious.

4
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:30.500
I also think the food is exceptional.

5
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.410
But I'd like it to be a bit more familiar.

6
00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.639
If it's okay with Chef On,

7
00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.410
it'll be good to devise a menu together.

8
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.150
We'll have to make adjustments,

9
00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.679
but I'd love to know how a Michelin three star dish really tastes.

10
00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:16.450
Chef Eric Song, clear!

11
00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.189
- Yes! - Nice!

12
00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.120
Chef.

13
00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:25.559
Mr. Park wants to see you.

14
00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:41.809
How was the food?

15
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.380
It was delicious.

16
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.609
But I'm not sure if the menu I create...

17
00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.450
will melt into a course like this.

18
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.960
Chef Song will make a few recipes.

19
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.399
This is too much.

20
00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.440
A full course meal has a story, a consistency.

21
00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.570
You can't meddle with my cooking.

22
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.940
It's a suggestion from the third consultation.

23
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.480
I can put up with anything except for my menu being changed.

24
00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.310
Your restaurant is losing money because you're too emotional.

25
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.679
Eric is a Michelin three star chef.

26
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.649
He says he'll devise a menu...

27
00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.820
because he likes your dish.

28
00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:30.459
Don't be arrogant.

29
00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.560
Launch the new menu he comes up with.

30
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.030
Promoting that will help with the sales.

31
00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.560
I opened a restaurant to cook my dishes.

32
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.230
I'm not trying to make money by copying others.

33
00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.970
If the reality doesn't support you, you need to compromise.

34
00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.040
I'll give you back your share,

35
00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.079
so don't get involved in my business.

36
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.380
Won't you regret this?

37
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.389
Management isn't an easy job.

38
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.790
You were able to keep it afloat because I helped you.

39
00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.760
You can't say you helped me if you only do it halfway.

40
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.880
I wanted to cook.

41
00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.089
Good in Korean and Soup in English.

42
00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.989
East meets west.

43
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.200
Don't sell the land grandpa gave you.

44
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.440
Hello.

45
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.209
I'd like to take out a loan.

46
00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.910
Are you requesting a secured loan?

47
00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.910
Yes. With land as collateral.

48
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.350
First you need to apply for the loan.

49
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.720
After an evaluation, a limit for the loan will be set.

50
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.859
Please fill this out, and leave it with me.

51
00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.790
I'll contact you when the result comes out.

52
00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:14.929
Okay.

53
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.700
(Loan Application, On Jung Sun)

54
00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.500
- Did you want to see me? - Yes.

55
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.769
("High Society")

56
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.979
You should work with writer Ji Hong Ah.

57
00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:32.380
What?

58
00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.649
She went into On Entertainment to work with Yi Bok.

59
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.779
But it hasn't been long since Yi Bok quit.

60
00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.349
You should work with Hong Ah.

61
00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.750
I'm preparing a drama with Hyun Soo.

62
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.060
Let's hold off on Ms. Lee's work.

63
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.620
Hong Jin.

64
00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:47.029
Come on.

65
00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:48.760
Hong Jin!

66
00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:52.729
Jung Woo.

67
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.099
Hong Jin is telling me to work with Hong Ah.

68
00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.269
Do you think it makes sense?

69
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.440
It can make sense.

70
00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:03.880
Then...

71
00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.039
what about Hyun Soo's drama?

72
00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:19.459
What's up?

73
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.360
Why did you want to see me?

74
00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.360
Don't we need to talk...

75
00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.000
if we're going to work together?

76
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.070
Talk about what?

77
00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:29.899
(Yoo Hong Jin)

78
00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:31.769
Excuse me for a second.

79
00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:36.510
Hi, this is Hong Ah.

80
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.010
Hi. I thought things over,

81
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.909
and I think it's a good idea for you to work with Joon Ha.

82
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.550
Let's have a meeting tomorrow.

83
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.450
Okay, thank you.

84
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.889
There's nothing to talk about.

85
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.800
I want to get to know you over tea.

86
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.029
Sure, if we're going to work together.

87
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.070
Hong Ah and Joon Ha won't make a good team.

88
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.180
You don't know if Joon Ha and Hyun Soo will make a good team.

89
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.680
Joon Ha is just insisting on it.

90
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.579
- They're working things... - Are you dating Hyun Soo?

91
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.450
Well, there's a rumor going around. Is it true?

92
00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.659
No.

93
00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:25.589
I knew it.

94
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.490
I know you don't mix personal feelings with business.

95
00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.500
"Let me have him."

96
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.070
(Let me have him.)

97
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.940
Where can I use this line?

98
00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.079
Let me...

99
00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:47.209
have him.

100
00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:49.979
You won't keep him anyway, so let me have him.

101
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:52.779
Stop changing your mind.

102
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.820
Don't snoop about.

103
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.190
Ultimately, people end up alone.

104
00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:28.219
(New post)

105
00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:31.320
I am happy alone.

106
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.659
It's warm.

113

You can't help liking someone.

114
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.060
Why do I keep talking to myself?

115
00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.029
Nobody's here.

116
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.599
Where did everyone go?

117
00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:15.969
I'm sure they're having a break.

118
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.440
I haven't seen Soo Jung lately.

119
00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.110
Hi, Hyun Soo.

120
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.909
Hi. Where's Soo Jung?

121
00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:25.579
She'll be here. She left this.

122
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.510
She quit.

123
00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.690
- Hello. - Hi, Soo Jung.

124
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.849
I always saw you in your uniform.

125
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.190
You look so pretty dressed like this...

126
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.589
and with your hair down.

127
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:42.560
Did you find a better place to work?

128
00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:45.200
No. I like Good Soup the best.

129
00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.430
Is that mine?

130
00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:49.200
Yes.

131
00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:52.869
I'll get going now.

132
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.770
Bye.

133
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.209
Bye. I'll see you next time.

134
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.440
Okay.

135
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.690
Soo Jung.

136
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.560
I thought you were going somewhere else.

137
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.270
No, I'm going to take a break.

138
00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:22.800
Then why did you leave?

139
00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:25.770
I'm sure Good Soup will get back on its feet.

140
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.739
Also, you know what Chef On is like. I'm here too.

141
00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:31.910
Are you asking me to stay?

142
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.579
I am.

143
00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:39.479
Usually, people offer raises when they scout employees.

144
00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:42.290
I can't give you a raise.

You heard something, didn't you?

148
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.969
The financial situation of the restaurant is bad.

149
00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:29.700
That's why Soo Jung quit.

150
00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:32.969
They'll go bankrupt if Mr. Park withdraws his investment.

151
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.709
Don't they have a contract? How can he withdraw it now?

152
00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:40.180
They have to listen to Mr. Park in order to keep the investment,

153
00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.219
but Chef On won't listen to Mr. Park.

154
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.129
Where is Jung Sun?

155
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.259
Let me think about it first.

156
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.729
Is it something you can't tell me?

157
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.810
He went to the bank to ask about a loan.

158
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.879
Jung Sun.

159
00:11:19.249 --> 00:11:20.290
Are you here?

160
00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:22.420
Did you go somewhere?

161
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.020
Yes.

162
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.859
I can't talk right now. I have to prep for dinner.

163

(Preparing ingredients)

164
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.629
I know. It'll be just a minute.

165
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.369
Is Mr. Park harsh on you?

166
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.999
No.

167
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.009
In his perspective, I must be harsh on him.

168
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.009
In regard to the business, he's doing what's right.

169
00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:46.810
- Does it bother you? - Yes.

170
00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:48.509
Jung Woo and I...

171
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.650
have our own relationship aside from you. Don't worry.

172
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.219
How strange.

173
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.520
It all sounds true when you say it.

174
00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.290
That's because it's true.

175
00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:06.259
Set a meeting with Lee Hyun Soo and Kim Joon Ha.

176
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.629
Okay.

177
00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:12.570
I asked you to come to ask what you think.

178
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.209
As I told you before, I don't want to do Ms. Ji's drama.

179
00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:20.410
I'll work according to what's given to me.

180
00:12:20.849 --> 00:12:22.849
How can you give up on me so easily?

181
00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:24.349
It's offending.

182
00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:27.089
We have to listen to our bosses.

183
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.060
I'm letting you go so that you won't feel guilty.

184
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:32.060
If I get to decide,

185
00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.129
we don't know when yours will air.

186
00:12:34.729 --> 00:12:37.430
I know. I went through it before.

187
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:43.599
I'll have Joon Ha work with Ms. Ji then.

188
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.869
You're being too much.

189
00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:54.650
I'll get going too.

190
00:12:58.219 --> 00:12:59.280
Mr. Park.

191
00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:04.660
Good Soup...

192
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.290
It's nothing.

193
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.759
(On Jung Sun)

194
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.800
(Accept)

195
00:13:47.229 --> 00:13:48.300
Hello?

196
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.300
- What are you doing? - Working.

197
00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:52.469
Don't you have to interview me?

198
00:13:52.469 --> 00:13:53.469
Why haven't you?

199
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.509
Is there something I should be researching?

200
00:13:56.009 --> 00:13:57.310
I have to buy groceries.

201
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.339
Groceries?

202
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.650
I've never seen a grocery store open so late.

203
00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:04.450
It's open 24 hours a day. Us chefs love it.

204
00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:07.420
I think this drama will work out thanks to you.

205
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.259
Did something happen today?

206
00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:13.329
No. I just missed you.

207
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.129
You did? That's nice.

208
00:14:17.729 --> 00:14:18.759
What are we buying?

209
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:21.770
Buy everything you want to eat. I'll buy it for you.

210
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.869
Are you rich?

211
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.999
I have enough to buy you food.

212
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.839
Wow, I'm so excited.

213
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.209
Then this one.

214
00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:33.780
- Get more. - Really?

215
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.310
Yes. Three of these.

216
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.150
You said I could get more.

217
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.180
Enough ramyeon.

218
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.119
Is it good?

219
00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:46.390
What is this?

220
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.890
- It's this. Pork. - This one?

221
00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:58.700
- It's so sour. - It's sour.

222
00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:04.680
I'm so happy.

223
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.650
We're sharing our daily lives.

224
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.410
I feel so close to you.

225
00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:18.520
Are you happy?

226
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.560
I am.

227
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:25.629
I want to carry it.

228
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.700
It's okay, I will.

229
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.499
No, I chose them, so I'll carry.

230
00:15:29.499 --> 00:15:31.640
- No, I'll carry it. - No!

231
00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:38.839
I told you not to do that.

232
00:15:43.349 --> 00:15:45.849
I'm sorry. We can just pick it up.

233
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:54.359
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:57.930
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

235
00:15:58.729 --> 00:15:59.729
Let's go.

236
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.009
(Appraisal Report)

237
00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:18.650
"On Jung Sun".

238
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.859
Did the result for the land appraisal come out?

239
00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:24.920
Yes, it did.

240
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.759
Jung Woo invested 350,000 dollars on us, right?

241
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.660
Are you really going to end things with Mr. Park?

242
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.099
The contract isn't over yet.

243
00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:35.670
It's for 3 years, but it hasn't been 1 year yet.

244
00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.800
I'll finish my business with him.

245
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.469
We'll buy his shares.

246
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.540
What if he declines?

247
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.979
He knows we can't continue.

248
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.579
He's strict when it comes to business. He must know...

249
00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:49.410
it's best to get out of it now.

250
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.849
Why would he want to keep this risk?

251
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.950
Because of Hyun Soo.

252
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.690
If he lets you go, he can't control you.

253
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.790
What if he holds on?

254
00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:01.160
I'm sure he's not like that.

255
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.700
If he is, then it'd be easier for me.

256
00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:19.209
It's a contract to buy out your investment shares.

257
00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:27.920
Do you really want us to split apart?

258
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.989
We're going in different directions,

259
00:17:29.989 --> 00:17:31.559
so it makes sense we break up.

260
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.830
When I was your age, I never thought about...

261
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.789
directions or dreams.

262
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.499
I only thought about making money. I did anything to do that.

263
00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:43.469
But I guess you're not the same.

264
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.469
We have different values.

265
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.069
Even if you don't agree with me, desperate people would do it.

266
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.940
You're just not desperate.

267
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.350
How long do you think you can last with what you have?

268
00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:56.009
I'll try to last.

269
00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:58.350
I won't be getting involved with you because of money again.

270
00:17:59.749 --> 00:18:00.789
Again?

271
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.059
Yes. I hope we never have to.

272
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:08.690
Your pride would be hurt.

273
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.170
I didn't want to live like my father either.

274
00:18:14.769 --> 00:18:16.370
However, I loved him.

275
00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:18.799
You don't love your father.

276
00:18:19.969 --> 00:18:21.569
You don't understand the difference, right?

277
00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:24.910
This is what determines success and failure.

278
00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:28.880
But I have the love you can't have.

279
00:18:29.249 --> 00:18:30.779
You're pretty good with comebacks.

280
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.989
Go.

281
00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:39.319
You'll be back. We don't want this to drag on and embarrass you.

282
00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:52.039
- Hello. - Hello.

283
00:18:52.969 --> 00:18:54.739
I feel more comfortable with you here.

284
00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.969
It feels like Good Soup.

285
00:18:56.239 --> 00:18:58.539
Thank you. Let me show you in.

286
00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:13.559
Hyun Soo, did something good happen?

287
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.459
Someone might think your drama got scheduled to air.

288
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.660
If I feel good about doing something, I'll feel good.

289
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.729
You're right. You can feel good if you feel good doing it.

290
00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:26.670
Let's clean up and then work. Won't that feel good?

291
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.670
Super, super, great!

292
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.940
Great!

293
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.580
Your mother is here.

294
00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:42.989
Are you coming from somewhere?

295
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:46.289
Are you...

296
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.670
I think he looks down on me.

297
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.900
No way.

298
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.330
He never talks to me.

299
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.440
He's not the talkative type.

300
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.009
He never invites me to his house when he lives here.

301
00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:03.410
I never wanted to see it anyway.

302
00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:07.209
That's easy.

303
00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:10.779
Let's ask him to give us some coffee.

304
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.850
The coffee smells good.

305
00:20:41.279 --> 00:20:42.410
Give us some too.

306
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.279
Wow. So this is what it looks like.

307
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:47.390
- It's perfect for a bachelor. - Sit down.

308
00:20:59.229 --> 00:21:00.269
Are things...

309
00:21:00.729 --> 00:21:01.799
tough?

310
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.640
The restaurant looks empty.

311
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.140
It's fine.

312
00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:08.309
Right. You're not the only one running it.

313
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.610
It won't be too difficult...

314
00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:12.279
since Mr. Park helps you.

315
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.350
He has nothing to do with Good Soup now.

316
00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:19.580
Did you decide to split up?

317
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.190
Gosh, that's why it's so difficult.

318
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.190
What do we do?

319
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.130
Mr. Park seemed to be a nice guy.

320
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.799
He always helped me with my exhibitions.

321
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.400
- Hey, let's go. - Why?

322
00:21:40.209 --> 00:21:42.709
It's not looking good here. We'll make him uncomfortable.

323
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.779
What did he help with?

324
00:21:45.279 --> 00:21:46.479
It's nothing.

325
00:21:47.209 --> 00:21:48.410
Yes, it's nothing.

326
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.749
He supported me when I was in France too.

327
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.719
It's nothing compared to then.

328
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.989
- Mom! - My goodness.

329
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.900
Hey, let's go.

330
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.870
Tell me the truth. Did you ask him for money?

331
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.700
I'll wait outside if this is a family meeting.

332
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.809
Hey, that hurts!

333
00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.239
I told you.

334
00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:22.309
The worst would be borrowing money from people I'm close with.

335
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.979
If it's not someone close, who would lend me money?

336
00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:27.219
That's why you should have given me some.

337
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.620
Do you think it was easy for me to ask him for money?

338
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.019
Mom. Mom. Mom!

339
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.190
How can a mother ruin her child's life?

340
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.160
I'm sorry,

341
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.200
but this is what I'm like.

342
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.999
Please calm down.

343
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.400
Get out.

344
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.039
Get out!

345
00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.440
Gosh.

346
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.370
Yes. I hope we never have to.

347
00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:53.039
You'll be back.

348
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.009
We don't want this to drag on and embarrass you.

349
00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:04.049
(Lee Hyun Soo)

350
00:24:11.489 --> 00:24:15.090
(Accept)

351
00:24:18.729 --> 00:24:19.769
Hello?

352
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.200
What's wrong?

353
00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:31.279
Did you cry?

354
00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:49.620
Did something happen?

355
00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:51.590
No.

356
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:52.890
Do you want tea?

357
00:26:17.979 --> 00:26:19.380
Let's live together.

358
00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:26.989
Let's stay together.

359
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.569
