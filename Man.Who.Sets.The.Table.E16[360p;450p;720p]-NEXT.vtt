00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.140
(Memorandum)

2
00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:10.470
"I, Hong Young Hye, swear 
to the followings."

3
00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:14.080
"Regardless of Lee So Won's 
relation to her,"

4
00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.910
"I, Hong Young Hye,
 will raise Oh Han Gyul."

5
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:19.510
Is this true?

6
00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:35.360
Oh, my. This is unbelievable.

7
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:39.600
This is quite a show you're putting on.

8
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:43.020
What are you doing, Young Hye?

9
00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:44.590
You're making Mrs. Yang uncomfortable.

10
00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:46.310
Get up already.

11
00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:50.210
I told you to stand up.

12
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.250
Excuse me. You're going too far.

13
00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:00.020
I only asked if you stand by what's 
written on the memorandum.

14
00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:02.460
Did I ask you to kneel in front of me?

15
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:05.460
It's your family who made a mistake.

16
00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.560
Why are you trying to make me look bad?

17
00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:09.660
You asked...

18
00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.300
if I stand by the memorandum.

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.940
I do.

20
00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.440
People adopt children, but Han Gyul...

21
00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:20.010
shares our family's blood.

22
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.680
If no one is willing to raise her, 
I will raise Han Gyul.

23
00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:25.450
Just like what the memorandum says,

24
00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.800
I will bother neither you nor Yeon Ju.

25
00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:30.190
I can register her under my family...

26
00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:32.920
and raise her. I'm willing to do so.

27
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420
Do you believe us now?

28
00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.860
This is my wife's and my intention.

29
00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:42.830
She promised you as she knelt 
down before you.

30
00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:44.620
Please trust us.

31
00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:45.670
But...

32
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.270
I'd like to ask you of this.

33
00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:49.940
Please...

34
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.340
help So Won not become the father 
who abandons his own daughter.

35
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.950
That poor girl just turned six.

36
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.180
Please help her grow up with her dad.

37
00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:03.250
Please help us not do wrong
 by that little girl.

38
00:02:03.673 --> 00:02:05.820
She had such a hard life.

39
00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:10.330
I'm begging you.

40
00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:14.630
Please. I hope you can accept her.

41
00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.430
Please. I'm begging you.

42
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.480
Goodness. Oh, my.

43
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.180
I can't be a match to you.

44
00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:34.530
I thought you only took care 
of house chores at home,

45
00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:37.100
had no idea how this world worked, 
and were clueless.

46
00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:40.620
After hearing you, I realized 
you're better than your husband.

47
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.430
So I noticed...

48
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.200
you only talked about it in favor of you.

49
00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:50.750
No, no. That's not true.

50
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.590
No, be quiet. Don't interrupt us.

51
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.100
Stop telling me your nonsense. So let me get this straight.

52
00:02:56.293 --> 00:03:00.140
What you mean to say is that you can follow the memorandum,

53
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.410
but if we are willing to raise her,

54
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.680
it would be the icing on the cake?

55
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.450
Okay. I see.

56
00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:11.670
- Wait. - I understand.

57
00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:13.670
Mrs. Yang, we...

58
00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:17.190
Yes, I heard you loud and clear. I understand what you said.

59
00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:19.430
I will consider what you said...

60
00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:23.130
and tell you what we think about this. So wait until then.

61
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.670
And when that time comes, you can't take back what you said.

62
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.440
Mrs. Yang.

63
00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:34.410
Mrs. Yang, Mrs. Yang.

64
00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:36.910
Well, let me explain, Mrs. Yang.

65
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:39.310
Please let me...

66
00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.060
You said you wanted to get some fresh air as you were frustrated.

67
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.560
Is this where you wanted to be?

68
00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.630
Whatever decisions our parents make, it's our lives.

69
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.070
Let's make our own decisions, and not let them...

70
00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:02.740
make decisions for us.

71
00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:13.050
It's cold.

72
00:04:14.137 --> 00:04:16.620
Your bronchial tubes aren't strong. You might catch a cold.

73
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.950
Let's go home.

74
00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:21.420
This is strange.

75
00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:25.130
For the four years we lived together,

76
00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:28.300
I've never felt that you loved me.

77
00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:30.370
But why are you being so affectionate now?

78
00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.740
Are you pitying me now that we might get a divorce?

79
00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:36.570
It's probably...

80
00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:40.180
because I don't want to lose you.

81
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.680
Why don't you want to lose me?

82
00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:47.180
I'm sure it's not because you have fallen in love with me suddenly.

83
00:04:48.838 --> 00:04:50.990
Is it because of the money that my mom can provide you?

84
00:04:55.578 --> 00:04:57.810
I went to a fortune-teller to ask about our marital compatibility,

85
00:04:57.814 --> 00:04:59.130
and he told me this.

86
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.360
We will never...

87
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.570
live together in happy union.

88
00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.570
But I told Mom he said we were meant to be...

89
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.870
as I was afraid she'd object to our marriage.

90
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.980
Because I loved you that much.

91
00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:20.750
Do you remember the day we first met?

92
00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:24.690
When you walked into the cafe,

93
00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:28.920
I thought I could even be your maid...

94
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.630
only if I could live with you.

95
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:39.930
And I still...

96
00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.810
feel the same way.

97
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:49.880
After I found out about Han Gyul,

98
00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.880
I was so mad and upset.

99
00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.750
So I tried to hate you.

100
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:56.820
I tried hard to abandon you.

101
00:05:57.874 --> 00:05:59.320
But I can't.

102
00:06:01.378 --> 00:06:04.930
But that doesn't mean I can raise someone else's child like this.

103
00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:07.060
Then what do you want to do?

104
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.570
Do you want me to decide what I want in my life?

105
00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:13.130
I've already made up my mind.

106
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.500
If we get divorced,

107
00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.440
I don't want to live anymore.

108
00:06:18.762 --> 00:06:21.010
I can't live without you. I rather...

109
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.110
- Yeon Ju. - I really mean it.

110
00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.330
This is my decision.

111
00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:26.880
So think about it.

112
00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.320
If you have a conscience,

113
00:06:32.542 --> 00:06:34.420
just do what your father tells you.

114
00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:38.330
If you insist to raise Han Gyul,

115
00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:40.300
I will...

116
00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:43.730
I'll leave this world immediately.

117
00:06:44.521 --> 00:06:46.300
You know what I mean, don't you?

118
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:03.890
Tiger, where are you going?

119
00:07:04.374 --> 00:07:05.990
I'm going to see my dad.

120
00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:08.360
Han Gyul, you don't have a dad, do you?

121
00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:11.830
That's not true. I have a dad too.

122
00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:15.560
He's the best dad in the world.

123
00:07:16.386 --> 00:07:19.300
And I'll live with my dad.

124
00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:20.800
Are you envious?

125
00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:40.420
Did you call me, Chairman Kevin?

126
00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:46.560
There's something I can't understand no matter how hard I try.

127
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.300
Is something wrong?

128
00:07:48.585 --> 00:07:50.130
I met a guy named Go Jung Do...

129
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.370
in the elevator yesterday.

130
00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:55.000
- He got off on the third floor. - He did?

131
00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.510
What was he doing in this building?

132
00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:00.610
The place I first met Jung Hwa Young...

133
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.940
was the basement garage of our company.

134
00:08:04.968 --> 00:08:06.680
If it were just once, I'd think it was coincidental.

135
00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:08.520
But I met the couple here.

136
00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.940
I'm sure they have some connection with our company.

137
00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:13.120
Then...

138
00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:16.360
is one of our employees their family?

139
00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:19.530
That's right. And he might be Jung Hwa Young's child...

140
00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:21.800
as I expected.

141
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:23.160
Then...

142
00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:25.770
he might be your...

143
00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:30.510
After she disappeared in Seattle, I was getting rid of her things,

144
00:08:31.394 --> 00:08:33.510
and I found baby clothes in her bag.

145
00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:38.080
She wanted to have a kid back then, so she could've just bought it.

146
00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:41.620
But there's a chance she was pregnant.

147
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.120
I've come this far thinking about it all the time.

148
00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:48.890
If Anna were alive,

149
00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:51.260
she would've come to Korea.

150
00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:52.630
Once I find her,

151
00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:55.630
I thought I'd finally solve my life-long problem.

152
00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:59.450
But when you met her,

153
00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.820
you saw she had only two children.

154
00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:03.470
She could've lied to me.

155
00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:06.870
Just like how she deleted her past and lives as Jung Hwa Young.

156
00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:11.580
She only has bad memories about me.

157
00:09:12.201 --> 00:09:15.120
I bet she couldn't accept the fact that I'm the father of her child.

158
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.620
I'll go check...

159
00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:21.020
if your guess is true.

160
00:09:32.956 --> 00:09:34.000
Promise me.

161
00:09:34.357 --> 00:09:36.740
Don't ever go near that woman.

162
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.010
Okay. I don't want to go near her.

163
00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:41.610
It won't happen.

164
00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.510
Eun Byul, you didn't answer him.

165
00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:48.250
You stole my necklace. Is there anything you can say?

166
00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:51.970
Apologize to your mom now.

167
00:09:51.975 --> 00:09:53.490
I know that too.

168
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.960
It's my fault that I stole Mom's necklace.

169
00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:58.260
But is it a bad thing to do?

170
00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:02.000
The man in Mom's necklace. It's Tae Yang's birth father, right?

171
00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:06.330
We're old enough to know what's going on.

172
00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:07.840
Grandma promised me.

173
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:11.010
If she finds out about the man, she can protect Tae Yang.

174
00:10:11.294 --> 00:10:13.370
So I was going to show her the picture.

175
00:10:13.463 --> 00:10:15.780
- What's so bad about it? - Go Eun Byul!

176
00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:17.380
How many times did I tell you?

177
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.930
She's not your grandmother. I told you not to meet her...

178
00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:21.580
or even talk to her.

179
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:22.880
Don't be absurd.

180
00:10:23.172 --> 00:10:25.490
She gave birth to you. Why is she not my grandmother?

181
00:10:25.842 --> 00:10:28.110
You always tell us to be nice to Mom.

182
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:29.990
How can you treat your mother like that?

183
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.590
What did Grandma do wrong?

184
00:10:32.682 --> 00:10:35.110
From the way I see her, she's just nice and kind.

185
00:10:35.118 --> 00:10:36.330
Stop it!

186
00:10:36.953 --> 00:10:38.080
Do you want me to tell you the truth?

187
00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:40.350
What she's done to us.

188
00:10:40.356 --> 00:10:41.700
Do you want me to tell you that?

189
00:10:41.858 --> 00:10:43.340
She's done...

190
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.910
No. Stop it.

191
00:10:49.132 --> 00:10:52.110
Don't you dare meet her one more time.

192
00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:54.120
I'll never let it slide.

193
00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:55.450
I'm serious.

194
00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:02.860
Remember what Dad just said.

195
00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:04.940
And the man in the picture...

196
00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:07.600
has nothing to do with Tae Yang, so stop being ridiculous.

197
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.260
And don't tell Tae Yang anything.

198
00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:12.970
- Okay? - Okay.

199
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.640
Go to your rooms.

200
00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:29.850
Woo Joo, isn't it strange?

201
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.250
I know. Mom is being strange.

202
00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:36.290
The man in the picture looks just like Tae Yang.

203
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.030
In fact, I think I saw him in the parking lot yesterday.

204
00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:42.900
The rich man I talked about?

205
00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:44.830
Yes. I think it was him.

206
00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:48.740
Then he must work at that company.

207
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.110
He looks quite rich. He might be an executive or something.

208
00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:56.240
Then Tae Yang and his birth father work at the same company?

209
00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:02.720
I should go ask Grandma about it.

210
00:12:02.939 --> 00:12:06.020
Hey, if Dad finds it out, you won't get away with it.

211
00:12:06.075 --> 00:12:07.990
He wouldn't kill me for it.

212
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:11.660
I'll find out the truth and tell Tae Yang about it.

213
00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:14.160
That his birth father is working at the same company with him.

Gosh, I'm tired. This is so heavy.

216
00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:27.540
I might have hemorrhoids if I keep carrying heavy things.

217
00:12:27.597 --> 00:12:30.380
Gosh, my arms hurt.

218
00:12:34.604 --> 00:12:37.250
Gosh, what was that?

219
00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:41.740
He's just unbelievable.

220
00:12:41.744 --> 00:12:44.130
Hey. Excuse me.

221
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:46.990
I clearly told you.

222
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.760
We should help each other.

223
00:12:49.085 --> 00:12:51.730
But if you keep standing out like this,

224
00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:53.600
I won't just ask you that.

225
00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:55.640
I'll threaten you instead.

226
00:13:05.468 --> 00:13:06.980
- Hey. - Yes.

You know what I mean? Okay?

231
00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:25.770
Gosh, are you insane?

It's all wet.

234
00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:31.220

Gosh, he's crazy.

236
00:13:34.497 --> 00:13:36.010
He's so pathetic.

237

Gosh, what should I do?

238
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:40.110
What?

239

00:13:49.445 --> 00:13:52.030
You should practice for your presentation.

- That's why you're all dressed up? - What?

That's not true.

246
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:04.010
This is how I'm usually dressed.

247
00:14:05.328 --> 00:14:08.040
You should do it. Unlike you, I'm not dressed up.

248
00:14:08.164 --> 00:14:09.410
I'm too shy to present.

249
00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:13.330
It's okay. No matter what you wear, you look just cool.

250
00:14:13.336 --> 00:14:14.620
I know that.

251
00:14:15.705 --> 00:14:17.250
But you look better than me today.

252
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.890
Let's start.

253
00:14:19.575 --> 00:14:21.860
- Chef Jung. - It'll be a good experience.

254
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:24.360
I've done this a lot. It's your turn.

You don't have to do this.

The new menu for the Christmas season...

257
00:14:34.857 --> 00:14:36.870
is Pork Neck Love Set.

258
00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:38.510
Hey, Ru Ri!

259
00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.380
We're in trouble. This is a disaster.

260

What's going on?

261
00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:45.710
Manager Jung, what's your new menu for the presentation?

262
00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.110
Pork Neck Love Set.

263
00:14:47.203 --> 00:14:49.620
I knew it. You should see this.

264
00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:51.350
This is Chef No's proposal.

265
00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:56.760
(Pork neck steak, steak sauce, and rice ball)

266
00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.360
(Tender, marinated pork neck steak)

267
00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:02.460
This recipe is exactly like our recipe except for the names.

268
00:15:02.551 --> 00:15:04.630
Even the side dish and the sauce are the same.

269
00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:06.370
What could've happened?

270
00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:10.710
This can't be a coincidence, can it?

271
00:15:11.227 --> 00:15:12.460
I think they plagiarized ours.

272
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:14.140
That's exactly what I thought.

273
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.730
The chef and the assistant both look ugly,

274
00:15:17.733 --> 00:15:19.650
and on top of that, they are not even ethical.

275
00:15:19.969 --> 00:15:23.250
What should we do? The presentation will start in any minute.

276
00:15:25.107 --> 00:15:27.890
Ru Ri, you can do the presentation just like you practiced, right?

277
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:29.490
Chef Jung.

278
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.130
If they copied our recipes word for word, there must be a trap.

279
00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.960
I should find out what that is.

280
00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:37.770
You should go.

281
00:15:41.324 --> 00:15:44.060
The first presentation of SC Food and Beverage's...

282

283
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:47.740
for the Christmas promotion will begin now.

284
00:15:47.964 --> 00:15:51.250
Each team will present their new recipes they developed.

285
00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:53.600
Through votes, we will decide which team's new recipe will be used...

286
00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:55.380
for the new dish of the Christmas promotion.

287
00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:57.120
First off...

288
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.990
(1st Presentation for the Christmas Promotion)

289
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.020
Are you late again as always?

290
00:16:13.022 --> 00:16:14.140
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:17.240
Chef Jung isn't feeling too well. So today,

292
00:16:17.326 --> 00:16:19.920
I will give the presentation on his behalf.

293
00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:23.610
Is that so? Intern Lee Ru Ri, you will go first.

294
00:16:34.443 --> 00:16:37.360
The new recipe our team developed for Christmas is...

295
00:16:37.546 --> 00:16:39.160
Pork Neck Love Set.

296
00:16:40.282 --> 00:16:42.260
I'm certain that they copied our recipes.

297
00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:45.870
But how did they get their hands on our proposal?

298
00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:48.700
Ru Ri doesn't have a big mouth.

299
00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:51.410
Then did you tell someone about your recipes?

300
00:16:52.194 --> 00:16:54.140
I tried to keep our recipes from leaking.

301
00:16:54.563 --> 00:16:57.560
They'd need my passcode to get into my computer. So it's not possible.

302
00:16:57.566 --> 00:16:58.610
Goodness.

303
00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:02.120
If they were computer geniuses, they could've gotten into it.

304
00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:03.980
What do you think hackers do?

305
00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:05.220
That must be it.

306
00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:08.020
I'm sure when everyone went home,

307
00:17:08.044 --> 00:17:10.390
they must've come and stolen your recipes secretly.

308
00:17:13.015 --> 00:17:15.280
The most significant feature of our new recipe is...

309
00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:17.750
that we have broken the prejudice that only beef...

310
00:17:17.753 --> 00:17:19.030
can be cooked as steaks.

311
00:17:20.156 --> 00:17:23.220
We can use the pork neck, which is an affordable ingredient,

312
00:17:23.225 --> 00:17:25.040
so the dish will be cost-effective.

313
00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:28.280
They're going to make steaks with pork?

314
00:17:28.397 --> 00:17:30.430
- How is that possible? - This is strange.

315
00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:32.500
- Are they serious? - Why would they do this?

316
00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:35.000
Instead of using meat tenderizers, we can use the marinade...

317
00:17:35.004 --> 00:17:36.470
and by making slits on the steaks...

318
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.200
Hold on.

319
00:17:38.207 --> 00:17:40.990
Why are Chef Jung and Chef No's recipes identical?

320
00:17:41.243 --> 00:17:44.960
I think they stole the recipe that I developed.

321
00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:49.400
- What? - No, that's not true.

322
00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:51.270
We never stole his recipe.

323
00:17:51.387 --> 00:17:56.090
We developed the recipe after spending nights in the office.

324
00:17:56.092 --> 00:17:58.240
Do you think you can get away with lying here?

325
00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:01.940
How could you copy someone else's recipe?

326
00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:03.910
Hold on.

327
00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:06.550
We cannot jump to the conclusion that Chef Jung copied...

328
00:18:06.769 --> 00:18:09.800
the recipe just because their recipes are the same.

329
00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:10.870
No.

330
00:18:10.873 --> 00:18:13.240
Not only is the main dish identical, but so is the sauce.

331
00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:16.440
I'm certain that one of the teams must have copied someone's recipe.

332
00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:18.280
If he had done something as daring as this,

333
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.240
he probably did it because he must have connections.

334
00:18:20.249 --> 00:18:21.610
Jung Tae Yang...

335
00:18:21.617 --> 00:18:24.150
wasn't even competent from day one. He was arrogant as he relied...

336
00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:25.970
on his tie with Chairman.

337
00:18:26.755 --> 00:18:30.040
Even if he has connections, stealing someone else's recipe...

338
00:18:30.493 --> 00:18:32.410
should disqualify him as a chef.

339
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:35.460
No. I can swear.

340
00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:36.980
We never stole their recipe.

341
00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:40.200
We even stayed up all night yesterday in the office...

342
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.750
because we were trying to develop our sauce.

343
00:18:42.238 --> 00:18:43.350
Manager Joo.

344
00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:45.950
Can you prove that Chef Jung copied the recipe?

345
00:18:46.342 --> 00:18:47.490
Of course.

346
00:18:48.244 --> 00:18:50.560
I have a definite piece of evidence.

347
00:18:55.518 --> 00:18:57.000
After work?

348
00:18:57.653 --> 00:19:00.800
Yes. I think my personal documents have leaked.

349
00:19:01.123 --> 00:19:02.440
I'd like to catch who did it.

350
00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.690
After everyone went home,

351
00:19:04.693 --> 00:19:08.210
was there anyone who did something suspicious at night?

352
00:19:08.998 --> 00:19:11.480
I don't know. Let me see.

353
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.900
There was someone like that lately.

354
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.720
That's right. All right. That must be the culprit.

355
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:20.320
Who is that?

356
00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:23.190
I was on my patrol around 11pm.

357
00:19:23.312 --> 00:19:25.030
I saw the lights were on in the office for the Menu Development.

358
00:19:41.297 --> 00:19:44.650
Hey! Stop! Hey, stop right there.

359
00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:46.600
I couldn't see as it was dark.

360
00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:47.600
Hey!

361
00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:48.950
- Come back. - From the back,

362
00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:51.450
- she was tall and slim. - Hey, miss!

363
00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:53.990
You know the girl you work with?

364
00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:55.920
It was definitely her.

365
00:19:57.479 --> 00:19:59.260
This is all thanks to you, Chef Jung.

366
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:00.540
I wanted to use this knife,

367
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.800
so I stayed late every night and practiced in secret.

368
00:20:03.652 --> 00:20:04.830
Lee Ru Ri.

369
00:20:05.554 --> 00:20:07.400
Were there any other people except her?

370
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.070
Except for her, there wasn't anyone who was suspicious.

371
00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:12.810
The rest were part of the Menu Development Team.

372
00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:15.660
Like who in the Menu Development Team?

373
00:20:15.664 --> 00:20:19.230
Manager Joo and Chef No stayed pretty late recently,

374
00:20:19.235 --> 00:20:20.500
but only when you weren't around, Chef Jung.

375
00:20:20.502 --> 00:20:23.020
Goodness, I know exactly what happened.

376
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:24.870
They were together when you weren't around...

377
00:20:24.873 --> 00:20:26.540
because they were copying your recipe.

378
00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:28.060
I have a feeling that it's them,

379
00:20:28.744 --> 00:20:30.320
but I need definite evidence.

380
00:20:31.914 --> 00:20:33.840
What is the definite piece of evidence...

381
00:20:33.849 --> 00:20:35.960
that Chef Jung copied Chef No's recipe?

382
00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:37.160
First off,

383
00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:40.270
Chef No's proposal was already submitted last week.

384
00:20:40.723 --> 00:20:43.770
Chef Jung's proposal was submitted this morning.

385
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.440
If both recipes are identical, who do you think copied the recipe?

386
00:20:47.463 --> 00:20:49.360
Of course, it's Chef Jung.

387
00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:51.460
I'm sure he went into the office without my knowing...

388
00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:53.760
and stole the recipe.

389
00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:54.850
That's not true.

390
00:20:55.037 --> 00:20:58.000
We finished our recipe this morning.

391
00:20:58.007 --> 00:20:59.250
That's an excuse.

392
00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:02.210
After seeing this proposal, I did some digging in secret.

393
00:21:02.211 --> 00:21:06.060
So did you find evidence that Chef Jung stole the recipe?

394
00:21:06.148 --> 00:21:07.190
Yes.

395
00:21:07.283 --> 00:21:10.260
The person who stole the recipe is in this room.

396
00:21:13.756 --> 00:21:14.840
Ms. Lee Ru Ri.

397
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:17.670
On the 4th and 15th,

398
00:21:17.926 --> 00:21:20.110
at 11pm when everyone had gone home,

399
00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.810
you were in the Menu Development Team's office alone, weren't you?

400
00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:23.910
No.

401
00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:29.550
It is true I was in the office,

402
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.020
but I wasn't there to steal.

403
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.250
I was practicing cooking.

404
00:21:35.644 --> 00:21:37.730
We really did not copy their recipe.

405
00:21:38.013 --> 00:21:40.010
Please believe us. It's the truth.

406
00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:42.280
- Could this be true? - She stayed late in the office?

407
00:21:42.284 --> 00:21:44.000
- She was alone in there. - Their recipes are identical.

408
00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:45.750
- Can you believe her? - I don't think it's the truth.

409
00:21:45.754 --> 00:21:48.570
- She could have stolen it. - It makes sense if she stole it.

410
00:21:57.966 --> 00:22:00.180
Somehow, you turned me into the vicious one here.

411
00:22:04.807 --> 00:22:07.760
Why are you sighing? You're not old enough to have trouble.

412
00:22:09.044 --> 00:22:10.660
Grandmother.

413
00:22:10.713 --> 00:22:11.790
What is it?

414
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.600
Who is that lady the other day?

415
00:22:15.117 --> 00:22:16.150
The lady?

416
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:19.770
The lady with big eyes who came with Dad.

417
00:22:19.955 --> 00:22:21.100
I see.

418
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.540
Why?

419
00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:24.720
Were you thinking about her?

420
00:22:24.727 --> 00:22:27.240
Who is the lady?

421
00:22:27.963 --> 00:22:30.480
She's just...

422
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.410
someone Dad loves the most.

423
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.850
But she...

424
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:39.150
doesn't like me?

425
00:22:39.742 --> 00:22:41.790
Is that why...

426
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.660
Dad isn't coming to see me?

427
00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:48.960
Han Gyul.

428
00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:51.830
Listen to me carefully.

429
00:22:53.255 --> 00:22:56.200
She is a very nice person.

430
00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:59.940
Right now, she's just surprised because you appeared...

431
00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:01.480
out of the blue.

432
00:23:01.764 --> 00:23:03.410
She will be nice to you as time passes.

433
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.230
Okay.

434
00:23:05.234 --> 00:23:09.750
I hope I can live with Dad and that lady soon.

435
00:23:10.072 --> 00:23:13.590
I hope we can get along and not fight like Grandfather.

436
00:23:25.354 --> 00:23:26.570
Please...

437
00:23:27.022 --> 00:23:30.040
help So Won not become the father who abandons his own daughter.

438
00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:33.310
That poor girl just turned six.

439
00:23:33.595 --> 00:23:35.640
Please help her grow up with her dad.

440
00:23:41.637 --> 00:23:44.050
Han Gyul. Han Gyul!

441
00:23:48.243 --> 00:23:50.260
What is it? Did you call me?

442
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:53.210
Hey, how many times did I tell you?

443
00:23:53.215 --> 00:23:56.500
I told you that you cannot address adults casually.

444
00:23:56.552 --> 00:23:58.500
Are you an adult?

445
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:00.680
Yes.

446
00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:04.040
You're a kid, and I'm an adult.

447
00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:06.970
So you must address me formally with honorifics.

448
00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:09.080
"Did you call for me, Dad?"

449
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:10.640
You're not my dad!

450
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:13.200
Are you an idiot? I'm your dad.

451
00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:14.250
No!

452
00:24:14.603 --> 00:24:15.650
You punk!

453
00:24:19.942 --> 00:24:21.660
Fine, fine. You win.

454
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:25.390
Whatever it is, you must do an errand for me later.

455
00:24:40.262 --> 00:24:41.310
Young Hye.

456
00:24:42.197 --> 00:24:43.930
You startled me.

457
00:24:43.932 --> 00:24:45.750
Why would I startle you?

458
00:24:46.301 --> 00:24:48.750
Other people might think that I abuse you or something.

459
00:24:48.871 --> 00:24:50.930
You're in my way. Leave my kitchen.

460
00:24:50.939 --> 00:24:53.290
You're so mean. Why do you hate me so much?

461
00:24:53.442 --> 00:24:55.890
I fell in love with you today.

462
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:02.000
How could you think of such a thing?

463
00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:06.770
I've been harsh on you, saying you're dull.

464
00:25:07.122 --> 00:25:09.200
I'd like to take it all back.

465
00:25:09.525 --> 00:25:12.610
You were like the Iron Lady today.

466
00:25:13.128 --> 00:25:14.710
You're strong inside and soft outside.

467
00:25:15.197 --> 00:25:18.150
You're a calm and confident woman with gentle charisma.

468
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.980
You're Merkel of Korea.

469
00:25:20.802 --> 00:25:24.650
I'm such a lucky guy who married a great lady. Bravo!

470
00:25:26.208 --> 00:25:27.490
Are you teasing me?

471
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.260
I feel very disturbed because of Mrs. Yang.

472
00:25:30.312 --> 00:25:32.730
There's no need to feel that way.

473
00:25:32.881 --> 00:25:34.260
Everything will be all right.

474
00:25:34.483 --> 00:25:35.730
When you...

475
00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:39.000
swallowed your pride and fell on your knees,

476
00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:41.230
I almost lost my temper.

477
00:25:42.057 --> 00:25:45.570
I thought you decided to become a disgrace of our family...

478
00:25:45.761 --> 00:25:48.760
and sling mud at me who has cared only about pride...

479
00:25:48.764 --> 00:25:50.280
throughout his 60 years of life.

480
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:54.200
I couldn't understand why you were being so humble...

481
00:25:54.202 --> 00:25:56.180
although you didn't have any other choices.

482
00:25:57.172 --> 00:25:58.750
Just say what you want to say.

483
00:25:58.874 --> 00:26:00.650
It's obvious.

484
00:26:00.709 --> 00:26:03.370
Just like Mrs. Yang said,

485
00:26:03.378 --> 00:26:04.930
you're much better than me.

486
00:26:05.914 --> 00:26:08.260
I thought only of the memorandum,

487
00:26:09.451 --> 00:26:12.620
but because you knelt down,

488
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:14.570
we looked even more truthful.

489
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.690
That's when the look in her face changed,

490
00:26:18.694 --> 00:26:20.140
and the tide turned in our favor.

491
00:26:20.362 --> 00:26:23.510
That's not what I'm interested in.

492
00:26:24.366 --> 00:26:28.220
I said that because I believed it'd be best for So Won and Han Gyul.

493
00:26:28.537 --> 00:26:30.520
You shouldn't be too optimistic.

494
00:26:30.706 --> 00:26:33.490
Mrs. Yang might look soft, but she's actually very uptight.

495
00:26:34.109 --> 00:26:36.060
Don't worry. I have a good feeling.

496
00:26:36.211 --> 00:26:38.590
You know reading others' minds...

497
00:26:38.647 --> 00:26:40.330
is my specialty.

498
00:26:40.782 --> 00:26:44.500
I could see how much she was moved when you lowered yourself.

499
00:26:45.554 --> 00:26:48.300
You did a great job.

500
00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.410
I apologize for questioning your love for our son...

501
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:52.970
for a second.

502
00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:57.260
If So Won doesn't get divorced,

503
00:26:57.265 --> 00:26:58.810
you'll get all the credit.

504
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:04.950
Come have some bean sprout rice.

505
00:27:05.374 --> 00:27:08.590
After cleaning up the table, I need to take Han Gyul to the dentist.

506
00:27:09.845 --> 00:27:11.760
Wait. Hold on.

507
00:27:12.514 --> 00:27:13.690
Han Gyul.

508
00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:15.330
Han Gyul.

509
00:27:23.525 --> 00:27:24.640
What is this?

510
00:27:25.193 --> 00:27:26.810
He gave this to me.

511
00:27:27.629 --> 00:27:30.330
Listen. I'm your dad.

512
00:27:30.332 --> 00:27:32.180
You're not my dad!

513
00:27:34.169 --> 00:27:37.120
Goodness.

514
00:27:37.205 --> 00:27:40.320
Her stubbornness tells that she's part of the Lee family.

515
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.060
Open it.

516
00:27:50.152 --> 00:27:51.330
What is this?

517
00:27:56.992 --> 00:27:58.070
Here.

518
00:28:03.665 --> 00:28:05.210
Today, we will commemorate...

519
00:28:05.634 --> 00:28:07.150
our wedding.

520
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:13.250
I thought about it.

521
00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:16.160
Although you made me worry...

522
00:28:16.845 --> 00:28:19.130
by asking for divorce,

523
00:28:19.181 --> 00:28:23.100
I'm grateful for you as you decided to stay next to me.

524
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.170
You...

525
00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:29.470
made a promise in front of Mrs. Yang.

526
00:28:29.858 --> 00:28:32.670
As a devoted mom who fell on her knees for her son,

527
00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:34.240
follow through with your promise.

528
00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:38.710
It'd be the best if they raise Han Gyul,

529
00:28:39.668 --> 00:28:41.650
but if they don't, we'll take care of her.

530
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.850
Let's think that we had a child late in our life.

531
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.760
Let's devote ourselves to raising her.

532
00:28:51.046 --> 00:28:53.160
I love you, Ms. Hong.

533
00:29:10.398 --> 00:29:11.980
Answer me now!

534
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.350
Why did you stay in the office until such a late hour?

535
00:29:16.104 --> 00:29:18.920
Ms. Intern, you'd better confess frankly.

536
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:21.640
According to our company code, interns are not allowed...

537
00:29:21.643 --> 00:29:23.710
to stay in the office alone after working hours.

538
00:29:23.712 --> 00:29:25.010
Why did you stay in the office alone at that hour?

539
00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:27.990
You tried to hide because you did something guilty.

540
00:29:28.216 --> 00:29:31.260
You stole Chef No's proposal, didn't you?

541
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.020
Did you collude with Chef Jung and did all this?

542
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.990
Of course she did. This is why...

543
00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:38.240
we shouldn't have hired Chef Jung who's so incompetent.

544
00:29:38.627 --> 00:29:41.010
They did it because they knew Chairman Kevin would back them.

545
00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:44.030
That's not true. I swear this isn't what you think.

546
00:29:44.032 --> 00:29:45.460
I'm serious. Please believe me.

547
00:29:45.467 --> 00:29:47.950
It isn't even worth arguing.

548
00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:51.050
It's obviously plagiarism. Let's draw a conclusion now.

549
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.820
Jung Tae Yang should also be responsible for this.

550
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.490
Where is he now?

551
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.660
If they didn't steal from your computer,

552
00:30:03.785 --> 00:30:05.500
how did they get all those?

553
00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:08.300
Steak, side menus,

554
00:30:08.623 --> 00:30:11.170
and sauces are developed consecutively,

555
00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:12.710
so the proposal was completed in the morning.

556
00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:15.580
How could they've stolen it when there wasn't enough time?

557
00:30:16.598 --> 00:30:19.580
That means they copied it little by little every day...

558
00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:21.950
until this morning.

559
00:30:22.771 --> 00:30:24.630
Then they must've been hiding here...

560
00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:26.990
and watching our every move.

561
00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:30.390
Watching our every move?

562
00:30:33.215 --> 00:30:34.260
Is there anything changed?

563
00:30:35.483 --> 00:30:36.960
Let's see if anything looks unusual.

564
00:30:38.153 --> 00:30:39.770
Myung Rang, pull down the blinds.

565
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:41.300
Why do you want me to do that out of the blue?

566
00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:43.570
- Just do it. We have no time. - Okay.

567
00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:07.660
There it is.

568
00:31:21.162 --> 00:31:23.510
They're such filthy runts.

569
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:25.480
What shall we do now?

570
00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:33.990
Mr. Jung, I need you to come with me.

571
00:31:37.212 --> 00:31:38.890
I feel falsely accused.

572
00:31:40.215 --> 00:31:42.060
Let me say this one more time.

573
00:31:42.284 --> 00:31:44.260
We didn't copy their proposal.

574
00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:47.900
Chef Jung isn't someone who would steal others' ideas.

575
00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:49.700
- I'm not that type either. - That's enough.

576
00:31:49.724 --> 00:31:51.640
Where is Mr. Jung?

577
00:31:56.965 --> 00:31:58.240
Mr. Jung is here.

578
00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:05.790
Chef Jung.

579
00:32:07.709 --> 00:32:09.190
Finally, you're here.

580
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:11.090
I thought you were the kind of person...

581
00:32:11.112 --> 00:32:13.760
who would cowardly lay blame on that intern.

582
00:32:14.482 --> 00:32:16.160
We don't need to hear it anymore.

583
00:32:16.217 --> 00:32:18.730
Just admit what you did and leave the company.

584
00:32:18.787 --> 00:32:21.600
This is an unprecedented unethical case.

585
00:32:21.957 --> 00:32:24.570
You brought disgrace on the company and Chairman Kevin.

586
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.040
Mr. Jung,

587
00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:29.040
did you really plagiarize Chef No's proposal?

588
00:32:38.139 --> 00:32:40.250
If two people made identical proposals,

589
00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.690
it means one of them has stolen the other's idea.

590
00:32:44.412 --> 00:32:46.760
I'm saying either I or Chef No would have done such thing.

591
00:32:46.848 --> 00:32:49.650
Exactly. That means you did it.

592
00:32:49.651 --> 00:32:51.260
Aren't you ashamed...

593
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.300
to say that as a chef?

594
00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:56.570
What are you talking about? You know who I am.

595
00:32:56.891 --> 00:32:59.140
Unlike you who used your connections to join the company,

596
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.960
I'm a competent chef...

597
00:33:00.962 --> 00:33:02.460
who is hired fair and square.

598
00:33:02.464 --> 00:33:04.910
Then why did you install this?

599
00:33:10.672 --> 00:33:13.020
Chef No, they found it.

600
00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:19.190
What... What is that?

601
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.000
He used this camera to keep an eye on every move.

602
00:33:24.519 --> 00:33:27.070
He stole my recipes using this.

603
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:29.070
Is that true, Chef No?

604
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.040
Please don't let him fool you.

605
00:33:34.696 --> 00:33:37.240
He's trying to fool you with that...

606
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:40.050
as he's driven to the last ditch.

607
00:33:40.201 --> 00:33:43.250
Do you really believe so? Then let me prove...

608
00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:45.250
that you're the culprit.

609
00:33:50.745 --> 00:33:51.890
What do you think you're doing?

610
00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:54.890
There must be video files you recorded with the camera.

611
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.660
Am I wrong?

612
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:08.740
He is trying...

613
00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:12.680
to deviate from the truth with such a ridiculous claim.

614
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.020
Open it,

615
00:34:20.575 --> 00:34:21.620
Chef No.

616
00:34:22.444 --> 00:34:24.160
If you're really innocent, open it.

617
00:35:06.721 --> 00:35:09.000
You're right! I copied it.

618
00:35:09.491 --> 00:35:10.770
I did it!

619
00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:15.040
But you can't blame me.

620
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.810
If you didn't...

621
00:35:17.132 --> 00:35:19.450
favor him in the first place,

622
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.920
I would've never done this!

623
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.350
You all...

624
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:26.690
have made me like this.

625
00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:28.290
You all...

626
00:35:28.977 --> 00:35:31.660
have the blames too. Get it?

627
00:35:36.151 --> 00:35:37.500
Chef No.

628
00:36:12.954 --> 00:36:14.100
Yeon Ju.

629
00:36:14.289 --> 00:36:18.100
Why are you stuck in your room? You haven't eaten anything.

630
00:36:18.226 --> 00:36:20.240
You're worrying me.

631
00:36:21.162 --> 00:36:23.810
How could I eat now when things are so messed up?

632
00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:26.760
I'll give you money, so call all your friends,

633
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:30.030
go to a club or something, and have fun...

634
00:36:30.038 --> 00:36:31.720
to relieve stress.

635
00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:40.130
Tell me...

636
00:36:40.748 --> 00:36:42.430
what's on your mind.

637
00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:46.470
Mom.

638
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:50.600
No matter how much I think about it, I can't live without So Won.

639
00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:53.740
But I also can't raise someone else's child.

640
00:36:53.861 --> 00:36:55.580
I might try if her mother's dead.

641
00:36:56.764 --> 00:36:59.950
She's the one So Won loved so much.

642
00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:02.520
When I think of her,

643
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:05.620
I can never raise the child.

644
00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:07.390
So?

645
00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:09.490
I gave him the final notice.

646
00:37:10.245 --> 00:37:12.730
I told him if he doesn't give up on the child, I'm going to die.

647
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:16.000
My gosh. You've gone too far.

648
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.070
Don't back him into a corner.

649
00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.450
Don't corner him so much.

650
00:37:21.456 --> 00:37:23.820
What if he decides to go wander off?

651
00:37:23.825 --> 00:37:26.140
That's why I'm going crazy.

652
00:37:26.427 --> 00:37:29.910
I can't tell what's on his mind.

653
00:37:30.231 --> 00:37:31.440
Don't stress yourself.

654
00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:34.080
I know how you feel now,

655
00:37:34.135 --> 00:37:36.670
so I'll clear things up.

656
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.950
Just do as I say.

657
00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:54.600
- You witch. - Oh, my.

658
00:37:54.956 --> 00:37:57.090
You were so mean to her in the past.

659
00:37:57.091 --> 00:37:58.640
That's why your daughter can't get pregnant.

660
00:37:58.926 --> 00:38:00.910
Try your best to run away.

661
00:38:00.995 --> 00:38:02.760
Your daughter or any other offspring...

662
00:38:02.764 --> 00:38:05.180
will never be able to get pregnant!

663
00:38:07.402 --> 00:38:10.020
Oh, my goodness. How harsh.

664
00:38:11.406 --> 00:38:12.590
Gosh.

665
00:38:12.974 --> 00:38:15.220
Like mother, like daughter.

666
00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:18.160
Even her life is like mine.

667
00:38:18.746 --> 00:38:21.110
I can't believe even my daughter...

668
00:38:21.115 --> 00:38:23.060
gets someone else's child.

669
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:26.830
This is so harsh. Seriously.

670
00:38:27.955 --> 00:38:29.140
Gosh.

671
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:30.770
My goodness.

672
00:38:31.726 --> 00:38:32.870
Chairwoman.

673
00:38:33.695 --> 00:38:35.020
Attorney Park is here.

674
00:38:35.029 --> 00:38:37.190
Okay. Bring me some tea.

675
00:38:37.198 --> 00:38:38.240
Yes, ma'am.

676
00:38:41.536 --> 00:38:45.790
Have you worked on what I told you?

677
00:38:45.907 --> 00:38:47.850
I've requested provisional attachment already this morning.

678
00:38:48.509 --> 00:38:50.740
He'll get notice in two weeks.

679
00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.060
Good job.

680
00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:54.510
The result will be out by tomorrow.

681
00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:55.900
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

682
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.260
Chairwoman.

683
00:38:57.852 --> 00:38:59.000
Are you...

684
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.100
sure about this?

685
00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:04.240
I never say empty words.

686
00:39:04.826 --> 00:39:07.260
This is the only way...

687
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:08.590
to pressure So Won,

688
00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:10.680
so make sure to get things done.

689
00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:27.790
Hey, So Won.

690
00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:32.320
What are you doing here?

691
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.880
Dad told me you went to the dentist.

692
00:39:34.889 --> 00:39:36.140
What about the hospital?

693
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.770
I emptied the schedule.

694
00:39:38.493 --> 00:39:39.990
Is Han Gyul getting treated?

695
00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:42.540
Yes. She has many cavities.

696
00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:49.950
Was it scary? It's over now. You did well.

697
00:39:53.341 --> 00:39:56.490
Was it that scary? You did great.

698
00:40:01.783 --> 00:40:03.200
Go to your dad.

699
00:40:04.752 --> 00:40:07.820
Don't worry. I'll be right beside you.

700
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:09.540
Don't cry and get treated well.

701
00:40:14.595 --> 00:40:17.380
Open your mouth.

702
00:40:19.801 --> 00:40:23.720
Han Gyul. Open your mouth.

703
00:40:45.993 --> 00:40:48.410
She's facing it well.

704
00:41:07.348 --> 00:41:08.390
Eun Joo.

705
00:41:09.784 --> 00:41:11.160
Ha Eun Joo.

706
00:41:20.862 --> 00:41:23.130
Catch me if you can.

707
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:24.240
Come here.

708
00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:27.050
Watch out. Be careful.

709
00:41:30.304 --> 00:41:31.350
Fine.

710
00:41:32.406 --> 00:41:33.690
If things don't work out,

711
00:41:34.942 --> 00:41:37.790
this will be my last card.

712
00:41:45.286 --> 00:41:47.600
Don't touch it. It's mine.

713
00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:00.010
Han Gyul...

714
00:42:00.301 --> 00:42:03.020
can't get along with other children.

715
00:42:04.472 --> 00:42:06.890
She was abandoned alone for too long.

716
00:42:07.542 --> 00:42:08.790
How could Su Mi...

717
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.360
not look after her child?

718
00:42:11.479 --> 00:42:13.560
She must've suffered a lot financially because of the baby...

719
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.560
after she broke up with me.

720
00:42:16.717 --> 00:42:19.070
She ended up using the hospital funds.

721
00:42:19.654 --> 00:42:21.050
She asked her sister to take care of Han Gyul...

722
00:42:21.055 --> 00:42:22.470
as she was being chased by the police,

723
00:42:25.693 --> 00:42:27.310
but her sister didn't take good care of Han Gyul.

724
00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:31.690
She grew up all alone in a dumping ground-like place...

725
00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:34.180
when she needed her parents the most.

726
00:42:34.902 --> 00:42:36.670
No one taught her anything...

727
00:42:36.671 --> 00:42:38.750
that she talks disrespectfully to everyone.

728
00:42:38.906 --> 00:42:41.650
She can't get along with other children.

729
00:42:43.444 --> 00:42:44.890
I'm really worried.

730
00:42:45.112 --> 00:42:46.290
I know.

731
00:42:47.114 --> 00:42:49.430
It hurt me so much in the dentist office.

732
00:42:51.619 --> 00:42:53.700
When I went to volunteer while I was in school,

733
00:42:54.455 --> 00:42:57.140
no matter how painful the treatment is,

734
00:42:58.759 --> 00:43:01.270
the children at the orphanage don't even say a word.

735
00:43:03.464 --> 00:43:05.440
They know there's no one to calm them down...

736
00:43:08.469 --> 00:43:09.850
by their instincts.

737
00:43:10.805 --> 00:43:12.280
That's why...

738
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.790
she endured it in the dentist.

739
00:43:16.944 --> 00:43:18.060
Mom.

740
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.930
I don't know what kind of person I am.

741
00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:26.170
I showed off to everyone...

742
00:43:26.454 --> 00:43:28.320
and lived so arrogantly...

743
00:43:28.322 --> 00:43:30.370
as if I have everything in the world.

744
00:43:33.761 --> 00:43:35.240
But my child...

745
00:43:35.997 --> 00:43:38.310
suffered in agony without me knowing.

746
00:43:41.902 --> 00:43:44.350
I don't know if I deserve to...

747
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:46.220
live anymore.

748
00:43:48.676 --> 00:43:49.790
That's okay.

749
00:43:51.112 --> 00:43:53.060
This is how you become a parent.

750
00:43:55.016 --> 00:43:58.330
Han Gyul has a long life ahead of her.

751
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.200
If what you couldn't have done for her hurts you,

752
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.870
fill her life with more love,

753
00:44:05.993 --> 00:44:07.640
and treat her even more nicely.

754
00:44:09.997 --> 00:44:11.580
From now on,

755
00:44:11.999 --> 00:44:15.080
don't try to run away,

756
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.090
and be her father. Okay?

757
00:44:34.055 --> 00:44:35.700
You don't like this?

758
00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:37.870
Then...

759
00:44:39.226 --> 00:44:40.610
What about this one?

760
00:44:41.362 --> 00:44:43.810
Do you like this? This is cute.

761
00:44:44.265 --> 00:44:47.250
This is cute. It's wearing a skirt.

762
00:44:56.844 --> 00:44:59.290
You dressed up nicely today. Where have you been?

763
00:45:03.017 --> 00:45:05.430
What are you hiding?

764
00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.470
I bought it in front of the hospital.

765
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.540
Is that for your daughter?

766
00:45:21.535 --> 00:45:24.450
You came to talk to me behind Yeon Ju's back, right?

767
00:45:24.472 --> 00:45:26.290
My precious daughter finds it...

768
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.460
hard to sleep and eat,

769
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.260
and grows thinner every day.

770
00:45:31.846 --> 00:45:35.160
But I guess you're enjoying your time with your daughter.

771
00:45:37.885 --> 00:45:40.430
I no longer can stand this.

772
00:45:40.554 --> 00:45:42.870
We should have it out today.

773
00:45:43.424 --> 00:45:46.310
Ms. Hong knelt in front of me...

774
00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:48.540
and begged me...

775
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.910
to let you raise your daughter.

776
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.080
But my answer is no.

777
00:45:55.102 --> 00:45:58.350
The rest is all up to you.

778
00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:13.830
(Consensual divorce intention confirmation document)

779
00:46:15.322 --> 00:46:18.320
I've taken a legal measure to keep you from selling...

780
00:46:18.325 --> 00:46:22.140
all the estates, bonds, assets, and even deposits you have.

781
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.240
As soon as you sign on the document,

782
00:46:25.533 --> 00:46:28.680
you'll be kicked out of my house with empty hands.

783
00:46:29.303 --> 00:46:32.020
However, if you decide to leave your daughter...

784
00:46:32.173 --> 00:46:34.290
to your parents,

785
00:46:34.408 --> 00:46:37.790
I promise to give you a full financial support.

786
00:46:37.978 --> 00:46:40.480
If you want to study abroad,

787
00:46:40.481 --> 00:46:43.400
I'll let you do so. Make a choice.

788
00:46:44.151 --> 00:46:46.830
Are you going to choose my daughter or your daughter?

789
00:46:47.154 --> 00:46:48.370
What do you say?

790
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.280
Hey, you'd better lie low.

791
00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:07.390
You can never be sure that you'd beat me again.

792
00:47:07.675 --> 00:47:09.120
You know how small this industry is.

793
00:47:09.743 --> 00:47:12.290
I'll make sure to pay you back next time.

794
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.330
Don't copy mine then.

795
00:47:15.616 --> 00:47:17.500
Don't worry. I won't.

796
00:47:23.891 --> 00:47:25.640
Gosh. Why did he glare at me like that?

797
00:47:26.193 --> 00:47:28.040
He didn't scare me at all. Help me, Ru Ri.

798
00:47:28.062 --> 00:47:29.980
I think he'll get back at me for snitching on him.

799
00:47:31.532 --> 00:47:34.350
- Dear me! - Hold on, Mr. Kim.

800
00:47:34.902 --> 00:47:36.680
I'm sorry. It's my fault!

801
00:47:38.405 --> 00:47:39.890
Am I okay? Is my cheek okay?

802
00:47:43.077 --> 00:47:44.120
What is that?

803
00:47:45.212 --> 00:47:46.260
What is this?

804
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:50.550
(New menu proposal for Christmas, Pork Neck Love Set)

805
00:47:50.551 --> 00:47:52.200
Pork Neck Love Set?

806
00:47:55.222 --> 00:47:56.270
Come in.

807
00:48:01.996 --> 00:48:04.130
Sir, the first round of the presentation...

808
00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:05.950
for Christmas promotion is over.

809
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.050
How did it go?

810
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:10.620
There was a problem, but it went pretty well.

811
00:48:10.804 --> 00:48:12.020
A problem?

812
00:48:12.172 --> 00:48:14.020
It's too trivial to concern you.

813
00:48:14.074 --> 00:48:16.720
- I see. What's the result then? - As you expected,

814
00:48:17.444 --> 00:48:19.120
Jung Tae Yang's proposal is selected.

815
00:48:21.115 --> 00:48:23.830
Actually, I was going over his proposal, and it's interesting.

816
00:48:23.851 --> 00:48:25.600
You really have an eye for people.

817
00:48:25.786 --> 00:48:28.570
He's very competent and decent.

818
00:48:28.923 --> 00:48:30.140
I'm happy to hear that.

819
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:33.110
Let's go and congratulate him on his success.

820
00:48:38.132 --> 00:48:40.350
Chef No! Chef No!

821
00:48:46.974 --> 00:48:49.290
Thank you for holding the sack.

822
00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:51.790
You know...

823
00:48:51.979 --> 00:48:53.830
- why I did so, right? - Of course I do.

824
00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:57.260
I'll reward you handsomely as I promised.

825
00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:59.820
You know how important it is to have a quick wit...

826
00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.370
in such urgent situations.

827
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:05.770
Lastly, let me tell you something.

828
00:49:06.927 --> 00:49:08.010
Ae Ri,

829
00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:10.640
you always have your way thanks to the silver spoon in your mouth.

830
00:49:11.999 --> 00:49:13.250
But you must be careful.

831
00:49:15.903 --> 00:49:18.320
- What? - You must be careful.

832
00:49:31.118 --> 00:49:32.160
Chef No,

833
00:49:32.886 --> 00:49:34.930
do you think your lousy menu will be selected?

834
00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:39.300
It's Chef Jung's proposal. Learn from this.

835
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.810
Why are you giving this to me?

836
00:49:43.364 --> 00:49:47.150
Some imitations are even better than their originals.

837
00:49:47.801 --> 00:49:49.010
Copy the whole proposal.

838
00:49:50.537 --> 00:49:51.620
This is unbelievable.

839
00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:54.350
Was Manager Joo behind all this?

840
00:49:54.942 --> 00:49:57.460
Wait. I must not be sitting here now.

841
00:49:58.078 --> 00:49:59.320
Where are you going?

842
00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.030
I'll tell the director who's really responsible for this.

843
00:50:05.919 --> 00:50:07.270
You did a good job.

844
00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:10.370
I almost got you wrong.

845
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:13.540
You almost got us wrong? How ridiculous.

846
00:50:13.694 --> 00:50:14.910
Can you still say that in front of this?

847
00:50:21.702 --> 00:50:22.850
We need to talk.

848
00:50:27.041 --> 00:50:28.120
Wait.

849
00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:30.890
I can explain. Please wait.

850
00:50:31.578 --> 00:50:33.760
She's such an obnoxious wench.

851
00:50:34.014 --> 00:50:36.160
Don't worry.

852
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:37.760
That wench is doomed.

853
00:50:42.423 --> 00:50:44.040
It's just as I expected.

854
00:50:45.192 --> 00:50:47.740
Please wait, Chef Jung. Wait!

855
00:50:48.262 --> 00:50:49.980
What's going on?

856
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:53.680
Please wait. Please hear me out.

857
00:50:55.035 --> 00:50:56.120
Chef Jung.

858
00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:57.950
Please spare me some moment.

859
00:50:57.971 --> 00:51:00.350
- I can explain everything. - There's no need to.

860
00:51:00.908 --> 00:51:02.150
Just listen to me.

861
00:51:12.786 --> 00:51:14.270
- This is... - Exactly.

862
00:51:14.655 --> 00:51:16.290
You colluded with him...

863
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.600
and put hair in the pasta to drive Ru Ri out.

864
00:51:19.193 --> 00:51:20.640
I knew it from the beginning.

865
00:51:21.995 --> 00:51:23.080
Moreover,

866
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.410
you stole my proposal.

867
00:51:26.467 --> 00:51:29.010
You won't be able to be bailed out this time...

868
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.120
even if you're Chairman's daughter.

869
00:51:31.705 --> 00:51:34.090
So what are you going to do?

870
00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:37.120
Will you tell everything to Dad?

871
00:51:37.444 --> 00:51:39.610
You want to throw me out by making me lose my dad's favor.

872
00:51:39.613 --> 00:51:41.230
Is that why you took me here?

873
00:51:43.717 --> 00:51:44.760
Maybe not.

874
00:51:45.452 --> 00:51:48.100
You wouldn't have wanted to talk to me privately if that was the plan.

875
00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:51.940
What is it?

876
00:51:52.693 --> 00:51:54.540
What do you really want from me?

877
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:56.910
Would you...

878
00:51:58.232 --> 00:52:00.180
turn a blind eye if I give you money?

879
00:52:02.803 --> 00:52:04.080
How much do you want?

880
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.720
Tell me how much I should give you...

881
00:52:08.842 --> 00:52:09.890
What are you doing?

882
00:52:20.654 --> 00:52:23.240
If you keep bullying the team members including Ru Ri,

883
00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:26.410
I won't let it slide.

884
00:52:27.995 --> 00:52:29.410
Stop being nasty.

885
00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:31.180
This is the last chance.

886
00:52:31.832 --> 00:52:33.150
There's no third chance.

887
00:52:37.037 --> 00:52:39.570
What is it? What is it you want from me?

888
00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:41.620
What are you doing this to me for?

889
00:52:42.342 --> 00:52:44.260
I'm not letting it go because of you.

890
00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:47.060
I'm doing this for the chairman.

891
00:52:48.282 --> 00:52:50.330
Don't tarnish his reputation anymore.

892
00:53:01.862 --> 00:53:02.910
Thank goodness.

893
00:53:21.014 --> 00:53:23.830
Is this the problem you've mentioned earlier?

894
00:53:24.651 --> 00:53:25.700
I apologize.

895
00:53:26.153 --> 00:53:27.870
My goodness.

896
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.470
Call Ae Ri over to my office.

897
00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:40.750
The man in Mom's necklace. It's Tae Yang's birth father, right?

898
00:53:48.242 --> 00:53:49.990
Why are you looking at the photo again?

899
00:54:06.593 --> 00:54:10.310
Didn't you keep it to show Tae Yang someday?

900
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:13.510
I didn't think he was alive back then.

901
00:54:14.635 --> 00:54:17.080
But now that I know he is,

902
00:54:18.038 --> 00:54:19.450
there's no need to keep it anymore.

903
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.120
Honey,

904
00:54:21.908 --> 00:54:24.290
do you know the best way to keep a secret?

905
00:54:26.713 --> 00:54:28.230
It's not to have any secrets.

906
00:54:29.449 --> 00:54:32.300
Why don't you tell everything to Tae Yang instead?

907
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.770
He must want to know who his biological father is,

908
00:54:37.324 --> 00:54:39.500
although he has never said that because he's so considerate.

909
00:54:39.693 --> 00:54:40.870
I can't do that.

910
00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:43.410
It's already sad enough that he grew up without father.

911
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:46.850
It's too harsh to tell him that his dad was an alcoholic,

912
00:54:47.634 --> 00:54:50.450
and I even tried to kill him.

913
00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:55.120
It's better to leave him as a great father in his imagination.

914
00:54:55.742 --> 00:54:58.740
What if he finds out about him by accident?

915
00:54:58.745 --> 00:55:00.180
What about the shock he'll get from it?

916
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.930
I'll try to stop that from happening,

917
00:55:04.151 --> 00:55:06.260
but if it's his fate, there's nothing I can do.

918
00:55:08.722 --> 00:55:09.870
Okay.

919
00:55:10.791 --> 00:55:12.950
I was worried about the picture.

920
00:55:12.959 --> 00:55:14.040
It's good that you got rid of it.

921
00:55:14.594 --> 00:55:15.710
Let's...

922
00:55:16.129 --> 00:55:19.140
end it with the past for good.

923
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.110
Justice prevails. Revenge never dies.

924
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:32.510
Cheers to our new recipe, Pork Neck Love Set.

925
00:55:32.512 --> 00:55:34.160
- Cheers. - Cheers.

926
00:55:34.381 --> 00:55:37.500
Good job today. It's on me. Enjoy it tonight.

927
00:55:37.551 --> 00:55:38.760
- Great. - Yes, sir.

928
00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:46.300
Hey, Lee Ru Ri.

929
00:55:47.861 --> 00:55:50.310
Beer tastes so good today.

930
00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:51.590
Excuse me.

931
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:54.360
Here you go. Your beer.

932
00:55:54.368 --> 00:55:56.450
- Great. - Hey, Ru Ri.

933
00:55:56.803 --> 00:55:58.420
They have an event today.

934
00:55:58.572 --> 00:56:01.300
You get one free if you drink this at once.

935
00:56:01.308 --> 00:56:02.550
You're right.

936
00:56:03.477 --> 00:56:04.560
I'll give it a shot.

937
00:56:04.978 --> 00:56:06.010
I'll try.

938
00:56:06.012 --> 00:56:09.950
Beer goes in with no problem

939
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.380
You keep making me dance

940
00:56:12.386 --> 00:56:14.820
Look at my shoulders They're disjointed

941
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:18.640
Bottoms up from outside the village

942
00:56:18.658 --> 00:56:21.490
Another shot when the flower blooms

943
00:56:21.495 --> 00:56:26.680
21 shot, shot shot

944
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.180
Everybody

945
00:56:29.403 --> 00:56:31.850
Hey, stop drinking.

946
00:56:32.572 --> 00:56:34.950
Hey, look at your belly.

947
00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:37.240
Don't stop her.

948
00:56:37.244 --> 00:56:39.790
Ru Ri drinks a lot when she's excited.

949
00:56:39.846 --> 00:56:41.940
Her nickname at school was...

950
00:56:41.948 --> 00:56:43.780
a Drinking Hippo.

951
00:56:43.784 --> 00:56:45.930
Of course it was nonalcoholic.

952
00:56:48.622 --> 00:56:51.270
Drinking Hippo on top of a pig.

953
00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:55.060
I have to earn a lot to feed her.

954
00:56:55.061 --> 00:56:58.630
Are you saying you're going to...

955
00:56:58.632 --> 00:57:00.580
My goodness.

956
00:57:02.002 --> 00:57:03.420
Mission accomplished!

957
00:57:05.572 --> 00:57:08.020
Excuse me. Recharge.

958
00:57:08.675 --> 00:57:09.740
Are you that happy?

959
00:57:09.743 --> 00:57:12.820
Yes, I am. I'm so excited.

960
00:57:13.013 --> 00:57:15.080
I know you did most of the work,

961
00:57:15.081 --> 00:57:17.900
and Myung Rang helped me too,

962
00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:19.780
but it's my first time...

963
00:57:19.786 --> 00:57:21.270
being acknowledged for what I did.

964
00:57:22.422 --> 00:57:23.870
You did a great job today.

965
00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:26.870
Actually, the sauce did all the job.

966
00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.540
I only placed pork neck...

967
00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:30.730
on top of your sauce.

968
00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:32.180
Not at all.

969
00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:50.600
Why did you call me, Dad?

970
00:57:52.819 --> 00:57:53.870
He knows what happened...

971
00:57:54.421 --> 00:57:57.100
with Jung Tae Yang.

972
00:57:59.426 --> 00:58:01.310
Dad, actually...

973
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:06.440
Get on the next flight to LA.

974
00:58:07.601 --> 00:58:08.750
Dad.

975
00:58:13.173 --> 00:58:15.020
Don't come back until I call you.

976
00:58:15.342 --> 00:58:17.890
Don't even think about working in the company.

977
00:58:19.279 --> 00:58:21.240
Take her to the airport tomorrow,

978
00:58:21.248 --> 00:58:22.560
and make sure she gets on the flight.

979
00:58:23.283 --> 00:58:24.700
You're so mean.

980
00:58:25.952 --> 00:58:28.330
You wouldn't do this if I were your real daughter.

981
00:58:29.689 --> 00:58:31.740
You're so nice to Jung Tae Yang,

982
00:58:32.058 --> 00:58:33.410
but why are you so mean to me?

983
00:58:33.593 --> 00:58:35.590
We're both not related to you,

984
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:37.180
but why do you hate me so much?

985
00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:39.840
Fine.

986
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:42.850
If that's what you want,

987
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:46.520
I'll disappear from your sight for good.

988
00:58:54.614 --> 00:58:56.330
Give her one more chance.

989
00:58:57.751 --> 00:59:00.200
That won't change her.

990
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.730
I'm sick of getting disappointed in her.

991
00:59:04.424 --> 00:59:05.940
When her mom died,

992
00:59:06.259 --> 00:59:08.470
I promised to take care of her.

993
00:59:10.497 --> 00:59:12.580
I must not be qualified as a parent.

994
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.110
It's been 15 years since I served you.

995
00:59:16.202 --> 00:59:17.250
I've also...

996
00:59:18.171 --> 00:59:19.880
seen Ae Ri grow.

997
00:59:20.907 --> 00:59:24.220
She might change if she has a boyfriend.

998
00:59:24.911 --> 00:59:26.560
Good people affect others.

999
00:59:27.514 --> 00:59:28.730
A boyfriend?

1000
00:59:28.882 --> 00:59:30.430
If you think of...

1001
00:59:30.717 --> 00:59:32.860
Jung Tae Yang as your successor,

1002
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.700
it'd be a good idea to make him see Ae Ri.

1003
00:59:37.724 --> 00:59:40.040
Right. Jung Tae Yang.

1004
00:59:43.763 --> 00:59:48.000
I'll be your star

1005
00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:51.950
I'll always make you happy

1006
00:59:51.972 --> 00:59:54.690
Acting and singing

1007
00:59:54.808 --> 00:59:59.010
And even comedy for you

1008
00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:01.790
I've never seen anyone getting so drunk from nonalcoholic drink.

1009
01:00:03.216 --> 01:00:05.000
Thank you, Chef Jung.

1010
01:00:05.452 --> 01:00:08.320
My life changed...

1011
01:00:08.321 --> 01:00:10.470
since the moment I met you.

1012
01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:12.640
Are you happy to have met me?

1013
01:00:12.726 --> 01:00:13.770
Of course.

1014
01:00:14.227 --> 01:00:15.870
I'm so happy.

1015
01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.410
I'm good at something.

1016
01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.410
I feel like I'm a good person,

1017
01:00:21.635 --> 01:00:23.450
and I even feel confident.

1018
01:00:25.171 --> 01:00:26.890
You gave me so much,

1019
01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.650
but I don't have anything to give you.

1020
01:00:30.243 --> 01:00:33.010
Only if I could do it, I want to make you laugh...

1021
01:00:33.013 --> 01:00:36.490
by doing something funny like the song says...

1022
01:00:43.923 --> 01:00:45.370
Be careful, Dummy.

1023
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.950
I...

1024
01:00:55.802 --> 01:00:57.180
like you.

1025
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.060
I really like you.

1026
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.260
Lee Ru Ri.

1027
01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:09.990
Raise your head.

1028
01:01:14.654 --> 01:01:17.100
What am I going to do with you?

1029
01:01:18.725 --> 01:01:21.010
You just come on to me.

1030
01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:24.680
Gosh.

1031
01:01:32.472 --> 01:01:33.520
You're beautiful.

1032
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.560
Also, you can make me laugh.

1033
01:01:42.082 --> 01:01:43.190
This is funny.

1034
01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.950
Romantic, comedy, romantic, comedy.

1035
01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:48.500
Seriously.

1036
01:02:22.055 --> 01:02:23.230
Did I scare you?

1037
01:02:23.923 --> 01:02:25.140
No.

1038
01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:27.990
No. I'm good.

1039
01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.040
Come on.

1040
01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.930
You eat so well, Han Gyul.

1041
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:53.100
You have to eat a lot...

1042
01:02:53.153 --> 01:02:55.330
to be a great person like me, your dad.

1043
01:02:56.422 --> 01:02:57.540
You idiot.

1044
01:02:58.424 --> 01:03:01.490
Grandma, Aunt, Grandpa.

1045
01:03:01.494 --> 01:03:03.680
Han Gyul. Do you get it?

1046
01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:08.950
Lee Ru Ri.

1047
01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:11.620
Why do you come home so late these days?

1048
01:03:11.671 --> 01:03:12.820
Pardon?

1049
01:03:14.574 --> 01:03:16.490
I told Mom.

1050
01:03:16.576 --> 01:03:18.740
She's been working late...

1051
01:03:18.745 --> 01:03:20.560
to develop a new recipe.

1052
01:03:20.947 --> 01:03:23.650
You're only an intern. Why do you have so much to do?

1053
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:24.930
Why do you have to work late?

1054
01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:28.600
All you do is making coffee and photocopying.

1055
01:03:28.788 --> 01:03:30.420
No, that's not true.

1056
01:03:30.423 --> 01:03:31.920
What do you mean?

1057
01:03:31.925 --> 01:03:33.500
I also worked in a company before.

1058
01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:37.080
You need to know your position.

1059
01:03:37.197 --> 01:03:39.690
You're going to be intern forever...

1060
01:03:39.699 --> 01:03:41.350
I might become a regular employee soon.

1061
01:03:41.634 --> 01:03:43.180
Really?

1062
01:03:43.703 --> 01:03:45.720
Are you becoming a regular employee now?

1063
01:03:48.842 --> 01:03:50.890
My goodness.

1064
01:03:50.977 --> 01:03:53.220
Do you believe her?

1065
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:56.560
She can't even cook ramyeon.

1066
01:03:56.783 --> 01:03:58.750
I'll eat my hat...

1067
01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.550
if she becomes a regular employee at a food company.

1068
01:04:00.553 --> 01:04:03.470
- You'll have to eat your hat then. - What?

1069
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:07.410
My recipe was chosen as the new menu for Christmas.

1070
01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:09.310
Oh, my. Really?

1071
01:04:09.529 --> 01:04:12.240
That's amazing.

1072
01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:15.350
You made so much mess in the kitchen making the sauce.

1073
01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:17.250
That's great.

1074
01:04:17.904 --> 01:04:19.520
See?

1075
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.850
Stop discouraging her.

1076
01:04:23.176 --> 01:04:25.610
She can be as good as So Won.

1077
01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:28.430
Who are you comparing her to?

1078
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:32.110
So Won just had a little scandal,

1079
01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:34.050
but as soon as this is over,

1080
01:04:34.053 --> 01:04:35.970
he'll be the best son in Korea.

1081
01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.870
In other words,

1082
01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:39.870
he's the son that everyone wants.

1083
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.310
My gosh.

1084
01:04:42.729 --> 01:04:43.780
You're right.

1085
01:04:44.364 --> 01:04:46.440
This should end well.

1086
01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:57.060
It's Mrs. Yang.

1087
01:05:00.213 --> 01:05:02.010
Hello? How are you?

1088
01:05:02.015 --> 01:05:03.900
Did you have breakfast?

1089
01:05:04.717 --> 01:05:07.600
Pardon? Today?

1090
01:05:08.721 --> 01:05:12.470
Yes. Sure. I'll be there.

1091
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.580
It's the D-day.

1092
01:05:18.865 --> 01:05:20.810
How did she sound?

1093
01:05:20.967 --> 01:05:22.080
It was good.

1094
01:05:22.635 --> 01:05:25.580
I think it's going as we hoped.

1095
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:38.330
It's your choice.

1096
01:05:38.885 --> 01:05:41.600
Are you going to choose my daughter or your daughter?

1097
01:05:50.496 --> 01:05:51.810
I'll help you.

1098
01:05:56.669 --> 01:05:58.450
You look thinner.

1099
01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:02.390
Make sure to have good lunch.

1100
01:06:05.244 --> 01:06:06.290
What?

1101
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.600
Is it weird that I'm being nice to you after all that crying?

1102
01:06:11.284 --> 01:06:13.000
I thought...

1103
01:06:13.453 --> 01:06:15.830
you're suffering as much as I am.

1104
01:06:16.823 --> 01:06:18.200
I want to...

1105
01:06:19.092 --> 01:06:21.370
I want to help you relax as much as I can.

1106
01:06:26.532 --> 01:06:27.650
But...

1107
01:06:31.304 --> 01:06:33.280
I'm going to trust you until the end.

1108
01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:37.160
You're not going to leave me, are you?

1109
01:06:43.016 --> 01:06:44.160
You look handsome...

1110
01:06:45.118 --> 01:06:46.300
every time.

1111
01:06:49.722 --> 01:06:52.600
- I'll get going. - Come home early.

1112
01:06:53.726 --> 01:06:55.370
I'll have dinner ready.

1113
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.120
What?

1114
01:07:11.244 --> 01:07:12.290
You look beautiful.

1115
01:07:40.673 --> 01:07:42.190
Where are you going?

1116
01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:44.760
Right.

1117
01:07:45.344 --> 01:07:47.830
I'm going to meet someone.

1118
01:07:48.514 --> 01:07:51.500
Stay with the maid at home.

1119
01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.330
Are you going to meet Dad?

1120
01:07:54.921 --> 01:07:56.230
No, it's not Dad.

1121
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:06.140
No, Han Gyul.

1122
01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.720
Am I pretty? I want to go meet Dad too.

1123
01:08:11.537 --> 01:08:12.880
My goodness.

1124
01:08:13.473 --> 01:08:15.290
You love Dad so much.

1125
01:08:30.423 --> 01:08:33.200
Don't come into this room until I call you.

1126
01:08:44.971 --> 01:08:47.150
Why did you want to see me today?

1127
01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.860
If it's about the child,

1128
01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.030
I promise you once again.

1129
01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:57.300
As it was written on the memorandum,

1130
01:08:57.583 --> 01:08:59.800
Yeon Ju will never have to worry...

1131
01:08:59.919 --> 01:09:01.470
Please shut your mouth.

1132
01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:04.470
Someone else will do the talking.

1133
01:09:05.191 --> 01:09:07.290
Pardon? Who are you talking about?

1134
01:09:07.293 --> 01:09:11.140
Someone's on the way here to talk about the final decision.

1135
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.450
Yes.

1136
01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:21.650
- So Won. - Father.

1137
01:09:21.841 --> 01:09:23.220
Don't be surprised.

1138
01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:25.410
I called all of you today...

1139
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.260
to end it here.

1140
01:09:27.713 --> 01:09:30.210
I see. That's a great idea.

1141
01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:32.400
Come sit here.

1142
01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.310
So...

1143
01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:46.240
have you thought about my offer?

1144
01:09:46.999 --> 01:09:49.680
Offer? What offer did she make?

1145
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:53.080
Yes. I've made up my mind.

1146
01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:54.890
What is it?

1147
01:09:57.009 --> 01:09:59.190
It's fine. Tell me quickly.

1148
01:09:59.845 --> 01:10:02.060
Is it my daughter or your daughter?

1149
01:10:02.582 --> 01:10:05.560
- Of course, it's Yeon Ju. - I...

1150
01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.270
won't divorce Yeon Ju.

1151
01:10:09.855 --> 01:10:11.140
See?

1152
01:10:11.691 --> 01:10:13.270
Obviously, he chooses Yeon Ju.

1153
01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:16.070
I see. Then...

1154
01:10:16.162 --> 01:10:19.580
are you going to leave your child to your father?

1155
01:10:20.233 --> 01:10:21.280
No.

1156
01:10:22.268 --> 01:10:24.050
I'm going to raise Han Gyul myself.

1157
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:27.290
- Hey, So Won. - What?

1158
01:10:28.107 --> 01:10:29.150
What?

1159
01:10:29.842 --> 01:10:34.430
What in the world are you talking about?

1160
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.490
Hey, what are you talking about?

1161
01:10:36.716 --> 01:10:38.200
How are you going to raise Han Gyul...

1162
01:10:38.384 --> 01:10:41.170
- if you won't divorce Yeon Ju? - Hey!

1163
01:10:42.888 --> 01:10:45.090
What are you talking about?

1164
01:10:45.091 --> 01:10:47.890
I told you to choose...

1165
01:10:47.893 --> 01:10:50.440
between my daughter and your daughter.

1166
01:10:51.063 --> 01:10:54.350
But you're going to live with my daughter and raise your daughter?

1167
01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.210
Do you think that makes sense?

1168
01:10:57.803 --> 01:10:59.720
Do you think I'd accept it?

1169
01:11:00.773 --> 01:11:01.850
So...

1170
01:11:03.809 --> 01:11:06.420
I'll move out with Yeon Ju.

1171
01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.060
What? Hey.

1172
01:11:12.218 --> 01:11:13.760
I've thought over it.

1173
01:11:14.253 --> 01:11:16.930
You told me to choose one.

1174
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:19.040
But I can't do that.

1175
01:11:19.759 --> 01:11:21.310
Both Yeon Ju and Han Gyul...

1176
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:24.610
mean so much to me.

1177
01:11:25.064 --> 01:11:26.840
You must be insane.

1178
01:11:26.966 --> 01:11:29.150
Then what about me?

1179
01:11:29.435 --> 01:11:31.220
Those two are precious,

1180
01:11:31.304 --> 01:11:34.420
but since I'm not, you're going to abandon me?

1181
01:11:34.473 --> 01:11:35.590
Mother.

1182
01:11:35.775 --> 01:11:38.520
So what you're saying is...

1183
01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:41.890
you're going to split me from my child,

1184
01:11:42.014 --> 01:11:45.430
but you're going to be happy with both of them?

1185
01:11:46.319 --> 01:11:49.400
You're really clever since you're a doctor.

1186
01:11:49.789 --> 01:11:51.970
Hey, are you even a human?

1187
01:11:52.124 --> 01:11:54.510
I've been so nice to you.

1188
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.510
Only because my daughter likes you,

1189
01:11:58.664 --> 01:12:01.500
I gave you everything including my money.

1190
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.910
How dare you say that to me!

1191
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:07.520
I'm sorry. I have no other choice.

1192
01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:12.610
Even if I move out, I'll be happy...

1193
01:12:12.611 --> 01:12:14.530
Hey. Be quiet!

1194
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.290
Follow me outside.

1195
01:12:17.049 --> 01:12:18.300
I can't do that, Father!

1196
01:12:18.484 --> 01:12:21.170
This won't change anything.

1197
01:12:21.354 --> 01:12:23.720
What? Follow me!

1198
01:12:23.723 --> 01:12:25.270
- Follow me! - Let me go!

1199
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.940
This isn't your life. It's my life.

1200
01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:31.810
You've ruined my life enough.

1201
01:12:31.964 --> 01:12:33.280
What more do you want from me?

1202
01:12:34.133 --> 01:12:36.410
Please. I beg you.

1203
01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.350
Stay out of this.

1204
01:12:40.339 --> 01:12:41.650
I'm going to...

1205
01:12:42.341 --> 01:12:43.720
live my own life.

1206
01:12:43.843 --> 01:12:45.960
What? What did you say?

1207
01:12:47.213 --> 01:12:49.430
You jerk! How dare you!

1208
01:12:54.053 --> 01:12:56.630
Hard work is wasted.

1209
01:12:56.722 --> 01:13:00.250
The child has driven him crazy.

1210
01:13:00.259 --> 01:13:01.910
He's gone crazy.

1211
01:13:14.039 --> 01:13:17.590
The love I had for you

1212
01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:19.890
When are you leaving?

1213
01:13:21.013 --> 01:13:22.890
I think the bread is going to get frozen.

1214
01:13:23.082 --> 01:13:24.600
I must be crazy.

1215
01:13:24.884 --> 01:13:27.980
I took a nap for an hour. I feel great.

1216
01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.100
Let's stay up all night.

1217
01:13:30.356 --> 01:13:33.090
My life changed...

1218
01:13:33.092 --> 01:13:35.610
the moment I met you.

1219
01:13:36.262 --> 01:13:37.760
I'll be your star

1220
01:13:37.763 --> 01:13:39.810
Nothing will...

1221
01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:42.180
stop me, not even rock... Never mind.

1222
01:13:42.568 --> 01:13:45.320
Not even a rock...

1223
01:13:45.738 --> 01:13:46.850
I'm giving up.

1224
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.190
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1225
01:13:51.277 --> 01:13:52.760
You jerk.

1226
01:13:52.912 --> 01:13:55.210
We're no longer in-laws anymore.

1227
01:13:55.214 --> 01:13:56.390
Go away.

1228
01:13:56.482 --> 01:13:59.250
- Why do you think I said that? - Let's get a divorce.

1229
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:00.820
Do you hate me?

1230
01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.720
I'm sorry.

1231
01:14:02.721 --> 01:14:04.420
He said he had an important plan.

1232
01:14:04.423 --> 01:14:07.020
Is he cheating on you with Joo Ae Ri?

1233
01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:09.140
The reason Go Jung Do's visiting our company.

1234
01:14:09.261 --> 01:14:11.510
He has a family working for our company.
