00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.341
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:30.632
We can see us,

3
00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:33.203
but humans...

4
00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:36.503
cannot see us.

5
00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:50.482
What do you think he'll die of? He looks so happy.

6
00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:53.023
Why are you suddenly pitying humans?

7
00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:56.493
You're cold-blooded and heartless.

8
00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:58.732
Blood? Heart?

9
00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:02.063
I'm not a human. I don't have those things.

10
00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:05.303
This is not like you.

11
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.773
Are you being sentimental because today is your last day?

12
00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:14.482
I hope your next partner is someone better than me.

13
00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:22.922
I'm sorry, 444.

14
00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.892
Are you hungry? What do you want to eat?

15
00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:28.723
What about a burger?

16
00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:30.023
- A burger? - Yes.

17
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.262
Gosh, there are so many people waiting.

18
00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.243
Wait in the car. I'll be right back with it.

19
00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:44.042
- Be careful. - Okay.

20
00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:51.913
Just like how humans cannot see us standing right next to them,

21
00:01:52.553 --> 00:01:56.622
they don't realize death is always there...

22
00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.592
in their lives.

23
00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:00.422
I'll get soda and...

24
00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:10.733
Here's your shrimp burger couple set.

25
00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:13.572
Stay for three more minutes.

26
00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:15.072
What?

27
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.183
What are you saying? Let go.

28
00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:22.643
Then wait for just a minute.

29
00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.613
Stay here for one more minute.

30
00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:27.013
Do you know why I dumped you?

31
00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:31.252
It's because you bring misfortune.

32
00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:34.222
Let go of me.

33
00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:47.102
Oh, my goodness!

34
00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.143
- Oh, no! - What just happened?

35
00:02:57.852 --> 00:02:59.513
Am I really dead?

36
00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.322
You're looking at it.

37
00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:06.053
I can't believe this.

38
00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:09.293
Let's go. We have a long way to go.

39
00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:22.602
Hey. What are you doing?

40
00:03:40.192 --> 00:03:41.692
Remember death.

41
00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:45.863
We're always by your side.

42
00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:50.203
(Black)

43
00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:53.002
Inside his body?

44
00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:54.442
Inside of a human body?

45
00:03:55.143 --> 00:03:56.303
Who is it? Who?

46
00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.243
There. The one at the back.

47
00:03:58.243 --> 00:03:59.613
- What? - Him.

48
00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:00.673
Where?

49
00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.513
There...

50
00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:07.213
Gosh, he didn't have to push so hard. It hurt.

51
00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.222
Where did he go anyway?

52
00:04:10.252 --> 00:04:11.523
Joon.

53
00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:14.893
Detective Han.

54
00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:17.493
Goodness! Oh, gosh.

55
00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:27.103
Who's that?

56
00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:40.312
Hello? We have an emergency.

57
00:04:47.923 --> 00:04:50.262
Kim of S Middle School committed suicide...

58
00:04:50.262 --> 00:04:53.062
by jumping off from the school rooftop today afternoon.

59
00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:57.803
He miraculously survived his another identical suicide attempt recently,

60
00:04:57.903 --> 00:05:01.403
and his death is bringing regrets to his beloved ones.

61
00:05:01.743 --> 00:05:04.543
The police is still investigating the reason of his suicide.

62
00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:07.413
However, his posts on the social media...

63
00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:09.613
and the messages he exchanged with his friends showed...

64
00:05:10.012 --> 00:05:12.952
that he was feeling pressure because of the college entrance exam.

65
00:05:13.053 --> 00:05:15.983
It seems the reason is his pessimism over his school records.

66
00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:19.392
The police is trying to find out if there were any other reasons...

67
00:05:19.392 --> 00:05:22.322
such as bullying or family trouble.

68
00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:30.762
What brings you here so late...

69
00:05:31.303 --> 00:05:33.072
after disappearing like that?

70
00:05:40.012 --> 00:05:42.413
You said Joon was...

71
00:05:42.413 --> 00:05:44.812
I mean Han Moo Gang was your first love.

72
00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:47.882
- What? - Do you still like Joon,

73
00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:51.752
Han Moo Gang... I mean, me?

74
00:05:52.522 --> 00:05:53.692
You do, don't you?

75
00:06:00.262 --> 00:06:03.303
Stay close to me then. Don't leave my side.

76
00:06:04.202 --> 00:06:05.473
From now on,

77
00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.043
I need you to be my eyes.

78
00:06:14.113 --> 00:06:17.442
You treated me like a nuisance earlier today.

79
00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:20.113
- Why are you doing this? - What?

80
00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:24.822
Goodness! Oh, gosh.

81
00:06:28.493 --> 00:06:31.663
You know the fact that I can see the shadow...

82
00:06:31.962 --> 00:06:34.533
and that the person with the shadow always dies.

83
00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:37.163
That woman can see us?

84
00:06:37.673 --> 00:06:41.673
That means I can find my partner hidden inside a human with her eyes.

85
00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:46.043
I'm glad I kept her alive.

86
00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:49.942
That's...

87
00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:51.653
Well...

88
00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:54.452
Why did you change your mind so suddenly?

89
00:06:54.553 --> 00:06:56.322
You yelled at me to get lost.

90
00:06:56.322 --> 00:06:58.093
It's because I want to help you.

91
00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:00.692
- What? - You said the one with shadow dies.

92
00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:04.192
If the shadow is inside someone, that person will die very quickly.

93
00:07:05.332 --> 00:07:08.433
The student you saw who had the shadow inside his body.

94
00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:10.803
He jumped off from the rooftop in an hour.

95
00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.103
- I know. - Don't you think we should...

96
00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:15.872
do something to prevent such misfortunes?

97
00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:18.942
All right. Stay close to me from now on,

98
00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.582
and if you see that shadow inside of someone again,

99
00:07:21.582 --> 00:07:24.413
let me know that instant. Do you get it?

100
00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.853
- Okay? - You jerk.

101
00:07:27.853 --> 00:07:29.183
Are you kidding me?

102
00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:31.423
- What? - You treated me like a stranger...

103
00:07:31.423 --> 00:07:32.952
and told me to get lost. And now, what?

104
00:07:33.122 --> 00:07:35.462
You want to save people's lives together with me?

105
00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:38.233
Do you think I'm a pushover? Do you?

106
00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:39.663
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

107
00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.863
You knew I was the kid with sunglasses in Moojin, right?

108
00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:45.803
You knew it all along, right? Why did you pretend not to?

109
00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:47.973
Why did you pretend not to know?

110
00:07:47.973 --> 00:07:51.743
I lost my memories. When I got shot in the head, I lost my memories.

111
00:07:52.413 --> 00:07:54.983
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

112
00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.582
Forget everything that has happened until now,

113
00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:03.723
and just stay by my side. Okay?

114
00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:05.322
You really can't remember?

115
00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:07.293
Nothing. None at all.

116
00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:09.262
I couldn't even remember my own name.

117
00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:11.933
So please understand.

118
00:08:11.933 --> 00:08:14.632
Just understand me, and stay close to me.

119
00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:16.733
No. No!

120
00:08:18.733 --> 00:08:21.243
What's the reason? Why?

121
00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:24.173
It's all my fault.

122
00:08:24.413 --> 00:08:26.613
- What is it now? - Because of me,

123
00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:30.183
you almost died.

124
00:08:30.183 --> 00:08:33.082
If I hadn't deluded myself that I can save people's lives,

125
00:08:33.082 --> 00:08:35.783
you wouldn't have taken hostage instead of that man...

126
00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.992
or nearly gotten killed.

127
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.822
How can I help you save people's lives again now?

128
00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:44.992
No, I'm fine. I really am.

129
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:47.832
I will never try to save someone's life again.

130
00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:52.933
Stop talking, and do as I say.

131
00:08:55.043 --> 00:08:57.873
I said no. I won't do it.

132
00:09:00.442 --> 00:09:03.513
How dare a lowbrow human disobey me?

133
00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:07.183
I desperately need your eyes right now,

134
00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:10.553
so stop complaining, and find the shadow inside...

135
00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:12.222
Are you deaf?

136
00:09:12.293 --> 00:09:13.722
I said no!

137
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.163
Stop.

138
00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:18.633
How dare you disobey me?

139
00:09:23.332 --> 00:09:24.633
If you don't do as I say,

140
00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:27.072
I will pull your eyes out right now.

141
00:09:27.803 --> 00:09:28.903
What?

142
00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:30.942
You don't think I can do it?

143
00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.612
I can easily pull out a human's eyes!

144
00:09:41.783 --> 00:09:44.952
What? Did you think that would frighten me?

145
00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:49.893
If you want to keep your manhood, get lost. Do you hear me?

146
00:10:17.023 --> 00:10:19.222
I can't believe he lost his memory.

147
00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.862
It's all my fault.

148
00:10:27.592 --> 00:10:30.003
Don't you die, Dad.

149
00:10:31.003 --> 00:10:34.202
You have to live a long life for me.

150
00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:51.653
Who told you guys to let that punk in here?

151
00:10:52.153 --> 00:10:54.623
I allowed it.

152
00:10:54.623 --> 00:10:56.523
Since regaining his consciousness,

153
00:10:56.592 --> 00:10:58.592
Mr. Chairman has been wanting to see his youngest son.

154
00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.062
What are you guys waiting for? Drag him out!

155
00:11:00.062 --> 00:11:01.602
Dad, Dad. Let go!

156
00:11:01.602 --> 00:11:02.933
- Let go of me! - Hey!

157
00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:05.133
- Let go of me right now! - What are you doing? Let him go!

158
00:11:07.232 --> 00:11:10.173
You're just my dad's doctor. Know your place, please.

159
00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:12.913
If you let that rat in here without my permission once again,

160
00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.812
I will not let it slide.

161
00:11:18.582 --> 00:11:19.753
Okay,

162
00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.653
sir.

163
00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:34.732
What?

164
00:11:35.102 --> 00:11:38.373
Are you upset because I interfered when you were...

165
00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.933
about to catch up with your youngest son whom you adore so much?

166
00:11:41.673 --> 00:11:44.242
If he finds out what kind of person you really are,

167
00:11:44.342 --> 00:11:46.143
will he be able to call you Dad...

168
00:11:46.143 --> 00:11:48.312
like he does now?

169
00:11:50.312 --> 00:11:51.913
Man Soo, that love child,

170
00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:54.523
has his mother's dirty lowborn blood,

171
00:11:54.653 --> 00:11:57.553
so he may be understanding about what you did.

172
00:12:00.523 --> 00:12:02.222
Remember this.

173
00:12:02.893 --> 00:12:06.033
The person who's cleaning up the mess you created...

174
00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:09.403
is not that punk. It's me,

175
00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:11.503
Oh Man Ho.

176
00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:16.072
Please let everything go and leave already...

177
00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:18.242
for the sake of Royeol Group.

178
00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:22.383
I'll make sure your funeral is a grand one.

179
00:12:33.722 --> 00:12:34.923
Doctor.

180
00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:41.303
I heard you work here.

181
00:12:42.602 --> 00:12:43.933
Did you get hurt or something?

182
00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:46.273
No, it's not that. Well...

183
00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:49.242
About Detective Han...

184
00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:54.013
He said he lost his memory due to the accident. Is it true?

185
00:12:54.383 --> 00:12:55.543
Yes, it's true.

186
00:13:02.183 --> 00:13:04.222
The bullet that day...

187
00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:06.753
It's because of the gunshot injury, right?

188
00:13:07.452 --> 00:13:08.623
Yes.

189
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:10.793
Does he...

190
00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:14.192
Does he remember nothing?

191
00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:15.403
That's right.

192
00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:19.572
He's also showing strange behavior. It's probably caused by the shock.

193
00:13:19.602 --> 00:13:20.873
I knew it.

194
00:13:23.543 --> 00:13:24.712
By the way,

195
00:13:27.783 --> 00:13:29.242
you said you got to know Moo Gang...

196
00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:32.153
through helping him with his investigation of a case.

197
00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:33.982
Pardon?

198
00:13:37.322 --> 00:13:38.692
That's...

199
00:13:39.793 --> 00:13:43.123
Well... I helped him track down a soldier who deserted the army...

200
00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:46.192
because of his girlfriend who broke up with him.

201
00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:50.102
You must be busy. I should get going now.

202
00:13:50.732 --> 00:13:52.303
- Thank you. - No problem.

203
00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:17.562
You just watch.

204
00:14:19.163 --> 00:14:21.533
I'm going to save Royeol Insurance no matter what.

205
00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:32.242
By the way, is that fortune-teller girl doing her job or what?

206
00:14:32.242 --> 00:14:33.643
I haven't heard a word from her.

207
00:14:48.692 --> 00:14:50.123
Ms. Fortune-teller?

208
00:14:54.263 --> 00:14:55.663
What should we do?

209
00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:57.503
The only thing that can help me find that loser...

210
00:14:57.503 --> 00:14:59.433
is that girl's eyes.

211
00:14:59.702 --> 00:15:02.003
Gosh, it doesn't look like it'll be easy.

212
00:15:02.773 --> 00:15:04.742
Her first love almost died because of her,

213
00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:06.413
and he even lost his memory.

214
00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:11.383
She wouldn't want to follow you around and see the shadow again.

215
00:15:14.183 --> 00:15:15.183
Oh, dear.

216
00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.293
Pass me the phone.

217
00:15:22.023 --> 00:15:23.692
Okay, just a second.

218
00:15:24.163 --> 00:15:25.663
This is...

219
00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:28.232
Well, it's...

220
00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:30.462
Be careful.

221
00:15:33.903 --> 00:15:35.003
Hello?

222
00:15:38.143 --> 00:15:40.212
You called me. Say what you need to say.

223
00:15:53.492 --> 00:15:54.763
You know what?

224
00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:56.862
My dad...

225
00:15:57.322 --> 00:16:00.433
always said that I'm blessed by the skies.

226
00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:04.232
That's why he named me Ha Ram.

227
00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:07.602
I'm blessed?

228
00:16:07.903 --> 00:16:09.503
Is that why...

229
00:16:10.972 --> 00:16:14.383
I have no power or connections whatsoever?

230
00:16:16.712 --> 00:16:18.383
I'm broke too.

231
00:16:19.383 --> 00:16:21.153
I don't even have a boyfriend.

232
00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:23.753
I don't have any friends either!

233
00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:30.492
As if that's not bad enough, Joon also...

234
00:16:31.263 --> 00:16:33.832
I think Joon also...

235
00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:37.633
died because of me.

236
00:16:40.003 --> 00:16:42.072
He has lost his memory too.

237
00:16:44.913 --> 00:16:46.273
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:47.783 --> 00:16:52.013
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Joon.

239
00:16:52.013 --> 00:16:53.312
I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:53.753 --> 00:16:55.653
My dad...

241
00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:01.222
My dad also...

242
00:17:02.992 --> 00:17:05.333
died because of me.

243
00:17:07.032 --> 00:17:09.732
Gosh, I can't believe it happened to you too.

244
00:17:24.413 --> 00:17:27.752
Do you know what it feels like...

245
00:17:27.752 --> 00:17:33.292
to be left all alone in this vast world?

246
00:17:33.593 --> 00:17:36.192
Do you know what it's like?

247
00:17:36.192 --> 00:17:37.962
I'm asking you if you know what it's like.

248
00:17:37.962 --> 00:17:40.492
Go like this

249
00:17:40.663 --> 00:17:43.663
Kungtari shabara

250
00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:46.673
Go like this

251
00:17:47.002 --> 00:17:48.272
Gosh!

252
00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.242
Lose some weight, will you?

253
00:17:52.242 --> 00:17:53.712
You're so stocky and shapeless.

254
00:17:53.712 --> 00:17:55.843
That's why you can't dance.

255
00:17:56.282 --> 00:17:57.813
Lose some weight!

256
00:17:58.413 --> 00:17:59.683
Gosh.

257
00:18:01.683 --> 00:18:03.823
What on earth have you been eating?

258
00:18:03.823 --> 00:18:06.093
You smell like garbage.

259
00:18:13.462 --> 00:18:15.433
Joon!

260
00:18:19.103 --> 00:18:21.502
Joon!

261
00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:25.073
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:30.482
I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.

263
00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:32.353
I'm sorry...

264
00:18:43.323 --> 00:18:46.192
- Go! Run! - Gosh, my legs. Okay, I heard you.

265
00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:47.593
Run.

266
00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:50.802
Giddy up. Go!

267
00:18:50.802 --> 00:18:53.603
- For goodness' sake. - Come on. Run.

268
00:18:53.603 --> 00:18:56.042
- Be gentle, will you? - Goodness.

269
00:19:01.913 --> 00:19:03.683
Gosh, she drooled.

270
00:19:03.683 --> 00:19:05.083
Do you even know how much this is?

271
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.093
Ms. Fortune-teller.

272
00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.323
I guess you're as lonely as I am.

273
00:19:23.732 --> 00:19:25.702
Joon.

274
00:19:26.573 --> 00:19:28.972
Joon.

275
00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:31.113
Han Moo Gang.

276
00:19:32.242 --> 00:19:33.942
Han Moo Gang...

277
00:19:33.942 --> 00:19:35.613
- What? - Han Moo Gang.

278
00:19:35.613 --> 00:19:36.813
She has two guys?

279
00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:40.353
- Han Moo Gang! - Gosh, she's really something.

280
00:19:53.962 --> 00:19:55.863
My dad...

281
00:19:56.563 --> 00:19:58.232
My dad also...

282
00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:02.272
died because of me.

283
00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:05.573
Gosh, why did she cry like that?

284
00:20:05.573 --> 00:20:07.113
I feel bad now.

285
00:20:10.913 --> 00:20:12.012
Should I just give this to her?

286
00:20:12.653 --> 00:20:14.153
No, no.

287
00:20:14.153 --> 00:20:17.153
I need to sort out my situation first.

288
00:20:19.692 --> 00:20:20.853
By the way,

289
00:20:21.692 --> 00:20:23.093
did this man...

290
00:20:23.692 --> 00:20:25.732
really kill her dad?

291
00:20:49.853 --> 00:20:51.052
We're okay.

292
00:20:54.762 --> 00:20:55.792
There you are.

293
00:21:00.163 --> 00:21:01.363
Come here!

294
00:21:01.363 --> 00:21:02.433
You brats!

295
00:21:02.863 --> 00:21:03.903
Come here!

296
00:21:07.103 --> 00:21:08.173
Run!

297
00:21:08.442 --> 00:21:09.802
You brats!

298
00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:11.173
Stop!

299
00:21:28.893 --> 00:21:29.962
What?

300
00:21:31.063 --> 00:21:34.163
Was that a dream? The thing that humans see when they sleep?

301
00:21:53.113 --> 00:21:54.282
They startled me.

302
00:21:54.282 --> 00:21:56.522
I mean, isn't it strange?

303
00:21:56.522 --> 00:21:59.452
You said she could even see a grim reaper inside of a human.

304
00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:03.923
Then why can't she see you inside of Moo Gang's body?

305
00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:06.732
- It's strange. - It's because she was wearing...

306
00:22:07.032 --> 00:22:08.133
Hold on.

307
00:22:09.302 --> 00:22:11.302
When I met her at the school that day,

308
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:14.232
she wasn't wearing sunglasses. But she didn't notice anything.

309
00:22:14.873 --> 00:22:18.212
If she saw me inside of this man, she would've made a big fuss.

310
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:21.113
Why can't she see me when she saw that idiot inside the boy?

311
00:22:21.413 --> 00:22:22.482
Could it be...

312
00:22:23.212 --> 00:22:24.552
Could it be...

313
00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:34.722
This suit.

314
00:22:35.363 --> 00:22:36.792
What about it?

315
00:22:38.063 --> 00:22:39.292
It's black.

316
00:22:39.863 --> 00:22:41.762
The shadow she sees is black too.

317
00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:44.133
She said she could see a black shadow inside of him.

318
00:22:44.163 --> 00:22:46.833
She can't see me because I'm wearing a black suit.

319
00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:48.573
Are you saying this black suit is...

320
00:22:48.573 --> 00:22:50.143
just like her sunglasses?

321
00:22:51.472 --> 00:22:52.873
It makes sense.

322
00:22:52.942 --> 00:22:55.383
You're hiding black with another black.

323
00:22:55.782 --> 00:22:57.813
It's black-and-black strategy.

324
00:22:57.913 --> 00:23:01.853
She won't be able to see you if you always wear something black.

325
00:23:03.653 --> 00:23:05.853
I almost made a big mistake.

326
00:23:07.192 --> 00:23:09.163
This can take a while.

327
00:23:09.462 --> 00:23:11.333
I should buy a few more black suits.

328
00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:16.732
You look great in a black suit.

329
00:23:18.532 --> 00:23:19.933
- I know, right? - Yes.

330
00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:24.512
What was his name again? Bread?

331
00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:28.643
- Joe Black. - Black.

332
00:23:29.712 --> 00:23:30.843
Black.

333
00:23:31.452 --> 00:23:32.583
Black.

334
00:23:34.482 --> 00:23:35.782
Black.

335
00:23:37.752 --> 00:23:38.853
I like it.

336
00:23:40.323 --> 00:23:42.823
In that case, I will call you...

337
00:23:42.893 --> 00:23:44.692
Black from now on.

338
00:23:46.532 --> 00:23:48.063
(Seoun Police Station)

339
00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.133
Of course, sir.

340
00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:03.712
What?

341
00:24:08.252 --> 00:24:09.482
Who is he?

342
00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:17.262
What is it?

343
00:24:24.002 --> 00:24:26.673
You're not very polite, are you?

344
00:24:29.972 --> 00:24:32.742
You should greet him. He's the commissioner general.

345
00:24:35.083 --> 00:24:38.353
What are you doing? Why are you blowing air into my ear?

346
00:24:38.353 --> 00:24:39.583
Are you a pervert?

347
00:24:46.123 --> 00:24:47.762
Who is that jerk?

348
00:24:48.663 --> 00:24:52.133
He recently injured his head. I'm so sorry.

349
00:24:52.192 --> 00:24:53.462
- Train him better. - Yes, sir.

350
00:24:53.462 --> 00:24:56.502
Most importantly, we have to stop losing young customers.

351
00:24:56.502 --> 00:24:58.972
Young people don't think of death...

352
00:24:58.972 --> 00:25:00.133
as something close to them.

353
00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:01.373
To them, life insurance is...

354
00:25:01.373 --> 00:25:05.272
something only old people need. We have to break that bias.

355
00:25:05.272 --> 00:25:07.512
Speaking of which, for this year's Halloween,

356
00:25:07.512 --> 00:25:11.052
I'm thinking of throwing a party for our VVIPs in their 20s to 40s.

357
00:25:11.583 --> 00:25:14.623
A very fancy and luxurious one.

358
00:25:14.623 --> 00:25:16.353
It'll make them take pride as Royeol's client...

359
00:25:16.353 --> 00:25:18.323
and recommend it to many of...

360
00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:20.022
their families and friends.

361
00:25:21.692 --> 00:25:24.593
All right. We'll have it at my villa in Yangpyeong.

362
00:25:24.692 --> 00:25:26.633
Among our clients in their 20s to 40s,

363
00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:29.732
let's select VVIPs, invite them, and promote the party.

364
00:25:31.302 --> 00:25:32.903
That's all. Get back to work.

365
00:25:34.702 --> 00:25:36.573
My dear Sip Gyeon. That was boring, right?

366
00:25:39.472 --> 00:25:41.643
Excuse me, sir.

367
00:25:41.643 --> 00:25:43.313
- What is it? - Well...

368
00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:46.482
We cleaned out Ms. Han Jin Sook's locker, the employee who died,

369
00:25:46.482 --> 00:25:48.052
and we found her notebook.

370
00:25:48.052 --> 00:25:51.853
Should we throw it away or give it to her family or the police?

371
00:25:51.853 --> 00:25:53.093
Give it to me.

372
00:25:54.093 --> 00:25:56.192
The commissioner general was there, and what? A pervert?

373
00:25:56.192 --> 00:25:57.633
Do you want to get fired?

374
00:25:57.792 --> 00:25:58.863
No.

375
00:25:58.992 --> 00:26:00.433
You're being rude again.

376
00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:03.462
You'd better talk to me politely now!

377
00:26:03.462 --> 00:26:05.333
- I'm your superior! - Hello?

378
00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:07.302
I'll be right there. Okay.

379
00:26:08.673 --> 00:26:10.002
You punk.

380
00:26:10.143 --> 00:26:13.012
I should teach you a lesson today. How dare you?

381
00:26:13.242 --> 00:26:14.613
Here.

382
00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:16.583
Oh, yes.

383
00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:19.012
You asked me to call you if we find anything...

384
00:26:19.012 --> 00:26:20.853
- about Ms. Han Jin Sook. - Yes.

385
00:26:21.183 --> 00:26:22.653
- Thank you for your cooperation. - Sure.

386
00:26:25.792 --> 00:26:29.462
I looked through it, and it only had notes about her work.

387
00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:30.593
I see.

388
00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:33.893
One million dollars?

389
00:26:37.502 --> 00:26:39.633
- Thank you. I should get going. - Okay.

390
00:26:40.073 --> 00:26:43.242
- May I? - Sure. Should I pack some?

391
00:26:43.242 --> 00:26:44.843
No, thank you.

392
00:26:45.873 --> 00:26:47.242
- Take care. - You too.

393
00:26:49.413 --> 00:26:52.052
Goodness, let's see. How much is this?

394
00:26:53.012 --> 00:26:54.482
1, 10, 100...

395
00:26:56.252 --> 00:26:59.353
My wife overused my credit card again.

396
00:26:59.593 --> 00:27:01.423
She spent more than my salaries again.

397
00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:04.163
What's this now? Let's see.

398
00:27:09.363 --> 00:27:11.002
What? 120 dollars?

399
00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:12.772
When did I drive too fast?

400
00:27:13.103 --> 00:27:14.542
(A traffic violation)

401
00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:17.103
"October 14", "Gangjeong Intersection"?

402
00:27:18.173 --> 00:27:20.042
"140km per hour"?

403
00:27:20.742 --> 00:27:21.982
What is this?

404
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:23.712
(Obligator: Han Moo Gang)

405
00:27:24.752 --> 00:27:26.583
Gosh, it scared me for a second.

406
00:27:26.583 --> 00:27:29.123
I almost wet my pants a bit because I thought it was for me.

407
00:27:29.952 --> 00:27:32.222
You were insane even before the injury.

408
00:27:32.222 --> 00:27:33.893
140km per hour?

409
00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:35.663
Gosh, you punk.

410
00:27:35.663 --> 00:27:38.163
Are you a racer? Take a look.

411
00:27:39.863 --> 00:27:41.032
Hold on.

412
00:27:42.903 --> 00:27:44.232
October 14.

413
00:27:44.772 --> 00:27:45.972
"Gangjeong Intersection"?

414
00:27:47.073 --> 00:27:50.143
That's the day he got shot at the shopping mall.

415
00:27:50.843 --> 00:27:51.873
What?

416
00:27:51.873 --> 00:27:53.873
That's right. "4:20pm".

417
00:27:55.413 --> 00:27:56.813
Around that time...

418
00:27:56.813 --> 00:27:59.413
- Please let me go. - I can't do that.

419
00:27:59.583 --> 00:28:01.883
- I'll pick her up for you then. - What?

420
00:28:02.052 --> 00:28:04.123
Where in Nine PM is it?

421
00:28:04.123 --> 00:28:05.492
- Detective! - Yes.

422
00:28:09.163 --> 00:28:13.732
Gangjeong Intersection and the mall are in the opposite direction.

423
00:28:14.802 --> 00:28:17.363
Why did he go there when he headed out for the mall...

424
00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.833
and overspeed?

425
00:28:21.403 --> 00:28:22.702
Excuse me.

426
00:28:22.843 --> 00:28:24.002
How can I help you?

427
00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.843
We're from Yeongjae Police Station.

428
00:28:25.843 --> 00:28:27.782
Is Detective Han Moo Gang here?

429
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:33.589
Did you find out anything?

430
00:28:36.718 --> 00:28:39.029
- Who are they? - From Yeongjae Police Station.

431
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:42.329
They just look like a couple of idiots.

432
00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:44.299
Why? Do they need backup force for a case again?

433
00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:45.829
I don't think it's about that.

434
00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:48.299
Why is Moo Gang in there?

435
00:28:48.398 --> 00:28:51.039
I don't know what kind of trouble he is this time.

436
00:28:56.478 --> 00:28:58.708
- You really don't know him? - No.

437
00:29:00.109 --> 00:29:02.618
Please understand. He recently had...

438
00:29:02.618 --> 00:29:04.549
a severe head injury.

439
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:06.418
Who is this man?

440
00:29:06.418 --> 00:29:08.059
He's a commando who accidentally...

441
00:29:08.059 --> 00:29:10.319
shot Detective Han when he was taken hostage.

442
00:29:10.489 --> 00:29:13.928
He lit a briquette in his car and attempted suicide last night.

443
00:29:13.928 --> 00:29:15.898
He's unconscious right now.

444
00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:17.928
Oh, dear. Why did he do that?

445
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:19.868
We'll find out details as we investigate,

446
00:29:19.868 --> 00:29:22.938
but his case was referred to the disciplinary committee,

447
00:29:22.938 --> 00:29:26.739
and they imposed severe disciplinary action. It really stressed him out.

448
00:29:26.739 --> 00:29:29.539
Besides, his sick wife passed away recently.

449
00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:32.049
We're assuming these are the reason for his extreme action.

450
00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:33.809
Anyhow, we should continue our investigation.

451
00:29:33.809 --> 00:29:35.718
My gosh, he still shouldn't have done that.

452
00:29:35.718 --> 00:29:37.718
But why do you need to talk to Detective Han?

453
00:29:37.718 --> 00:29:39.718
The last person he called...

454
00:29:39.718 --> 00:29:41.658
was Detective Han.

455
00:29:41.658 --> 00:29:43.989
The phone call only lasted around 10 seconds.

456
00:29:43.989 --> 00:29:46.228
So I don't think it was enough time for them to have had a conversation.

457
00:29:46.228 --> 00:29:49.228
But I just wanted to ask if you had ever called him...

458
00:29:49.228 --> 00:29:50.859
or met him separately before the incident.

459
00:29:50.898 --> 00:29:53.529
No. I've never seen him in my life.

460
00:29:54.428 --> 00:29:58.539
Oh, I get it now. I guess he must've called...

461
00:29:58.539 --> 00:30:01.009
to tell him that he's sorry.

462
00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:03.938
That must be why he called him.

463
00:30:03.938 --> 00:30:06.178
But then again, he did make him into a fool.

464
00:30:06.178 --> 00:30:08.148
He used to be a smart guy.

465
00:30:08.148 --> 00:30:10.178
Okay, that's enough for now.

466
00:30:10.849 --> 00:30:12.849
Please call us if you ever get reminded of anything.

467
00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:15.859
Okay. See you. Bye.

468
00:30:18.589 --> 00:30:20.589
Hey. What? Really?

469
00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:37.408
(Freezer Murder Incident)

470
00:30:39.978 --> 00:30:41.749
("The Freezer Murder Case Has Still Not Been Solved")

471
00:30:48.658 --> 00:30:51.059
Jin Sook, have you gone mad?

472
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:54.029
You threaten him by saying that you have the tape?

473
00:30:54.859 --> 00:30:57.628
I got a loan without my husband knowing.

474
00:30:57.868 --> 00:31:01.029
But my debt slowly started to increase so much.

475
00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:04.509
Sun Young. You have that tape, right?

476
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:07.408
Let's give him that tape, and ask him for some money.

477
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:09.208
I don't have it.

478
00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:11.208
He took it with him that day.

479
00:31:11.208 --> 00:31:12.678
What are you talking about?

480
00:31:12.678 --> 00:31:15.418
He totally bought it when I told him that I have it.

481
00:31:16.478 --> 00:31:18.888
What? Really?

482
00:31:18.888 --> 00:31:21.458
Yes. If he actually had it,

483
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:22.918
he wouldn't have asked me to meet.

484
00:31:22.918 --> 00:31:24.089
He asked you to meet?

485
00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:26.529
Hey.

486
00:31:27.128 --> 00:31:28.228
Are you crazy?

487
00:31:28.228 --> 00:31:30.329
Are you trying to get yourself in trouble?

488
00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:32.329
If you don't want to die,

489
00:31:32.468 --> 00:31:35.339
you better not meet him. Just hide, and live a quiet life.

490
00:31:36.868 --> 00:31:39.039
And don't ever call me again.

491
00:31:42.708 --> 00:31:43.839
What?

492
00:31:45.249 --> 00:31:47.549
That means he didn't take that tape with him that day.

493
00:31:47.918 --> 00:31:50.279
Then where in the world is it?

494
00:31:52.648 --> 00:31:54.249
Tell me!

495
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:56.859
What happened 20 years ago?

496
00:31:56.859 --> 00:31:58.589
That tape that she was looking for...

497
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:01.658
It's all because of that tape.

498
00:32:01.728 --> 00:32:03.158
Where is that tape?

499
00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:06.069
Where is it?

00:32:06.868 --> 00:32:08.668
I wonder if Moo Gang found it.

501
00:32:09.868 --> 00:32:12.739
If he did, I'm sure he must've hid it in that basement.

502
00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.309
Yes.

503
00:32:18.648 --> 00:32:21.749
As long as that's gone, they won't be able to do anything to me.

504
00:32:22.448 --> 00:32:24.549
That will make Moo Gang safe as well.

505
00:32:36.259 --> 00:32:38.368
Hey. Hey.

506
00:32:38.728 --> 00:32:40.069
Detective Han is here.

507
00:32:42.868 --> 00:32:45.269
I'll be outside. You guys can talk.

508
00:32:49.438 --> 00:32:50.839
What is it that you want to say?

509
00:32:54.349 --> 00:32:56.118
Nurse! Nurse!

510
00:32:56.118 --> 00:32:58.289
Nurse! Hurry up! Come on!

511
00:32:59.388 --> 00:33:01.989
Hey! What happened?

512
00:33:02.418 --> 00:33:04.019
- Hurry! - Please move.

513
00:33:06.958 --> 00:33:08.799
Hey, excuse me.

514
00:33:09.128 --> 00:33:11.058
What did he say to you?

515
00:33:12.498 --> 00:33:13.628
He said he's sorry.

516
00:33:18.069 --> 00:33:19.739
I went to see 10 people today.

517
00:33:19.739 --> 00:33:21.069
But I couldn't find any shadows.

518
00:33:27.009 --> 00:33:29.148
Joon.

519
00:33:30.248 --> 00:33:32.648
I thought you wouldn't be able to finish it, but you did.

520
00:33:33.248 --> 00:33:35.319
- What? - Never mind.

521
00:33:35.518 --> 00:33:39.029
Here's the list of our VVIP members that you need to check out tomorrow.

522
00:33:45.668 --> 00:33:47.128
What? "Mujin"?

523
00:33:47.569 --> 00:33:49.969
I thought I'd only be responsible for the ones in Seoul.

524
00:33:50.538 --> 00:33:51.609
You'll have to go all over the country.

525
00:33:51.609 --> 00:33:53.708
My gosh, there isn't even a flight to Mujin.

526
00:33:53.708 --> 00:33:55.609
How many hours will it take me by car?

527
00:33:55.609 --> 00:33:58.808
He's a good friend of my dad's.

528
00:33:58.808 --> 00:34:01.248
So take a close look at him, okay?

529
00:34:02.248 --> 00:34:04.848
My goodness, Sip Gyeon. Let's eat.

530
00:34:06.989 --> 00:34:08.989
Here you go.

531
00:34:11.018 --> 00:34:13.688
That dog's life is better than mine.

532
00:34:15.998 --> 00:34:19.799
Sip Gyeon. Do you know what the meanest thing in the world is?

533
00:34:20.328 --> 00:34:23.598
It's to cheat on someone.

534
00:34:24.038 --> 00:34:26.208
My gosh, look at you enjoying your meal.

535
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.038
The meanest thing in the world...

536
00:34:29.038 --> 00:34:32.348
is to give that salmon to a dog instead of a human.

537
00:34:32.348 --> 00:34:34.179
What a petty CEO.

538
00:34:34.978 --> 00:34:36.179
I'm hungry.

539
00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:46.429
Why won't it open?

540
00:35:20.453 --> 00:35:23.685
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E04 Black "I Need You to Be My Eyes"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

541
00:35:50.188 --> 00:35:51.359
What is it that you want to say?

542
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.759
I'm sorry.

543
00:35:53.489 --> 00:35:55.098
I tried to commit suicide...

544
00:35:56.128 --> 00:35:57.598
because I was...

545
00:35:58.668 --> 00:36:00.668
embarrassed of what I did.

546
00:36:01.598 --> 00:36:03.038
But...

547
00:36:04.969 --> 00:36:06.339
I didn't have...

548
00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:09.239
a choice.

549
00:36:09.239 --> 00:36:10.339
What do you mean?

550
00:36:10.339 --> 00:36:13.049
I had to do it.

551
00:36:14.409 --> 00:36:15.478
No.

552
00:36:16.248 --> 00:36:18.389
I just did it anyway.

553
00:36:18.389 --> 00:36:20.018
What are you talking about?

554
00:36:20.018 --> 00:36:21.688
Your injury...

555
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:25.029
wasn't caused accidentally.

556
00:36:26.029 --> 00:36:28.458
He's going to...

557
00:36:29.429 --> 00:36:32.299
try to kill you again.

558
00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:35.438
So before he does,

559
00:36:35.998 --> 00:36:37.038
hurry up...

560
00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:43.038
That means Moo Gang wasn't killed accidentally,

561
00:36:43.038 --> 00:36:45.248
which means he was purposely murdered.

562
00:36:46.049 --> 00:36:49.348
Then that means he wasn't sacrificed for anyone else's life.

563
00:36:50.248 --> 00:36:53.518
He was supposed to die that day anyway.

564
00:36:54.918 --> 00:36:55.918
Yes.

565
00:36:57.058 --> 00:37:00.029
That means he didn't die because of that woman.

566
00:37:00.458 --> 00:37:01.598
That's great.

567
00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:08.538
But how am I supposed to explain this to her?

568
00:37:08.739 --> 00:37:11.409
If I take her to the sniper,

569
00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:13.239
she'll probably waste time by saying that...

570
00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:15.739
she'll go after the guy who gave orders to kill Moo Gang.

571
00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:19.978
How should I tell her this?

572
00:37:21.009 --> 00:37:22.918
"Gangjung Intersection"?

573
00:37:22.918 --> 00:37:25.719
That's the opposite way from the shopping center.

574
00:37:26.648 --> 00:37:29.418
Why did he go there,

575
00:37:29.418 --> 00:37:30.788
and violate the speed limit?

576
00:37:37.558 --> 00:37:39.998
What are you doing? When did you get here?

577
00:37:43.869 --> 00:37:45.069
Yes.

578
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:48.038
What time did you say I left that day?

579
00:37:48.438 --> 00:37:50.279
It was around 4pm.

580
00:37:50.878 --> 00:37:51.978
4pm...

581
00:38:01.918 --> 00:38:04.989
Moo Gang left the police station that day at 4pm.

582
00:38:04.989 --> 00:38:06.589
Then 20 minutes later,

583
00:38:06.828 --> 00:38:10.058
he got a speeding ticket at Gangjung Intersection.

584
00:38:10.058 --> 00:38:12.429
And that's on the southern side of Seoun.

585
00:38:12.869 --> 00:38:14.969
That's on the complete opposite side of the shopping mall...

586
00:38:14.969 --> 00:38:16.569
that's located at the northern side of Seoun.

587
00:38:17.768 --> 00:38:19.139
What are you doing?

588
00:38:19.139 --> 00:38:20.168
Yes.

589
00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:23.679
Moo Gang didn't head to the shopping mall that day.

590
00:38:24.748 --> 00:38:28.449
But he got shot in the head and died at 7pm.

591
00:38:36.119 --> 00:38:38.228
Why does he talk as if it's someone else's story?

592
00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:41.199
Did you say from 5pm to 7pm?

593
00:38:41.199 --> 00:38:42.259
Yes.

594
00:38:43.228 --> 00:38:44.768
How many times do I need to tell you?

595
00:38:47.328 --> 00:38:49.168
You said it's 66M6900.

596
00:38:50.538 --> 00:38:53.139
66M6900.

597
00:38:56.179 --> 00:38:57.308
Here it is.

598
00:39:04.049 --> 00:39:06.848
So he really did arrive six hours later after having gone somewhere.

599
00:39:08.918 --> 00:39:11.659
Isn't that you?

600
00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:22.639
Wait.

601
00:39:26.268 --> 00:39:28.279
Does that mean the shopping mall is on this side?

602
00:39:28.279 --> 00:39:31.078
No, the shopping mall is on the other side.

603
00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:32.748
That side leads to the hotel.

604
00:39:34.308 --> 00:39:35.949
- "The hotel"? - Yes.

605
00:39:37.819 --> 00:39:40.619
Moo Gang was on his way to a hotel?

606
00:39:59.869 --> 00:40:03.009
Yes, that's where Ji Dong disappeared.

607
00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:06.109
I remember seeing Moo Gang at the hotel corridor that day.

608
00:40:06.409 --> 00:40:09.418
So he was at the hotel instead of being at the shopping mall?

609
00:40:09.918 --> 00:40:11.319
Why?

610
00:40:14.018 --> 00:40:15.159
Rewind it.

611
00:40:16.918 --> 00:40:18.058
Fast forward it.

612
00:40:18.759 --> 00:40:21.558
Keep going. Continue. Stop.

613
00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:25.228
Where is this guy?

614
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:35.839
I need to help Joon regain his memory no matter what.

615
00:40:44.049 --> 00:40:47.489
Oh, right. We took this photo at Mujin.

616
00:40:48.889 --> 00:40:50.389
I wonder...

617
00:40:51.188 --> 00:40:54.159
if he'll remember anything if I show him this photo.

618
00:40:54.998 --> 00:40:56.898
I should show this to him when I meet him.

619
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:06.409
Detective Han.

620
00:41:08.679 --> 00:41:09.938
You have something to say to me?

621
00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:13.478
Tell this woman what you told me.

622
00:41:13.748 --> 00:41:14.878
Okay.

623
00:41:15.148 --> 00:41:17.949
On the day he was captured as hostage,

624
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:21.788
this detective over here gave me some money...

625
00:41:21.788 --> 00:41:25.188
and asked me to escort an old lady with Alzheimer's...

626
00:41:25.188 --> 00:41:27.558
to the Homicide Team at Seoun Police Station...

627
00:41:27.558 --> 00:41:30.859
because of an urgent appointment he had at the hotel.

628
00:41:31.569 --> 00:41:35.739
Then he hurriedly ran towards the hotel.

629
00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:39.438
That's why I took her to where I was told to.

630
00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:40.839
What?

631
00:41:41.739 --> 00:41:43.478
He definitely said he was...

632
00:41:43.938 --> 00:41:45.708
on his way to bring his mother.

633
00:41:46.578 --> 00:41:48.518
Who do you think he was supposed to meet at the hotel?

634
00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:50.049
I don't know.

635
00:41:50.878 --> 00:41:52.119
I can't remember.

636
00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:54.659
So are you saying...

637
00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:58.859
you asked the parking guy to take your mother to the police station,

638
00:41:58.859 --> 00:42:01.929
and on your way out from the hotel,

639
00:42:02.199 --> 00:42:05.029
you got captured by that soldier accidentally?

640
00:42:06.299 --> 00:42:09.839
That's right. Even if you hadn't saved that guy's life that day,

641
00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:13.069
Moo Gang would've been at the crime site anyway and died.

642
00:42:13.869 --> 00:42:14.938
No.

643
00:42:15.438 --> 00:42:17.179
I almost died.

644
00:42:18.179 --> 00:42:19.478
That just reminded me of something.

645
00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:23.049
When I saw that guy's shadow,

646
00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:29.989
I heard more than one gun shot.

647
00:42:35.458 --> 00:42:36.558
Yes.

648
00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:38.328
I heard two gun shots.

649
00:42:39.668 --> 00:42:41.438
I think I heard them almost simultaneously.

650
00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:42.938
I just remembered.

651
00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:46.469
I also saw blood...

652
00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:49.739
flowing from behind me.

653
00:42:50.509 --> 00:42:51.609
That means...

654
00:42:53.348 --> 00:42:55.279
Moo Gang was right behind me.

655
00:43:01.918 --> 00:43:03.159
Like you said,

656
00:43:03.558 --> 00:43:06.929
if I got shot because I offered to bring his mom to the police station,

657
00:43:06.958 --> 00:43:10.029
that parking guy should've been the one to get shot, not me.

658
00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:11.429
Don't you agree?

659
00:43:12.328 --> 00:43:15.139
But like you can see, that parking guy's completely fine.

660
00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:16.668
I didn't even know that.

661
00:43:17.969 --> 00:43:19.609
I thought...

662
00:43:19.808 --> 00:43:22.478
you got hurt because of me.

663
00:43:26.509 --> 00:43:27.679
I need to take you somewhere.

664
00:43:41.429 --> 00:43:44.929
If you hadn't agreed to save lives, that man over there...

665
00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:48.869
would be lying in his grave right now.

666
00:43:49.938 --> 00:43:51.069
That's not it.

667
00:43:51.739 --> 00:43:54.909
Do you think that woman with Alzheimer's would still be alive?

668
00:43:55.179 --> 00:43:57.409
You saved both of their lives.

669
00:43:58.449 --> 00:44:00.409
You did something great.

670
00:44:04.248 --> 00:44:05.389
Ha Ram.

671
00:44:06.418 --> 00:44:07.719
Look straight into my eyes.

672
00:44:09.259 --> 00:44:11.159
No one died that day.

673
00:44:12.029 --> 00:44:14.328
I'm also standing right in front of you.

674
00:44:15.328 --> 00:44:16.558
Do you remember...

675
00:44:17.429 --> 00:44:19.869
that male student who had a shadow inside his body?

676
00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:23.598
If you hadn't ignored him like you did, that boy...

677
00:44:24.509 --> 00:44:27.538
would probably be spending time with his family right now.

678
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:31.308
So from now on,

679
00:44:31.748 --> 00:44:33.679
just stay next to me,

680
00:44:33.779 --> 00:44:36.619
and tell me whenever you see...

681
00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:39.788
another person with a shadow inside of their body.

682
00:44:39.918 --> 00:44:42.619
You can't let yourself make the same mistake again.

683
00:44:43.518 --> 00:44:44.728
Right?

684
00:44:59.839 --> 00:45:01.109
It's time for food.

685
00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:17.418
Your palate changed a lot.

686
00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:22.958
You used to hate intestine soup.

687
00:45:25.369 --> 00:45:26.628
I'm glad that...

688
00:45:26.768 --> 00:45:29.869
I wasn't the reason why you almost got killed.

689
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:33.969
It was so tormenting until now.

690
00:45:34.978 --> 00:45:37.739
But I can finally be at ease.

691
00:45:38.279 --> 00:45:39.509
Okay.

692
00:45:40.208 --> 00:45:42.478
Hearing you say that makes me feel happy.

693
00:45:43.179 --> 00:45:46.319
You're going to stay by my side from now on,

694
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:49.688
and tell me whenever you see anything black, right?

695
00:45:50.788 --> 00:45:52.529
I'll think about it.

696
00:45:55.128 --> 00:45:56.998
What? Why?

697
00:45:56.998 --> 00:45:58.699
Moo Gang didn't almost die because of you. No.

698
00:45:59.328 --> 00:46:01.668
I didn't almost die because of you.

699
00:46:02.538 --> 00:46:04.768
I explained it to you already. What would you need to think about?

700
00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:09.538
It's not that simple. I also have a job to fulfill.

701
00:46:11.279 --> 00:46:13.208
What? I'm late.

702
00:46:13.978 --> 00:46:16.248
My gosh, I barely have enough time to go to Mujin and come back.

703
00:46:16.248 --> 00:46:19.049
- Please excuse me. - Wait.

704
00:46:19.049 --> 00:46:21.119
Where are you going? We're not done talking.

705
00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:22.159
Oh, right.

706
00:46:32.969 --> 00:46:36.768
My dad took this photo when we went to the stream to fish.

707
00:46:37.639 --> 00:46:41.739
I thought maybe this could help you regain your memory.

708
00:46:43.308 --> 00:46:45.648
Look at it carefully, okay?

709
00:46:45.648 --> 00:46:46.848
I'll call you.

710
00:46:46.848 --> 00:46:49.119
Hey, wait.

711
00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:57.119
Why is the office so empty?

712
00:46:57.119 --> 00:46:58.929
It's way past lunchtime already.

713
00:46:59.228 --> 00:47:02.328
Gwang Gyun just called to tell me that he's on his way to Mujin...

714
00:47:02.328 --> 00:47:04.299
to do an investigation on Han Jin Sook's murder.

715
00:47:04.299 --> 00:47:06.728
And Detective Park is at the hospital...

716
00:47:06.728 --> 00:47:08.139
to treat his hand tremor.

717
00:47:08.268 --> 00:47:10.469
These jerks. Where's Moo Gang?

718
00:47:11.938 --> 00:47:14.538
Don't you know that you need to be back here by 1pm?

719
00:47:14.538 --> 00:47:16.509
These punks seem to think there are no rules around here.

720
00:47:16.509 --> 00:47:19.009
Why isn't she picking up?

721
00:47:19.949 --> 00:47:22.848
I tried so hard to convince her. It's about time she understood.

722
00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:26.188
What? Can he not see me?

723
00:47:26.889 --> 00:47:28.418
He's pretending as if he can't hear me.

724
00:47:29.659 --> 00:47:33.029
Oh, right. This guy has a bullet in his head. I should hold my anger in.

725
00:47:33.029 --> 00:47:35.058
I'll just hold it in. My gosh.

726
00:47:36.759 --> 00:47:37.898
Let's be peaceful.

727
00:47:38.668 --> 00:47:40.869
Let's put up with it since I'm normal.

728
00:47:40.869 --> 00:47:42.098
Hey, Gwang Gyun.

729
00:47:42.098 --> 00:47:44.168
Did you look into what I asked you to last time?

730
00:47:44.509 --> 00:47:47.239
Yes, I tracked Han Jin Sook's bank account.

731
00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.739
But nothing's been transferred to her account.

732
00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:50.909
Really?

733
00:47:51.578 --> 00:47:53.208
- Okay. - Okay.

734
00:47:55.719 --> 00:47:57.348
(Welcome to Mujin.)

735
00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:12.799
I'm pretty sure this place is it.

736
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:16.139
Who did she meet here?

737
00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:38.458
Sir.

738
00:48:40.788 --> 00:48:41.898
How long has it been?

739
00:48:41.898 --> 00:48:45.299
I got appointed to a police station in Seoul after Soo Hyuk died.

740
00:48:45.299 --> 00:48:46.699
So it's been around 20 years.

741
00:48:46.699 --> 00:48:47.869
- "20 years"? - Yes.

742
00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:49.469
Has it really been that much?

743
00:48:50.098 --> 00:48:52.569
I wouldn't have recognized you if I met you on the street.

744
00:48:52.569 --> 00:48:54.839
You've changed a lot.

745
00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:56.339
You used to be so naive and...

746
00:48:56.339 --> 00:48:58.049
My gosh, that's what life does to you.

747
00:48:58.179 --> 00:49:01.449
By the way, congratulations on getting promoted.

748
00:49:02.378 --> 00:49:03.549
It's nothing.

749
00:49:04.119 --> 00:49:07.918
But then again, I am the youngest one to be in this position.

750
00:49:08.518 --> 00:49:10.558
By the way, what brings you here?

751
00:49:10.558 --> 00:49:13.089
I came here to check a CCTV footage.

752
00:49:13.889 --> 00:49:16.398
I was told to wait for around 20 minutes.

753
00:49:16.398 --> 00:49:19.398
I just came to see you while I was here.

754
00:49:19.398 --> 00:49:21.498
I see. What CCTV footage?

755
00:49:21.498 --> 00:49:24.708
It's to investigate about the recent freezer murder incident.

756
00:49:24.869 --> 00:49:28.038
We joke around saying that it's a cold case.

757
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:33.549
I came here because I saw an address from Mujin in the victim's notebook.

758
00:49:33.848 --> 00:49:35.549
And I saw a CCTV camera at the scene.

759
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:38.248
I just want to see if anything got caught on the camera.

760
00:49:38.248 --> 00:49:39.949
- Is that right? - Yes.

761
00:49:39.949 --> 00:49:41.319
Oh, excuse me for a second.

762
00:49:42.188 --> 00:49:43.489
Hello?

763
00:49:43.819 --> 00:49:45.429
It's been restored?

764
00:49:45.558 --> 00:49:46.889
- They restored it? - Yes.

765
00:49:46.889 --> 00:49:48.628
Okay, thank you. I'll come down shortly.

766
00:49:48.628 --> 00:49:50.598
Hey, just check it here.

767
00:49:50.598 --> 00:49:51.869
Tell them to email it to me.

768
00:49:51.869 --> 00:49:53.429
- Can I do that? Hello? - Yes.

769
00:49:53.429 --> 00:49:55.438
Please send it to Mr. Commissioner General via email.

770
00:49:55.438 --> 00:49:56.839
You know his email address, right? Yes.

771
00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:58.938
Okay, thank you.

772
00:50:00.938 --> 00:50:02.909
- It sounds like you got an email. - Yes.

773
00:50:05.779 --> 00:50:07.949
All right. Shall we have a look?

774
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:11.348
- I got the email. - Let me have a look.

775
00:50:11.348 --> 00:50:13.089
- Okay. - I need to watch it.

776
00:50:13.989 --> 00:50:16.159
Let's see. This is...

777
00:50:17.319 --> 00:50:19.889
I'll copy the file onto my flash drive.

778
00:50:19.889 --> 00:50:20.929
Sure.

779
00:50:21.859 --> 00:50:22.958
(Han Jin Sook, Royeol Insurance)

780
00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:25.429
Is the victim's name Han Jin Sook?

781
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:28.998
Sorry? Oh, yes.

782
00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:33.869
Gosh, the resolution is so low.

783
00:50:33.869 --> 00:50:36.139
Really? Let me see.

784
00:50:39.179 --> 00:50:40.848
Jae Geun, this is useless as it is now.

785
00:50:40.848 --> 00:50:44.319
I should check it again in Seoul.

786
00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:47.219
Jae Geun, call me if you're ever in Seoul.

787
00:50:47.219 --> 00:50:49.219
Let's grab a drink together. I know many good places.

788
00:50:49.219 --> 00:50:50.819
Yes, of course.

789
00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:52.228
- I'll get going. - All right. Get back safely.

790
00:50:52.228 --> 00:50:53.859
- I will. - Bye.

791
00:51:16.279 --> 00:51:18.018
- Hello. - Hello.

792
00:51:18.848 --> 00:51:21.788
Do you know if Mr. Commissioner General has left for the day?

793
00:51:21.788 --> 00:51:22.788
He's still here.

794
00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.628
- I see. Thank you. - No problem.

795
00:51:48.918 --> 00:51:50.478
What are you doing here, kids?

796
00:51:53.788 --> 00:51:55.489
Do you guys want to see a puppy at my place?

797
00:52:01.029 --> 00:52:02.029
(Loser)

798
00:52:05.029 --> 00:52:06.929
You'll follow me around and tell me...

799
00:52:06.929 --> 00:52:10.469
if you ever spot a human with the shadow inside the body, right?

800
00:52:24.279 --> 00:52:25.788
- Excuse me. - Yes.

801
00:52:25.788 --> 00:52:29.859
Around what time will Mr. Commissioner General be leaving?

802
00:52:30.058 --> 00:52:31.759
He just left.

803
00:52:31.989 --> 00:52:34.029
- Pardon me? - He just left.

804
00:52:34.929 --> 00:52:36.628
Is that his car? Gosh.

805
00:52:36.628 --> 00:52:39.569
No, no. Stop! Wait!

806
00:52:41.029 --> 00:52:43.768
She's not picking up? How dare she not pick up?

807
00:52:43.799 --> 00:52:45.768
Who does this human think she is?

808
00:52:45.768 --> 00:52:47.708
I even confirmed that Han Moo Gang didn't die...

809
00:52:47.708 --> 00:52:50.708
because of her and that he got murdered. What's her problem?

810
00:52:51.878 --> 00:52:53.708
Han Moo Gang was murdered?

811
00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:55.248
When the hostage situation was going on,

812
00:52:55.748 --> 00:52:58.049
the killer killed him on purpose but staged it as an accident.

813
00:52:58.119 --> 00:53:01.049
What the... So who killed him?

814
00:53:01.049 --> 00:53:03.119
How would I know? I'm not even interested.

815
00:53:03.688 --> 00:53:06.029
Gosh, that means we have a big problem.

816
00:53:08.259 --> 00:53:10.029
- What do you mean? - The killer might try...

817
00:53:10.029 --> 00:53:12.869
to kill Han Moo Gang again, thinking that he didn't die.

818
00:53:13.598 --> 00:53:16.168
If that happens, you'll no longer be able to use that body.

819
00:53:16.898 --> 00:53:20.308
A body that has died twice can't be used, you know.

820
00:53:21.378 --> 00:53:22.578
You're right.

821
00:53:23.279 --> 00:53:24.878
Yes.

822
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:29.248
Then where will you find another body of a detective?

823
00:53:29.248 --> 00:53:31.389
Let's say you got lucky and found one by chance.

824
00:53:31.648 --> 00:53:35.159
How will you manage to persuade that girl again in that body?

825
00:53:35.458 --> 00:53:38.259
She's not even helping her first love.

826
00:53:38.259 --> 00:53:40.089
If you ask her for a favor as a complete stranger,

827
00:53:40.089 --> 00:53:42.199
she'll obviously say no.

828
00:53:47.628 --> 00:53:50.239
This body is a lot more valuable than I thought it was.

829
00:53:50.239 --> 00:53:53.438
Yes, absolutely. You should be thankful.

830
00:53:54.208 --> 00:53:58.279
Treasure that body and use it well, okay?

831
00:53:59.009 --> 00:54:00.848
Gosh, that's amazing.

832
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:04.848
That means Han Moo Gang is helping you big time, 444.

833
00:54:05.018 --> 00:54:06.049
Hang on.

834
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:10.418
You happened to go into the body of that girl's first love.

835
00:54:11.228 --> 00:54:13.058
What if all of it was his will?

836
00:54:13.058 --> 00:54:14.128
What...

837
00:54:17.998 --> 00:54:19.029
Is it you?

838
00:54:19.029 --> 00:54:20.429
Let me live.

839
00:54:20.898 --> 00:54:22.268
What did you say?

840
00:54:23.768 --> 00:54:26.069
What did you say to Han Moo Gang?

841
00:54:26.239 --> 00:54:27.339
I just...

842
00:54:28.509 --> 00:54:29.779
apologized to him...

843
00:54:30.639 --> 00:54:32.279
and told him how sorry I am.

844
00:54:33.949 --> 00:54:35.648
I won't tell him.

845
00:54:36.949 --> 00:54:38.219
Don't kill me, please.

846
00:54:41.049 --> 00:54:43.389
He's going to try...

847
00:54:44.359 --> 00:54:47.159
to kill you again.

848
00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:50.328
So before he does, hurry up...

849
00:54:50.958 --> 00:54:51.998
You should...

850
00:54:57.139 --> 00:54:58.168
Hang on.

851
00:54:59.639 --> 00:55:02.578
Who's the scumbag that keeps on trying to kill Han Moo Gang?

852
00:55:04.078 --> 00:55:06.648
I cannot die again!

853
00:55:07.049 --> 00:55:08.779
Gosh, that fool.

854
00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:45.577
Are you okay?

855
00:57:07.834 --> 00:57:10.834
Han Moo Gang. What on earth...

856
00:57:11.064 --> 00:57:13.104
were you up to before you died?

857
00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.743
Sir, please do not lose that car over there.

858
00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:33.024
Yes, that car. Please keep following it.

859
00:57:41.363 --> 00:57:43.133
My gosh! What?

860
00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:49.874
Hey, kid. Are you all right?

861
00:57:52.274 --> 00:57:55.044
Kid, are you okay? Wait.

862
00:57:55.044 --> 00:57:57.073
Hey, kid!

863
00:58:03.953 --> 00:58:06.283
Yes, Mr. Oh. I just checked.

864
00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:07.683
He has no shadow with him.

865
00:58:08.154 --> 00:58:10.694
Yes, I'm going to head back to Seoul right away.

866
00:58:10.694 --> 00:58:12.064
Okay, bye.

867
00:58:30.814 --> 00:58:31.913
Hey.

868
00:58:32.144 --> 00:58:33.314
What are you doing here?

869
00:58:36.254 --> 00:58:38.084
I'm not a bad person.

870
00:58:38.584 --> 00:58:39.654
Where's your mom?

871
00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:42.424
Mom? My mom?

872
00:58:45.294 --> 00:58:47.363
My gosh, what are you doing here?

873
00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:51.734
Doesn't he live in this neighborhood?

874
00:58:52.004 --> 00:58:53.504
I've never seen him before.

875
00:58:57.334 --> 00:58:59.774
Hey, where do you live?

876
00:59:07.743 --> 00:59:09.484
You can't find your place?

877
00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:11.624
Eun Hye, Eun Hye.

878
00:59:11.984 --> 00:59:14.593
Eun Hye? Is that where you live?

879
00:59:15.024 --> 00:59:16.323
Eun Hye Town House?

880
00:59:19.323 --> 00:59:20.524
Don't cry.

881
00:59:27.904 --> 00:59:29.904
Stop crying, okay?

882
00:59:30.174 --> 00:59:32.203
Don't cry. Try to remember where your place is.

883
00:59:39.314 --> 00:59:40.444
Is it good?

884
00:59:46.154 --> 00:59:48.924
Where did you leave your sock?

885
00:59:55.234 --> 00:59:56.394
There we go.

886
01:00:04.073 --> 01:00:06.044
Oh, is that right? Okay.

887
01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:10.144
His dad is Officer Kim at Seochon Substation.

888
01:00:10.343 --> 01:00:12.113
He's been running around trying to find his son.

889
01:00:12.314 --> 01:00:15.453
- Oh, Officer Kim is that nice guy. - Yes.

890
01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:20.283
Yes, that boy is Officer Kim's son.

891
01:00:20.624 --> 01:00:23.223
Please wait just a little longer. His parents will be here shortly.

892
01:00:23.223 --> 01:00:24.453
Sure, no problem.

893
01:00:26.763 --> 01:00:28.294
Washroom.

894
01:00:28.294 --> 01:00:29.933
What? Do you want to go to the washroom?

895
01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.564
Excuse me, where's the washroom here?

896
01:00:32.564 --> 01:00:35.174
- It's over there. - I see. Thank you.

897
01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:37.504
Let's go. I'll take you there.

898
01:00:42.113 --> 01:00:44.343
Gosh. Hey, hey!

899
01:00:45.283 --> 01:00:46.944
Hey, you're...

900
01:00:50.783 --> 01:00:52.183
Hey, why did you...

901
01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:42.504
- Gosh, Geon Young! - Geon Young!

902
01:01:42.504 --> 01:01:43.973
There you are, Officer Kim.

903
01:01:44.274 --> 01:01:46.674
You must've been very worried. You look so pale.

904
01:01:46.674 --> 01:01:47.843
Geon Young.

905
01:01:49.644 --> 01:01:50.944
What's the matter?

906
01:01:51.113 --> 01:01:54.084
That young lady found Geon Young and brought him here.

907
01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:57.053
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

908
01:01:57.053 --> 01:01:58.424
Have you been starving your son?

909
01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:00.354
- Pardon? - Pardon?

910
01:02:00.354 --> 01:02:03.124
He was eating a chocolate bar at a store barefoot.

911
01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.964
Geon Young.

912
01:02:06.524 --> 01:02:09.394
He has sugar sensitivity,

913
01:02:09.394 --> 01:02:11.633
so we don't give him things like chocolate.

914
01:02:12.004 --> 01:02:13.763
But he's still young,

915
01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:17.734
so he leaves the house like this when he craves sweets. I'm sorry.

916
01:02:19.674 --> 01:02:21.944
How can you let him wander around like that?

917
01:02:22.444 --> 01:02:23.674
We're really sorry.

918
01:02:23.674 --> 01:02:24.883
It's all my fault.

919
01:02:24.883 --> 01:02:29.683
Goodness. He leaves the house the second you take your eyes off him.

920
01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.723
He always wanders around barefoot.

921
01:02:31.723 --> 01:02:33.254
Everyone in this area knows him.

922
01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:36.124
I have huge respect for them for raising him. If I were his dad...

923
01:02:38.993 --> 01:02:42.234
Officer Kim, you should take him home and give him dinner.

924
01:02:43.064 --> 01:02:44.334
Thank you.

925
01:02:44.504 --> 01:02:45.834
- We're really sorry again. - Oh, boy.

926
01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:51.404
- Thank you. - Thank you.

927
01:02:51.404 --> 01:02:53.573
- I'll call you. Speak to you soon. - Thank you. Take care.

928
01:03:04.654 --> 01:03:06.183
(Social Security Card, Kim Cheol Soo)

929
01:03:08.854 --> 01:03:09.953
Bye.

930
01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:16.263
Excuse me.

931
01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:18.234
Yes.

932
01:03:18.703 --> 01:03:19.734
You dropped this.

933
01:03:21.203 --> 01:03:23.133
- Thank you. - This too.

934
01:03:24.274 --> 01:03:27.444
Please don't let him wander around. Make sure he stays home.

935
01:03:29.243 --> 01:03:30.573
What do you mean?

936
01:03:31.044 --> 01:03:33.613
Anyway, don't let him go outside.

937
01:03:33.613 --> 01:03:35.553
Please make sure he doesn't leave the house.

938
01:03:36.654 --> 01:03:39.183
- Okay. Thank you. - Okay, we will.

939
01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:40.783
Thank you.

940
01:03:41.453 --> 01:03:42.593
Take care.

941
01:03:50.933 --> 01:03:53.363
I don't care. I've done my best.

942
01:03:53.734 --> 01:03:55.004
I won't worry about him.

943
01:04:29.973 --> 01:04:32.004
Ms. Han Jin Sook used to live here, right?

944
01:04:32.404 --> 01:04:33.444
Yes.

945
01:04:42.553 --> 01:04:43.883
What now?

946
01:04:46.254 --> 01:04:48.424
Do you cops still have things that you want to ask me?

947
01:04:51.924 --> 01:04:54.024
Just catch the killer, will you?

948
01:04:54.993 --> 01:04:56.194
By any chance,

949
01:04:57.133 --> 01:04:59.964
do you have any old photos of Ms. Han?

950
01:05:00.133 --> 01:05:01.374
Photos?

951
01:05:04.874 --> 01:05:06.174
Just a moment, please.

952
01:05:08.413 --> 01:05:10.644
Where did I put the album?

953
01:05:54.754 --> 01:05:57.624
Are you awake now?

954
01:05:58.424 --> 01:06:00.194
Did you have a fight with someone?

955
01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:06.763
I wonder who did that to you, Mr. Invincible.

956
01:06:10.973 --> 01:06:12.144
By the way,

957
01:06:12.674 --> 01:06:15.113
can you please turn on the TV before you leave?

958
01:06:15.113 --> 01:06:18.914
We can't turn it on ourselves, you know. It's so inconvenient.

959
01:06:18.914 --> 01:06:21.683
All right, come on. Please turn it on.

960
01:06:21.713 --> 01:06:23.683
The drama will be on soon.

961
01:06:26.553 --> 01:06:27.894
I can't let you have your way today.

962
01:06:28.053 --> 01:06:29.994
"Show Me the Money" will start soon.

963
01:06:29.994 --> 01:06:31.293
You brat.

964
01:06:31.293 --> 01:06:33.593
There's a thing called hierarchy. Do you really want me to get into it?

965
01:06:33.593 --> 01:06:35.734
You probably think that Crown Prince Sado died locked up in a rice chest.

966
01:06:35.734 --> 01:06:37.293
That's not true at all.

967
01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.303
I was right beside him when he died.

968
01:06:39.303 --> 01:06:40.564
Be quiet!

969
01:06:45.904 --> 01:06:47.944
What on earth was this guy up to before he died?

970
01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.244
I must gather more intel on Han Moo Gang.

971
01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:03.524
That's right.

972
01:07:04.494 --> 01:07:06.293
I bet there's something there.

973
01:07:07.364 --> 01:07:08.864
Yes, I should go there.

974
01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:10.933
Where are you going?

975
01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:16.873
What are you doing?

976
01:07:16.873 --> 01:07:20.074
Were you headed to that shoe closet?

977
01:07:20.074 --> 01:07:21.574
What? Why am I here?

978
01:07:23.444 --> 01:07:25.784
I should be in the basement of the building with a yard.

979
01:07:25.784 --> 01:07:27.883
Basement? I guess it's locked.

980
01:07:28.383 --> 01:07:30.753
We can't get into locked spaces, you know.

981
01:07:30.954 --> 01:07:34.694
That's why we come out through stinky bathroom stalls at times.

982
01:07:34.694 --> 01:07:36.024
- Exactly. - Yes.

983
01:07:36.024 --> 01:07:38.963
- A bank vault will be awesome. - Totally.

984
01:07:39.324 --> 01:07:41.093
- "Show Me the Money". - "Show Me the Money".

985
01:07:41.793 --> 01:07:44.564
Why is it kept locked? I can't even get in there.

986
01:07:45.303 --> 01:07:48.574
Then go open it so that you can go in there whenever you want.

987
01:07:51.244 --> 01:07:52.904
What a nuisance.

988
01:07:54.543 --> 01:07:55.774
Gosh, that temper.

989
01:08:22.003 --> 01:08:23.104
What's in there?

990
01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.744
They must've put up this steel door and locked it for a reason.

991
01:08:32.183 --> 01:08:33.814
What's inside? I can't see a thing.

992
01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.513
I don't even see anything.

993
01:09:24.263 --> 01:09:25.503
("Moojin Time Mart Collapsed")

994
01:09:25.503 --> 01:09:26.664
("The Collapse Killed 300 People")

995
01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:30.234
("The Bereaved Are Protesting Demanding the Truth to Be Revealed")

996
01:10:05.843 --> 01:10:09.013
I thought maybe this could help you regain your memory.

997
01:10:09.314 --> 01:10:10.774
It's Han Moo Gang.

998
01:10:41.574 --> 01:10:45.284
Well, is this working? Good.

999
01:10:48.114 --> 01:10:49.513
Introduce yourself.

1000
01:10:51.553 --> 01:10:54.253
I'm 14 years old, and my name is Kim Sun Young.

1001
01:10:54.894 --> 01:10:56.793
All right. Take your clothes off now.

1002
01:11:08.704 --> 01:11:09.803
What are you doing here now?

1003
01:11:11.774 --> 01:11:12.944
I'll do it.

1004
01:11:14.843 --> 01:11:15.914
What?

1005
01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:17.774
I'll do what you asked me to do.

1006
01:11:18.683 --> 01:11:20.944
I'll stay by your side at all times.

1007
01:11:21.183 --> 01:11:23.284
I'll be glued to you.

1008
01:11:24.954 --> 01:11:26.083
Is that right?

1009
01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.994
I'm glad to hear that.

1010
01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:30.694
So let's save his life.

1011
01:11:32.423 --> 01:11:34.293
Let's try to save that boy's life together.

1012
01:11:54.383 --> 01:11:56.053
(Black)

1013
01:11:56.314 --> 01:11:58.024
I clearly saw a stamp on the bandage...

1014
01:11:58.024 --> 01:11:59.984
on the guy who will kill Geon Young.

1015
01:12:00.154 --> 01:12:03.053
Are you sure that the shadow was inside that kid's body?

1016
01:12:03.053 --> 01:12:05.463
Ms. Fortune-teller, how do you even know this piece of trash?

1017
01:12:05.463 --> 01:12:06.763
You're keeping an eye on him, right?

1018
01:12:06.763 --> 01:12:08.864
He disappeared when his mom went to the bathroom.

1019
01:12:08.864 --> 01:12:10.364
No one can save his life.

1020
01:12:10.364 --> 01:12:11.364
That's...

1021
01:12:11.364 --> 01:12:12.404
No.

1022
01:12:12.704 --> 01:12:13.933
Give Geon Young back!

1023
01:12:13.933 --> 01:12:17.373
Don't you know what will happen when you meddle in humans' affairs?

1024
01:12:18.144 --> 01:12:19.944
I never meddled in anything.
