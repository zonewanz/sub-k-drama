00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:19.595
Hey, Ji Ho.

2
00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:21.435
I just got here.

3
00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:23.904
Okay, take your time.

4
00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:26.805
Welcome.

5
00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.894
Did you guys find each other?

6
00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:46.795
Hey.

7
00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:54.604
What is this? I thought it would be just two of us.

8
00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:58.475
Look who's talking? You didn't tell me she was coming.

9
00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:01.504
You wouldn't have shown up if I told you.

10
00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:03.714
Why are you sitting on the same side?

11
00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:06.244
I don't want to see her face.

12
00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:08.945
What is she talking about?

13
00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:12.085
Hey, I...

14
00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:15.824
have something to say to you.

15
00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:17.195
What is it?

16
00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.094
It's something I have to tell both of you.

17
00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:29.535
All right. Here.

18
00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.005
Let's have water first.

19
00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:36.244
What is it? Did something happen?

20
00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:37.744
What is it? You're making me nervous.

21
00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:39.344
What's going on?

22
00:01:41.484 --> 00:01:42.844
Guys...

23
00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:48.824
I...

24
00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:54.065
We'll look into the inflow after we apply SEO.

25
00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:56.764
Do you have anything else to note?

26
00:01:56.764 --> 00:01:58.594
(Tell acquaintances)

27
00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:04.104
Yes?

28
00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:05.775
During the last team dinner,

29
00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:08.675
how many of you...

30
00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:09.844
betted on my sexual orientation?

31
00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:14.714
What bet?

32
00:02:14.714 --> 00:02:16.714
Why would we do such a thing?

33
00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:18.184
We don't bet on things.

34
00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:20.784
Do we look like we have nothing better to do?

35
00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:22.885
Gosh, I'm speechless.

36
00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.694
Who made a bet on I'm gay?

37
00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:31.395
Who thought I was straight?

38
00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:34.904
How about asexual?

39
00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:39.434
Congratulations, Bo Mi.

40
00:02:41.874 --> 00:02:44.244
I'm getting married.

41
00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:45.944
What?

42
00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:48.944
Mr. Nam?

43
00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:51.485
What is he doing?

44
00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:53.485
- Getting married. - Married?

45
00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:56.955
Pay up. It's 50 dollars.

46
00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:00.464
Mr. Nam, can we talk?

47
00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:02.925
You're joking...

48
00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:05.934
because you're mad that we made a bet, right?

49
00:03:06.034 --> 00:03:07.534
Am I right?

50
00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:09.164
Did you pay 50 dollars?

51
00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:14.075
Hey. You're getting married? A real wedding?

52
00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:16.575
Marriage? Wedding? Holy matrimony?

53
00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:18.145
Yes.

54
00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:20.414
Is it with a woman?

55
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:21.645
Yes.

56
00:03:21.844 --> 00:03:23.714
Don't lie to me! How can you get married?

57
00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:25.885
An asexual can't get married.

58
00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:28.124
Do you think I'll believe you? It's a fake wedding, isn't it?

59
00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:31.754
You can't fool me. Gosh.

60
00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:33.124
She's pretty.

61
00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:37.295
- She's pretty? - Yes.

62
00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:42.664
Very.

63
00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:48.904
Se Hee's in love.

64
00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:52.545
Se Hee finally found love!

65
00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:58.455
- You're getting... - Married?

66
00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:00.224
With the landlord?

67
00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:04.555
Are you surprised?

68
00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:15.735
Since when did you start dating?

69
00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:17.534
Dating?

70
00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:23.005
We dated for about a month or two.

71
00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:26.044
Does that mean you dated as soon as you moved in?

72
00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:28.414
I guess so.

73
00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:29.784
You dated from then?

74
00:04:29.914 --> 00:04:31.114
Yes.

75
00:04:31.114 --> 00:04:32.654
Then why didn't you tell us?

76
00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:35.025
You told us there was nothing between you two.

77
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:36.825
Right?

78
00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:40.325
Yes. I thought it was strange how strongly you denied it.

79
00:04:42.025 --> 00:04:45.294
That's because we were just starting it out.

80
00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:48.604
It was embarrassing to tell you.

81
00:04:48.604 --> 00:04:50.575
But you're getting married so soon?

82
00:04:50.935 --> 00:04:52.674
Yes. Well...

83
00:04:54.104 --> 00:04:58.015
There are a lot of people that get married fast.

84
00:04:58.015 --> 00:04:59.645
That's other people.

85
00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:01.484
You're Ji Ho.

86
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.484
What about me?

87
00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:07.255
It takes you months to get close to someone.

88
00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:10.354
It's strange you'd get married so fast without warming up.

89
00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:11.455
Isn't it strange?

90
00:05:13.224 --> 00:05:15.094
A relationship...

91
00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:18.594
doesn't just rely on the time they've known each other.

92
00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:21.304
The thing is...

93
00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:24.234
Although we only met recently,

94
00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:27.044
I felt that he was someone I need in my life...

95
00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:28.145
Need?

96
00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:32.145
Well...

97
00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:36.185
It may sound strange I'm saying I need him...

98
00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:37.755
when he's a person,

99
00:05:38.085 --> 00:05:40.755
but what I mean is...

100
00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:45.695
I got it. I know why you're getting married.

101
00:05:46.424 --> 00:05:47.525
What?

102
00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:49.395
Ji Ho...

103
00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:54.604
You fell in love at first sight, right?

104
00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:00.844
You fell for him as soon as you saw him. Right?

105
00:06:00.844 --> 00:06:04.044
It happens in movies and dramas. It was like fireworks, right?

106
00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:06.344
Yes. That's right.

107
00:06:06.945 --> 00:06:08.015
Really?

108
00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:12.614
It just happened.

109
00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:17.054
As soon as I saw him, he had me.

110
00:06:18.354 --> 00:06:21.325
That's why you're getting married so fast.

111
00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:23.294
Yes.

112
00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:27.464
I think it might be fate.

113
00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:30.904
- Fate? - It's perfect.

114
00:06:36.844 --> 00:06:38.114
My gosh.

115
00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:43.284
I think it might be fate.

116
00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:46.455
I must be crazy.

117
00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:48.854
After writing a few dramas,

118
00:06:49.255 --> 00:06:51.455
I'm getting better at acting.

119
00:07:10.214 --> 00:07:12.745
Let's go. That way.

120
00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:21.724
Did you tell your coworkers?

121
00:07:21.825 --> 00:07:24.455
Yes. We had an all-staff meeting,

122
00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:26.395
so I was able to do it in one go.

123
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:31.094
What about your colleague you were worried about?

124
00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:33.205
It was easier than I had anticipated.

125
00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:36.534
I took advantage of the nature of male evolutionary psychology.

126
00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:37.904
Pardon?

127
00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:40.404
What about you?

128
00:07:40.404 --> 00:07:44.075
They are your old friends, so you were worried.

129
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:47.645
I was able to do it in one go as well.

130
00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:49.585
What kind of tactic did you use?

131
00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:51.885
I told them...

132
00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:53.854
What?

133
00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:57.955
I was... I was lucky.

134
00:07:58.154 --> 00:08:00.265
I used a storytelling method.

135
00:08:00.364 --> 00:08:03.094
I didn't know being a writer would help at a time like this.

136
00:08:03.094 --> 00:08:04.294
I see.

137
00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:12.174
(Nam Hee Bong)

138
00:08:15.205 --> 00:08:17.275
Shall we go in then?

139
00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:23.885
Will you be all right?

140
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.025
Yes. I'll do my best.

141
00:08:29.955 --> 00:08:32.454
Your mother must have watched my dramas,

142
00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:34.895
so I think it'll be okay.

143
00:08:36.324 --> 00:08:37.465
Your father, on the other hand...

144
00:08:37.465 --> 00:08:42.164
You don't have to pay attention to my father.

145
00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:01.584
The landlord's mother, Cho Myeong Ja.

146
00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:03.924
She's from Jongno District in Seoul.

147
00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:05.755
She was born in 1955.

148
00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:11.735
She wants to be seen as a good wife and a wise mother.

149
00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:12.735
She's a stay-at-home mom.

150
00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:15.934
Are you here?

151
00:09:16.034 --> 00:09:17.334
- Have you been well? - Yes.

152
00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:20.245
She wants her son's marriage issue to be taken care of fast...

153
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.544
in order to find peace in the family.

154
00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:25.574
She's a typical mother character who always opts for what's safe.

155
00:09:25.574 --> 00:09:27.745
This is Ji Ho whom I told you about.

156
00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:30.355
- Hello. - Hello.

157
00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:33.424
- Wasn't it hard coming here? - Not at all.

158
00:09:33.584 --> 00:09:36.355
I'm not sure if you'd like these...

159
00:09:36.355 --> 00:09:38.194
My goodness.

160
00:09:38.255 --> 00:09:40.395
There's no woman who would hate flowers.

161
00:09:42.564 --> 00:09:44.265
They smell great.

162
00:09:44.595 --> 00:09:47.005
I haven't gotten a bouquet in so long.

163
00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:48.865
I'm an expert at handling a character like her.

164
00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:51.304
I'm glad I worked on daily dramas for a long time.

165
00:09:51.434 --> 00:09:54.704
Your father went on a trip with his friends.

166
00:09:54.704 --> 00:09:56.245
He's coming from the airport now.

167
00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:58.215
- Take a seat. - Okay.

168
00:09:58.215 --> 00:09:59.314
All right.

169
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:10.154
The landlord's father, Nam Hee Bong.

170
00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:14.664
He taught students as a civics teacher for 30 years...

171
00:10:14.924 --> 00:10:17.334
until he retired last year after serving as a principal.

172
00:10:18.265 --> 00:10:19.495
(Respect your teacher, love your pupil)

173
00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:21.505
He's a typical educator character.

174
00:10:22.904 --> 00:10:24.704
I'm an expert with these characters.

175
00:10:25.135 --> 00:10:27.775
I think this will be easier than I thought...

176
00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:31.044
Are you home?

177
00:10:49.424 --> 00:10:53.404
I didn't know. I thought it was because you were a tenant.

178
00:10:53.704 --> 00:10:56.334
It's natural for an engaged couple to visit each other's homes.

179
00:10:57.034 --> 00:10:58.875
Did you think we wouldn't understand?

180
00:10:59.475 --> 00:11:00.605
Right, Honey?

181
00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:02.944
Right?

182
00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:09.284
Thank you for understanding.

183
00:11:09.444 --> 00:11:11.914
I was so flustered then.

184
00:11:11.914 --> 00:11:13.385
I know, it's okay.

185
00:11:13.654 --> 00:11:16.895
Wouldn't it be nice for the guy to step in and explain?

186
00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:19.255
The men in my family are too shy.

187
00:11:19.794 --> 00:11:21.324
It's not a bad thing, though.

188
00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:24.495
They're the type to take good care of you without saying anything.

189
00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:26.865
What do they call it again?

190
00:11:26.865 --> 00:11:28.505
Tsundere?

191
00:11:29.135 --> 00:11:30.674
Did I get it right?

192
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:38.275
Yes, I know. My family is from Gyeongsang Province.

193
00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:40.885
Really? Where?

194
00:11:41.515 --> 00:11:42.784
Namhae.

195
00:11:43.314 --> 00:11:47.525
Going to Seoul National University from Namhae is so rare.

196
00:11:47.654 --> 00:11:50.324
It's hard to get admitted even if you live in Seoul.

197
00:11:50.424 --> 00:11:51.554
Right?

198
00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:55.995
Why do you want to get married?

199
00:11:57.434 --> 00:11:59.034
What do you mean why?

200
00:11:59.034 --> 00:12:01.005
Youths get married because they like each other.

201
00:12:01.204 --> 00:12:03.404
What kind of question is that?

202
00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:05.174
You graduated from a good university.

203
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:08.275
If you're a writer, you must have a lot of passion about your career.

204
00:12:08.275 --> 00:12:10.314
Why do you want to get married so suddenly?

205
00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:11.875
You even quit.

206
00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:15.985
- Well... - That's enough.

207
00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:20.485
You were pushing Mom to pressure me.

208
00:12:20.755 --> 00:12:22.355
What are you doing now?

209
00:12:23.255 --> 00:12:25.125
I wasn't asking you.

210
00:12:25.255 --> 00:12:27.025
Well, the thing is...

211
00:12:30.564 --> 00:12:33.904
Se Hee and I haven't known each other for long, but...

212
00:12:33.904 --> 00:12:35.605
Don't couples these days...

213
00:12:35.804 --> 00:12:38.105
- call each other something else? - Pardon?

214
00:12:38.204 --> 00:12:39.904
You're 30, not 40.

215
00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:42.074
Why do talk about your boyfriend like that?

216
00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:44.544
Is this an interview?

217
00:12:44.544 --> 00:12:47.515
I'm asking what I'm entitled to. Don't overact.

218
00:12:47.515 --> 00:12:49.745
Why would you ask why we're getting married?

219
00:12:50.184 --> 00:12:51.814
Can't a father ask?

220
00:12:53.855 --> 00:12:54.985
Honey.

221
00:12:56.954 --> 00:13:00.395
I love my honey.

222
00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:21.314
(Episode 5: Because This Is My First Promise)

223
00:13:25.255 --> 00:13:26.985
(Mom: Are you having a good weekend with Ji Ho?)

224
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:31.595
Are you having a good weekend with Ji Ho?

225
00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:34.495
I was so touched that day.

226
00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.765
I didn't know you two were in so much love.

227
00:13:37.865 --> 00:13:40.704
- Gosh... - Son, I love you!

228
00:13:48.704 --> 00:13:50.574
- Are you going to work out? - Yes.

229
00:13:52.044 --> 00:13:53.485
It's a late lunch.

230
00:13:53.715 --> 00:13:55.745
Yes, I slept in.

231
00:13:58.054 --> 00:14:00.684
I must have been tense when we went to see your parents.

232
00:14:02.084 --> 00:14:04.395
Yes, you must have been nervous.

233
00:14:04.924 --> 00:14:06.824
Yes, I think so.

234
00:14:08.294 --> 00:14:09.965
If you were so nervous,

235
00:14:10.294 --> 00:14:11.465
how could you say that?

236
00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:13.135
Pardon?

237
00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:14.404
I love...

238
00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:18.704
my honey.

239
00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:23.414
Did you learn to say that line from writing scenarios?

240
00:14:29.314 --> 00:14:31.914
I was surprised by your bold choices.

241
00:14:31.914 --> 00:14:33.015
Well...

242
00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:36.694
Your father seemed like the type...

243
00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:39.694
that likes things straightforward.

244
00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:43.334
I see. But that was quite unexpected.

245
00:14:44.064 --> 00:14:46.064
I'm surprised that it worked out.

246
00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:48.965
He's not the type to believe such words.

247
00:14:50.204 --> 00:14:53.105
I thought he's been...

248
00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:55.275
waiting for such words.

249
00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:00.284
I think he wanted to check.

250
00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:04.454
I think he wanted to check if I'm the right person for his son.

251
00:15:05.184 --> 00:15:08.525
In that kind of situation, there's nothing straightforward...

252
00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:12.194
than saying I love you.

253
00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:14.664
That's right.

254
00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:16.995
It's also something really easy to say.

255
00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:24.005
Now, we just have to see each other's family tomorrow.

256
00:15:25.534 --> 00:15:28.875
Right. So is that the end of every process?

257
00:15:29.275 --> 00:15:31.275
Yes, if nothing else happens.

258
00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:33.145
I'm sure nothing will happen.

259
00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:36.245
I'll get going.

260
00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:38.985
Goodbye.

261
00:15:52.135 --> 00:15:55.465
(Is everyone busy today? Shall we have dinner together?)

262
00:16:02.404 --> 00:16:03.715
It's pretty.

263
00:16:06.615 --> 00:16:07.645
What is?

264
00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:10.115
The fine dust.

265
00:16:12.715 --> 00:16:16.025
- Do I sound crazy? - Yes.

266
00:16:17.054 --> 00:16:18.255
Am I crazier than Ji Ho?

267
00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:21.465
No.

268
00:16:24.395 --> 00:16:26.804
Soo Ji, is Ho Rang okay?

269
00:16:27.164 --> 00:16:30.034
What did she say? Did she ask if I'm okay?

270
00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.005
Yes.

271
00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:40.985
Did I not seem okay when she was saying it?

272
00:16:41.715 --> 00:16:43.355
Was it that obvious that I was jealous?

273
00:16:45.054 --> 00:16:47.255
No, just a little bit.

274
00:17:05.304 --> 00:17:08.505
Ji Ho, wear the dress I got you when you meet his parents.

275
00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:09.544
Okay?

276
00:17:12.215 --> 00:17:14.485
I know this can sound weird,

277
00:17:15.084 --> 00:17:17.884
but I'm sorry to get married...

278
00:17:18.314 --> 00:17:20.655
at this moment.

279
00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:26.354
I knew it.

280
00:17:28.695 --> 00:17:31.394
Just feel sorry until today, okay?

281
00:17:36.735 --> 00:17:39.874
Why would she feel sorry? It's not like she's marrying my husband.

282
00:17:40.175 --> 00:17:41.544
How innocent of her.

283
00:17:44.044 --> 00:17:46.215
Hey, you've never seen him, right?

284
00:17:46.374 --> 00:17:47.544
Who are you talking about?

285
00:17:47.985 --> 00:17:49.084
Ji Ho's husband.

286
00:17:49.544 --> 00:17:50.784
You know nothing in detail, do you?

287
00:17:51.455 --> 00:17:52.715
How would I know?

288
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:57.425
We have to know in details about him before they get married.

289
00:17:58.155 --> 00:18:00.064
That innocent Ji Ho isn't marrying some scammer, is she?

290
00:18:00.294 --> 00:18:02.294
Let's ask Won Seok when he comes back.

291
00:18:03.064 --> 00:18:05.094
He must know a lot about him.

292
00:18:08.364 --> 00:18:09.405
What is it?

293
00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:11.775
Are you two still fighting?

294
00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:17.475
He hasn't come home for five days already.

295
00:18:20.915 --> 00:18:22.284
You can't return it?

296
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:25.614
They'll never take it back.

297
00:18:32.124 --> 00:18:33.364
Aren't you going home?

298
00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:36.394
I drank 23 bottles of soju for the past 3 days.

299
00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:39.905
I feel like my organs are destroyed and my lever melted down.

300
00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:43.005
I can only go back if I have home. Where can I go back to?

301
00:18:43.405 --> 00:18:46.074
Go back to the rooftop house you got under your name...

302
00:18:46.074 --> 00:18:47.705
but with your girlfriend's deposit.

303
00:18:47.844 --> 00:18:50.475
I'm not going back! I'm really upset this time.

304
00:18:50.814 --> 00:18:52.574
Do you know how hard I tried to get that sofa?

305
00:18:52.574 --> 00:18:56.185
I sold that wireless keyboard I love to the secondhand shop.

306
00:18:56.314 --> 00:18:59.314
Why was she so upset though?

307
00:18:59.354 --> 00:19:01.624
You bought the sofa she wanted.

308
00:19:01.624 --> 00:19:04.425
If sofa's not the answer, then what is?

309
00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.794
I don't know. How can I keep up with her temperament?

310
00:19:09.794 --> 00:19:12.564
Or could it be something else...

311
00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:14.405
other than the sofa?

312
00:19:16.804 --> 00:19:18.804
I can't believe he really got you this sofa.

313
00:19:19.235 --> 00:19:20.874
Won Seok's so...

314
00:19:22.175 --> 00:19:24.175
pure. He's really innocent.

315
00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:30.155
Gosh, but this sofa is great.

316
00:19:32.915 --> 00:19:34.255
He really is pure.

317
00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:37.124
I tried so hard to make him dirty...

318
00:19:37.695 --> 00:19:41.025
when he was a pure engineering student for more than seven years.

319
00:19:43.195 --> 00:19:44.394
But I got it wrong.

320
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.465
I guess he can't be changed.

321
00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:50.034
Then why don't you just ask him to marry you?

322
00:19:50.735 --> 00:19:51.735
Are you crazy?

323
00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:54.705
Why not? The person who wants to get married fast should say it.

324
00:19:55.144 --> 00:19:56.515
I don't want to.

325
00:19:58.374 --> 00:20:00.284
I don't want to seem desperate.

326
00:20:07.425 --> 00:20:09.255
- A marriage proposal? - That's right.

327
00:20:09.255 --> 00:20:11.894
Listen. She wanted a sofa, and a matrimonial home,

328
00:20:11.894 --> 00:20:15.495
and talked about her colleague. That means she wants to get married...

329
00:20:15.495 --> 00:20:18.695
like her colleague in a matrimonial home where she can put the sofa.

330
00:20:19.665 --> 00:20:20.834
That must be it.

331
00:20:22.465 --> 00:20:24.475
No, that's not true. No way.

332
00:20:24.505 --> 00:20:27.675
What do you mean? I thought you've been seeing her for seven years.

333
00:20:28.044 --> 00:20:29.405
People normally get married after that long.

334
00:20:29.405 --> 00:20:33.144
Sang Goo, Ho Rang is not an ordinary girl.

335
00:20:33.445 --> 00:20:35.515
Do you know what she did for me when I was writing my thesis paper?

336
00:20:35.515 --> 00:20:38.485
She looked after my professor's dog when he went on a vacation.

337
00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:40.854
And she even helped with his kids' homework.

338
00:20:41.054 --> 00:20:44.725
She must know well what an important phase I'm going through now.

339
00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:48.564
Marriage? Gosh, you're only saying that because you don't know her.

340
00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:52.665
Oh, my goodness. We missed that part.

341
00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:58.175
She's mad because the sofa used to be displayed in the shop.

342
00:21:02.905 --> 00:21:03.975
My gosh.

343
00:21:05.844 --> 00:21:08.644
- That must be it. That's it. - That's right.

344
00:21:08.715 --> 00:21:10.255
How did you figure that out?

345
00:21:10.255 --> 00:21:11.955
Gosh, we missed that part.

346
00:21:12.915 --> 00:21:14.155
My gosh.

347
00:21:14.554 --> 00:21:17.695
- Gosh, it's bitter. - Have this soup.

348
00:21:19.794 --> 00:21:21.564
It's because it was displayed.

349
00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:34.644
Yes, Mom.

350
00:21:35.074 --> 00:21:36.874
- Aren't you sleeping? - What is it?

351
00:21:37.844 --> 00:21:39.715
Are you coming tomorrow morning?

352
00:21:39.884 --> 00:21:40.945
Yes.

353
00:21:41.544 --> 00:21:44.215
Oh, it's just...

354
00:21:44.354 --> 00:21:46.685
I had something to talk about with the meeting tomorrow.

355
00:21:47.554 --> 00:21:49.624
Is this Ji Ho? What is it?

356
00:21:53.165 --> 00:21:54.864
Dad, where's Mom?

357
00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:57.935
I don't know. She just passed the phone to me.

358
00:21:58.094 --> 00:22:00.005
What is it? Did something happen?

359
00:22:00.804 --> 00:22:01.864
It's...

360
00:22:07.344 --> 00:22:09.675
Okay, Dad. Safe trip tomorrow.

361
00:22:09.874 --> 00:22:10.915
Okay.

362
00:22:12.044 --> 00:22:13.384
- You're here. - Yes.

363
00:22:14.485 --> 00:22:16.614
- Was it your dad? - Yes.

364
00:22:17.054 --> 00:22:20.525
I told him that we're not going to have a wedding.

365
00:22:21.685 --> 00:22:23.124
I did too.

366
00:22:23.495 --> 00:22:25.124
- Oh, really? - Yes.

367
00:22:25.394 --> 00:22:27.124
I thought it'd be better to tell this ahead,

368
00:22:27.124 --> 00:22:29.225
so nothing special will happen tomorrow.

369
00:22:30.394 --> 00:22:33.405
Did your parents take it well?

370
00:22:33.765 --> 00:22:34.804
Yes, they did.

371
00:22:35.505 --> 00:22:36.574
Thankfully,

372
00:22:37.205 --> 00:22:40.175
Dad didn't have much to say about it.

373
00:22:40.604 --> 00:22:43.344
I think it's because my brother hasn't had a wedding yet.

374
00:22:43.344 --> 00:22:45.275
- I think that helped a little. - I see.

375
00:22:45.975 --> 00:22:48.245
My mother didn't say much too.

376
00:22:48.415 --> 00:22:51.985
I think the actual price of wedding must have shocked her much.

377
00:22:53.824 --> 00:22:54.985
That's great.

378
00:22:55.384 --> 00:22:56.854
Well,

379
00:22:57.495 --> 00:22:59.354
after the meeting tomorrow,

380
00:22:59.455 --> 00:23:02.394
there won't be any other expenses, right?

381
00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:03.534
Yes.

382
00:23:03.695 --> 00:23:06.134
After tomorrow,

383
00:23:06.364 --> 00:23:08.564
let's wrap up with the final contract.

384
00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:09.705
Sure.

385
00:23:11.935 --> 00:23:14.905
By the way, how did your mother react?

386
00:23:15.604 --> 00:23:17.415
What does your mother think?

387
00:23:18.344 --> 00:23:20.185
- Pardon? - I've thought about it,

388
00:23:20.515 --> 00:23:22.784
and realized your mother...

389
00:23:23.155 --> 00:23:25.354
had no special opinion from the last time we saw her.

390
00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:31.755
My mom...

391
00:23:34.564 --> 00:23:37.394
My mom usually doesn't have much opinion.

392
00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:41.405
I told you already that our family is totally patriarchal.

393
00:23:43.804 --> 00:23:47.775
Talking about opinions, I think your father has not much too.

394
00:23:48.675 --> 00:23:51.015
- What does your father think? - I'm not interested.

395
00:23:52.544 --> 00:23:53.614
Sorry?

396
00:23:54.515 --> 00:23:57.755
At 5pm tomorrow? I'll be at the bus terminal then.

397
00:23:57.955 --> 00:23:59.155
Okay.

398
00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:02.054
Wear thick clothes since it's cold in Seoul.

399
00:24:02.255 --> 00:24:03.425
Of course!

400
00:24:03.755 --> 00:24:06.155
Mom, don't forget to take medicine for nausea.

401
00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:09.894
Why isn't mom saying anything?

402
00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:13.864
She even put Dad on the phone.

403
00:24:20.044 --> 00:24:21.745
Mom, are you sleeping?

404
00:24:22.475 --> 00:24:23.614
I am sleeping.

405
00:24:26.644 --> 00:24:29.745
How can she message me back if she's asleep?

406
00:24:39.354 --> 00:24:40.465
What is it?

407
00:24:41.195 --> 00:24:43.495
It feels like she's holding a grudge against me.

408
00:24:49.564 --> 00:24:53.205
Marriage is a major life event.

409
00:24:53.804 --> 00:24:56.374
We are now in a very special relationship.

410
00:24:57.515 --> 00:25:00.614
Speaking of which, why don't I pour you a glass?

411
00:25:00.614 --> 00:25:02.884
- That sounds good. - Okay.

412
00:25:05.054 --> 00:25:08.384
Don't you think our kids are smart?

413
00:25:08.384 --> 00:25:11.955
I was a bit sad when they said they didn't want a wedding ceremony.

414
00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:14.265
But everyone is feeling the recession these days.

415
00:25:14.265 --> 00:25:16.765
I think they are very sensible.

416
00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:20.205
I'm glad you think that way.

417
00:25:22.405 --> 00:25:24.104
- Let me pour you a one. - Thanks.

418
00:25:26.235 --> 00:25:27.945
I appreciate it.

419
00:25:28.304 --> 00:25:31.215
I can imagine her being really smart...

420
00:25:31.574 --> 00:25:34.284
to get into Seoul University all the way from Namhae.

421
00:25:34.915 --> 00:25:37.985
That's not true. She's just like everybody else.

422
00:25:38.715 --> 00:25:41.324
She's very polite too.

423
00:25:41.955 --> 00:25:43.695
Yes, like everybody else.

424
00:25:44.155 --> 00:25:46.155
Not like the young ones these days,

425
00:25:46.155 --> 00:25:49.195
she's so innocent and kind.

426
00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:51.794
That's not true.

427
00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:54.935
She's just like everybody else.

428
00:25:57.334 --> 00:25:58.534
I see.

429
00:25:58.534 --> 00:25:59.775
She's just the same as everybody else.

430
00:26:00.005 --> 00:26:03.314
She is immature like everyone in her age.

431
00:26:03.374 --> 00:26:05.614
She is also a bit selfish.

432
00:26:06.044 --> 00:26:07.544
She's just one of the young ones.

433
00:26:07.685 --> 00:26:08.884
I don't think she's different from them.

434
00:26:10.955 --> 00:26:12.054
Okay.

435
00:26:12.314 --> 00:26:14.655
You shouldn't have said something unnecessary like that.

436
00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:21.465
Please let me pour you a glass too.

437
00:26:21.665 --> 00:26:22.725
That sounds good.

438
00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:24.064
It's a great day today.

439
00:26:26.294 --> 00:26:27.405
Right?

440
00:26:34.245 --> 00:26:35.705
Thank you.

441
00:26:35.874 --> 00:26:37.175
Did you pay for it?

442
00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:38.574
Yes.

443
00:26:38.874 --> 00:26:41.644
I've read that it's better to pay for the first family meeting...

444
00:26:41.715 --> 00:26:43.584
before leaving the place.

445
00:26:46.284 --> 00:26:49.084
Should we calculate everything at the end of every month?

446
00:26:49.084 --> 00:26:52.054
Splitting every time is a bit of hassle.

447
00:26:52.124 --> 00:26:54.824
Today will be the last time we need to pay for things anyway.

448
00:26:55.564 --> 00:26:57.534
Let me take care of this today.

449
00:26:57.534 --> 00:26:58.634
No, you can't.

450
00:26:59.165 --> 00:27:00.564
This is an expensive place.

451
00:27:00.564 --> 00:27:03.975
Your parents had to come all the way to Seoul.

452
00:27:04.475 --> 00:27:08.144
We have to count their transportation expenses and efforts.

453
00:27:09.245 --> 00:27:10.344
I see.

454
00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:28.894
We just need to announce and introduce each other's families.

455
00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:33.134
It's just taking several steps and things are done.

456
00:27:33.665 --> 00:27:37.804
Getting married is actually easier than I thought.

457
00:27:38.935 --> 00:27:41.005
Honestly, I was worried...

458
00:27:41.445 --> 00:27:44.314
because I thought my family wouldn't take things well.

459
00:27:44.915 --> 00:27:47.344
I knew it was going to be this easy.

460
00:27:47.814 --> 00:27:49.854
- Really? - Yes.

461
00:27:51.084 --> 00:27:53.824
We are quite a good combination of two people.

462
00:27:57.324 --> 00:27:59.794
Although on loan, I have a house.

463
00:28:00.495 --> 00:28:03.665
You went to a good university, but you don't have a job.

464
00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:06.834
I'm sure those play a part in their decision making.

465
00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:09.874
I agree with the former one.

466
00:28:10.275 --> 00:28:11.675
But what do you mean by the latter one?

467
00:28:11.675 --> 00:28:15.405
They want someone well-educated as the family of teachers.

468
00:28:15.975 --> 00:28:19.985
But they don't want to look up to their daughter-in-law.

469
00:28:20.215 --> 00:28:22.215
You satisfied my parents' hypocritical needs...

470
00:28:22.384 --> 00:28:24.515
unintentionally.

471
00:28:26.255 --> 00:28:29.324
I never thought me being unemployed as a graduate of a good school...

472
00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:32.324
could bring such a great synergy effect.

473
00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:34.425
That's a good thing.

474
00:28:34.525 --> 00:28:35.824
I'm glad.

475
00:28:44.235 --> 00:28:45.405
What?

476
00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:47.574
What did I say?

477
00:28:49.275 --> 00:28:52.215
Why are you like this today?

478
00:28:53.884 --> 00:28:55.284
Are you drunk?

479
00:29:00.124 --> 00:29:02.485
Yes, I am. I'm a little bit drunk.

480
00:29:03.195 --> 00:29:05.854
I'd love to say what I want to say since I'm a bit drunk.

481
00:29:06.124 --> 00:29:10.864
We don't want to marry off our daughter in such a way.

482
00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:14.304
What do you mean by that?

483
00:29:14.364 --> 00:29:16.675
I want them to do what everybody else does.

484
00:29:16.675 --> 00:29:18.205
I want them to have a wedding.

485
00:29:19.435 --> 00:29:21.874
They finished talking about it all.

486
00:29:21.874 --> 00:29:23.215
We think the same.

487
00:29:23.574 --> 00:29:26.175
They should have a wedding.

488
00:29:42.294 --> 00:29:44.394
Have you gone senile?

489
00:29:44.534 --> 00:29:46.465
Are you sick or something?

490
00:29:47.604 --> 00:29:49.935
My menopause is right around the corner.

491
00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:53.604
Why are you like this?

492
00:29:53.604 --> 00:29:56.614
Do you want to ruin your own daughter's marriage?

493
00:29:56.975 --> 00:29:59.814
What am I ruining?

494
00:30:00.284 --> 00:30:04.084
They sounded cocky first.

495
00:30:04.155 --> 00:30:05.584
What did they say?

496
00:30:05.584 --> 00:30:07.755
They are such nice people.

497
00:30:07.755 --> 00:30:09.485
They said she wasn't like the other young ones.

498
00:30:10.294 --> 00:30:13.025
They said she was innocent and kind.

499
00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:15.064
That's a compliment for a woman.

500
00:30:15.064 --> 00:30:18.495
They said it's better for her to stay home and raise a kid...

501
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:21.534
since it costs more if they both work.

502
00:30:21.935 --> 00:30:23.675
That's actually true.

503
00:30:25.505 --> 00:30:26.745
Besides,

504
00:30:27.505 --> 00:30:29.405
how could they think she looked like me?

505
00:30:33.344 --> 00:30:35.715
You and Ji Ho look exactly the same.

506
00:30:36.854 --> 00:30:38.755
Did you not know that?

507
00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:49.011
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E05 Because This is My First Life
"Because This is My First Promise"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

508
00:30:55.564 --> 00:30:56.735
Mom.

509
00:31:00.505 --> 00:31:02.405
Why are you like this?

510
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:07.485
When we went to Yong Hyun's wedding,

511
00:31:07.485 --> 00:31:10.284
you told me the wedding was just a noisy and money-spending event.

512
00:31:10.655 --> 00:31:13.455
We had a family meeting and introduced each other.

513
00:31:13.554 --> 00:31:15.054
Why do we have to have a wedding?

514
00:31:17.354 --> 00:31:20.394
I feel like they are looking down on us.

515
00:31:21.394 --> 00:31:23.935
Do you think it's a good thing they think you are innocent and kind?

516
00:31:24.034 --> 00:31:27.064
That means they want you to listen to them all the time...

517
00:31:27.064 --> 00:31:29.435
and have no opinion. Did you know that?

518
00:31:29.765 --> 00:31:31.205
It feels like they are looking down on you...

519
00:31:31.205 --> 00:31:34.275
because you are living with him before getting married.

520
00:31:36.275 --> 00:31:38.314
Why are you so twisted?

521
00:31:38.314 --> 00:31:40.314
It's true that they are looking down on you.

522
00:31:40.314 --> 00:31:42.284
Let me ask you more.

523
00:31:43.915 --> 00:31:45.015
Why do you...

524
00:31:46.255 --> 00:31:47.955
want to get married?

525
00:31:49.025 --> 00:31:51.925
What do you mean?

526
00:31:52.094 --> 00:31:55.725
Is it weird to get married even though I'm 30?

527
00:31:55.725 --> 00:31:56.834
What about your work?

528
00:31:57.864 --> 00:31:58.995
Are you not going to write?

529
00:32:03.604 --> 00:32:04.804
I'm not going to write anymore.

530
00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:08.104
I quit.

531
00:32:08.104 --> 00:32:09.874
You chose the marriage as your job.

532
00:32:10.445 --> 00:32:11.515
You are not actually getting married then.

533
00:32:11.515 --> 00:32:13.344
Why? There's nothing wrong with that.

534
00:32:13.344 --> 00:32:16.685
Do you think I paid for your college tuition for this?

535
00:32:17.185 --> 00:32:20.354
Is this what your dad gets after paying for you that much?

536
00:32:21.284 --> 00:32:22.554
How can you just become like this?

537
00:32:23.455 --> 00:32:24.725
What can I do?

538
00:32:25.225 --> 00:32:27.025
Did you think I could become someone?

539
00:32:28.594 --> 00:32:30.265
Did you expect me to give you money...

540
00:32:30.634 --> 00:32:32.564
if I become a famous writer?

541
00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:35.465
Yes, that's what I wanted.

542
00:32:36.675 --> 00:32:39.175
I'm so frustrated for what I did for you.

543
00:32:39.705 --> 00:32:41.475
I paid your college admission fee,

544
00:32:41.844 --> 00:32:44.275
and I even gave you more money without telling your dad.

545
00:32:44.644 --> 00:32:48.044
Give me back all your expensive clothes you wore for the rehearsals.

546
00:32:53.155 --> 00:32:54.485
You didn't even find a nice one either.

547
00:32:56.425 --> 00:32:59.225
You couldn't even get a bag like everybody else.

548
00:32:59.324 --> 00:33:00.594
How stupid you are.

549
00:33:03.634 --> 00:33:05.665
How can I get anything from them when I have nothing to give?

550
00:33:07.465 --> 00:33:08.864
What do we have?

551
00:33:10.104 --> 00:33:12.205
You can't even afford a place for me to stay.

552
00:33:12.534 --> 00:33:14.705
You should feel guilty about what you are saying now.

553
00:33:18.015 --> 00:33:19.114
Writing?

554
00:33:19.844 --> 00:33:22.945
That's what you can do when you have a good background.

555
00:33:24.255 --> 00:33:27.425
If you don't have any money, all you can do is just sleeping.

556
00:33:30.624 --> 00:33:31.925
You can't dream of anything.

557
00:33:52.275 --> 00:33:55.884
Your dad is being considerate about her and her family.

558
00:33:55.884 --> 00:33:57.084
Guys don't care much,

559
00:33:57.314 --> 00:34:00.955
but girls do want to wear a dress.

560
00:34:01.054 --> 00:34:03.495
You are never considerate,

561
00:34:03.495 --> 00:34:05.324
and I thought that's how you live your life.

562
00:34:08.264 --> 00:34:09.764
You can tell him that's what I said.

563
00:34:13.535 --> 00:34:16.575
What Se Hee wants to say is...

564
00:34:17.075 --> 00:34:21.345
that he doesn't want to hold an expensive wedding for others' sake.

565
00:34:21.374 --> 00:34:23.044
My daughter-in-law isn't a stranger.

566
00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:25.744
Tell him that.

567
00:34:29.014 --> 00:34:30.084
Well...

568
00:34:31.014 --> 00:34:32.584
So what your dad wants to say is...

569
00:34:33.224 --> 00:34:35.425
It's a happy day when we greet our new family member.

570
00:34:35.724 --> 00:34:38.255
We should all gather together and congratulate your wedding.

571
00:34:38.894 --> 00:34:41.525
Just say that you want to take back what you paid for others' weddings.

572
00:34:42.195 --> 00:34:45.064
That would make it sound more trustful.

573
00:34:46.035 --> 00:34:47.535
Se Hee.

574
00:34:47.934 --> 00:34:49.974
You must want to brag about...

575
00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:51.805
how well you raised your son...

576
00:34:52.405 --> 00:34:54.075
and how well-educated your daughter-in-law is.

577
00:34:55.445 --> 00:34:58.115
I'm not getting married to save your face.

578
00:35:02.314 --> 00:35:04.954
You promised that you'd never threaten Mom with divorce...

579
00:35:04.954 --> 00:35:07.155
and that you'd stay out of my business if I got married.

580
00:35:07.925 --> 00:35:08.925
Keep it.

581
00:35:12.555 --> 00:35:15.064
You're not even holding a wedding ceremony,

582
00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:17.095
and you call that a marriage?

583
00:35:19.064 --> 00:35:20.334
I won't accept it.

584
00:35:23.604 --> 00:35:25.575
Calm down, and go.

585
00:35:26.135 --> 00:35:27.575
Just go.

586
00:35:43.555 --> 00:35:45.454
I thought you had a Korean course meal for dinner.

587
00:35:45.825 --> 00:35:47.925
It's been digested already.

588
00:35:50.664 --> 00:35:52.494
Are you really not going to hold a wedding ceremony?

589
00:35:55.164 --> 00:35:56.675
I'm jobless,

590
00:35:56.874 --> 00:35:59.235
and he has to pay back his loan.

591
00:35:59.735 --> 00:36:00.805
It'll be too much of a luxury.

592
00:36:00.974 --> 00:36:02.805
Don't you want to wear a wedding dress?

593
00:36:03.175 --> 00:36:04.845
What about wedding pictures?

594
00:36:05.374 --> 00:36:09.014
I don't know. Both of us don't put much importance in those things.

595
00:36:09.544 --> 00:36:12.914
Ji Ho, a wedding ceremony isn't for just the two of you.

596
00:36:13.224 --> 00:36:15.084
Your opinions don't matter.

597
00:36:15.354 --> 00:36:17.494
You know why you hold a press conference before you make a drama.

598
00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:19.965
The investors and broadcasting station won't suffer a loss...

599
00:36:19.965 --> 00:36:22.264
if you draw people's attention by doing so.

600
00:36:22.595 --> 00:36:24.064
A wedding ceremony is just the same.

601
00:36:24.164 --> 00:36:26.095
That's why I don't want it.

602
00:36:26.604 --> 00:36:27.965
Why...

603
00:36:28.834 --> 00:36:31.005
And my parents aren't investors.

604
00:36:31.405 --> 00:36:33.035
Of course, they are.

605
00:36:33.104 --> 00:36:36.275
Your mom said similar stuff. She must've said it in a fit of temper,

606
00:36:36.544 --> 00:36:39.775
but she must want to be compensated by some means...

607
00:36:39.775 --> 00:36:40.814
even if it's not money.

608
00:36:40.945 --> 00:36:45.215
Right, I want to see you in a dress, and she must want it more than I do.

609
00:36:45.555 --> 00:36:48.684
I don't have any money to pay for my wedding.

610
00:36:49.385 --> 00:36:51.394
Neither does my housemate.

611
00:36:54.394 --> 00:36:57.465
By the way, why do you keep calling your fiance as your housemate?

612
00:37:02.905 --> 00:37:04.434
Did I?

613
00:37:04.704 --> 00:37:06.104
Yes, twice.

614
00:37:07.544 --> 00:37:10.514
Did I? Why did I do that?

615
00:37:10.945 --> 00:37:12.314
Are you...

616
00:37:13.144 --> 00:37:15.885
playing some kind of role play like a tenant and landlord?

617
00:37:17.155 --> 00:37:18.584
"Your rent is overdue."

618
00:37:19.584 --> 00:37:21.124
"I'll give you a lesson tonight."

619
00:37:21.885 --> 00:37:22.985
Gosh.

620
00:37:23.084 --> 00:37:24.425
You're crazy.

621
00:37:24.425 --> 00:37:25.894
No way.

622
00:37:25.894 --> 00:37:28.264
"Your bath runs only cold water?"

623
00:37:28.825 --> 00:37:30.635
"Then I'll heat it for you..."

624
00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:33.064
- "with my body." - Gosh.

625
00:37:33.264 --> 00:37:34.635
- You silly. - Goodness.

626
00:37:34.905 --> 00:37:37.635
- That's crazy. - That's not it, you crazy brats.

627
00:37:37.905 --> 00:37:39.005
Goodness.

628
00:37:41.874 --> 00:37:44.445
- You're not wearing a bra again? - No.

629
00:37:45.514 --> 00:37:46.914
What's wrong with you?

630
00:37:47.184 --> 00:37:49.345
- Why would you not wear it? - Hey.

631
00:37:49.644 --> 00:37:52.385
Think about it. All day long, I have to squeeze...

632
00:37:52.385 --> 00:37:54.785
my healthy chest like this by wearing a bra.

633
00:37:55.255 --> 00:37:56.325
Don't you feel it's suffocating?

634
00:37:56.494 --> 00:37:58.624
Let go or I'll kill you.

635
00:38:03.235 --> 00:38:05.195
I'd feel much at ease to go to work if I wouldn't have to wear...

636
00:38:05.195 --> 00:38:08.064
Ji Ho, Mom wants to know your boyfriend's number.

637
00:38:17.044 --> 00:38:19.445
- Give us one more beer, please. - It's okay.

638
00:38:20.845 --> 00:38:22.345
I thought you wanted to get drunk today.

639
00:38:22.715 --> 00:38:24.255
I'm drunk enough.

640
00:38:25.414 --> 00:38:28.854
Your neurons are so rational to feel tipsy with 500ml of beer.

641
00:38:28.854 --> 00:38:29.954
They're nice.

642
00:38:30.025 --> 00:38:32.494
Why don't your neurons work rationally about your marriage...

643
00:38:32.624 --> 00:38:35.195
when they do regarding drinking issues?

644
00:38:36.465 --> 00:38:39.965
- What do you mean? - Weddings are for collecting money.

645
00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:43.064
People get so excited even if they pay for their own meals.

646
00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:45.204
I told you so many times that it's such a strange event.

647
00:38:45.735 --> 00:38:47.905
You hold your wedding by collecting money from people.

648
00:38:47.905 --> 00:38:49.945
You'll benefit from this anyway.

649
00:38:50.414 --> 00:38:53.285
I have no intention on being my parents' tool to collect money.

650
00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:58.155
Do you want to suffer all your marriage life because of this?

651
00:38:58.314 --> 00:39:00.285
Or do you want to live in peace after bearing it for two hours?

652
00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:04.124
You sure you can put up with their nagging for the rest of your life?

653
00:39:07.064 --> 00:39:09.465
Just do it. It doesn't cost that much money to hold a wedding.

654
00:39:09.525 --> 00:39:11.595
Shall I make an estimate for you?

655
00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:13.934
- No, thanks. - Okay.

656
00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:17.635
I won't give you a wedding gift, so don't buy me a meal for this.

657
00:39:17.834 --> 00:39:19.805
I know a place that provides dresses at a cheap price.

658
00:39:20.305 --> 00:39:22.644
Skip the traditional wedding.

659
00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:24.845
Okay, it'll cost about this much.

660
00:39:24.845 --> 00:39:26.115
I said, it's okay.

661
00:39:29.684 --> 00:39:31.285
It'll cost only this much?

662
00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:34.785
If you ask your acquaintances for help, it can get lower than this.

663
00:39:35.525 --> 00:39:36.655
Ask him.

664
00:39:38.994 --> 00:39:42.325
Who on earth is he that he's been sleeping here?

665
00:39:42.724 --> 00:39:44.965
He's been sleeping here since yesterday.

666
00:39:45.934 --> 00:39:49.235
He's that guy. The one who introduced you to Ji Ho.

667
00:39:49.905 --> 00:39:52.405
Hey, wake up.

668
00:39:53.305 --> 00:39:55.104
Be careful.

669
00:39:56.204 --> 00:39:57.215
Well...

670
00:39:59.445 --> 00:40:01.285
Nice to meet you.

671
00:40:01.615 --> 00:40:04.314
I'll make a mobile wedding invitation for you, so don't worry.

672
00:40:21.064 --> 00:40:23.204
Did you persuade your mother?

673
00:40:27.204 --> 00:40:30.215
Did you persuade your father?

674
00:40:52.365 --> 00:40:53.604
- Why don't we... - Why don't we...

675
00:40:56.474 --> 00:40:58.474
Go ahead.

676
00:41:01.744 --> 00:41:03.075
Why don't we...

677
00:41:04.845 --> 00:41:06.115
just hold...

678
00:41:07.385 --> 00:41:08.584
a wedding ceremony?

679
00:41:13.624 --> 00:41:16.084
Make sure you stabilize the app within this week.

680
00:41:16.155 --> 00:41:18.525
You all know that we're having a company dinner this Monday, right?

681
00:41:19.224 --> 00:41:22.294
Who does company dinners on Mondays? I have a plan already.

682
00:41:22.394 --> 00:41:24.834
This is the strong point of our liberal company.

683
00:41:25.035 --> 00:41:27.865
Be a CEO yourself if you don't like the idea.

684
00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:32.275
I don't think I can join the company dinner this time.

685
00:41:33.374 --> 00:41:37.474
You're not allowed to miss it unless it's family business.

686
00:41:37.544 --> 00:41:39.644
I have to attend a wedding in the evening that day.

687
00:41:40.445 --> 00:41:42.044
A wedding in the evening of Monday.

688
00:41:42.684 --> 00:41:45.314
What a nice date selection.

689
00:41:45.314 --> 00:41:48.755
What kind of people are they that they're getting married on Monday?

690
00:41:48.785 --> 00:41:51.195
- Whose wedding is it? - It's my wedding.

691
00:41:52.525 --> 00:41:53.965
So I have to attend it.

692
00:41:56.325 --> 00:41:58.595
It's the cheapest day.

693
00:41:59.805 --> 00:42:01.235
You're the host for my wedding.

694
00:42:01.365 --> 00:42:04.305
By any chance, can you not make it because of the company dinner?

695
00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:16.485
She said she wore it only once, and it does look brand new.

696
00:42:17.084 --> 00:42:20.354
Thank you. Tell her that I'll treat her to a meal for certain.

697
00:42:20.684 --> 00:42:23.724
Are you going to be okay? It's a used dress.

698
00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:27.794
It's for wedding pictures, so it's too bland. It's not flowing either.

699
00:42:29.624 --> 00:42:31.535
I'll wear this for about an hour anyway.

700
00:42:31.934 --> 00:42:33.095
It's pretty.

701
00:42:33.604 --> 00:42:36.575
All wedding dresses look the same to me.

702
00:42:37.175 --> 00:42:39.575
I can't believe it. Are you color blind or something?

703
00:42:40.005 --> 00:42:41.945
It'll be held in the evening of a weekday. Will there be many guests?

704
00:42:42.604 --> 00:42:46.044
Most of them will be our parents' guests. Ours won't be that many.

705
00:42:46.514 --> 00:42:47.615
The landlord...

706
00:42:48.445 --> 00:42:51.555
Se Hee invited his colleagues.

707
00:42:52.084 --> 00:42:54.224
Will there be someone nice among his friends?

708
00:42:54.285 --> 00:42:56.255
You know, I haven't dated a man for a while.

709
00:42:57.224 --> 00:42:59.865
It must be your sexual life, not dating.

710
00:43:00.425 --> 00:43:03.294
Do you not like the mister whom you were seeing before?

711
00:43:03.294 --> 00:43:04.635
Did you block him?

712
00:43:05.834 --> 00:43:09.604
He looks all right, but he's too distracting.

713
00:43:12.505 --> 00:43:14.405
Oh, right. Ho Rang.

714
00:43:15.244 --> 00:43:18.775
I called Won Seok because of my wedding.

715
00:43:19.885 --> 00:43:20.985
Is that right?

716
00:43:21.115 --> 00:43:23.985
I guess he drinks every day these days.

717
00:43:24.414 --> 00:43:26.184
He didn't sound so good.

718
00:43:27.954 --> 00:43:29.055
Is that right?

719
00:43:29.794 --> 00:43:32.294
Are you not going to call him?

720
00:43:34.564 --> 00:43:37.235
Why would I call my ex-boyfriend? It's clingy.

721
00:43:38.564 --> 00:43:40.735
He didn't call me more than a week, so I thought he wanted to break up.

722
00:43:41.735 --> 00:43:43.175
I'm going on a blind date next week.

723
00:43:50.175 --> 00:43:51.215
All right.

724
00:43:53.215 --> 00:43:57.084
Which concept do you want? Romantic, traditional, or comical concept?

725
00:43:57.285 --> 00:43:58.954
- What is this? - Choose a concept for your wedding.

726
00:43:59.014 --> 00:44:00.224
Are you going to sing?

727
00:44:00.825 --> 00:44:01.854
No.

728
00:44:02.285 --> 00:44:06.325
Something old-fashioned like doing push-ups and stuff...

729
00:44:06.325 --> 00:44:07.965
is more exciting in wedding ceremonies indeed.

730
00:44:08.095 --> 00:44:09.224
I can't wait.

731
00:44:09.224 --> 00:44:10.865
Don't do anything.

732
00:44:11.195 --> 00:44:12.010
What?

733
00:44:12.268 --> 00:44:13.308
All right.

734
00:44:15.308 --> 00:44:19.177
Which concept do you want? Romantic, traditional, or comical concept?

735
00:44:19.378 --> 00:44:21.047
- What is this? - Choose a concept for your wedding.

736
00:44:21.107 --> 00:44:22.317
Are you going to sing?

737
00:44:22.918 --> 00:44:23.947
No.

738
00:44:24.378 --> 00:44:28.418
Something old-fashioned like doing push-ups and stuff...

739
00:44:28.418 --> 00:44:30.058
is more exciting in wedding ceremonies indeed.

740
00:44:30.188 --> 00:44:31.317
I can't wait.

741
00:44:31.317 --> 00:44:32.958
Don't do anything.

742
00:44:33.288 --> 00:44:34.103
What?

743
00:44:34.165 --> 00:44:36.064
There's only one thing you can do.

744
00:44:36.064 --> 00:44:39.075
To get over with the wedding as quickly as possible.

745
00:44:39.674 --> 00:44:40.774
What is this about?

746
00:44:40.774 --> 00:44:42.745
That's the only wedding you'll have in your life.

747
00:44:42.745 --> 00:44:44.075
And you want it to end fast?

748
00:44:44.075 --> 00:44:46.515
Yes, I want my wedding to be short and typical...

749
00:44:46.515 --> 00:44:48.785
so that no one would remember it.

750
00:44:49.785 --> 00:44:50.955
Please do that for me.

751
00:44:56.024 --> 00:44:58.625
He must be planning something.

752
00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:04.194
What are you going to wear as a groom?

753
00:45:04.495 --> 00:45:07.134
- I'll just wear a suit. - Okay.

754
00:45:08.134 --> 00:45:10.375
What about our parents' hanbok?

755
00:45:10.634 --> 00:45:12.805
My parents are going to borrow from their relatives.

756
00:45:12.805 --> 00:45:14.305
My mother has one already.

757
00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:18.415
I see. It's much more simple than I thought.

758
00:45:19.114 --> 00:45:20.785
Are we done now?

759
00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.884
The most important part.

760
00:45:23.314 --> 00:45:25.814
- Our contract. - Oh, right.

761
00:45:27.384 --> 00:45:30.055
What we have to agree on...

762
00:45:30.055 --> 00:45:31.855
We have to talk about the costs.

763
00:45:31.855 --> 00:45:34.125
And the contract termination.

764
00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:35.194
Right.

765
00:45:35.495 --> 00:45:36.694
Like we discussed last time,

766
00:45:36.694 --> 00:45:39.665
we will each pay for family events and holidays.

767
00:45:39.904 --> 00:45:41.234
Is that okay with you?

768
00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:42.665
Yes, I'm good with it.

769
00:45:42.734 --> 00:45:44.904
Let's terminate the contrast after two years.

770
00:45:44.904 --> 00:45:48.345
If there are any unexpected events, we will discuss again.

771
00:45:49.044 --> 00:45:50.975
- Is that okay with you? - Yes.

772
00:45:53.384 --> 00:45:56.515
By the way, how will we...

773
00:45:56.714 --> 00:45:58.584
end the contract?

774
00:45:58.915 --> 00:46:02.924
What I mean is... Are we going to get divorce by mutual agreement?

775
00:46:03.424 --> 00:46:06.395
Of course we're not going to register our marriage,

776
00:46:06.524 --> 00:46:09.225
but we've told our friends and all...

777
00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:11.095
Yes, I suppose that's what's going to happen.

778
00:46:11.765 --> 00:46:14.535
We will end the contract by getting a divorce.

779
00:46:14.834 --> 00:46:18.105
On the outside, we'll tell people we agreed to get divorced...

780
00:46:18.105 --> 00:46:19.105
due to our differences.

781
00:46:19.435 --> 00:46:21.145
How does that sound?

782
00:46:22.544 --> 00:46:24.714
I like that. That'd be okay.

783
00:46:25.044 --> 00:46:26.145
All right.

784
00:46:35.185 --> 00:46:37.024
What did you bring me late at night?

785
00:46:37.555 --> 00:46:39.555
Mom brought some food for you last time.

786
00:46:39.555 --> 00:46:41.464
I couldn't give it to you because you just left.

787
00:46:43.694 --> 00:46:47.234
Mom asked for your boyfriend's number.

788
00:46:47.234 --> 00:46:49.504
Tell her you don't know and that I didn't give it to you.

789
00:46:50.504 --> 00:46:51.935
What's she going to talk about with him?

790
00:46:52.634 --> 00:46:55.705
What has gotten into Mom all of a sudden?

791
00:46:55.705 --> 00:46:57.214
Why is she acting so strange?

792
00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:58.544
I was a little surprised too.

793
00:46:59.785 --> 00:47:01.544
I thought Mom wouldn't be like this.

794
00:47:01.614 --> 00:47:04.915
I was shocked when she talked about the wedding and a designer bag.

795
00:47:05.314 --> 00:47:06.384
I know.

796
00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:10.194
Don't worry. You only need to go through the wedding now.

797
00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:12.125
I'll take Mom and Dad safely.

798
00:47:12.395 --> 00:47:14.694
- See you there. - Bye.

799
00:47:17.694 --> 00:47:18.794
Ji Ho.

800
00:47:20.334 --> 00:47:21.435
By the way,

801
00:47:22.805 --> 00:47:25.105
I think I kind of know why Mom's behaving like that.

802
00:47:26.475 --> 00:47:28.075
Getting married...

803
00:47:28.904 --> 00:47:30.544
isn't as simple as you think.

804
00:47:32.745 --> 00:47:35.214
You'll know what I mean once you get married.

805
00:47:38.915 --> 00:47:41.055
He's talking as if he's been married for more than six years.

806
00:47:41.955 --> 00:47:43.524
It's only been six months.

807
00:47:48.564 --> 00:47:50.734
According to the sociologist, Gary Becker,

808
00:47:51.734 --> 00:47:55.165
people only get married if it brings more benefits...

809
00:47:55.265 --> 00:47:57.174
than being single.

810
00:48:16.225 --> 00:48:18.225
I thought getting married...

811
00:48:18.855 --> 00:48:20.024
was simple.

812
00:48:21.924 --> 00:48:24.595
It's what people who calculate benefits can do.

813
00:48:25.194 --> 00:48:26.864
But for us,

814
00:48:28.265 --> 00:48:29.805
there's no affection.

815
00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:35.404
So I thought it's something...

816
00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:37.475
more simple.

817
00:49:12.475 --> 00:49:13.745
Shall we?

818
00:49:13.944 --> 00:49:15.044
Sure.

819
00:49:16.584 --> 00:49:19.685
It suits you better than I thought.

820
00:49:21.754 --> 00:49:22.995
Thank you.

821
00:49:25.555 --> 00:49:27.864
What? There's traffic?

822
00:49:28.424 --> 00:49:30.435
- How long will... - I think there's an accident.

823
00:49:30.435 --> 00:49:32.495
I think it'll take more than an hour. What should we do?

824
00:49:32.495 --> 00:49:33.605
An hour?

825
00:49:33.665 --> 00:49:36.904
Ji Ho, get going first. You'll be late otherwise.

826
00:49:36.904 --> 00:49:39.504
Okay then. See you later.

827
00:49:40.274 --> 00:49:41.345
What should we do?

828
00:49:41.444 --> 00:49:44.645
My friends who were supposed to pick us up are going to be late.

829
00:49:44.645 --> 00:49:48.345
I was checking the traffic condition and there's been an accident.

830
00:49:48.614 --> 00:49:50.785
I think we should go by taxi first.

831
00:49:50.785 --> 00:49:53.084
- Otherwise, we'll be late. - Okay, let's do that.

832
00:49:57.654 --> 00:50:01.095
That bus goes to the wedding hall.

833
00:50:02.194 --> 00:50:03.364
I know.

834
00:50:04.165 --> 00:50:06.194
Taxi will cost us much.

835
00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:13.544
- Shall we run? - Okay.

836
00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:38.694
We'll be there in time, right?

837
00:50:38.694 --> 00:50:40.234
Yes, we have enough time.

838
00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:46.345
By any chance,

839
00:50:47.075 --> 00:50:49.645
do you think you need a handkerchief?

840
00:50:49.645 --> 00:50:51.875
Pardon? A handkerchief?

841
00:50:51.875 --> 00:50:55.515
I mean, my friend told me I must bring a handkerchief.

842
00:50:56.685 --> 00:50:59.114
He told me I have to wipe the bride's tears...

843
00:50:59.214 --> 00:51:01.984
with my handkerchief when she cries.

844
00:51:02.855 --> 00:51:05.294
I'm going to cry?

845
00:51:05.625 --> 00:51:06.794
I thought so.

846
00:51:06.924 --> 00:51:08.825
That won't happen, will it?

847
00:51:09.225 --> 00:51:10.334
Of course.

848
00:51:11.564 --> 00:51:13.064
You shouldn't worry about it.

849
00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:18.134
Why would I cry? I'm not that type of person.

850
00:51:18.805 --> 00:51:19.904
Okay.

851
00:51:21.274 --> 00:51:23.274
That's a big relief.

852
00:51:26.915 --> 00:51:28.114
Hey, Ji Ho.

853
00:51:28.114 --> 00:51:30.714
You look so beautiful.

854
00:51:30.714 --> 00:51:32.055
Ji Ho!

855
00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.225
- You're here. - Ji Ho!

856
00:51:33.325 --> 00:51:35.455
Oh, my goodness. You're so beautiful.

857
00:51:35.984 --> 00:51:38.625
I knew you'd be beautiful, but it's beyond my expectation.

858
00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:41.864
Please sit down with her. I'll take a photo for you.

859
00:51:41.864 --> 00:51:42.964
- Okay. - Okay.

860
00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:44.935
You're so beautiful.

861
00:51:45.334 --> 00:51:48.504
Hey, your groom looks so much better in person.

862
00:51:49.035 --> 00:51:51.234
I thought you don't care much about looks.

863
00:51:51.504 --> 00:51:53.475
I know. I was so surprised. He's really tall too.

864
00:51:53.475 --> 00:51:55.475
Really? Is he tall?

865
00:51:56.044 --> 00:51:58.015
Hey, did you put on a waterproof makeup?

866
00:51:58.015 --> 00:51:59.075
Does it have to be waterproof?

867
00:51:59.444 --> 00:52:01.544
Your makeup will be erased when you cry later.

868
00:52:01.544 --> 00:52:03.984
So brides must wear waterproof makeups, don't you know?

869
00:52:04.915 --> 00:52:06.015
I'll take it now.

870
00:52:07.024 --> 00:52:08.424
1, 2.

871
00:52:16.895 --> 00:52:17.964
Thank you for coming.

872
00:52:18.234 --> 00:52:20.105
- Hello. - Welcome.

873
00:52:22.265 --> 00:52:23.404
Hello.

874
00:52:24.205 --> 00:52:25.404
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

875
00:52:25.904 --> 00:52:28.504
Goodness, you didn't have to give that much.

876
00:52:28.504 --> 00:52:29.645
Hello.

877
00:52:29.714 --> 00:52:31.274
Go on in.

878
00:52:34.515 --> 00:52:35.645
Where are you going?

879
00:52:36.084 --> 00:52:37.185
To the restroom.

880
00:52:50.895 --> 00:52:52.464
The bride went to the restroom.

881
00:52:53.665 --> 00:52:54.765
Is that so?

882
00:53:13.125 --> 00:53:16.185
Do you have anything to say?

883
00:53:17.855 --> 00:53:20.725
No, I don't.

884
00:53:22.194 --> 00:53:23.794
Then why are you coming out from there?

885
00:53:26.364 --> 00:53:28.864
I thought it was a bathroom.

886
00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.174
Mom.

887
00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:38.745
Why did you ask for his number?

888
00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.515
Why?

889
00:53:43.084 --> 00:53:45.915
Can I not ask my son-in-law's number?

890
00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:49.754
I wonder what you are going to say to him.

891
00:53:50.524 --> 00:53:51.694
What?

892
00:53:52.625 --> 00:53:55.794
I'm even doing the wedding as you wanted.

893
00:53:56.435 --> 00:53:58.834
So you can stop talking about stupid things to him.

894
00:53:59.705 --> 00:54:01.634
If you do that to him again,

895
00:54:02.265 --> 00:54:05.035
I will be really upset.

896
00:54:09.475 --> 00:54:10.544
Did you hear me?

897
00:54:11.975 --> 00:54:13.044
I wish...

898
00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:17.884
you could have a daughter like you.

899
00:54:33.404 --> 00:54:35.504
- The ceremony will start soon. - I see.

900
00:54:37.234 --> 00:54:40.745
By the way, Is that black bag Se Hee's?

901
00:54:41.205 --> 00:54:43.044
Yes, why?

902
00:54:43.444 --> 00:54:46.015
Your mom asked me about it. She wanted to give something to him.

903
00:54:46.015 --> 00:54:47.614
Did my mom say so?

904
00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:49.685
Yes, she put something in that bag.

905
00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:55.254
I knew she was going to do that.

906
00:54:56.725 --> 00:54:57.794
What is it?

907
00:55:04.294 --> 00:55:06.765
Nam Se Hee and Yoon Ji Ho's wedding ceremony...

908
00:55:06.864 --> 00:55:10.075
will start soon.

909
00:55:10.504 --> 00:55:13.845
Please be seated.

910
00:55:32.855 --> 00:55:33.964
Se Hee.

911
00:55:36.712 --> 00:55:37.841
What?

912
00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:41.864
Se Hee.

913
00:55:44.612 --> 00:55:46.041
What? Why?

914
00:55:46.143 --> 00:55:47.342
How should I know?

915
00:55:51.212 --> 00:55:52.283
Excuse me.

916
00:55:53.422 --> 00:55:54.482
Ji Ho.

917
00:56:13.373 --> 00:56:16.413
I'm Ji Ho's mom.

918
00:56:17.243 --> 00:56:20.413
I don't know how to call you yet.

919
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:22.542
We haven't met many times.

920
00:56:24.612 --> 00:56:26.882
I'm sorry for how I behaved at the first family meeting.

921
00:56:28.522 --> 00:56:31.053
She's my first daughter, you know.

922
00:56:32.022 --> 00:56:33.922
She's like my husband sometimes,

923
00:56:34.362 --> 00:56:37.692
and she's also like my friend.

924
00:56:45.433 --> 00:56:47.272
She's scared of her dad,

925
00:56:47.803 --> 00:56:49.612
and she had to give up a lot because of her younger brother.

926
00:56:52.712 --> 00:56:54.583
Because she met someone like me as her mother,

927
00:56:55.413 --> 00:56:57.783
she has gone through a lot.

928
00:57:02.583 --> 00:57:06.192
Thankfully, not like me, she's really smart.

929
00:57:06.192 --> 00:57:08.962
(Certificate of Award)

930
00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.192
I was relieved because I thought...

931
00:57:11.763 --> 00:57:13.562
she was not going to live like me.

932
00:57:25.172 --> 00:57:26.683
I guess,

933
00:57:26.913 --> 00:57:29.612
being smart is nothing...

934
00:57:31.382 --> 00:57:34.623
if you don't have a rich family these days.

935
00:57:41.263 --> 00:57:43.993
Se Hee,

936
00:57:45.062 --> 00:57:48.962
can you please do me just two favors?

937
00:57:51.803 --> 00:57:54.303
If Ji Ho says...

938
00:57:54.772 --> 00:57:56.743
she wants to write in the future,

939
00:57:57.612 --> 00:58:00.413
can you let her do that?

940
00:58:01.612 --> 00:58:04.083
I will do the house chores if that helps.

941
00:58:04.982 --> 00:58:06.183
So...

942
00:58:07.583 --> 00:58:10.692
if she ever wants to write again in the future,

943
00:58:12.053 --> 00:58:15.323
please don't let her give up on her dream.

944
00:58:17.033 --> 00:58:18.862
I don't want her to live like me.

945
00:58:19.763 --> 00:58:21.562
Please do that for her.

946
00:58:22.562 --> 00:58:23.803
And...

947
00:58:25.303 --> 00:58:26.703
it's hard for Ji Ho...

948
00:58:27.672 --> 00:58:30.743
to stop crying when she starts.

949
00:58:32.312 --> 00:58:33.583
So...

950
00:58:35.013 --> 00:58:37.312
please don't let her cry alone.

951
00:58:37.783 --> 00:58:38.982
Even though you make her cry,

952
00:58:39.882 --> 00:58:43.053
just be with her when she's crying.

953
00:58:46.152 --> 00:58:48.422
Se Hee, you have to go now. What should I do?

954
00:58:51.732 --> 00:58:52.763
You can go.

955
00:58:54.902 --> 00:58:58.132
I can take care of myself.

956
00:59:00.172 --> 00:59:01.442
Please go first.

957
00:59:03.272 --> 00:59:05.542
Se Hee, I'll be with her.

958
00:59:05.573 --> 00:59:07.783
You should go first now. They are waiting for you.

959
00:59:14.252 --> 00:59:15.323
Where's the tissue?

960
00:59:16.393 --> 00:59:17.922
What should I do with her makeup?

961
00:59:19.763 --> 00:59:22.223
Stop crying, Ji Ho.

962
00:59:50.893 --> 00:59:52.022
Is it hard to...

963
00:59:53.292 --> 00:59:54.792
stop crying?

964
01:00:03.272 --> 01:00:04.333
If that's the case,

965
01:00:05.433 --> 01:00:06.743
we should go together.

966
01:00:11.272 --> 01:00:12.942
It's okay to cry.

967
01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.042
Let's go together.

968
01:00:16.353 --> 01:00:17.683
I'll be right next to you.

969
01:00:23.823 --> 01:00:25.393
I'll be with you.

970
01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:38.002
I thought getting married was...

971
01:00:38.973 --> 01:00:40.042
going to be simple.

972
01:00:41.902 --> 01:00:43.172
This is...

973
01:00:44.212 --> 01:00:46.243
where we meet our needs.

974
01:00:47.442 --> 01:00:48.783
Maybe, it could be...

975
01:00:54.553 --> 01:00:57.353
where our hearts meet.

976
01:01:01.862 --> 01:01:03.493
Something that's not simple...

977
01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:06.632
just started.

978
01:01:27.723 --> 01:01:31.553
(Because This is My First Life)

979
01:01:32.553 --> 01:01:34.792
Are you talking about us?

980
01:01:35.823 --> 01:01:38.192
Yes, I'm talking about us.

981
01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:42.062
Goodness. We should leave right away after taking the picture, okay?

982
01:01:42.203 --> 01:01:43.203
- Hey, Shortie. - Are you talking about me?

983
01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:45.272
- You should move next to the bride. - Why would I say hi to her?

984
01:01:45.272 --> 01:01:46.502
I'm an introversive person.

985
01:01:47.373 --> 01:01:49.303
I like him saying, "us".

986
01:01:49.303 --> 01:01:50.473
Are you saying you get aroused?

987
01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.243
- "Us". - "Us".

988
01:01:52.612 --> 01:01:54.283
I really love you.

989
01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:56.982
