<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:23.813
<i>I wonder... when I started
liking this person.</i>

4
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:33.410
<i>Was it last night?</i>

5
00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.830
<i>Was it the day before yesterday?</i>

6
00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:46.013
<i>Was it... that day?</i>

7
00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:52.836
<i>If not, was it the day before?</i>

8
00:00:55.982 --> 00:00:59.541
<i>It's possible that it started
a long time ago.</i>

9
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.423
<i>I wonder when I started...
liking this person.</i>

10
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:22.708
<i>[The time it takes to love.]</i>

11
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.393
When do the shuttle buses start running?

12
00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:44.900
If we get back now,
we could sleep for a little bit.

13
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.988
- Are you tired?
- Not at all.

14
00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:52.358
Then, we should watch
the sunrise together.

15
00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:55.084
<i>Is this how it feels to hear "we?"</i>

16
00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:57.641
Let's go and watch the sunrise.

17
00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:33.391
Excuse me...

18
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.021
Did you say your name is So Ran?

19
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:43.856
Yes, good morning.

20
00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:46.283
Did you come to see the sunrise?

21
00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:50.159
I didn't, but I thought
I might as well wait to see it.

22
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.183
I'm sorry, but can you take a picture
of me when the sun rises?

23
00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.219
Yes, sure.

24
00:03:45.432 --> 00:03:48.969
- I'll take your picture with your phone.
- Thank you.

25
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.372
You just have to take it
from the waist up.

26
00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:54.315
I don't know if it'll turn out all right.

27
00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:56.773
That's okay. Just make me look pretty.

28
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.477
Don't you like it?

29
00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:17.552
It's not that.

30
00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:22.939
How can the picture look pretty
when the person isn't?

31
00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:28.384
- I'll take another one.
- That's okay.

32
00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.489
Try smiling a little more.

33
00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:35.621
A little bit more, and lower your chin.

34
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:39.836
That's too much. Yes, that's good.
And stand up straight.

35
00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:43.040
Don't stick it out, but stand like this.

36
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.977
And try leaning back, just slightly.

37
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.009
Try to look more sexy.

38
00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.232
That's not possible at my age.

39
00:04:56.114 --> 00:05:01.756
You have to take every picture
as if it's your last.

40
00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:04.097
That's the only way
to capture your true face.

41
00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:06.949
Ready?

42
00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:10.295
I'll take it now.

43
00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:13.711
Wow.

44
00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:16.105
You look pretty.

45
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:25.857
Wow.

46
00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:29.249
They turned out amazing. Didn't it
turn out great? Aren't they pretty?

47
00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.896
Yes, who is this?

48
00:05:31.896 --> 00:05:36.420
You look so pretty. I'll take a few more.

49
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.403
You don't have to.

50
00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:44.804
I'll take it now. Wow.

51
00:05:45.684 --> 00:05:48.797
Wow, you look beautiful.

52
00:06:16.057 --> 00:06:19.222
<i>Gosh, you dated for a long time.</i>

53
00:06:19.222 --> 00:06:21.595
Don't people ask you
when you're getting married?

54
00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:24.194
- They do.
- You must hate it.

55
00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:26.374
It annoys the heck out of me.

56
00:06:26.374 --> 00:06:29.912
"You'll be old when you have children.
Is it because you don't have money?"

57
00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:33.234
"How much does your boyfriend make?
How much have you saved?"

58
00:06:33.234 --> 00:06:37.018
I don't know when they started
worrying about that stuff.

59
00:06:37.018 --> 00:06:41.055
Don't believe them when they say
you have to get married eventually.

60
00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:44.441
That's how I feel at this age.
Was I born to get married?

61
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:49.756
Was I born to have children?
Just live a beautiful and cool life.

62
00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.896
I want to do that...

63
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.999
but I don't know how to live that way.

64
00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:06.011
It's your life whether
you get married or not.

65
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:09.244
But don't leave it to someone else.

66
00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:11.867
If your own body isn't yours

67
00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:15.953
there's no way someone else
can become yours forever.

68
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:53.960
<i>Act natural.
Act as naturally as possible.</i>

69
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.222
Hello! Did you come to see the sunrise?

70
00:07:58.222 --> 00:08:01.884
We... I mean, I asked
for a private sunrise tour.

71
00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:04.932
Night tours are 30 euros,
but sunrise tours are 40 euros.

72
00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:09.836
It's a bit expensive...
I forgot to pay you.

73
00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:13.614
I should have paid you
in advance, but I forgot.

74
00:08:13.614 --> 00:08:15.840
10, 20...

75
00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:17.927
30 euros.

76
00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:22.352
<i>That was good. That was very natural.</i>

77
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:26.020
Stop it. You're being awkward.

78
00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:32.129
Did you see the sunrise?
Wasn't it beautiful?

79
00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:34.607
I'll be your guide too.

80
00:08:34.607 --> 00:08:39.644
This is an arch corridor.
It's surrounded by these pillars

81
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.902
because it was designed
to block out the sunlight.

82
00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:46.041
They say the sunlight
comes through in large increments.

83
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:48.991
Just like this. Just like this.

84
00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:53.771
A lot of artists gained a lot of
inspiration from this place.

85
00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.510
<i>How could anyone be this awkward?</i>

86
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.448
Then, let's move on to the next location.

87
00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:07.399
Yes, let's go.

88
00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:14.971
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw.

89
00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:17.973
Guide Yoon had something on her back too.

90
00:09:17.973 --> 00:09:20.490
Really? I didn't see it.

91
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.521
I saw it. I'm certain.
Would you like to see?

92
00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.728
- Right? Right?
- Yeah, you're right.

93
00:09:34.728 --> 00:09:36.905
That means they were lying down together.

94
00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:39.752
- There's something between them.
- Gosh, I'm jealous.

95
00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:41.777
They're at the happiest
times of their lives.

96
00:09:41.777 --> 00:09:44.356
No one will know that
we spent the night together.

97
00:09:44.356 --> 00:09:47.901
- Right?
- Of course. I was perfect.

98
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:52.202
I said you were being awkward.
What's a sunrise tour?

99
00:09:52.202 --> 00:09:55.164
You were being even more awkward
by being their guide.

100
00:09:55.164 --> 00:09:56.765
Keep a distance.

101
00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.943
The way they're walking is awkward too.

102
00:10:00.943 --> 00:10:01.967
Should we tell them?

103
00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:05.806
- Hey, let's mind our own business.
- What if other people see?

104
00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:06.806
You think?

105
00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:11.165
They're lucky we're good at
keeping secrets. Let's go.

106
00:10:12.442 --> 00:10:14.560
Guide Yoon, you have
something on your back.

107
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.150
Mister, you have the same thing
on your back too.

108
00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:22.294
What do we do? I'm going crazy.

109
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.780
- Tell them it's a coincidence.
- Does that make sense?

110
00:10:29.982 --> 00:10:32.944
- What are you doing?
- My bad. My bad.

111
00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:34.247
Turn around.

112
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:48.012
I could die.

113
00:10:48.012 --> 00:10:50.399
It's okay. Who cares?

114
00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:52.885
We didn't do anything wrong.

115
00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:55.227
There's a rule in this industry.

116
00:10:55.227 --> 00:10:58.876
During a tour, the guide and tourists are
nothing more than a guide and tourists.

117
00:10:58.876 --> 00:11:01.883
You said you become friends
after traveling with the tourists.

118
00:11:01.883 --> 00:11:03.637
Is that what friends do?

119
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.809
I don't think we should be
seen together for the time being.

120
00:11:14.809 --> 00:11:17.694
Don't come near me
from this point forward.

121
00:11:17.694 --> 00:11:19.540
Okay, don't worry.

122
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.011
We have to be as far apart
from each other as possible, okay?

123
00:11:25.762 --> 00:11:29.349
<i>"We" is always nice to hear.</i>

124
00:11:54.663 --> 00:11:57.806
Enjoy your breakfast.
Enjoy your breakfast.

125
00:11:59.174 --> 00:12:02.092
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- Please go.

126
00:12:02.092 --> 00:12:03.329
Pardon?

127
00:12:04.431 --> 00:12:07.665
- I told you to go.
- Where?

128
00:12:12.367 --> 00:12:14.205
Enjoy your breakfast.

129
00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:15.713
Enjoy.

130
00:12:22.377 --> 00:12:26.218
- You could have eaten there.
- May I sit here?

131
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.540
- Excuse me.
- Pardon?

132
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.568
Can we switch from a double
to twin beds at the next hotel?

133
00:12:38.568 --> 00:12:39.833
What does that mean?

134
00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:42.742
I'm asking for two beds instead of one.

135
00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:47.630
- I'd like that too.
- Yes, I'll do that for you.

136
00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:51.752
- And...
- Yes?

137
00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:53.958
When are we going shopping?

138
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.250
We're planning to shop this afternoon
and tomorrow afternoon.

139
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.938
We won't be moving as a group,
so you can shop freely.

140
00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:05.924
I'll get up first so I can
get ready for departure.

141
00:13:05.924 --> 00:13:08.731
You should eat more. You ate too little.

142
00:13:08.731 --> 00:13:11.394
You should take your time and eat more.

143
00:13:11.394 --> 00:13:14.094
Yes... I'll get up first.

144
00:13:38.474 --> 00:13:40.238
<i>Where are you?</i>

145
00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:43.253
Where were you all night?
You ran away, didn't you?

146
00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:45.193
You ran away, right?

147
00:13:45.193 --> 00:13:49.486
I guess you don't think
I'll find you. But just you wait.

148
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.838
I'll take it now! One, two!

149
00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:05.666
- Let's get on the bus!
- So So, let's take one together.

150
00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:08.834
- No, that's okay.
- Let's take one together.

151
00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:11.117
- Yes, we're a team.
- I'm okay, though.

152
00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:13.785
You're stubborn, Big Sis.
Hurry over here!

153
00:14:13.785 --> 00:14:15.743
Mister, where's your selfie stick?

154
00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:19.049
Two, three!

155
00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.210
Hey!

156
00:14:38.588 --> 00:14:41.169
Hey!

157
00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:53.954
Sumimasen! You, Sumimasen son of a bitch!

158
00:14:53.954 --> 00:14:55.655
What are you doing? Let go!

159
00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:58.120
- Don't get in the way!
- Drink this first.

160
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.026
- Move!
- Soo Soo!

161
00:15:07.353 --> 00:15:09.680
<i>I played a lot of sports as a kid too.</i>

162
00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:16.733
<i>But I guess he played a lot more.</i>

163
00:15:17.872 --> 00:15:19.373
Let go of him now.

164
00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:21.798
- You two...
- Soo Soo!

165
00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:24.140
- All night long...
- Yoon Soo Soo!

166
00:15:35.694 --> 00:15:38.425
I'm sorry. Please get on the bus first.

167
00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:41.098
- Are you going to do this every time?
- Ma Ru!

168
00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:43.530
Get on the bus.

169
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.473
You get on the bus too.

170
00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:58.800
- Where are we going?
- Home.

171
00:16:13.115 --> 00:16:16.116
<i>I need to introduce an unwelcome guest.</i>

172
00:16:16.116 --> 00:16:18.155
Get up and say hello.

173
00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.617
I saw him at Montmartre.

174
00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.686
He's my little brother, Yoon Soo Soo.

175
00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:30.511
He was traveling through France,
and we ran into each other yesterday.

176
00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:33.991
But he can't make his flight, so he'll
accompany us for a little while.

177
00:16:33.991 --> 00:16:36.790
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

178
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.973
Make him sing a song.

179
00:16:37.973 --> 00:16:42.290
- He's tone-deaf.
- I'm not tone-deaf.

180
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.794
Did you have a good time
at Mont Saint-Michel?

181
00:16:46.794 --> 00:16:48.190
Yes!

182
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.538
- Did you make lots of good memories?
- Yes.

183
00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:56.546
We're on our way to Saint-Malo.

184
00:16:56.546 --> 00:17:00.478
After sightseeing, we're going to go
to our next destination in the evening.

185
00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:04.431
But, Guide Yoon,
what's that island over there?

186
00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:08.104
That's Tombelaine Island,
which I told you about yesterday.

187
00:17:08.104 --> 00:17:12.361
During the Hundred Years' War,
they killed English soldiers there.

188
00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:17.215
It's a habitat for migratory birds now,
so it's not a sightseeing destination.

189
00:17:17.215 --> 00:17:20.551
The tides go down
in the morning and evening

190
00:17:20.551 --> 00:17:24.206
but if you go at the wrong time,
you could get stuck there all night long.

191
00:17:24.206 --> 00:17:27.296
As a result, countless
romances were born there.

192
00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:30.015
It's also called "Lovers' Island."

193
00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:40.376
<i>I didn't know it was a lovers' island.</i>

194
00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.521
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:52.207 --> 00:17:56.061
I'm really sorry. This is my fault.

196
00:17:57.573 --> 00:18:01.184
The Celts lived in Saint-Malo
since the 1700s.

197
00:18:01.184 --> 00:18:03.621
They were also known as Gauls.

198
00:18:03.621 --> 00:18:06.196
They were powerful pirates.

199
00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:09.811
If Mont Saint-Michel
is like an elegant goddess

200
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:13.453
- St. Vincent...
<i>- Was her voice always this nice?</i>

201
00:18:13.453 --> 00:18:17.229
<i>If not, did it grow on me?</i>

202
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:19.279
<i>I wonder when it started.</i>

203
00:18:57.514 --> 00:19:02.661
<i>André Malraux, a culture minister
who wrote "La Condition Humaine"</i>

204
00:19:02.661 --> 00:19:06.832
<i>saw Saint-Malo and said that
if he had one week left to live</i>

205
00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:10.994
<i>he would spend that time in Saint-Malo.</i>

206
00:19:10.994 --> 00:19:12.492
<i>It's not that special</i>

207
00:19:12.492 --> 00:19:16.500
<i>but the longer you stay,
the more you don't want to leave.</i>

208
00:19:17.499 --> 00:19:21.522
But it used to be a city
of pirates. Isn't it ironic?

209
00:19:21.522 --> 00:19:25.130
Behind me is St. Vincent Cathedral.

210
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.337
After taking the shuttle
around the cathedral

211
00:19:28.337 --> 00:19:30.469
please shop and look around.

212
00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:33.529
Let's meet at the bus at 12 p.m.

213
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:35.038
- Yes.
- Yes.

214
00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:40.072
- When are we going home?
- After the tour, of course.

215
00:19:40.072 --> 00:19:42.060
Really? You're not lying, right?

216
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.714
Take a ride on the shuttle.
It's really nice here.

217
00:19:44.714 --> 00:19:47.348
- Big Sis.
- I'm the guide.

218
00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:50.559
You're trying to run away, aren't you?

219
00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:54.261
I'd abandon you,
but I wouldn't abandon the tourists.

220
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:57.254
Fine, then promise me
you won't run away.

221
00:19:57.254 --> 00:20:00.239
- I promise.
- Here.

222
00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:02.580
Gosh, you're so childish.

223
00:20:06.418 --> 00:20:08.812
- Here.
- Let's go.

224
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.536
Wow, this place is so nice.
This is totally my style.

225
00:20:28.536 --> 00:20:31.021
That looks delicious!

226
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.577
Look at that! Isn't it pretty?

227
00:20:33.577 --> 00:20:37.404
- They have shoe stores too.
- Have you been to Hwasan, Suwon?

228
00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.773
- No.
- Go there one day.

229
00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:42.123
They have the same shuttle bus.

230
00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:44.436
I see.

231
00:20:44.675 --> 00:20:48.148
By the way, about yesterday...

232
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.445
I'm really sorry.

233
00:20:52.445 --> 00:20:56.408
Don't worry.
Visit our restaurant.

234
00:20:56.408 --> 00:20:58.897
I'll give you lots of drinks.

235
00:20:58.897 --> 00:21:01.431
- Yes.
- You're all invited.

236
00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:26.815
<i>No matter how long you ride it for,
you return to the same place.</i>

237
00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:30.915
To the same time and place that
you've always wanted to go back to.

238
00:21:31.403 --> 00:21:33.050
Isn't that why you ride it?

239
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.375
I just ride it to pass the time.

240
00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:37.970
Then don't cry.

241
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.441
You can't start over if you keep crying.

242
00:22:34.889 --> 00:22:36.812
Don't they have this in Itaewon?

243
00:22:46.557 --> 00:22:48.874
Why are you back already?

244
00:22:48.874 --> 00:22:50.617
Because I missed you!

245
00:23:00.473 --> 00:23:02.434
Don't exaggerate.

246
00:23:02.434 --> 00:23:04.786
I'd like a night tour tonight.

247
00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:16.367
I'm not holding night tours tonight.

248
00:23:16.367 --> 00:23:18.387
Then go on a date with me.

249
00:23:25.434 --> 00:23:27.780
<i>I wonder when I started waiting...</i>

250
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.846
<i>to hear her voice.</i>

251
00:23:36.627 --> 00:23:37.983
I don't want to.

252
00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:03.530
Let's go on a date.

253
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.674
I'll just give you a night tour.

254
00:24:05.674 --> 00:24:08.539
- 30 euros?
- I knew it.

255
00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:14.073
I'll just give you a night tour.

256
00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:16.812
- 30 euros?
- I knew it.

257
00:24:19.714 --> 00:24:22.049
Did you sleep with him? Did you?

258
00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:25.531
- No.
- If we did, it's not your business.

259
00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:27.157
Is that why you don't want to go home?

260
00:24:27.157 --> 00:24:30.442
- It's not that...
- Shut your mouth.

261
00:24:31.417 --> 00:24:33.109
We need to talk.

262
00:24:34.735 --> 00:24:38.510
- I'll talk to you later.
- Let me explain...

263
00:24:46.741 --> 00:24:51.242
<i>Fine, I can't really defend
what happened last night.</i>

264
00:24:54.562 --> 00:24:56.014
Wait.

265
00:24:59.309 --> 00:25:02.523
Do you have... a condom?

266
00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:05.386
- Pardon?
- Do you?

267
00:25:05.386 --> 00:25:06.975
I don't.

268
00:25:06.975 --> 00:25:09.281
Why don't you carry any?

269
00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:11.272
Why would I?

270
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.196
Okay.

271
00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:19.381
- What are you looking for?
- A condom.

272
00:25:19.381 --> 00:25:21.280
Do you carry one around?

273
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.005
Isn't it a given?

274
00:25:23.005 --> 00:25:25.241
Why is it a given?

275
00:25:26.035 --> 00:25:28.403
You don't have a reason
to carry one around.

276
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.044
You never know what will happen.

277
00:25:34.044 --> 00:25:37.802
- Why do those things happen?
- It's happening right now.

278
00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:40.656
Right, I'm just saying...

279
00:25:40.656 --> 00:25:42.888
Are you calling me easy?

280
00:25:42.888 --> 00:25:45.408
- I'm not...
- Do you think

281
00:25:45.408 --> 00:25:48.448
I'm always ready to sleep with a man?

282
00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:56.115
In France, kids learn how to
use condoms in middle school.

283
00:25:56.115 --> 00:25:58.907
Thinking it's weird for
women to carry condoms

284
00:25:58.907 --> 00:26:01.590
is an old-fashioned mindset,
don't you think?

285
00:26:02.597 --> 00:26:07.686
<i>Did I adapt a way of thinking
that I hate without realizing it?</i>

286
00:26:07.686 --> 00:26:09.497
We should stop now.

287
00:26:10.993 --> 00:26:15.119
<i>I didn't know the word "we"
could feel so cold.</i>

288
00:26:16.814 --> 00:26:20.208
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

289
00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:22.291
For not carrying condoms around.

290
00:26:24.244 --> 00:26:27.336
That's okay. Have a good night.

291
00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:45.186
I'm sorry.

292
00:26:47.725 --> 00:26:51.250
I'm really sorry. That was my fault.

293
00:26:55.377 --> 00:26:58.283
I try my best not to get brainwashed

294
00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:02.038
but they always tell us men should
do this and woman should do that.

295
00:27:02.644 --> 00:27:04.483
That's the world I live in.

296
00:27:11.327 --> 00:27:12.807
It's okay.

297
00:27:12.807 --> 00:27:14.654
This isn't worth fighting about.

298
00:27:19.647 --> 00:27:22.753
But... what will we do?

299
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:27.696
It seems to be too late
to get back in the mood.

300
00:27:31.871 --> 00:27:36.523
I think... we'll have plenty of time.

301
00:27:43.455 --> 00:27:47.917
I didn't make a mistake
kissing you today.

302
00:27:48.936 --> 00:27:53.644
It's possible... that yesterday
wasn't a mistake either.

303
00:27:53.644 --> 00:27:55.318
But...

304
00:27:56.216 --> 00:28:00.638
I feel like I'll think of
anything else we do as a mistake.

305
00:28:08.877 --> 00:28:10.307
It's cold.

306
00:28:11.522 --> 00:28:12.913
Come here.

307
00:28:24.013 --> 00:28:26.256
Who's that punk?
What's your relationship?

308
00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:28.015
I told you he's a customer.

309
00:28:28.015 --> 00:28:30.898
Why would a customer jump off
a moving shuttle bus and run to you?

310
00:28:30.898 --> 00:28:32.763
Did he run off a bus?

311
00:28:32.763 --> 00:28:34.581
He was practically flying.

312
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.466
Is he hurt?

313
00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:39.128
Look at you.

314
00:28:40.146 --> 00:28:44.023
Don't develop feelings for just anyone.
He's just here for casual fun.

315
00:28:44.023 --> 00:28:46.908
- That's enough!
- Do you know what makes me mad?

316
00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:49.108
It's not that you
followed that bastard here

317
00:28:49.108 --> 00:28:50.934
or that you're not going back home

318
00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:53.722
and it's not because of that punk,
but because of me!

319
00:28:53.722 --> 00:28:57.147
Why did I join the military at that time,
and end up in jail...

320
00:28:57.968 --> 00:29:01.898
Jail? What are you talking about?

321
00:29:03.253 --> 00:29:05.073
Why did you go to jail?

322
00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:09.532
Did you get into trouble again?

323
00:29:09.532 --> 00:29:11.725
- Why aren't you talking?
- You told me not to!

324
00:29:11.725 --> 00:29:14.443
Tell me! What happened?

325
00:29:19.223 --> 00:29:21.243
I was engaged to get married.

326
00:29:22.663 --> 00:29:24.937
What's all this talk
about jail and marriage?

327
00:29:24.937 --> 00:29:28.502
I'm getting married to Doo Ri.

328
00:29:28.502 --> 00:29:31.753
- Doo Ri? Han Doo Ri?
- Yeah.

329
00:29:31.753 --> 00:29:35.253
- Really?
- Her parents were shocked too.

330
00:29:36.487 --> 00:29:39.355
- You're...
- getting married?

331
00:29:39.355 --> 00:29:41.369
- Yeah.
- Yes.

332
00:29:44.252 --> 00:29:47.516
You were attached
at the hip since high school.

333
00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:50.773
Don't commit to one woman for
so long. It'll get really boring.

334
00:29:50.773 --> 00:29:54.099
You said you two were each other's
first loves when you got married.

335
00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:56.780
- That's why I'm telling you this.
- Are you pregnant?

336
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.859
- Not yet.
- Then date someone else.

337
00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:03.985
I only had your father
as my man my entire life.

338
00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:06.168
But I feel so wronged because of it.

339
00:30:06.168 --> 00:30:08.913
You should date around
before you get married.

340
00:30:08.913 --> 00:30:12.208
- I'll be her only love anyway.
- You're a gym teacher, right?

341
00:30:12.208 --> 00:30:14.328
- Yes.
- And you're a music teacher.

342
00:30:14.328 --> 00:30:16.216
What will you do during your vacations?

343
00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:18.694
Couples shouldn't spend
so much time together.

344
00:30:18.694 --> 00:30:21.648
- Yes, I'll take that as a yes...
- You punk!

345
00:30:22.692 --> 00:30:25.867
You shouldn't call
your son-in-law a punk.

346
00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:27.580
This is why you don't have friends.

347
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.109
- Yeah, you're right.
- And, Mother...

348
00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:34.034
you shouldn't go hiking
with your former colleagues so often.

349
00:30:34.034 --> 00:30:35.965
You could end up cheating.

350
00:30:37.744 --> 00:30:41.638
That punk knows too many
of our weaknesses.

351
00:30:41.638 --> 00:30:45.243
A son-in-law should be
easier to deal with.

352
00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:47.352
<i>We booked the wedding hall</i>

353
00:30:47.352 --> 00:30:50.434
and went to a musical concert
with both of our parents.

354
00:31:02.433 --> 00:31:04.109
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

355
00:31:05.205 --> 00:31:08.090
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Where's my big sister?

356
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.467
Where did you abandon her?

357
00:31:15.859 --> 00:31:17.975
Hey! Hey!

358
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.678
I was arrested.

359
00:31:23.677 --> 00:31:26.616
- Did you reflect on your actions?
- Did you?

360
00:31:27.237 --> 00:31:30.493
I guess you think
I abandoned your sister.

361
00:31:31.129 --> 00:31:33.597
But it was just an attribute
of our relationship.

362
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:38.012
Let's say a puppy likes this basket.

363
00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:41.926
You can put the puppy
in the basket, but you can't...

364
00:31:41.926 --> 00:31:44.163
put the basket in the puppy.

365
00:31:44.163 --> 00:31:47.130
The essence of a person
in a relationship doesn't change.

366
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.225
What the heck was that punk saying?

367
00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:53.532
You don't understand me.

368
00:31:56.933 --> 00:31:58.715
I'll make it easier to understand.

369
00:31:58.715 --> 00:32:02.396
Marriage is a rice soup, whether you put
rice in the soup or the other way around.

370
00:32:02.396 --> 00:32:07.300
But the fact that one was rice
and the other was soup doesn't change.

371
00:32:08.265 --> 00:32:11.269
Geez, you rice soup son of a bitch.

372
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:14.813
Come here. Come here right now. Damn it...

373
00:32:14.813 --> 00:32:18.935
Don't you want to find
your big sister, Yoon So So?

374
00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:21.186
He told me to stay quiet.

375
00:32:21.849 --> 00:32:24.830
He told me not to spread
any rumors about him.

376
00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:29.721
Then he'd give me your address
and reach an agreement.

377
00:32:31.895 --> 00:32:34.926
I became an ex-convict
before my marriage.

378
00:32:34.926 --> 00:32:37.367
And I got fired, so I'm unemployed now.

379
00:32:37.367 --> 00:32:40.820
I'm sorry. All because of me...

380
00:32:45.273 --> 00:32:46.742
What about your marriage?

381
00:32:46.742 --> 00:32:49.533
Doo Ri's parents came
on the day of my release.

382
00:32:49.533 --> 00:32:50.946
Hey!

383
00:32:57.534 --> 00:32:59.098
Soo Soo!

384
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.926
You lost so much weight.

385
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.486
Goodness. Goodness.

386
00:33:17.486 --> 00:33:21.477
Hey, Son-in-law, it's okay.

387
00:33:21.477 --> 00:33:23.821
At least you're not a drug addict.

388
00:33:25.869 --> 00:33:27.686
It's okay. Give it to him.

389
00:33:27.686 --> 00:33:32.128
Son-in-law, I didn't have tofu,
so have some soy milk.

390
00:33:32.773 --> 00:33:36.525
They told me to bring you back
for our wedding next spring.

391
00:33:37.051 --> 00:33:39.274
Mother-in-law paid for my trip here.

392
00:33:42.763 --> 00:33:44.314
But did you know?

393
00:33:45.817 --> 00:33:48.015
No one hates you.

394
00:33:48.725 --> 00:33:50.188
Except one person.

395
00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:52.752
You.

396
00:34:00.776 --> 00:34:04.008
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E07 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

397
00:34:10.121 --> 00:34:12.328
You can't dress like that
for your wedding.

398
00:34:12.971 --> 00:34:14.313
Follow me.

399
00:34:34.902 --> 00:34:38.496
Excuse me. You think...

400
00:34:39.522 --> 00:34:44.159
This... or... this?

401
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.389
What?

402
00:34:46.683 --> 00:34:50.654
You think this or this?

403
00:34:51.259 --> 00:34:55.002
- This.
- Okay, this one.

404
00:35:08.893 --> 00:35:12.031
Let's get some coffee.
I'm craving caffeine.

405
00:35:31.779 --> 00:35:33.404
Let's make up already.

406
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:36.641
It's not something we can resolve.

407
00:35:36.641 --> 00:35:39.304
I was wrong. I won't do it again.

408
00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:40.888
You won't do what again?

409
00:35:40.888 --> 00:35:43.078
Everything you hate.

410
00:35:43.078 --> 00:35:46.415
- What do I hate?
- Well...

411
00:35:46.415 --> 00:35:50.272
talking about work, using work
as an excuse, and only working.

412
00:35:50.272 --> 00:35:52.322
- Forget it.
- And...

413
00:35:52.322 --> 00:35:54.775
Let's stop. My head hurts.

414
00:35:54.775 --> 00:35:56.949
And I won't always talk about "later."

415
00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:03.264
I won't put everything off
until later anymore.

416
00:36:06.493 --> 00:36:08.942
I'm really incapable right now

417
00:36:08.942 --> 00:36:11.241
so there's not much I can do.

418
00:36:11.241 --> 00:36:16.665
I talked like that because I felt like
I could do them in the future.

419
00:36:18.942 --> 00:36:22.384
There will be many things
we can't do in the future.

420
00:36:22.384 --> 00:36:26.813
Then you'll put those off until later.
Love should happen in the present.

421
00:36:26.813 --> 00:36:29.214
Don't call yourself incapable.

422
00:36:29.214 --> 00:36:32.427
And why did you buy so much?
You don't have money.

423
00:36:32.427 --> 00:36:35.732
These? It's not much.

424
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.991
These are the sugar cookies
you like so much.

425
00:36:40.616 --> 00:36:42.793
This is the sweater you like

426
00:36:43.264 --> 00:36:47.417
this is the scarf you like,
these are the loafers you like

427
00:36:47.417 --> 00:36:49.712
and this is me, whom you like.

428
00:36:52.413 --> 00:36:57.368
Are you out of your mind? You said work
is hard and you don't have investments.

429
00:36:57.368 --> 00:37:00.543
- Should I return them?
- Don't bother. Thanks.

430
00:37:00.543 --> 00:37:03.502
- When are you going to take this?
- Later.

431
00:37:03.502 --> 00:37:05.540
- Later when?
- I don't know.

432
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.507
It's time to go back. Let's go.

433
00:37:11.976 --> 00:37:13.692
Get up already.

434
00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:32.873
Hey, Little Brother. You look good.

435
00:37:32.873 --> 00:37:36.210
- Suits are uncomfortable.
- You'd better listen to me.

436
00:37:37.581 --> 00:37:40.493
- Which one will look better?
- Ties make me feel constricted.

437
00:37:40.493 --> 00:37:42.400
Stay still!

438
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.045
Let's go with this one.

439
00:37:45.045 --> 00:37:47.420
I hate tying up my neck.

440
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.741
Head down.

441
00:38:07.696 --> 00:38:10.527
Wow, my little brother is all grown up.

442
00:38:14.217 --> 00:38:17.491
I wanted to buy you a suit
when you graduated from college.

443
00:38:18.953 --> 00:38:22.085
I wanted to buy one for you
when you got out of the military

444
00:38:22.085 --> 00:38:25.433
and I wanted to buy one for you
for your first day of work.

445
00:38:26.092 --> 00:38:28.976
I'm late, aren't I?

446
00:38:30.897 --> 00:38:34.953
What do you think?
Isn't it perfect for your wedding?

447
00:38:41.226 --> 00:38:43.319
<i>Did she always smile so beautifully?</i>

448
00:38:43.319 --> 00:38:45.406
It suits you well.

449
00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:03.328
Goodness. Goodness.

450
00:39:04.368 --> 00:39:08.052
We spent the last two days at a castle.
Why are we at another one?

451
00:39:08.052 --> 00:39:11.866
That wasn't a castle, but a monastery.

452
00:39:11.866 --> 00:39:14.478
They're all castles to me.

453
00:39:14.478 --> 00:39:17.594
I need to speak with her boss.

454
00:39:17.594 --> 00:39:19.971
Did you call the kids?

455
00:39:19.971 --> 00:39:22.502
Why would I?
International calling is expensive.

456
00:39:22.502 --> 00:39:27.357
Gosh... I wonder if
they're eating properly.

457
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:32.112
I didn't even teach my only
daughter how to make kimchi.

458
00:39:32.112 --> 00:39:35.393
The restaurant is overflowing
with kimchi. She can eat that.

459
00:39:35.393 --> 00:39:40.058
Until when? I can't make
kimchi for her forever.

460
00:39:40.058 --> 00:39:43.250
I'm sure they'll do it themselves
when you're an old granny.

461
00:39:44.679 --> 00:39:47.846
Who says I'll live
until I'm an old granny?

462
00:39:49.134 --> 00:39:51.069
You shouldn't say that.

463
00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.469
Get up so we can get some food.

464
00:39:55.565 --> 00:39:59.708
Honey, I have a favor to ask you.

465
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:01.661
Will it cost me money?

466
00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:04.514
Can't you think about
what other people will think?

467
00:40:04.514 --> 00:40:06.641
Mind your own business

468
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:10.310
stop being so stubborn,
and try to yell a little less.

469
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.574
When did I yell?

470
00:40:12.574 --> 00:40:14.400
Fine, let's stop.

471
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.025
I mean, if they did a good job,
I'd mind my business.

472
00:40:18.025 --> 00:40:22.141
If they did a good job, I wouldn't be
so stubborn. It's all their fault!

473
00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:26.167
I got it. I was wrong to ask.

474
00:40:26.167 --> 00:40:28.386
- Let's go. Let's go.
- I'm not going.

475
00:40:28.386 --> 00:40:29.534
- Let's go.
- I'm not going.

476
00:40:29.534 --> 00:40:31.241
- Let's go.
- Let go.

477
00:40:55.197 --> 00:40:57.922
Of course, I miss you.

478
00:40:57.922 --> 00:41:00.406
It's been five days but
it feels like it's been five years.

479
00:41:00.406 --> 00:41:03.748
<i>Five years? Not 50 years?</i>

480
00:41:03.748 --> 00:41:06.737
It feels like it's been 500 years.

481
00:41:06.737 --> 00:41:08.846
I miss you so much.

482
00:41:10.455 --> 00:41:12.735
Should we video chat?

483
00:41:12.735 --> 00:41:15.583
I can't right now. I'm in a meeting.

484
00:41:15.583 --> 00:41:17.558
<i>Aren't you home yet?</i>

485
00:41:17.558 --> 00:41:22.714
I'm working late these days.
I want to go home and shower and rest.

486
00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:27.654
Okay, what should I buy you?
Tell me everything you want.

487
00:41:27.654 --> 00:41:31.761
- I'm in a meeting.
- Yeah, okay. I got it.

488
00:41:32.496 --> 00:41:35.112
I miss you. I love you.

489
00:41:35.112 --> 00:41:36.781
I love you too.

490
00:41:42.598 --> 00:41:45.009
- You haven't changed.
- Shall we begin?

491
00:41:45.009 --> 00:41:46.652
I'm ready.

492
00:41:47.161 --> 00:41:50.706
- Is it good?
- You know how it is.

493
00:41:50.706 --> 00:41:53.775
He's full of spirit.

494
00:41:53.775 --> 00:41:56.467
- Put on your sunglasses.
- Why?

495
00:41:56.467 --> 00:41:59.944
- I don't like the hearts in your eyes.
- But these hearts are for you.

496
00:41:59.944 --> 00:42:02.955
I already know talked
on the phone with that woman.

497
00:42:11.618 --> 00:42:12.781
Eat.

498
00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:20.018
But, how did you know I talked to her?

499
00:42:20.018 --> 00:42:22.270
Because you never look at me that way.

500
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.598
I told you Saint-Malo
is the city of pirates, right?

501
00:42:30.598 --> 00:42:35.514
St. Vincent Cathedral was built
as a volunteer facility in the 1200s.

502
00:42:35.514 --> 00:42:37.645
It looks like Namhansanseong Fortress.

503
00:42:37.645 --> 00:42:40.581
- That's enough.
- You never let me say anything.

504
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:42.862
You're too much, Mister.

505
00:42:42.862 --> 00:42:46.107
Namhansanseong Fortress
was our country's best fortress.

506
00:42:46.107 --> 00:42:47.654
This fortress was the same.

507
00:42:47.654 --> 00:42:50.444
During the war in the 1200s,
it blocked out the Germans' attacks

508
00:42:50.444 --> 00:42:52.804
so 70 to 80 percent of it was destroyed.

509
00:42:52.804 --> 00:42:56.165
But through restoration
efforts after the war

510
00:42:56.165 --> 00:43:00.000
they recreated the designs of the 1700s.

511
00:43:03.603 --> 00:43:05.786
Do you know "The Last Concert"?

512
00:43:06.422 --> 00:43:09.699
- Lee Sung Chul.
- Not the song, but the movie.

513
00:43:10.147 --> 00:43:12.759
You've heard of Stella, right?

514
00:43:13.212 --> 00:43:16.706
- Isn't that a car?
- It's a movie.

515
00:43:16.706 --> 00:43:21.531
In the French movie, "The Last Concert,"
Stella was the female lead.

516
00:43:21.531 --> 00:43:25.413
<i>The love of her life succeeded
as a pianist and had a concert.</i>

517
00:43:25.413 --> 00:43:27.940
<i>Stella died in the audience.</i>

518
00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.534
<i>You probably heard about it before.</i>

519
00:43:30.534 --> 00:43:35.853
The last scene of that film took place
at the Saint-Malo beach.

520
00:43:36.848 --> 00:43:40.337
Today, we have an even number.

521
00:43:40.337 --> 00:43:43.326
Please hold hands
with the person beside you.

522
00:44:06.217 --> 00:44:09.772
I always talk about
"The Last Concert" when I come here.

523
00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:13.375
"Love passionately,
to the point of fearing your parting."

524
00:44:13.375 --> 00:44:16.810
I think that's the message
Saint-Malo gives us.

525
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:20.804
Don't let go of each other's hands
until we meet at the entrance at 6 p.m.

526
00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:24.690
Today is hand-holding day.

527
00:45:41.246 --> 00:45:43.476
These are Saint-Malo postcards.

528
00:45:43.476 --> 00:45:48.569
If you write to your loved one,
we'll send it for you today.

529
00:45:48.569 --> 00:45:52.469
It'll take around three
to four weeks to get to Korea

530
00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:55.351
so you'll get it once
you've forgotten about today.

531
00:46:00.266 --> 00:46:02.246
- Should we write it now?
- Yes, go ahead.

532
00:46:02.246 --> 00:46:04.045
Who are you going to write?

533
00:46:09.831 --> 00:46:10.987
That woman.

534
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.978
<i>[Misdeed Confirmation]</i>

535
00:46:56.761 --> 00:47:00.614
You told me Ma Ru used his superior's ID

536
00:47:00.614 --> 00:47:02.906
to obtain secret information
from the company.

537
00:47:03.717 --> 00:47:05.132
Sign it.

538
00:47:06.243 --> 00:47:09.009
Ma Ru only got it
because the section chief

539
00:47:09.009 --> 00:47:11.911
asked you to do something,
which you passed on to Ma Ru.

540
00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:14.456
That part is left out.

541
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.384
Play the game properly.

542
00:47:18.976 --> 00:47:22.395
The company is going to file
a 1.4 billion won lawsuit.

543
00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.770
1.4 billion won?

544
00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:27.980
These are the additional
documents for the lawsuit.

545
00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:33.487
If we get hurt by this,
do you think you'll be okay?

546
00:47:33.487 --> 00:47:35.750
Should we join in
on the 1.4 billion won party?

547
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:39.382
- Ma Ru doesn't have 1.4 billion won.
- Do you?

548
00:47:40.982 --> 00:47:42.746
I don't either.

549
00:47:42.746 --> 00:47:47.973
People who don't have any money
need to keep quiet.

550
00:47:47.973 --> 00:47:49.616
Sign it.

551
00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:53.681
I collected them.

552
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:56.940
I want to bring you
around as my assistant.

553
00:48:57.643 --> 00:49:00.759
- Do you see that gate?
- Yeah.

554
00:49:00.759 --> 00:49:05.049
If you turn right and walk 60 meters,
there's a restaurant.

555
00:49:05.049 --> 00:49:06.915
There's a park across the street.

556
00:49:06.915 --> 00:49:09.214
There's a mailbox
on the left side at the end.

557
00:49:09.214 --> 00:49:12.500
- Put them in there.
- Me?

558
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.514
Never mind, I'll do it.
You must be tired. Get some rest.

559
00:49:15.514 --> 00:49:19.741
That's okay. I'll go. Get some rest.

560
00:49:19.741 --> 00:49:21.663
- Hurry.
- Okay.

561
00:49:21.663 --> 00:49:24.833
- It's your first right.
- I know!

562
00:49:50.444 --> 00:49:53.482
Do you have your wallets,
passports, and cell phones?

563
00:49:53.482 --> 00:49:56.567
We'll head over to Honfleur now.

564
00:49:56.567 --> 00:50:00.362
You'll have dinner and
unpack as soon as we arrive.

565
00:50:00.362 --> 00:50:03.362
We'll meet at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning.

566
00:50:03.362 --> 00:50:05.982
Didn't we forget someone?

567
00:50:09.833 --> 00:50:14.221
My brother. He's going straight
to the airport from here.

568
00:50:14.221 --> 00:50:18.143
Rest on our way there.
I'll guide you when we arrive.

569
00:50:52.502 --> 00:50:53.891
Damn it.

570
00:50:58.083 --> 00:51:00.420
<i>I left your luggage
at the information desk.</i>

571
00:51:04.967 --> 00:51:05.967
Thank you.
(In French)

572
00:51:16.547 --> 00:51:21.239
<i>Soo Soo, I'm going to Honfleur now.</i>

573
00:51:21.239 --> 00:51:23.935
<i>It's a small and beautiful port city.</i>

574
00:51:24.447 --> 00:51:29.594
<i>After a night there, I'm going to
stop in Germany and go back to France.</i>

575
00:51:30.139 --> 00:51:33.529
<i>If you want to drag me back home,
meet me there.</i>

576
00:51:33.529 --> 00:51:38.639
<i>But if you miss me, can you go
home and wait for me there?</i>

577
00:51:41.502 --> 00:51:44.246
<i>Even if no one hates me...</i>

578
00:51:44.246 --> 00:51:46.264
<i>I hate myself too much.</i>

579
00:51:47.013 --> 00:51:51.587
<i>After I become more tolerant
of myself, I'll go back myself.</i>

580
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:59.219
<i>Tell Mom, Dad, and Doo Ri
that I love them.</i>

581
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.737
<i>And don't sit anywhere in your suit.</i>

582
00:52:07.842 --> 00:52:11.735
<i>It's a long ride to the airport.
Remember to eat.</i>

583
00:52:11.735 --> 00:52:13.944
<i>You lost too much weight.</i>

584
00:52:13.944 --> 00:52:16.357
<i>I put some spending money in your bag.</i>

585
00:52:40.112 --> 00:52:43.000
You don't have any money either.

586
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:49.362
- Big Sis Guide.
- Yes?

587
00:52:49.362 --> 00:52:53.014
How long will it take
to that Honfleur place?

588
00:52:53.014 --> 00:52:55.592
It'll take between two
and a half to three hours.

589
00:52:55.592 --> 00:52:58.630
- Why does it take so long?
- Because it's far.

590
00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:00.996
Why are we going so far
and tiring ourselves out?

591
00:53:00.996 --> 00:53:03.616
Stop it already!

592
00:53:03.616 --> 00:53:07.235
You always tell me to stop it! Sleep!

593
00:53:15.206 --> 00:53:18.009
<i>That's not a smile.</i>

594
00:53:18.578 --> 00:53:23.252
<i>I can detect fake smile
after seeing a genuine one.</i>

595
00:53:24.433 --> 00:53:27.241
<i>They say real love begins</i>

596
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:30.373
<i>as soon as you find their real face.</i>

597
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:45.924
<i>[Regarding San Ma Ru's misconduct...]
[Name]</i>

598
00:53:46.991 --> 00:53:50.706
<i>Can you stay by my side until the end?</i>

599
00:53:50.706 --> 00:53:54.558
I'll always be on your side,
until the end.

600
00:54:05.246 --> 00:54:09.815
<i>[Oh Ye Bi]</i>

601
00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:32.600
<i>[If you don't want to do it, quit.]</i>

602
00:54:53.255 --> 00:54:55.868
Gosh, it's so pretty.

603
00:54:55.868 --> 00:55:00.469
Pretty things won't feed you.
Why haven't you been eating?

604
00:55:01.594 --> 00:55:04.536
- I'm fine.
- Geez, seriously.

605
00:55:04.536 --> 00:55:06.770
You need to eat well.

606
00:55:16.993 --> 00:55:19.917
Will medicine help you
if your stomach is empty?

607
00:55:19.917 --> 00:55:21.150
Wait.

608
00:55:22.473 --> 00:55:26.500
- What are you doing?
- You'll only eat if we have a stew.

609
00:55:30.873 --> 00:55:32.770
How will you make it without a pot?

610
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.431
Just wait. I'll do everything.

611
00:55:50.618 --> 00:55:53.598
This is my favorite place
in the whole world.

612
00:55:55.101 --> 00:55:59.036
Painters escaped their studios
and came out into the sunlight here.

613
00:55:59.036 --> 00:56:03.694
Monet did that, as well as
Turner, Corot, and Dufy.

614
00:56:04.708 --> 00:56:08.875
I feel like I can paint something
new whenever I come here.

615
00:56:08.875 --> 00:56:11.538
That's why this is my favorite place.

616
00:56:11.538 --> 00:56:13.636
Didn't you say Auvers-Sur-Oise
was your favorite?

617
00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:15.732
I like that place because
I can collect my thoughts.

618
00:56:15.732 --> 00:56:18.154
And I like this place
because my thoughts unfold.

619
00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:23.110
This is where impressionist painters
came from, but Monet's early paintings

620
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.746
exhibit very rugged strokes...

621
00:56:24.746 --> 00:56:27.484
Did you brother leave safely?

622
00:56:29.223 --> 00:56:32.527
Don't worry. I'm sure he did.

623
00:56:33.717 --> 00:56:35.475
I'm sure he left safely.

624
00:56:36.321 --> 00:56:37.703
Yes.

625
00:56:39.725 --> 00:56:41.663
Even though you didn't
send him off nicely.

626
00:56:47.618 --> 00:56:51.538
My brother is getting
married next spring.

627
00:56:51.538 --> 00:56:54.351
Really? You'd better go.

628
00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:58.250
People will talk about me.

629
00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:01.976
And my parents will be embarrassed
to have a daughter like me.

630
00:57:01.976 --> 00:57:06.391
Don't listen to people
who have no rights to your life.

631
00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:11.022
People who have rights to my life?

632
00:57:17.641 --> 00:57:22.560
There are no flights today. I hope
he's not harassing my boss at the office.

633
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.139
I'm sure he's not that shameless.

634
00:57:26.264 --> 00:57:28.141
I need to go home. Aren't you leaving?

635
00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:31.442
You can go first. I'll eat
and sleep here on my own.

636
00:57:31.442 --> 00:57:37.107
Hey, as a fellow Korean, how could I
go home and leave you here?

637
00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:41.692
- You're a humanitarian.
- Yeah, that's right.

638
00:57:41.692 --> 00:57:45.074
I was a humanitarian throughout
all of my school life.

639
00:57:45.074 --> 00:57:47.558
I'm the top humanitarian.

640
00:57:47.558 --> 00:57:50.130
Then should we cheers to that with soju?

641
00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:51.993
Try to cook up some
snacks to eat with it.

642
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:58.627
You're a senseless little punk,
but you're shameless too.

643
00:57:58.627 --> 00:58:00.302
You have tuna though, right?

644
00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.464
During the Hundred Years' War,
Honfleur was a combat base.

645
00:58:07.464 --> 00:58:09.748
It was a huge fortress.

646
00:58:09.748 --> 00:58:13.656
After that, it became a departure
location for explorers.

647
00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.895
- Don't be my guide.
- Pardon?

648
00:58:15.895 --> 00:58:18.900
- We're on a date.
- No, we're not.

649
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.822
This is a night tour.

650
00:58:20.822 --> 00:58:23.652
- Would you like 30 euros?
- No.

651
00:58:23.652 --> 00:58:25.581
Then it's a date, right?

652
00:58:25.581 --> 00:58:30.264
I'm doing this because you paid me
30 euros for a nonexistent sunrise tour.

653
00:58:31.755 --> 00:58:34.447
- Sit here for a second.
- Why?

654
00:58:34.447 --> 00:58:36.011
Sit down.

655
00:58:52.884 --> 00:58:54.418
It's a gift.

656
00:58:57.049 --> 00:59:00.101
- Is this...
- Try it on.

657
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:02.110
Why are you giving me shoes
all of a sudden?

658
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:04.127
Should I put them on for you?

659
00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:06.563
No, I'll put them on.

660
00:59:09.574 --> 00:59:10.768
Wait...

661
00:59:22.266 --> 00:59:23.581
Does it fit?

662
00:59:24.942 --> 00:59:27.065
How did you know my size?

663
00:59:27.065 --> 00:59:29.592
I just estimated with my eyes.

664
00:59:30.685 --> 00:59:35.344
Everyone, this is where God's
revelation and human belief...

665
00:59:35.344 --> 00:59:38.022
<i>I thought these would fit you.</i>

666
00:59:38.688 --> 00:59:42.746
They say women will run away
if you buy them shoes.

667
00:59:42.746 --> 00:59:46.235
They also say good shoes
take women to good places.

668
00:59:52.842 --> 00:59:55.413
You said today is hand-holding day.

669
01:00:03.259 --> 01:00:06.690
<i>At a time like this, I wish I were a god.</i>

670
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:13.290
<i>I want to use the most beautiful words
to ask her to spend the night together.</i>

671
01:00:14.005 --> 01:00:15.587
Sleep with me tonight.

672
01:00:17.016 --> 01:00:18.888
Don't go overboard.

673
01:00:18.888 --> 01:00:21.605
<i>I wonder what words I can use
that are more beautiful.</i>

674
01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:41.989
I can always trust my own taste.
Isn't the sweater pretty?

675
01:00:41.989 --> 01:00:43.324
Yeah.

676
01:00:43.324 --> 01:00:45.808
But don't you have the same hat at home?

677
01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:48.574
It's similar, but it's very different.

678
01:00:48.574 --> 01:00:50.846
How can things be similar
but very different?

679
01:00:50.846 --> 01:00:53.438
- It has a different vibe.
- Geez.

680
01:00:53.438 --> 01:00:56.110
You sure buy a lot of things for
someone who doesn't speak French.

681
01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.603
I told you, I can speak everyday English.

682
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.563
I was always curious about this
when I watched movies and dramas.

683
01:01:22.235 --> 01:01:23.781
About what?

684
01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:35.306
<i>You know how a couple
usually kisses during a date?</i>

685
01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:56.741
<i>And then it immediately
switches to a bed scene.</i>

686
01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:02.063
<i>What do you think happened</i>

687
01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:05.308
<i>on their way there?</i>

688
01:02:07.614 --> 01:02:09.078
I'm not sure.

689
01:02:10.002 --> 01:02:12.266
Let's go.

690
01:02:27.917 --> 01:02:31.397
<i>I wonder when this love began.</i>

691
01:02:36.835 --> 01:02:40.583
<i>I wonder how long this love
will go on for.</i>

692
01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:58.100

<i>Who's the man you came with?</i>

694
01:03:17.389 --> 01:03:19.813
<i>Someone who gives me money.</i>

695
01:03:19.813 --> 01:03:22.121
<i>This one! This one! This one!</i>

696
01:03:22.121 --> 01:03:26.554
<i>Haven't you heard that
there's no end to shopping?</i>

697
01:03:27.246 --> 01:03:31.873
<i>Don't stick with me all the time,
and stop staring at me.</i>

698
01:03:31.873 --> 01:03:37.005
<i>You're really here. Say hello.
This is my friend, Didier.</i>

699
01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:39.235
<i>Say hello. This is my friend, Allan.</i>
