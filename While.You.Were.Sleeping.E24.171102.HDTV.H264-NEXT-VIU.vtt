1
00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:06.985
Welcome.

2
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.944
(Episode 24)

3
00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:10.084
Hey, Jung Seung Won.

4
00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:13.525
Hey, Myung Dae Gu.

5
00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:14.824
Are you a part-timer here?

6
00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:17.094
- Do you live around here? - Yes.

7
00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:19.864
Please give me recycling bags in 10ml...

8
00:00:19.864 --> 00:00:22.225
and food recycling bags in 2l.

9
00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:23.534
10 pieces each.

10
00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:25.165
You're buying these for your mom?

11
00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:28.364
No, my parents passed away.

12
00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:32.104
I am the mom now because my brother is a horrible house keeper.

13
00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:33.445
Please check this out too.

14
00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:38.245
Your brother comes here often too?

15
00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.445
If a tall and normal-looking guy who acts like a child comes by,

16
00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:43.354
that'd be my brother. Be careful of him.

17
00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:46.955
Seung Won.

18
00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:48.685
Yes?

19
00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:52.465
Can you ask your brother to meet up with my dad?

20
00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:54.525
Your father?

21
00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:57.334
You should be close to him. His brother is a prosecutor.

22
00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:01.064
Who knows? His brother might get your dad out of the prison.

23
00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:04.275
Oh, that...

24
00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:08.304
My brother is going through a lot because of an important trial.

25
00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.215
I see.

26
00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:14.344
Please don't mind it then.

27
00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:16.455
I shouldn't have said anything.

28
00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:22.725
I'm home.

29
00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:24.094
You're here.

30
00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:27.094
What's with the stool?

31
00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:29.995
I don't need it anymore, so I'll put it upstairs.

32
00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:33.235
Then we won't have enough seats for tomorrow's breakfast.

33
00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:35.134
Let them have breakfast at their homes.

34
00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:38.134
- Why? - I'm tired.

35
00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:43.475
It's uncomfortable for me to see Prosecutor Jung.

36
00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:47.485
Mom!

37
00:01:56.854 --> 00:01:59.425
Mother, I peed by myself.

38
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:01.195
The pee just came out.

39
00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:02.225
Really?

40
00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:05.864
Good job!

41
00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:10.705
Good job, my little prince!

42
00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:15.144
Grandmother will be here in half an hour.

43
00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.374
- You can be alone, right? - Yes.

44
00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.044
Chan Ho.

45
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:25.685
There are so many people who we need to thank for.

46
00:02:25.884 --> 00:02:29.655
There're so many people I need to pay back for their generosity.

47
00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:32.094
Yes, go and pay them back.

48
00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:33.594
I'm fine now.

49
00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:44.534
It's me. Where are you?

50
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:47.344
Me? I'm on your way to your house to have breakfast.

51
00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:50.175
I'm sorry, but I think we should skip today's breakfast.

52
00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:53.344
- Why? - Mom is a little busy...

53
00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:54.985
because of her restaurant.

54
00:02:55.344 --> 00:02:56.384
Okay.

55
00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:59.854
- Oh, I found your power bank. - What?

56
00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:02.824
The red power bank you dropped in my car.

57
00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:06.824
Oh, that.

58
00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:08.064
I'll give it to you next time.

59
00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:10.265
Don't forget your umbrella. It's going to rain today.

60
00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:11.894
Okay.

61
00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:30.215
What are you doing here? Waiting for us?

62
00:03:30.284 --> 00:03:32.525
I want to have brunch outside.

63
00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:33.584
Let's go together.

64
00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:36.354
I'll have it at your place. I don't like brunches.

65
00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:40.594
Yes, you do. Let's just go have brunch.

66
00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:42.124
Let's go have brunch.

67
00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:43.894
What time is today's trial?

68
00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:45.765
It's at 2pm. Why? You're coming?

69
00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:48.064
Of course I have to go. Today's the final trial.

70
00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:51.435
I have to see if the slow turtle can catch the rabbits.

71
00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:53.104
Let's go.

72
00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:54.675
Did you bring your umbrella? It's going to rain later.

73
00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:55.705
Sure, I did.

74
00:03:55.874 --> 00:03:57.344
Can you let go of my neck?

75
00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:01.245
Lawyer Lee disagreed to the autopsy results?

76
00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:03.255
Yes, so I have to interrogate the doctor who conducted the autopsy.

77
00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:05.884
I have never seen anyone disagree to the autopsy results.

78
00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:08.525
He'll point out the fault for conducting the autopsy...

79
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:09.824
after the organ transplant.

80
00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:12.765
Lawyer Lee is playing it dirty.

81
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:14.724
Prosecutor Jung.

82
00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:17.965
Let's go to the trial together.

83
00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:20.305
I'll question the autopsy doctor myself.

84
00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:21.635
Why would you?

85
00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:25.305
I can't stand him playing it so dirty as a lawyer.

86
00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:27.775
Is it okay?

87
00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:30.675
I would be thankful if you could come with me.

88
00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:32.414
- Thank you, Ms. Son. - It's okay.

89
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.485
I'm more grateful towards you.

90
00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:36.814
Why?

91
00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:39.655
I'm also grateful to you these days.

92
00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:44.325
My lovely colleague.

93
00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:46.965
Look at him.

94
00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:02.175
(Autopsy results)

95
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:06.785
Witness, you wrote up the autopsy results yourself. Is that right?

96
00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:07.985
Yes.

97
00:05:07.985 --> 00:05:10.615
According to the autopsy results, what caused the death?

98
00:05:10.684 --> 00:05:13.224
The cause of death is the exterior shock on the brain of the victim...

99
00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:15.724
that led to excessive bleeding on the arachnoid membrane.

100
00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:19.294
The autopsy was conducted right after the organ transplant.

101
00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:20.994
How was that possible?

102
00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:23.564
When the victim arrived at the hospital right after the accident,

103
00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:25.834
he didn't have any other injuries except for a cerebral haemorrhage...

104
00:05:25.834 --> 00:05:27.035
and several fractures.

105
00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:30.604
When we put him through CT scan and MRI before the organ transplant,

106
00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:32.275
the other organs looked all fine.

107
00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:35.204
So we excluded organ damage as the cause of death.

108
00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:37.215
And we could conduct the autopsy right after the organ transplant.

109
00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:41.544
Is there any chance that the autopsy results might have changed...

110
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:43.414
because of the organ transplant?

111
00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:44.914
No, it can't happen.

112
00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:49.124
(Issue no.1: autopsy after the organ transplant)

113
00:05:49.124 --> 00:05:50.494
Her strategy is good.

114
00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:53.195
She wants to lead the game by asking the same questions...

115
00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:54.664
before the lawyer does.

116
00:05:56.695 --> 00:05:58.394
According to the autopsy results,

117
00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:01.434
the right thyroid cartilage was fractured.

118
00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.235
What does this mean?

119
00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:07.104
Thyroid cartilage is what covers up the vocal cords like this.

120
00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:10.044
This gets fractured when someone strangles hard.

121
00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:11.275
That's the common cause of the fracture.

122
00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:14.485
What if it got fractured because the person fell by himself?

123
00:06:14.644 --> 00:06:17.014
Like if a person gets drunk and falls down somewhere.

124
00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:19.354
The thyroid cartilage won't get fractured just by falling.

125
00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:22.525
But what if we assume that the victim's thyroid cartilage...

126
00:06:22.894 --> 00:06:25.525
got fractured from the fall, like the lawyer's argument?

127
00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:28.925
If that is the case, the fracture must have also occurred around...

128
00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:32.465
the jaw and cervical spine too.

129
00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:33.505
But that didn't happen.

130
00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:35.564
The crucial point...

131
00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:39.035
is that we found blood stains around the thyroid cartilage.

132
00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:43.115
The stains only appear when it's pressured by two hands.

133
00:06:43.814 --> 00:06:45.374
All argument points cleared.

134
00:06:45.744 --> 00:06:48.314
So to summarize, the autopsy results tell us...

135
00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:52.724
the victim passed away because someone strangled his neck.

136
00:06:52.854 --> 00:06:54.325
And he fell under the elevator door in that condition.

137
00:06:54.454 --> 00:06:56.954
This led him to die from the exterior shock and bleeding.

138
00:06:57.724 --> 00:06:58.755
Is that right?

139
00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:00.195
Yes, it's correct.

140
00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:02.365
This will be all.

141
00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:19.615
Defense Lawyer, please start the cross-examination.

142
00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:21.814
Yes, Your Honor.

143
00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:30.224
Let's see.

144
00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:33.794
When was the victim Lee Hwan diagnosed with brain death?

145
00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:37.965
It was at 8:30am, June 2, 2016.

146
00:07:38.064 --> 00:07:41.365
So when did his heart actually stop?

147
00:07:41.365 --> 00:07:45.035
It was at 5:17pm, June 2, 2016.

148
00:07:45.035 --> 00:07:46.704
The difference is around 9 hours.

149
00:07:47.305 --> 00:07:50.314
How did you decide on his time of death?

150
00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:54.885
When we were trying to transplant his organ, we just recorded that...

151
00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:57.385
as his final hour.

152
00:07:58.314 --> 00:08:02.285
So that hour must be...

153
00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:04.255
the final hour recorded on the arraignment, right?

154
00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:05.595
Yes, you're right.

155
00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:08.695
That will be all.

156
00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:15.905
What's this? He disagreed to the evidence just to ask that?

157
00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:18.905
That's what I'm saying. What is he up to?

158
00:08:31.914 --> 00:08:33.454
The victim Lee Hwan's precious life...

159
00:08:34.224 --> 00:08:37.755
was taken by a professor who he once admired.

160
00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:42.064
But from the day of the incident until today's trial,

161
00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:45.035
the accused Moon Tae Min tried to cover up his crime.

162
00:08:45.035 --> 00:08:47.834
He denied the charge and frequently changed his statements.

163
00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:50.175
He's not even regretting his crime.

164
00:08:50.934 --> 00:08:54.845
According to the Criminal Law Article 250 of section 1,

165
00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:59.014
I hereby request for a sentence of 10 years on the accused for murder.

166
00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:10.695
Next, defense lawyer. Please deliver your closing argument.

167
00:09:12.255 --> 00:09:13.965
The trial is almost over.

168
00:09:16.834 --> 00:09:18.195
A testimonial from a five-year-old.

169
00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:21.005
The autopsy after the organ transplant.

170
00:09:21.764 --> 00:09:26.505
All these do not completely prove that a murder happened.

171
00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:30.115
Watching this unstable reasoning,

172
00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:33.115
I have a question that I constantly wanted to ask.

173
00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:36.914
Can we charge the accused...

174
00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:40.385
for murder?

175
00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:46.965
Why is he saying all that nonsense so politely?

176
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:48.394
Based on the autopsy doctor's statement,

177
00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:50.564
Lee Hwan, the victim,

178
00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:55.564
died at 8:30am, June 2, 2016.

179
00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:59.204
And after 9 hours, at 5:17pm,

180
00:09:59.544 --> 00:10:03.544
his heart stopped after transferring the organs.

181
00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:06.684
As you know, brain death is not considered as actual death...

182
00:10:06.684 --> 00:10:08.744
according to the criminal law.

183
00:10:08.744 --> 00:10:12.115
The criminal law only recognizes death when the heart stops beating.

184
00:10:13.055 --> 00:10:14.655
The same applies for the organ transplant laws too.

185
00:10:16.724 --> 00:10:18.655
We refer to the family of a patient who died of brain death...

186
00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:20.025
as a "family".

187
00:10:20.465 --> 00:10:22.095
We call them a "bereaved family"...

188
00:10:22.224 --> 00:10:23.595
only after the organ transplant is complete.

189
00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:27.405
You can't...

190
00:10:28.604 --> 00:10:30.135
If the victim Lee Hwan...

191
00:10:30.474 --> 00:10:32.704
damaged his brain and died...

192
00:10:33.244 --> 00:10:36.044
only after some time passed by,

193
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.244
we can charge the accused for murder.

194
00:10:40.244 --> 00:10:42.854
But when the victim's brain died,

195
00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:45.615
his heart didn't stop beating.

196
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.055
As he was going through the transplant surgery,

197
00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:50.454
his heart stopped beating.

198
00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:54.465
No, you can't.

199
00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:59.635
The accused did not stop his heart from beating.

200
00:11:00.334 --> 00:11:01.704
We'll work on the main artery now.

201
00:11:02.874 --> 00:11:06.374
It's the doctor who stopped his heart...

202
00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.945
when he worked on the main artery.

203
00:11:10.275 --> 00:11:13.244
So the death recognized by the criminal law...

204
00:11:13.314 --> 00:11:14.345
was not caused by the accused,

205
00:11:15.644 --> 00:11:17.615
but the doctor who conducted the surgery.

206
00:11:22.494 --> 00:11:23.555
No way.

207
00:11:23.794 --> 00:11:27.695
So by the criminal law, the victim didn't die because of the accused.

208
00:11:29.264 --> 00:11:31.164
He died because of organ transplant.

209
00:11:31.595 --> 00:11:33.604
He got a devil's tongue.

210
00:11:38.434 --> 00:11:42.144
Therefore, we can't charge the accused for the victim's death.

211
00:11:42.544 --> 00:11:43.544
In addition, the accused...

212
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.215
is pleading innocence for murder.

213
00:11:52.385 --> 00:11:53.655
What's this?

214
00:11:55.184 --> 00:11:56.624
What are you talking about?

215
00:11:58.155 --> 00:12:01.465
Who killed my son?

216
00:12:02.664 --> 00:12:03.934
Sir, please calm down.

217
00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:06.934
Did the doctor kill my son?

218
00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:09.934
It wasn't that man? Let go of me!

219
00:12:10.275 --> 00:12:11.305
No, sir.

220
00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:15.914
It's all nonsense. Don't worry, sir.

221
00:12:16.175 --> 00:12:18.845
I'll take him outside. Sir, please come this way.

222
00:12:19.445 --> 00:12:20.814
Don't worry.

223
00:12:21.014 --> 00:12:24.255
The prosecutor there will prove...

224
00:12:24.255 --> 00:12:25.414
that all of this is nonsense.

225
00:12:25.414 --> 00:12:27.184
Please keep quiet.

226
00:12:27.624 --> 00:12:30.695
I must make him understand, so we can get out of here.

227
00:12:30.724 --> 00:12:32.764
Imagine how his father must be feeling.

228
00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:35.664
Why can't we charge him?

229
00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:38.894
If he didn't hit the son,

230
00:12:38.894 --> 00:12:41.305
he would be alive now.

231
00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:42.775
The doctor wouldn't have done the organ transplant too.

232
00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:44.374
Don't you all agree?

233
00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:48.244
She's right.

234
00:12:54.744 --> 00:12:56.854
Hong Joo is really brave.

235
00:12:56.854 --> 00:12:58.785
She speaks whatever she thinks is right.

236
00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:01.425
Sorry.

237
00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:05.294
Prosecutor, is there any additional statements from your end?

238
00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:07.025
Shall I go?

239
00:13:07.794 --> 00:13:08.994
No, I'll go.

240
00:13:09.635 --> 00:13:10.635
Yes, there is.

241
00:13:13.135 --> 00:13:14.135
What...

242
00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:17.405
Is the law really that unreasonable?

243
00:13:17.974 --> 00:13:21.144
Organ transplant doesn't make the accused guilty!

244
00:13:21.244 --> 00:13:22.275
No, sir.

245
00:13:22.814 --> 00:13:24.874
The law isn't that loose, sir.

246
00:13:24.974 --> 00:13:27.785
They will justify whoever did wrong.

247
00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:29.954
I shouldn't have agreed to the organ transplant.

248
00:13:31.684 --> 00:13:33.724
It's all because of me.

249
00:13:35.425 --> 00:13:39.894
Sir, this definitely is not your fault at all.

250
00:13:41.794 --> 00:13:43.235
After hearing the lawyer,

251
00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.604
the victim's father must be blaming himself for this.

252
00:13:46.965 --> 00:13:48.035
Goodness.

253
00:13:48.334 --> 00:13:50.204
Because I agreed to the organ transplant,

254
00:13:50.405 --> 00:13:52.675
now I can't punish who killed my son. This must be his thoughts.

255
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.445
I did something good, but it turned to be bad.

256
00:13:55.974 --> 00:13:57.845
"The law is defending the criminal."

257
00:13:58.715 --> 00:13:59.985
He must be thinking that.

258
00:14:04.184 --> 00:14:05.755
The laws shouldn't do that.

259
00:14:08.655 --> 00:14:10.724
Of course. That shouldn't happen.

260
00:14:10.755 --> 00:14:12.764
That can't happen.

261
00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:16.195
The victim had brain death because of the accused.

262
00:14:16.434 --> 00:14:19.135
And as the lawyer said, after the brain death,

263
00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:21.135
if days passed without going through organ transplant,

264
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.405
his heart would have stopped and he would have died.

265
00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:25.874
As all the brain death patients do.

266
00:14:26.704 --> 00:14:27.974
But just because...

267
00:14:28.345 --> 00:14:30.514
the organ transplant jumped in between his death,

268
00:14:30.874 --> 00:14:32.345
can the accused be innocent?

269
00:14:33.184 --> 00:14:34.215
It doesn't make sense.

270
00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:37.785
Your son would have died without the organ transplant...

271
00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:39.255
in a few days.

272
00:14:39.854 --> 00:14:42.655
He would have died without the organ transplanting doctor.

273
00:14:43.354 --> 00:14:47.365
But imagine if Mr. Moon did not hit your son.

274
00:14:47.564 --> 00:14:49.264
If Mr. Moon never hit the victim,

275
00:14:50.064 --> 00:14:53.135
would the victim have died?

276
00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:57.604
It's rather simple to find out who caused the death.

277
00:14:58.235 --> 00:15:01.405
You can simply try removing the causes that led to death.

278
00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:03.874
Even if we remove the doctor in the equation,

279
00:15:04.115 --> 00:15:06.084
the victim would have died anyway.

280
00:15:06.445 --> 00:15:10.314
However, the story becomes different if we remove the accused here.

281
00:15:10.715 --> 00:15:12.454
If the accused did not do what he did,

282
00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:16.954
the victim would not have died and continued to live his life.

283
00:15:19.564 --> 00:15:22.794
The organ transplant did not kill your son.

284
00:15:23.235 --> 00:15:24.664
Neither did you.

285
00:15:26.164 --> 00:15:29.235
The one that took your son's life is that guy named Moon Tae Min.

286
00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:31.434
Don't get confused.

287
00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:33.905
The law can't confuse the fact.

288
00:15:34.544 --> 00:15:38.374
The law has to clearly and fairly justify who is responsible...

289
00:15:39.014 --> 00:15:40.215
for the crime.

290
00:15:41.584 --> 00:15:44.914
Just because the time of the death applies new rules to the case,

291
00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:47.255
we can't say the accused is innocent for his crime.

292
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:48.854
Otherwise, we can say that...

293
00:15:49.794 --> 00:15:51.825
there is no justice.

294
00:15:56.834 --> 00:16:00.535
Moreover, for the victim who gave new lives to seven people...

295
00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.434
and for his family who all agreed to the organ transplant,

296
00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:07.175
we can't let this trial go in favor to the accused.

297
00:16:08.874 --> 00:16:12.215
That's because it's not justifiable.

298
00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:31.635
Please...

299
00:16:32.865 --> 00:16:34.434
let justice flow like river...

300
00:16:36.104 --> 00:16:37.175
inside this court.

301
00:16:38.505 --> 00:16:40.275
Let it happen in this trial.

302
00:16:44.644 --> 00:16:45.644
I hope that would happen.

303

Prosecutor Jung.

306
00:17:27.454 --> 00:17:30.525
Ms. Son, thank you so much for today.

307
00:17:31.724 --> 00:17:33.925
No, I should thank you.

308
00:17:35.624 --> 00:17:37.064
Thanks to you,

309
00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:41.905
I can sleep without guilt in my heart. Thank you.

310
00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:45.535
All right.

311
00:17:48.644 --> 00:17:50.014
Thank you very much.

312
00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:55.215
Oh, okay.

313
00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:56.985
I'm grateful too.

314
00:18:04.294 --> 00:18:05.294
Ms. Son.

315
00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:17.305
(We recommend you to use a single paper towel.)

316
00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:18.834
Darn it!

317
00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:21.744
Is it out of paper towel?

318
00:18:23.014 --> 00:18:24.044
Yes.

319
00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:26.244
Do you want my handkerchief?

320
00:18:27.044 --> 00:18:28.084
It's fine.

321
00:18:41.264 --> 00:18:42.564
I'm home.

322
00:18:42.735 --> 00:18:45.564
Hong Joo, I got all your blankets from your room.

323
00:18:46.805 --> 00:18:49.104
I don't think the washing machine can take all of these.

324
00:18:49.104 --> 00:18:51.374
I'll do it in the laundry room.

325
00:18:52.434 --> 00:18:53.445
Mom.

326
00:18:54.575 --> 00:18:56.445
Are we not calling them again for tomorrow's breakfast?

327
00:18:56.914 --> 00:18:57.914
No.

328
00:19:00.644 --> 00:19:04.285
Mom. I went to Jae Chan's trial today.

329
00:19:06.454 --> 00:19:10.055
When I watched the trial, I realized I was confused all along.

330
00:19:12.095 --> 00:19:13.124
Confused?

331
00:19:13.925 --> 00:19:15.525
Like you said,

332
00:19:16.294 --> 00:19:19.735
I thought Dad died because of me.

333
00:19:20.635 --> 00:19:22.635
I thought Jae Chan got shot because of me.

334
00:19:24.675 --> 00:19:26.305
This thought made me suffer.

335
00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:29.914
I realized that I was wrong after watching the trial.

336
00:19:30.474 --> 00:19:32.044
I was confused all along.

337
00:19:37.584 --> 00:19:39.925
Dad died because of the soldier who ran away.

338
00:19:40.155 --> 00:19:42.624
Jae Chan got shot because of Yoo Su Kyung's father.

339
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:47.325
All those would have happened even if I wasn't in all those scenes.

340
00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:48.865
Am I right?

341
00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:50.595
Yes.

342
00:19:52.394 --> 00:19:55.204
The others were to blame, but I didn't know that.

343
00:19:55.974 --> 00:19:57.675
I was confused for a very long time.

344
00:20:01.974 --> 00:20:05.075
So do you feel better now?

345
00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:06.544
You're not blaming yourself?

346
00:20:06.785 --> 00:20:08.244
No, I'm not.

347
00:20:16.325 --> 00:20:18.095
So much laundry to do.

348
00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:24.865
Mother.

349
00:20:26.264 --> 00:20:28.505
I mean, Ma'am. Good evening.

350
00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:30.305
Are you here for laundry?

351
00:20:30.805 --> 00:20:31.834
Yes, I am.

352
00:20:38.244 --> 00:20:40.785
I know it by nature as a mom.

353
00:20:41.584 --> 00:20:44.115
Dad's passing away, Jae Chan's accident and all that.

354
00:20:44.215 --> 00:20:46.124
You're blaming yourself, and you're suffering from it.

355
00:20:47.325 --> 00:20:50.525
You keep blaming yourself, and you're hurt inside.

356
00:20:50.794 --> 00:20:53.425
And you'll keep doing that.

357
00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:00.434
Ma'am.

358
00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:02.675
I have something to tell you.

359
00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.704
Hong Joo has nothing to do with me getting hurt.

360
00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:08.905
The guy who shot me is someone else, not her.

361
00:21:09.544 --> 00:21:10.874
Hong Joo knows it very well.

362
00:21:10.874 --> 00:21:12.275
- She won't be... - She won't be confused about it.

363
00:21:12.845 --> 00:21:14.914
And she won't blame herself.

364
00:21:15.644 --> 00:21:16.785
Yes, how did you...

365
00:21:18.285 --> 00:21:19.454
You two practiced the same lines, right?

366
00:21:19.785 --> 00:21:22.454
You heard from Hong Joo that I'll be here, and you followed me.

367
00:21:22.454 --> 00:21:25.755
No, never. It was a coincidence. I came for laundry.

368
00:21:25.755 --> 00:21:27.124
Stop that nonsense.

369
00:21:27.564 --> 00:21:30.494
You don't do any chores, but you brought your laundry here.

370
00:21:30.494 --> 00:21:35.264
It doesn't sound natural that you came down all the way here.

371
00:21:35.264 --> 00:21:37.275
I do a lot of chores, Mother. I mean, Ma'am.

372
00:21:38.805 --> 00:21:39.805
Ma'am.

373
00:21:39.805 --> 00:21:41.744
I'm sorry for confusing you,

374
00:21:42.244 --> 00:21:44.275
but you can call me Mother.

375
00:21:51.715 --> 00:21:54.184
I'm sorry for being a small person.

376
00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:57.555
I know that I shouldn't be doing this.

377
00:21:57.925 --> 00:21:59.695
But I'm quite cunning like all humans.

378
00:22:00.894 --> 00:22:04.035
I hurt someone else's child to protect my child.

379
00:22:05.494 --> 00:22:07.264
I'm sorry for behaving that way as an adult.

380
00:22:10.374 --> 00:22:11.474
I'm really sorry.

381
00:22:13.974 --> 00:22:15.345
No, it's fine.

382
00:22:15.814 --> 00:22:18.345
Then are you forgiving me?

383
00:22:19.445 --> 00:22:20.445
Yes, Mother.

384
00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:25.255
Thank you for caring and loving Hong Joo.

385
00:22:25.485 --> 00:22:27.785
No, I thank you more, Mother.

386
00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:30.695
I mean, Ma'am.

387
00:22:32.325 --> 00:22:34.465
I mean, Mother.

388
00:22:35.465 --> 00:22:36.494
Goodness.

389
00:22:51.014 --> 00:22:53.115
Oh, it's the red car.

390
00:22:54.244 --> 00:22:55.814
Whose car is this?

391
00:23:03.255 --> 00:23:04.994
- Gosh, that startled me. - Jae Chan.

392
00:23:05.865 --> 00:23:06.965
What are you doing in front of my car?

393
00:23:07.465 --> 00:23:09.264
Is this your car?

394
00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:12.664
Yes, it's my car. It's my car. It is my car.

395
00:23:13.035 --> 00:23:14.064
It's my car.

396
00:23:15.704 --> 00:23:17.834
This is my dream car. The red one.

397
00:23:17.874 --> 00:23:19.005
Tell me anytime.

398
00:23:19.244 --> 00:23:21.805
Whenever you need this, I'll let you borrow it.

399
00:23:22.044 --> 00:23:23.474
- Really? - Yes.

400
00:23:23.744 --> 00:23:25.945
- Why? - I just checked that...

401
00:23:26.144 --> 00:23:28.345
Moon Tae Min is charged.

402
00:23:29.215 --> 00:23:31.615
Guilty of murder! Seven years in prison!

403
00:23:35.454 --> 00:23:37.494
It should have been full 10 years!

404
00:23:37.494 --> 00:23:38.894
Seven years is a lot too.

405
00:23:39.965 --> 00:23:41.695
Good job.

406
00:23:43.664 --> 00:23:44.695
And thank you.

407
00:23:46.664 --> 00:23:47.965
You're saying the same thing too?

408
00:23:48.465 --> 00:23:50.204
Why is everyone thanking me?

409
00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:53.775
Is the prosecutor doing his job something to be thankful about?

410
00:23:53.775 --> 00:23:55.914
No, it's only natural.

411
00:23:56.675 --> 00:23:57.814
But I'm just grateful.

412
00:23:59.544 --> 00:24:03.314
You said I can borrow your car whenever I want, right?

413
00:24:03.314 --> 00:24:04.555
Yes, why?

414
00:24:04.584 --> 00:24:06.255
Okay then. I want it now!

415
00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:09.394
Now?

416
00:24:16.365 --> 00:24:17.365
Key, please.

417
00:24:17.894 --> 00:24:19.035
Hey.

418
00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:31.644
Can you get your day off?

419
00:24:32.945 --> 00:24:34.945
We can go see the sea for an hour if we leave now.

420
00:24:45.794 --> 00:24:48.865
Hi! I'm here.

421
00:25:03.345 --> 00:25:05.075
It's the sea!

422
00:25:22.595 --> 00:25:24.865
It really looks the same. How did you find this?

423
00:25:25.195 --> 00:25:26.604
I searched a lot.

424
00:25:27.005 --> 00:25:29.235
So? Is this the same sea you saw in your dream?

425
00:25:29.434 --> 00:25:30.474
Yes, it's the same one.

426
00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:32.104
You're lying.

427
00:25:33.805 --> 00:25:36.914
No, I'm not. It's actually prettier than the one from my dream.

428
00:25:37.414 --> 00:25:39.584
You didn't dream about it. I know you're lying.

429
00:25:42.084 --> 00:25:43.485
How did you know?

430
00:25:43.985 --> 00:25:44.985
I told you.

431
00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:47.025
I can detect every single lie.

432
00:25:47.255 --> 00:25:49.255
I could tell you were lying.

433
00:25:49.525 --> 00:25:51.595
You kept saying not to let my guard down.

434
00:25:51.755 --> 00:25:53.025
And you came to see the trial.

435
00:25:53.825 --> 00:25:55.865
Your face was so obvious that you're lying.

436
00:25:55.965 --> 00:25:57.965
Why didn't you say anything?

437
00:25:58.264 --> 00:25:59.305
And why did we come here?

438
00:25:59.465 --> 00:26:01.334
I don't know. You seemed like you wanted to see the sea.

439
00:26:02.775 --> 00:26:05.175
You wanted to see that I win in the trial and the sea as well.

440
00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:07.505
I thought you wanted to see both of them.

441
00:26:08.345 --> 00:26:09.345
I worked hard for that.

442
00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:11.715
I worked really hard.

443
00:26:12.644 --> 00:26:14.914
Thanks for trying hard.

444
00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:18.115
Don't you want to go inside?

445
00:26:18.115 --> 00:26:21.055
It's too early. I just want to see the sea.

446
00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:22.794
Okay.

447
00:26:36.405 --> 00:26:37.434
What a relief.

448
00:26:41.305 --> 00:26:43.144
It's not that cold. Come in.

449
00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:44.845
Don't you lie!

450
00:26:45.244 --> 00:26:48.144
Your lips turned purple because it's too cold.

451
00:26:48.814 --> 00:26:49.985
No, they're fine.

452
00:26:50.555 --> 00:26:52.885
This picture is worth as your profile picture.

453
00:26:53.385 --> 00:26:54.425
Really?

454
00:26:54.925 --> 00:26:56.854
Send it to me.

455
00:26:57.025 --> 00:27:00.025
Goodness. This photo is good.

456
00:27:00.294 --> 00:27:02.465
How could this be possible?

457
00:27:02.494 --> 00:27:04.535
Really? How do I look?

458
00:27:05.465 --> 00:27:07.405
Let me see.

459
00:27:07.405 --> 00:27:08.905
It's rather fake.

460
00:27:09.604 --> 00:27:11.175
Wait!

461
00:27:11.175 --> 00:27:13.575
No! Don't!

462
00:27:13.575 --> 00:27:15.974
I'll kill you if you put me in the water!

463
00:27:15.974 --> 00:27:17.075
Don't do this!

464
00:27:19.785 --> 00:27:22.814
It's a blessing to know what's going to happen.

465
00:27:23.814 --> 00:27:25.215
I thought it like that.

466
00:27:27.555 --> 00:27:31.354
But this blessing takes away the feeling of throbbing.

467
00:27:56.755 --> 00:27:58.314
It kills a will to challenge.

468
00:27:58.314 --> 00:28:01.684
(My death, a raining day)

469
00:28:01.684 --> 00:28:03.195
It puts out embers of hope.

470
00:28:03.195 --> 00:28:04.655
(SBC Blue Team uniform)

471
00:28:04.655 --> 00:28:08.195
At about 5am today, a 52-year-old man named Mr. Myung...

472
00:28:08.294 --> 00:28:12.095
tied up the underwear he was wearing and hung himself...

473
00:28:12.095 --> 00:28:13.735
while serving in Seoul Gu Min Prison.

474
00:28:15.104 --> 00:28:16.275
A future I can't change.

475
00:28:19.544 --> 00:28:20.644
A future that's been decided.

476
00:28:22.974 --> 00:28:24.175
Father...

477
00:28:24.374 --> 00:28:26.985
Last May, 2015, Mr. Myung was pointed as the culprit...

478
00:28:27.084 --> 00:28:31.584
of a serial killing using injections that caused a stir,

479
00:28:31.655 --> 00:28:33.354
and was sentenced to life.

480
00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:39.025
That's another form of despair.

481
00:28:40.025 --> 00:28:41.764
That makes me lose everything...

482
00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:44.035
by giving up and repeating every day in vain.

483
00:28:44.735 --> 00:28:47.064
Mr. Myung left a suicide note saying he feels falsely accused.

484
00:28:47.235 --> 00:28:50.775
He also wrote that he wishes the truth to be revealed.

485
00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:54.075
Lieutenant Han, are the walkie-talkies fully charged?

486
00:28:56.374 --> 00:28:57.414
These...

487
00:29:03.615 --> 00:29:04.814
When did you start charging them?

488
00:29:06.055 --> 00:29:07.055
Sorry?

489
00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:10.994
The lights are green. They're fully charged.

490
00:29:10.994 --> 00:29:12.025
I see.

491
00:29:34.144 --> 00:29:36.184
I wish I gave her some time to relax by bringing her to the sea.

492
00:29:37.155 --> 00:29:39.224
I hope this can be a shelter from those days that are in vain.

493
00:29:45.294 --> 00:29:46.294
I wish...

494
00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:48.525
she had a throbbing day today.

495
00:30:17.814 --> 00:30:19.914
