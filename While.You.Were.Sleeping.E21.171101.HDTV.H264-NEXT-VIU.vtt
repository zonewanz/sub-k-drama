00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.440
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:14.540
Yes, hello?

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.770
Is this Lawyer Lee Yu Beom?

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.779
The lawyer who got Kang Dae Hee acquitted.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.179
Yes, who is this?

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.379
Are you recording this call right now?

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.980
No, I'm not. Why do you ask?

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.220
You don't need to know.

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.419
I'd like to consult you about an urgent matter.

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.290
Then please make an appointment for tomorrow.

11
00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:34.859
It will be too late by then.

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.290
Make some time for me now.

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.999
Look, who do you think you are to...

14
00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.900
I'm writer Moon Tae Min.

15
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.010
I own four of your novels.

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.850
I would've brought them had I known I'd be seeing you today.

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.919
I'd love to get them signed by you.

18
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.159
Shall we get right to the point?

19
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.290
I'm starting to work on a new novel,

20
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.900
and I need to consult a lawyer.

21
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570
My gosh, what an honor.

22
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.430
Is the protagonist a lawyer?

23
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.469
No.

24
00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:19.269
A killer.

25
00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.139
A killer?

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.639
What does that killer do for a living?

27
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.980
He's a writer and a professor.

28
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.680
A writer who's a professor.

29
00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.820
Like you, right?

30
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.850
Why did you say that?

31
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.060
My apologies. All right.

32
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.790
Please tell me the storyline you're thinking of in detail.

33
00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.200
The story begins at the writer's book launch party.

34
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.739
("Youth, Cheering for the Spring")

35
00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.570
Gosh, thank you for coming.

36
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.910
- Yes. - This essay...

37
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.850
is about youth, which is a topic you've never written about before.

38
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.780
Did anything particular spark your interest in the topic?

39
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.880
As you know, I'm a writer, but I also teach students.

40
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.250
I couldn't stop thinking about those...

41
00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.019
who are studying under difficult circumstances.

42
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.290
That's why I decided to donate 100 percent of my book sales...

43
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.560
to scholarship funds.

44
00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.389
Yes, thank you.

45
00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.100
(The Truth about Professor Moon Tae Min)

46
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.329
It looks like one of your students has a surprise gift for you.

47
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.169
Hello, I'm standing here before all of you today...

48
00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.839
to reveal the truth about the man of the hour,

49
00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:31.940
Professor Moon Tae Min.

50
00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.220
This picture was used in the cover of our school magazine recently.

51
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.119
Professor Moon said he wants to jump with us until his knees break.

52
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.720
That afternoon,

53
00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.359
we had to help him move until our knees failed us.

54
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.299
There's more. We even had to drive his son to school and pick him up...

55
00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:55.929
and worked as parking attendants at his daughter's wedding.

56
00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:57.100
- Using the thesis as... - Are you crazy?

57
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.940
- What are you doing right now? - Come down.

58
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.299
I want to disclose all of his wrongdoings...

59
00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.810
- It's not true! - We apologize.

60
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.709
- I hurt my right arm due to him. - Stop it already!

61
00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.239
- Move. No photos, please. - Why can't we take photos?

62
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.720
I criticized his thesis quite harshly.

63
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.679
I guess he'd been holding grudges because of it.

64
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.720
Are you drunk?

65
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.459
This is unacceptable even for a drunken rampage.

66
00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.160
No, I'm completely sober now.

67
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.230
I guess you don't want to be published.

68
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.299
It looks like you want to leave this field for good.

69
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.899
That's right. I don't need to be published.

70
00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.399
All I've learned is how to polish your shoes and clean your car.

71
00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.639
What's the point of getting published?

72
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.079
I'm here as a teaching assistant, not as your slave.

73
00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.979
You little...

74
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.279
I'm recording this conversation.

75
00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.909
Go ahead and treat me the way you always do.

76
00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.250
You rat.

77
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.019
How dare you!

78
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.420
Die, you punk!

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.070
What's this sound?

80
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.899
So out of anger, he strangled his teaching assistant,

81
00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:09.039
who ended up falling through the elevator shaft due to the rebound.

82
00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.039
Were there any witnesses?

83
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.579
I'm not sure.

84
00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.349
He doesn't think that anyone witnessed it,

85
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.519
but there's one thing that bothers him.

86
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.260
He found a kid's hat on the floor,

87
00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.589
but he's not sure whether it was already there,

88
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.930
or if someone dropped it when the incident took place.

89
00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.029
What happened to the teaching assistant?

90
00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:39.570
He got his head hurt, so he's fallen into a coma.

91
00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.779
He's in the ICU, and all he can do is breathe.

92
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.979
We can't really say that he's alive.

93
00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.579
Are you saying he's brain-dead?

94
00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.389
Let's get the terminology straight first.

95
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.120
The protagonist of this story...

96
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.190
is not a killer.

97
00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.829
The Criminal Code doesn't classify those who are brain-dead as dead.

98
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.329
Only cases of cardiac death are considered deaths.

99
00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:06.560
Is that right?

100
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.099
It can be considered personal injury caused by negligence,

101
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.529
but even that's not really appropriate.

102
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.940
He could be deemed not guilty.

103
00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.610
- Not guilty? - That's right.

104
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.649
If the protagonist and his lawyer come up with a good plan together,

105
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.279
he may be deemed not guilty.

106
00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.680
You think so? That's great.

107
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.849
It looks like I came to the right person.

108
00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.190
Bring me some coffee.

109
00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.519
Is it because I feel relaxed now? I'm suddenly craving caffeine.

110
00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.829
All of my staff have left for the day. We can go somewhere for coffee.

111
00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:45.399
We need to awaken our brains in order to craft a plan.

112
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.010
It looks like you need to improve your firm's customer service.

113
00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:53.409
Goodness, how can I provide better customer service than this?

114
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.950
What? What did you just say?

115
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.019
Let's be honest. You abused your power and killed that poor student.

116
00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:01.589
Now, you're asking me to get you acquitted.

117
00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:03.820
Know your place because you're a criminal now.

118
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.060
How dare you expect me to bring you coffee?

119
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.289
Hey, Lawyer Lee.

120
00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.459
Your life is in my hands now.

121
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.829
In other words, I have more power than you.

122
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.260
Get your attitude straight.

123
00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.529
If I talk to you nicely, you should do the same.

124
00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.870
Don't forget that you're a criminal and behave yourself!

125
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.240
Repeat after me.

126
00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.339
"Please help me, Lawyer Lee."

127
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.519
Please help me, Lawyer Lee.

128
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.389
Good. That was good.

129
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.029
Now, I feel motivated to work on the plan with you,

130
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.229
Mr. Moon.

131
00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:54.209
I think that writer, Moon Tae Min, is a very scary person.

132
00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.940
One of his teaching assistants caused a scene at his book launch,

133
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.339
saying that he wants to disclose all of his bad deeds,

134
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.209
but I could tell exactly what has been going on.

135
00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:04.450
He has probably been abusing his power like crazy...

136
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.579
over his teaching assistants, using their grades as an excuse.

137
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:10.760
Gosh, I was a fan of his. I'm so disappointed.

138
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.519
All right, good. You interviewed his teaching assistant, right?

139
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.860
I was going to, but there was an accident.

140
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.130
What kind of accident?

141
00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:19.630
I heard that he got drunk and fell through an elevator shaft.

142
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.769
He's in a coma now.

143
00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:22.870
Of course it involves alcohol. Goodness.

144
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.469
Hey, newbie. Come here.

145
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.099
Everyone must be quite hungry. Go to the convenience store...

146
00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:29.240
and pick up snacks that you like.

147
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.880
I want a fish cake bar.

148
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.079
I'm telling you. This hierarchical culture needs to be uprooted.

149
00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:39.050
Being older doesn't give you all the power in the world.

150
00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:41.719
How can you treat your co-worker like your servant?

151
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.360
You're talking to me, right?

152
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.089
No, I was talking about Mr. Moon.

153
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.930
Why, Du Hyun? Did it sound like I was talking about you?

154
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.329
Do you feel guilty?

155
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:52.500
No. Why would I...

156
00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:55.500
Why are you holding my credit card?

157
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.670
Let's continue along with the meeting. Yes, thanks.

158
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.270
(Seogu University Hospital)

159
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.140
Are you ready to check out?

160
00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:08.780
Yes, I'm almost ready to leave.

161
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520
You guys came together.

162
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.160
You got the ring, right?

163
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.790
Yes.

164
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.499
Oh, we ran into each other in front of the hospital.

165
00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:31.239
What? Have you decided to talk casually to each other?

166
00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:32.499
Yes, it sort of happened.

167
00:08:32.499 --> 00:08:34.140
Does that mean we can talk like that too?

168
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.369
No, we can't.

169
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.270
What is that based on?

170
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.379
You two talk like friends, and so do you guys.

171
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.709
But the two of you can't?

172
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.520
Gosh, cut it out. You brought my work ID card, right?

173
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.680
Of course. Here you go.

174
00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:49.050
(Jung Jae Chan, Supreme Prosecutors' Office)

175
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.320
You see this, right? I am a prosecutor.

176
00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:54.489
Yes, you are indeed.

177
00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:57.660
What? That's it? You don't have anything else to say to me?

178
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.430
"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I apologize for doubting you."

179
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.800
Shouldn't you say something like that?

180
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.940
Why are you being like this? Don't be so childish.

181
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.570
Yes, please stop. You're starting to embarrass me.

182
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.180
I'm sorry for doubting you.

183
00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:16.780
But since you're a prosecutor, you shouldn't get the provisions...

184
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.650
in the Criminal Code mixed up...

185
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.249
or pester people to believe that you're a prosecutor...

186
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.749
when you don't even have any ID on you.

187
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.259
Pester... Hey, how dare you!

188
00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:27.359
- You little... - Gosh, just let him go.

189
00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.530
Everything he said is right.

190
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.560
Oh, that's right. He reminds me of you.

191
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.700
From how rude he is to the way he looks, he's just like you as a kid.

192
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.200
Stop spewing nonsense!

193
00:09:36.229 --> 00:09:37.869
My gosh. Hey, kid!

194
00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:44.839
Hey, kid.

195
00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:47.109
Doctor, we need help here. A kid just fainted. Doctor!

196
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.050
(Intensive Care Unit)

197
00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:52.379
What happened to him?

198
00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:53.619
Is he okay?

199
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.719
Yes. He's getting emergency dialysis now, so he'll be okay.

200
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.060
Dialysis?

201
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.190
Yes, he's suffering from chronic renal failure.

202
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.030
He's been receiving dialysis for five years.

203
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.499
I think he has a lot of toxins built up inside. He's quite swollen too.

204
00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:07.599
For five years? He's so young though.

205
00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:10.270
We're running out of veins to puncture.

206
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.599
A transplant is the only way to cure him,

207
00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:14.570
but we can't find any donor. It's very frustrating.

208
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.410
I shouldn't have let him drink.

209
00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:22.879
I'm really sorry.

210
00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:25.550
He never caused any trouble when he got drunk in the past.

211
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.119
I had no idea that he'd get himself into an accident like this.

212
00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:29.890
Gosh, please don't apologize.

213
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.119
You took time out of your busy schedule to come here.

214
00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:34.190
I really appreciate it.

215
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.690
Please don't say that. Of course I should visit him.

216
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.160
He's my favorite student.

217
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.530
Thank you.

218
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.540
Oh, Doctor. Hwan's surgery went well, right?

219
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.070
His brain was already severely damaged when he got here.

220
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.940
He couldn't even breathe on his own.

221
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.609
You should mentally prepare yourself for the worst-case scenario.

222
00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.109
Gosh.

223
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.520
My gosh, Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee.

224
00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:17.599
Chan Ho.

225
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.599
Mommy is here.

226
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.040
Chan Ho.

227
00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:24.339
Chan Ho...

228
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.320
(Episode 21: To Die or to be Bad)

229
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.129
(Episode 21: To Die or to be Bad)

230
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.570
Thanks for the ride.

231
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.099
Where will you stay while you recover? Will you just stay home?

232
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.040
Or will you stay at Hong Joo's place like I did?

233
00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:56.709
He should stay home, of course.

234
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.979
Why inconvenience other people when he has a home?

235
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.479
And you are fully recovered.

236
00:12:00.609 --> 00:12:02.349
You're feeling great, right?

237
00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:04.550
No, I'm not feeling great.

238
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.950
I'm not fully recovered yet. It still hurts here.

239
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.489
Then you should stay at my place for a few days like Woo Tak did.

240
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.420
I'll look after...

241
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.629
Gosh, no. That'd be too shameless.

242
00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.089
Woo Tak deserved to be looked after you,

243
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.999
- but Jae Chan doesn't. - Why not?

244
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.829
Did you get injured while trying to rescue Hong Joo like Woo Tak did?

245
00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:23.900
Well, no. But I was...

246
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.869
Do you live alone like Woo Tak does?

247
00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:27.940
No, I live with you. But I'm...

248
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.609
You're not that useful.

249
00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:31.780
- That's why... - I'll try to be useful.

250
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.910
Let me look after you, okay?

251
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.150
Thanks for everything today, guys.

252
00:12:36.249 --> 00:12:38.219
Let's go, Jae Chan. Don't inconvenience them anymore.

253
00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:39.780
Hey, Seung Won.

254
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.060
Let's go to my place.

255
00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:46.859
I've experienced this, so I'm sure I'll be better than you.

256
00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:49.930
You're okay with staying at my place, right?

257
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.359
Well, shall I?

258
00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:02.070
- Jae Chan, Jae Chan. - Bye.

259
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.170
Jae Chan, wait. Jae Chan.

260
00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:07.079
Why can't he take a hint?

261
00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:10.310
Don't you think you're the one who can't take a hint?

262
00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:11.379
What did I do?

263
00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:13.619
They found out that they had actually met 13 years ago.

264
00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:16.050
Just leave them alone so that they can catch up.

265
00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:27.329
Thank you.

266
00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:28.869
I'm sorry you went through that.

267
00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:32.200
I'll look after Prosecutor Jung.

268
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.670
You should go tidy up your room.

269
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.940
He needs to take his medication and...

270
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.640
I'll make sure he takes his medication. Go tidy up your room.

271
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.849
If he sees your room, he'll get disgusted and faint.

272
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.119
It's not even messy.

273
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.450
This abalone porridge is really good.

274
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.390
How long are you planning on staying here?

275
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.290
Two days will be enough, right?

276
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.859
Oh, yes. That's definitely enough.

277
00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:12.509
Where did it go?

278
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.979
I know that I put it somewhere here.

279
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.749
He'll be so disappointed if he finds out that I lost it.

280
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.619
Can I come in?

281
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.160
Yes, come in.

282
00:14:27.859 --> 00:14:31.660
Gosh, it's a lot messier than I imagined it to be.

283
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.170
No, no. It's usually not this messy.

284
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.800
I was just looking for something.

285
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.099
What?

286
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.200
You don't need to know.

287
00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:41.040
Sit here. Let me take your temperature.

288
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.709
Okay.

289
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.709
Well...

290
00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:53.119
Hong Joo, do you not like the ring I gave you?

291
00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:56.290
I do. I really like it.

292
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.859
Then why don't you wear it?

293
00:14:59.859 --> 00:15:01.589
I'm worried about what my co-workers might think,

294
00:15:02.129 --> 00:15:04.160
and my mom might also get the wrong idea if she sees it.

295
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.660
I'll wear it when I'm just with you.

296
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.729
Promise me.

297
00:15:08.229 --> 00:15:09.300
Okay.

298
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.770
The fever is almost gone.

299
00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:16.709
I'll dress your wound for you tomorrow morning.

300
00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:19.839
You sound like a doctor now.

301
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.979
I got some practice with Woo Tak, you know.

302
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:31.859
Did you take his temperature and dress his wound too?

303
00:15:31.859 --> 00:15:32.859
Yes.

304
00:15:34.089 --> 00:15:35.959
Why do you ask? Does it bother you?

305
00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:37.190
Are you jealous? Is that it?

306
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.959
No, not at all. Not even one bit.

307
00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:41.670
You didn't have to deny it so strongly.

308
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.270
Hong Joo, what are you doing?

309
00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:44.770
You're keeping him up. Come out already.

310
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.040
All right.

311
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.810
Good night. Tell me if you need anything.

312
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.140
Okay, thanks.

313
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.249
Why isn't your fever going down?

314
00:15:59.979 --> 00:16:01.550
It must be because you make my heart flutter.

315
00:16:15.369 --> 00:16:17.440
Your abs are rock-hard. How did the knife even penetrate them?

316
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.839
Stop it. You're tickling me.

317
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:22.509
I'll teach you a lesson.

318
00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:29.680
- Don't do that. - You guys are being ridiculous.

319
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.420
Gosh, seriously. I shouldn't have come here.

320
00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:38.590
Goodness, I should've just stayed home.

321
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.029
Mom, have you seen my ring by any chance?

322
00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:45.360
The one Jae Chan gave me as a gift.

323
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.069
No, I haven't. Did you lose it?

324
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:50.870
I know I put it on my dressing table, but I can't find it.

325
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:54.769
Why are you applying it so carefully? You're just going to bed.

326
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:56.069
Just slap it on and go to sleep.

327
00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.039
No, my skin is overly sensitive these days. What if I break out?

328
00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.350
Jae Chan is staying with us too.

329
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.450
I heard that you and Prosecutor Jung had actually met 13 years ago.

330
00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:10.759
Do you feel more attached to him now that you know about it?

331
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.920
Why? Do you want me to feel more attached to him?

332
00:17:13.719 --> 00:17:15.559
No, I don't want that to happen.

333
00:17:16.289 --> 00:17:19.130
Well, we might get closer. You never know.

334
00:17:19.259 --> 00:17:20.529
And with time, we might...

335
00:17:20.529 --> 00:17:21.969
No, I don't want that.

336
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.670
I don't want you guys to get closer even later on.

337
00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:46.759
Hello.

338
00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:48.830
We checked what you asked us to look into.

339
00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:52.559
Your son did register his consent to be an organ donor.

340
00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.700
See? I knew it.

341
00:17:55.999 --> 00:17:58.499
You should be proud of your son.

342
00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:04.840
Hwan, did you hear that?

343
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.650
Your doctor complimented you.

344
00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:11.920
Please let us know when you decide on the date.

345
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.660
The day after tomorrow.

346
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.729
It's...

347
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.430
his...

348
00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:30.999
birthday.

349
00:18:33.499 --> 00:18:34.539
Okay.

350
00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:40.650
Kidney donation?

351
00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:42.479
It hasn't been confirmed yet,

352
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.479
but there's a brain-dead patient who can be a donor.

353
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.580
We'll have to do the antibody test first. If the types match,

354
00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:49.190
Chan Ho will be able to get a kidney transplant.

355
00:18:51.819 --> 00:18:53.019
Thank you.

356
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:56.190
Thank you so much.

357
00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:02.830
What are you talking about?

358
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.610
Gosh... Who killed my son?

359
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.539
You said that scumbag killed my son.

360
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.479
We can't get him because no autopsy was done?

361
00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:15.950
How can the law be so unfair?

362
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.860
What should we do, Robin?

363
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.870
Gosh, how should I bring it up to him?

364
00:19:43.709 --> 00:19:46.709
Just to catch that one man, you killed...

365
00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:48.279
You killed seven people.

366
00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:51.519
Tell me. Is this the kind of justice you believe in?

367
00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:53.850
Do you think this is just?

368
00:20:10.874 --> 00:20:14.106
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E21 While You Were Sleeping "To Die or to be Bad"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

369
00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:30.690
What should I tell him?

370
00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:02.519
Stop sighing. Do you hate recycling that much or what?

371
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:04.390
Did something happen?

372
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.459
I had a bad dream.

373
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.559
I was thinking about how I should bring it up.

374
00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.600
What? Me too.

375
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.440
Was it about Jae Chan by any chance?

376
00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:19.499
Yes. You too?

377
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.709
Yes. Did you also see him quitting his job?

378
00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:25.110
You saw that too?

379
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.880
Yes.

380
00:21:29.479 --> 00:21:30.880
It's cold.

381
00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:38.190
What are they doing there? Why aren't they coming in?

382
00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:46.200
We should tell Jae Chan. It'll happen to him.

383
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:50.400
What will change if we tell him?

384
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.469
There's nothing he can change even if he knows about it in advance.

385
00:21:52.569 --> 00:21:54.110
He'll at least be able to run away from it.

386
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.170
Then what? Someone else will have to deal with it if he runs away.

387
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.340
Will you run away knowing that? Do you think you can do it?

388
00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:01.249
- No. - Jae Chan is like you.

389
00:22:01.479 --> 00:22:03.180
He won't run away if he knows about it.

390
00:22:03.509 --> 00:22:05.049
So, you better not tell him.

391
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.080
I'll make him run away.

392
00:22:08.219 --> 00:22:09.249
How?

393
00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:26.069
The bus is here.

394
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.410
Aren't we getting on?

395
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.340
No, I'm not going to work.

396
00:22:32.739 --> 00:22:34.150
I'll skip work today.

397
00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:37.049
Why?

398
00:22:38.979 --> 00:22:41.890
Because it's an unbelievably gorgeous day.

399
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.219
There's no fine dust. And you're off too.

400
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.090
I don't want to work on a day like this.

401
00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:54.029
So? Where do you want to go?

402
00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:01.670
Du Hyun, I'm sorry.

403
00:23:01.809 --> 00:23:04.380
I'm using my vacation day today because the weather is so nice.

404
00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:06.709
The nice weather must've made her lose her mind.

405
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.650
What is wrong with Hong Joo?

406
00:23:13.249 --> 00:23:14.950
Darn it.

407
00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:18.319
Did you pull another all-nighter?

408
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.660
Yes.

409
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.999
Hasn't everyone in our department been pulling all-nighters?

410
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.700
To cover for someone.

411
00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:29.969
Hey, it's not like Mr. Jung wants to take a hiatus.

412
00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:33.140
I'm sure he knows how much work we have to do to cover for him.

413
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.610
Then he should come back soon.

414
00:23:35.809 --> 00:23:38.140
I'm sure he's uncomfortable about taking time off too.

415
00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:40.850
That poor guy.

416
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.719
Hey.

417
00:23:55.989 --> 00:23:57.729
Come here. Let's take a selfie together.

418
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.559
Gosh, amazing. That's such a great photo.

419
00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:03.430
My gosh! We look so cute in it.

420
00:24:04.469 --> 00:24:06.140
My goodness, you're too cute.

421
00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.069
My cutie-pie, you're so adorable.

422
00:24:09.069 --> 00:24:11.880
- You're just too cute, my puppy. - I know, right?

423
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.080
- My gosh, that's so cute! - Does it look good?

424
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.479
Yes, it's really cute. Oh, my.

425
00:24:16.509 --> 00:24:17.950
What an eyesore, don't you think?

426
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.350
- Let's take another one. - Actually, I brought you flowers.

427
00:24:21.219 --> 00:24:24.090
Seriously? I'm so touched. My gosh.

428
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.190
- Thank you. - How beautiful.

429
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.090
Where did you go? Get back in the frame.

430
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.160
Come closer.

431
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:33.059
This is for you.

432
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.930
I can't even tell you apart from the flowers.

433
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.200
You like beer. It's made from this.

434
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.370
Right, thanks.

435
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.739
Hey, where are you going?

436
00:25:04.999 --> 00:25:06.499
Shall we go to the beach tomorrow?

437
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.130
It's been at least five years since I last saw the ocean.

438
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:11.999
I'll be going back to work tomorrow though.

439
00:25:12.999 --> 00:25:15.610
Just skip it, like I did today.

440
00:25:19.479 --> 00:25:21.080
Will something happen to me tomorrow?

441
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.350
What?

442
00:25:23.209 --> 00:25:25.120
What are you talking about?

443
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.350
I overheard your conversation with Woo Tak this morning.

444
00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:29.090
You said you saw something in your dream.

445
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.130
Just tell me. Why do you want me to run away?

446
00:25:40.729 --> 00:25:42.130
You must make a choice,

447
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.799
a very difficult one.

448
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.309
If what I saw in my dream actually happens,

449
00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:50.640
you'll do an inspection as soon as you return to work tomorrow.

450
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.509
A brain-dead patient who supposedly got a head injury in an accident.

451
00:25:55.509 --> 00:25:57.420
But during your inspection,

452
00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.580
you find out that his injury was not caused by an accident.

453
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:01.289
It wasn't an accident?

454
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.090
Does that mean somebody hurt him intentionally?

455
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:06.660
Yes. So, you decide to do an autopsy...

456
00:26:06.959 --> 00:26:08.390
and end up catching the culprit.

457
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.529
Then what's the problem?

458
00:26:10.529 --> 00:26:11.660
That brain-dead victim...

459
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.299
pledged to be an organ donor.

460
00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.799
Because you decide to do an autopsy,

461
00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.340
he can no longer donate his organs.

462
00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:23.410
So, seven patients who have been waiting on transplants...

463
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.509
Do they die?

464
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:26.979
Yes.

465
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.709
The shock from that makes you...

466
00:26:31.019 --> 00:26:32.380
quit your job as a prosecutor.

467
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:36.819
What if I don't do the autopsy?

468
00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:38.819
Wouldn't I be able to catch the culprit without it?

469
00:26:39.219 --> 00:26:40.930
Woo Tak had a dream too,

470
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.489
and that's what you did in his dream.

471
00:26:43.729 --> 00:26:44.930
You chose to give up the autopsy...

472
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:48.229
so that you can save the seven people's lives, but...

473
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.910
(Hakdong Kindergarten)

474
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.979
The culprit gets acquitted with an innocent verdict...

475
00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:02.580
as the cause of death...

476
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.249
can't be conclusively determined without an autopsy.

477
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.019
The victim's father resents you a lot for everything,

478
00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:09.749
so after beating yourself up...

479
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.319
I quit my job as a prosecutor.

480
00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:13.519
Yes.

481
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.600
Any information on the victim? You don't know who he is?

482
00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:20.430
I didn't see him in my dream.

483
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.499
If I do the autopsy, seven people will die.

484
00:27:26.539 --> 00:27:29.039
If I forgo it, I'll save seven people's lives,

485
00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:30.309
but the culprit gets off scot-free.

486
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.779
Hence, whether I do the autopsy or not,

487
00:27:33.209 --> 00:27:34.850
I'll end up leaving the prosecution.

488
00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:41.420
I guess you wanted me to run away...

489
00:27:41.749 --> 00:27:43.450
because I'll regret either way.

490
00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:47.660
Gosh, that's really awful.

491
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:54.299
Indeed. It is really awful.

492
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.749
Let's go to the beach tomorrow.

493
00:28:10.479 --> 00:28:12.049
- Seriously? - Yes.

494
00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:13.350
I want to run away.

495
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.590
Okay, we'll go.

496
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.219
I know that I'm being a coward, but I still want to run away.

497
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.459
I don't want to leave the prosecution for the life of me.

498
00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:25.900
Right, I'm sure you don't want to quit.

499
00:28:27.499 --> 00:28:29.600
Then what? Someone else will have to deal with it if he runs away.

500
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.069
Will you run away knowing that? Do you think you can do it?

501
00:28:32.069 --> 00:28:34.039
Of course. I can totally do that.

502
00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:36.870
Jae Chan is like you. He won't run away if he knows about it.

503
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.840
Wrong. I will run away.

504
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.809
Whether it gets dumped on someone or not, I don't care.

505
00:28:40.809 --> 00:28:42.380
Woo Tak and I are essentially different.

506
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.080
My conscience has such low standards.

507
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.219
That's good.

508
00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:48.249
We must know our places.

509
00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:52.219
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind taking a picture of us?

510
00:28:52.219 --> 00:28:55.160
Yes, I do mind! Why should I take a picture for complete strangers?

511
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.430
You saw that, right? I'll do and say whatever I want from now on.

512
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.630
How obnoxious. That little...

513
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.239
Let's go, baby. I'll treat you to barbecue. Don't let it get to you!

514
00:29:07.239 --> 00:29:08.309
Okay, I won't.

515
00:29:08.709 --> 00:29:11.209
I think your brother is a good prosecutor.

516
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.340
What are you talking about? That's so random.

517
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.680
He proved Do Hak Young's innocence and got him acquitted.

518
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.920
Hey, he just did what he had to do.

519
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.090
Teachers teach students,

520
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.019
the President protects the people,

521
00:29:24.489 --> 00:29:28.130
and prosecutors only prosecute those who committed crimes.

522
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.259
Just doing his duty doesn't make him a good prosecutor.

523
00:29:30.959 --> 00:29:32.529
It's not always easy to do that though.

524
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:35.529
I learned that from my dad.

525
00:29:37.229 --> 00:29:39.469
My dad was a doctor,

526
00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:41.709
but meeting an ill-intentioned prosecutor...

527
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.809
turned him into a serial killer.

528
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.650
Who's that prosecutor?

529
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.080
You wouldn't know him.

530
00:29:52.049 --> 00:29:54.890
He alters witness statements and fabricates evidence.

531
00:29:55.989 --> 00:29:57.819
That's how he turns innocent people into criminals.

532
00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.830
My gosh. You're a lucky man, Mr. Moon.

533
00:30:05.729 --> 00:30:07.930
The hospital staff told me that Lee Hwan...

534
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.370
will donate his organs soon.

535
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.200
That means there will be no autopsy, right?

536
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.769
It'll be game over if they can't do an autopsy.

537
00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.410
It'll be concluded as an accidental death.

538
00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:19.009
Don't worry too much even if the case goes to trial.

539
00:30:19.239 --> 00:30:21.950
It'll be easy to get you acquitted as there are many gray areas.

540
00:30:22.009 --> 00:30:24.779
I totally trust you.

541
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.590
Mr. Moon, you should try to find the owner of that hat.

542
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.890
That worries me the most.

543
00:30:31.019 --> 00:30:32.120
Okay, I will.

544
00:30:39.294 --> 00:30:43.494
(Episode 22 will air shortly.)
