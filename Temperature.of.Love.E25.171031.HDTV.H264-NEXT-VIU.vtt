1
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.310
When you two first met in front of Good Soup,

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.180
do you know why I wasn't threatened by you?

3
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.090
How can it be you?

4
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.459
You're still lost.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.119
You're young too.

6
00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:24.860
What can you do for Hyun Soo?

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929
I can give her everything she wants.

8
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.069
You only care about your feelings,

9
00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.470
so you don't care about her future.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.310
You should get mad when you're mad.

11
00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.740
I'm telling you I'll steal your woman.

12
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:41.709
If you have your hand in a fist, you should hit me. What's wrong?

13
00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.050
You finally seem human.

14
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990
You've been acting too noble until now.

15
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.350
(Temperature of Love)

16
00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.190
Hyun Soo, you go ahead first.

17
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.660
I have to talk to Jung Woo.

18
00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:00.789
(On Jung Sun)

19
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.539
You finally seem human.

20
00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.190
(Lee Hyun Soo)

21
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.030
The person you have called can't come to the phone...

22
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.370
Why isn't he picking up?

23
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.870
(Lee Hyun Soo)

24
00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.840
Hello? Where are you?

25
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.680
Are you still outside?

26
00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:53.509
I'm at home.

27
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.710
That's a relief.

28
00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.620
I want to talk to you face-to-face. Can I do that?

29
00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.019
Sure.

30
00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.519
Okay, I'll be right there.

31
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.940
I didn't know you'd be waiting outside.

32
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.410
You're so impatient.

33
00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.509
You just hung up without even letting me answer back.

34
00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.979
I hung up because I thought you might not let me come.

35
00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.350
Why did you think I might not let you come?

36
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.250
Because I felt like you'd be in a bad mood.

37
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.419
It's cold. Do you want to go inside, and drink some tea?

38
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.789
Can you make me food?

39
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.190
Are you going to cook rice?

40
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.960
You don't need to. You can just cook me ramyeon.

41
00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.400
I don't have ramyeon. I have noodles though.

42
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.500
Let's eat that then.

43
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:49.930
Rice will be too heavy of a meal.

44
00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.299
Should I cook the noodles?

45
00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.269
No, I'll cook everything for you.

46
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.750
I was on my way back from a meeting with Mr. Park.

47
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.449
You smelled like alcohol.

48
00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.289
Do you drink while you work?

49
00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.449
Oh, that.

50
00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.759
Joon Ha wanted to go somewhere else for a meeting.

51
00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.359
But we didn't know that he'd take us there.

52
00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.160
Joon Ha just took us without telling us where...

53
00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.330
I don't know why I'm trying to justify myself.

54
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.369
Why did you come back with Jung Woo when you went there with Kyung?

55
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.840
Are you being jealous right now?

56
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.320
It feels nice.

57
00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.390
I shouldn't have told you when there's nothing much to it.

58
00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.960
What did you talk about with Mr. Park?

59
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.629
Nothing much.

60
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:53.669
My goodness.

61
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.700
It's okay. This happens to me often.

62
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.869
This is why I told you not to cook.

63
00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:08.350
Do you want to eat bread? I just have to toast it.

64
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:09.809
I think that would be better.

65
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.749
Okay.

66
00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.510
Don't you have any affection for me?

67
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.309
I don't think I'll ever be on bad terms with you.

68
00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:38.979
Why?

69
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.510
Because it's you.

70
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.090
I liked how she knew how to cherish her feelings.

71
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.129
Because that would mean she would treat me the same way...

72
00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:59.799
if she actually started to like me.

73
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.400
I'm not sure if it's right to keep working with you.

74
00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.689
What did you talk about with Mr. Park?

75
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.789
Nothing much.

76
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.820
My goodness.

77
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.090
This is why I told you not to cook.

78
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.840
You have an executives' meeting at 9am.

79
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.070
You have a lunch meeting at 12pm with the director of HNC.

80
00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:42.840
You're scheduled to have tea with Netflix at 2:30pm.

81
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.780
And you need to sign a contract with Director Min at 3:30pm.

82
00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.179
Then you have a dinner meeting at 7pm with the director of SBC.

83
00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:19.239
I knew you normally come to work at this hour, so I came to see you.

84
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.580
Please bring us some tea.

85
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.210
Okay.

86
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.489
Why did you come see me in the middle of jogging?

87
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.299
What did you say...

88
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.429
to Jung Sun that night?

89
00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:42.900
I thought you were smart.

90
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.700
Are you so blinded by love that you've become stupid?

91
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.109
You have a way of making yourself look charming...

92
00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:53.809
by talking as if you're tough.

93
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.320
It's attractive. Just not to me.

94
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:04.220
You must be nervous.

95
00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:06.929
You guys are already being swayed.

96
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.059
How easy.

97
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.499
You both talked as if you guys had a really strong relationship.

98
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:17.239
You can sway me...

99
00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:19.900
because I always manage to find my way back.

100
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.340
I know how it feels to be swayed.

101
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.910
But Jung Sun's not like me.

102
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:31.379
Don't women normally fall for guys with a strong mentality?

103
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:33.649
Do you like him even if he's weak?

104
00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:36.590
Do you like him even if he's not stable?

105
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:38.759
Yes, I like him.

106
00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:42.529
Not just his appearance, but also his spirit.

107
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.159
He's 28.

108
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.029
It'd be weird for him to have already succeeded.

109
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.639
You're being really mean to me.

110
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.499
If I try to be on good terms with both of you,

111
00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:53.810
it'll be harder on all three of us.

112
00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:56.810
If I just try to make things work with one person,

113
00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.479
then only one person will have to get hurt.

114
00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:02.080
You talk as if you have control over...

115
00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.649
this relationship.

116
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.850
Do I not?

117
00:09:05.119 --> 00:09:07.920
That only works when Jung Sun and I are strangers.

118
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.590
This is a different situation.

119
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.389
Stop acting like your boyfriend's mother. Now, go home and work.

120
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.300
Why aren't you trying to earn money with my script?

121
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.269
I don't think it's right for you to say that you're only choosing...

122
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:29.040
my work because of our relationship.

123
00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:32.509
Other production companies don't think of my work that way.

124
00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:34.979
Do you want to work at another production company?

125
00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:36.920
I keep my promises.

126
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.619
Even if I do leave one day,

127
00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:40.550
I'm not going to leave before I earn money for your company.

128
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.989
So...

129
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.720
my story's going to be a happy ending.

130
00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:56.369
My goodness, look who's here. It's the handsome chef.

131
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.800
Do you have bass?

132
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.700
I came to buy them myself.

133
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.310
You're so strict when it comes to buying ingredients.

134
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:03.840
Let's see here.

135
00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:09.379
What do you think?

136
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.019
Ms. Lee, Mr. Park gave me orders to drive you home.

137
00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:23.529
No, it's okay.

138
00:10:24.229 --> 00:10:25.700
I'll be waiting outside.

139
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.100
Hyun Soo.

140
00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:31.170
Hello, Mother.

141
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.509
Isn't he Mr. Park's personal driver?

142
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.810
Yes, I came by to see Mr. Park about something.

143
00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:42.779
I see. I guess you work for him as well.

144
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.249
Yes. But what are you doing here?

145
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.649
I came to talk to Mr. Park about something.

146
00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.259
I'll see you next time.

147
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:52.560
Okay. See you.

148
00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:59.200
Is Mr. Park inside?

149
00:10:59.499 --> 00:11:01.399
I know he still has some time before the meeting starts.

150
00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:03.840
He already went to the meeting.

151
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.840
Really? I guess it started early. When did it start?

152
00:11:07.409 --> 00:11:09.009
It's been a little over 30 minutes.

153
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.440
Really? Okay.

154
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.580
He's not inside.

155
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:23.389
You're here.

156
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.960
Do you have something against Jung Sun?

157
00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:30.259
I'm a bit too straightforward, aren't I?

158
00:11:30.729 --> 00:11:32.200
That's your charm.

159
00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:33.899
What is this about?

160
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.369
I heard Good Soup isn't doing well financially.

161
00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:38.999
Can't you help him out a little?

162
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:42.739
I don't know how you came across that information.

163
00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:46.139
It doesn't look good for you to get involved in his business.

164
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.850
What?

165
00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:52.279
I'm sorry. I need to go to a meeting.

166
00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:54.350
You can have some tea before you leave.

167
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.749
Does Hyun Soo work here too?

168
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.159
I met her downstairs.

169
00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:02.029
Yes, she works here.

170
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.960
Is there nothing going on between you two?

171
00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:14.239
Please give Ms. Yoo some warm tea.

172
00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:29.090
Hello, Chef.

173
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.820
Why aren't you giving me an answer on the offer I made?

174
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.159
I heard Good Soup's going to go bankrupt soon.

175
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.529
Just come work for me before it goes bankrupt.

176
00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:40.100
I already gave you an answer.

177
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.330
It's become worse than before.

178
00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:45.499
It actually might be better for you to quit working there.

179
00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:46.869
They'll be able to cut down on personnel expenses.

180
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.940
Okay.

181
00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:59.019
Shouldn't we quit if the restaurant's doing this bad?

182
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.619
Then who's going to cook?

183
00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:04.019
Soo Jung might quit.

184
00:13:04.989 --> 00:13:06.560
I think someone's trying to scout her.

185
00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:08.790
I like Chef On.

186
00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:10.960
Why isn't he appearing on TV shows?

187
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.930
What were you talking about?

188
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.229
We were thinking maybe we should quit.

189
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.670
Quitting is better than getting fired.

190
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.040
Soo Jung got an offer from another restaurant.

191
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.310
- Why did you tell him that? - What?

192
00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:30.850
Chef.

193
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.149
I need to talk to you.

194
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.889
Is something wrong?

195
00:13:40.729 --> 00:13:42.430
Why don't you hire a regular server...

196
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:46.869
rather than keeping a sommelier like me?

197
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.629
Why did you come up with that idea?

198
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.940
I can make a wine list for you even if I'm somewhere else.

199
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.609
You should go if you have a better offer.

200
00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:01.649
I'm not doing this to go to a better restaurant.

201
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.149
I'll go prepare for lunch.

202
00:14:11.173 --> 00:14:14.405
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E25 Temperature of Love "I Respect You"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

203
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.769
She's trying to help us cut down on labor cost.

204
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.040
Soo Jung leaving us would be a worse blow.

205
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.739
Good job. You can go have lunch.

206
00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:32.779
Okay.

207
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.350
Mom.

208
00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:44.190
Hey.

209
00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:47.489
What's up? What brings you all the way here?

210
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.460
Nothing.

211
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.229
About Jung Sun...

212
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.200
Yes?

213
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.300
He loves me.

214
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:01.409
I know.

215
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.580
I could tell that the other day.

216
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.279
Happy dating.

217
00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.749
We can't just date.

218
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.050
You shouldn't decide to get married just because of your age.

219
00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.850
I'm okay with celibacy.

220
00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.190
Who says we'll get married now?

221
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.560
I want to give him conviction.

222
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.200
That my family approves our relationship.

223
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:29.170
Is your relationship that weak that he needs conviction?

224
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:31.440
Does his mom overpower him?

225
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.369
She seemed more than ordinary.

226
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.379
Jung Sun's mom is nice. She's different every time.

227
00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:39.279
That means she doesn't have stability.

228
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.649
Mr. Park...

229
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.779
Why are you bringing Mr. Park up?

230
00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.119
He likes you.

231
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.619
You don't even have to tell me. I know.

232
00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:51.759
I like Mr. Park.

233
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.859
He's stable.

234
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.430
Mom.

235
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.430
You're over 30.

236
00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:00.970
How can you be so out of touch with reality?

237
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:06.840
(Jung Sun's Mother)

238
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:10.580
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:15.509
We parted too abruptly earlier. Let's have tea.

240
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:18.550
Okay. Where should we meet?

241
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.920
Okay, ma'am.

242
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.090
I really don't like her.

243
00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:27.330
Jung Sun and you aren't even married. Why is she calling you?

244
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.600
This is her charm. This kind of unexpectedness.

245
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.859
Goodness.

246
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.180
Hello, again.

247
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.720
You're dressed differently.

248
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.950
You were in your sweat suit earlier.

249
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.249
Yes. I was working out.

250
00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:58.460
Are you close with Mr. Park?

251
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.359
How long have you known him?

252
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.230
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

253
00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:10.939
I ordered it.

254
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.439
I saw you liked Kenya double A.

255
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:16.270
Yes.

256
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.879
I've known Mr. Park for five years. We're quite close.

257
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.609
He's my college senior.

258
00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:26.149
Jung Sun and Mr. Park...

259
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.350
are like brothers. Did you know?

260
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.629
I found out just recently.

261
00:17:34.629 --> 00:17:35.659
Do you know...

262
00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:38.230
that they aren't getting along these days?

263
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.330
Yes.

264
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.840
Is it because of you?

265
00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:50.709
So it is.

266
00:17:56.949 --> 00:17:58.020
I liked that...

267
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.119
we were both dating men who were younger than us.

268
00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:07.260
But now I feel like I've been back-stabbed.

269
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.790
There has been a misunderstanding.

270
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.929
You should just listen.

271
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.300
Jung Sung's dad was 25 when I married him.

272
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.639
I was two years his senior.

273
00:18:18.469 --> 00:18:20.969
His family was against us getting married.

274
00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:25.740
Since I had nothing to show for except my looks and modesty.

275
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:28.550
I loved him so much.

276
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.119
I thought I'd die without him.

277
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:33.149
But...

278
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.550
it was different when we got married.

279
00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:38.520
He was violent.

280
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.490
So I was lonely.

281
00:18:43.929 --> 00:18:45.859
I made friends because I was lonely,

282
00:18:46.699 --> 00:18:48.100
and that caused trouble.

283
00:18:49.199 --> 00:18:50.469
One of them ran off with my money.

284
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.570
My husband lost his trust in me.

285
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.780
He hadn't left his family...

286
00:18:58.379 --> 00:18:59.709
even when he was having affairs.

287
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.990
Jung Sun is like a flower that bloomed in trash.

288
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.320
My heart aches for him.

289
00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:14.730
But...

290
00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:16.459
I can't control myself.

291
00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:19.330
I'm scared of living alone.

292
00:19:20.199 --> 00:19:21.270
I hate being alone.

293
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.139
Can you handle all that?

294
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.240
Yes, I can.

295
00:19:30.639 --> 00:19:31.709
What?

296
00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:33.750
You can?

297
00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:35.510
I'll try, ma'am.

298
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.080
Please root for me.

299
00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.520
You're really absurd.

300
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.090
I love Jung Sun.

301
00:19:46.689 --> 00:19:49.189
One only has this kind of love once in a lifetime.

302
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.969
I realized that during the five years he was gone.

303
00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:12.580
Chef, I'll do it. It's my turn.

304
00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:15.990
I'll do it. Just get ready to eat after you clean things up.

305
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.090
- I think he's overreacting. - Stop it.

306
00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:26.000
Thank you.

307
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.939
Is everyone worried about the restaurant closing?

308
00:20:35.969 --> 00:20:38.080
Worrying is my job.

309
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.679
You can't overstep your bounds.

310
00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.119
Why aren't you answering me? Will you quit because you're worried?

311
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.350
- No, Chef. - No, Chef.

312
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.090
Eat up.

313
00:21:15.949 --> 00:21:17.550
You like being high up.

314
00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:19.750
That's why I asked you to meet me here.

315
00:21:20.949 --> 00:21:22.619
I have 30 minutes.

316
00:21:23.689 --> 00:21:24.760
I'm sorry I hit you.

317
00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:26.790
You don't have to apologize.

318
00:21:27.429 --> 00:21:28.929
I'm apologizing to you...

319
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.659
and to me as well.

320
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.469
My goal in life was to not live like my dad.

321
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.699
I've been suppressing my aggressive nature inside me.

322
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.909
You disturbed it.

323
00:21:42.639 --> 00:21:44.409
Thanks to you it's been shaken.

324
00:21:50.179 --> 00:21:51.250
I respect you.

325
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.850
Being angry at me is ultimately is being angry yourself.

326
00:21:56.719 --> 00:21:58.389
It means you cared for me very much.

327
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.459
Our friendship is on trial.

328
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.600
I want to take it to the end.

329
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.000
I want to know the true nature of the ones I loved.

330
00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:49.010
Goodness.

331
00:22:50.939 --> 00:22:51.980
Welcome home.

332
00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:55.010
What? I thought I walked into your house.

333
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.619
Your place feels like my house.

334
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.290
Isn't Kyung home?

335
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.590
She's sleeping.

336
00:23:01.719 --> 00:23:04.090
I think she's a bit lazy, and she sleeps a lot too.

337
00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:06.260
But you like her, right?

338
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.399
I submitted our drama script to the station.

339
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.300
But On Entertainment also submitted Writer Ji's drama script as well.

340
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.100
Our company can only choose one.

341
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.439
I don't know what Jung Woo's thinking.

342
00:23:20.469 --> 00:23:21.909
I'm sure he'll make a wise decision.

343
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.879
Why can't you acknowledge reality?

344
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.649
If you choose Jung Woo, you'll be able to live a comfortable life.

345
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.250
I know because I've been there.

346
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.980
Your kind of love won't be able to last long.

347
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.219
Let me give it a try.

348
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.189
I want to decide after I give it my best shot.

349
00:23:41.959 --> 00:23:44.659
Did you sleep well?

350
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.359
Hey, Hyun Soo.

351
00:23:46.869 --> 00:23:47.899
Do you want some ramyeon?

352
00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:52.639
No. I have to go to Good Soup for an interview.

353
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.240
If I go there, good-looking chefs will give me delicious food.

354
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.010
Okay, fine.

355
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.189
(Park Jung Woo, Min Yi Bok)

356
00:24:19.159 --> 00:24:20.800
I'll do my best.

357
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.600
I look forward to working with you.

358
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Me too.

359
00:24:25.969 --> 00:24:28.310
Have you read Writer Ji Hong Ah's drama script?

360
00:24:28.709 --> 00:24:30.980
Yes. The storyline was very straightforward.

361
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.280
I think you two will get along very well.

362
00:24:33.609 --> 00:24:36.679
I told you beforehand that you won't get along so well with Writer Lee.

363
00:24:37.219 --> 00:24:38.520
You're the one who insisted on working with her.

364
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.320
But Writer Ji needs to make some changes in her script.

365
00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:47.689
You need to discuss it with the writer before you edit it.

366
00:24:48.129 --> 00:24:49.389
I told Writer Ji to come to the office.

367
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.830
Hello.

368
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:54.969
Welcome.

369
00:24:56.699 --> 00:24:57.699
It's nice to see you again.

370
00:24:58.199 --> 00:25:01.540
It was really painful contemplating on whether...

371
00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:03.480
I should work with you or not.

372
00:25:06.709 --> 00:25:09.050
She's not giving me an easy start.

373
00:25:09.709 --> 00:25:12.649
If you make any changes to my script, I might kill you.

374
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.030
My gosh, this is really interesting.

375
00:25:24.199 --> 00:25:25.230
I wonder who's going to win.

376
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:33.669
Won Joon.

377
00:25:34.139 --> 00:25:35.240
Hey, you're here.

378
00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.750
I just met the director.

379
00:25:42.949 --> 00:25:44.050
I guess things went well.

380
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.879
Yes, they did.

381
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.629
I'll see you next time.

382
00:25:57.699 --> 00:25:59.330
I get that you have a girlfriend.

383
00:25:59.859 --> 00:26:01.669
But you and I were already friends.

384
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:03.199
How can you suddenly treat me so differently?

385
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.369
I'm sorry. The restaurant's not doing so well these days,

386
00:26:06.369 --> 00:26:07.770
and I have a lot on my mind.

387
00:26:08.139 --> 00:26:09.939
The only friends I have in my life are...

388
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.109
Hyun Soo, you, Jung Sun, and Kyung.

389
00:26:12.109 --> 00:26:13.280
It's just the four of you.

390
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.409
But none of you are supporting me right now.

391
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.490
- Hello, Ms. Yoo. - Hi.

392
00:26:22.219 --> 00:26:23.490
Is Jung Sun at home?

393
00:26:23.619 --> 00:26:25.790
No, he went to meet Mr. Park.

394
00:26:26.889 --> 00:26:28.230
You seem familiar.

395
00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:29.990
Hello.

396
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.830
How do you know her?

397
00:26:31.929 --> 00:26:33.429
I saw her at Mr. Park's office.

398
00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:38.240
Now that I'm seeing you again,

399
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.369
I wonder why it feels as though you're a very complicated person.

400
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:46.010
Anyway, I need to talk to my son today.

401
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.709
And I've already spent too much energy, so I'll see you next time.

402
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.250
Bye, Ms. Yoo.

403
00:26:58.219 --> 00:27:01.359
There aren't as many ingredients as there used to be.

404
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.859
When did you interview him?

405
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.899
A... A few days ago.

406
00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:08.699
We don't have a lot of customers these days.

407
00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:10.439
So we're not making as many orders as we used to.

408
00:27:11.199 --> 00:27:12.300
Is it that bad?

409
00:27:12.869 --> 00:27:15.109
Mr. Park's been pressuring us lately.

410
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.980
Is Chef On upstairs?

411
00:27:25.419 --> 00:27:27.320
I waited for you for over an hour.

412
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.619
How did things go with Mr. Park?

413
00:27:33.629 --> 00:27:34.790
Why aren't you answering me?

414
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:39.100
You're doing this because of Hyun Soo, aren't you?

415
00:27:39.359 --> 00:27:40.570
That's why you're not telling me anything.

416
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:42.169
Why are you bringing up Hyun Soo all of a sudden?

417
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:44.540
I met Hyun Soo at Mr. Park's company.

418
00:27:44.969 --> 00:27:46.570
They seemed pretty close.

419
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.669
She works for that company. That's why they're close.

420
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:49.869
Don't get mistaken.

421
00:27:49.869 --> 00:27:51.340
I'm not mistaken.

422
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.010
Is there something going on between you and Professor Min?

423
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.449
What are you talking about?

424
00:27:56.649 --> 00:27:59.550
Since when were you so interested in me like this?

425
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.919
What kind of mother wouldn't love their own son?

426
00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.020
I'm a mother too.

427
00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:09.189
My goodness.

428
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.830
You should go now.

429
00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:15.929
Hello.

430
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.949
You're so diligent.

431
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:30.419
Do you follow me around?

432
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.980
Mom, aren't you going to leave?

433
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:38.889
Why are you disrespecting me?

434
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.560
You can treat me like that when it's just the two of us.

435
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.060
But how can you treat me like that in front of her?

436
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.300
Okay, I get it.

437
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.929
What do you get? This is all because of her.

438
00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:47.169
Why are you taking it out on me?

439
00:28:51.639 --> 00:28:53.199
I liked you earlier, but not anymore.

440
00:28:53.609 --> 00:28:55.709
I'll do my best to make you keep liking me.

441
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.139
Are you going to keep doing this?

442
00:28:58.409 --> 00:29:00.679
No. Because I know you'll hate me if I continue.

443
00:29:00.949 --> 00:29:02.109
Goodbye.

444
00:29:03.109 --> 00:29:04.480
You have really good manners.

445
00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.820
Yes, Mother. I hear that a lot.

446
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.820
What a great personality.

447
00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:25.270
I was here for an interview and heard you were here, so I came up.

448
00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.510
You have to get ready for dinnertime soon.

449
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:32.310
I'm sorry about my mom.

450
00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:34.909
It's okay.

451
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.879
She's not that hard to deal with.

452
00:29:37.179 --> 00:29:38.350
She's cute.

453
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.619
Her mood changes really quickly.

454
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.419
I like that she's honest.

455
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.260
That's why I liked Hong Ah.

456
00:29:45.419 --> 00:29:47.290
I like your optimistic nature.

457
00:29:47.959 --> 00:29:49.030
That's right.

458
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:10.250
Jung Sun is like a flower that bloomed in a pile of trash.

459
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.219
Jung Sun and Mr. Park...

460
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.189
are like brothers.

461
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.919
Do you know that they aren't getting along these days?

462
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.530
I want to give him assurance...

463
00:30:22.359 --> 00:30:24.230
that my family approves our relationship.

464
00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:41.209
(Third Report on how to improve the management performance of Good Soup)

465
00:30:42.109 --> 00:30:45.020
Here's the third consultation report on Good Soup.

466
00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:49.090
(Development of new menu, A collaboration with a famous chef)

467
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.790
(Chef On could work with another chef to bring out better results.)

468
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:07.909
This is Good Soup.

469
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.340
Chef On, I'm calling from Mr. Park's office.

470
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.080
Yes, hello.

471
00:31:13.209 --> 00:31:14.780
I'm calling to make a dinner reservation for two.

472
00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:17.980
Mr. Park's going to eat there with Eric Song,

473
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.419
a Michelin three-star chef from Hong Kong.

474
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:22.520
Okay.

475
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.129
The restaurant feels so weird without Soo Jung.

476
00:31:31.399 --> 00:31:33.100
Do you know who's coming to the restaurant today?

477
00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:35.770
Eric Song is coming. He's coming with Jung Woo.

478
00:31:35.929 --> 00:31:37.040
Eric Song?

479
00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:39.040
He's the chef who got three Michelin stars.

480
00:31:40.209 --> 00:31:42.209
Mr. Park must be trying to support us now.

481
00:31:43.169 --> 00:31:44.379
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

482
00:31:44.939 --> 00:31:46.209
No, my gut's telling me that it is.

483
00:31:46.409 --> 00:31:48.980
How nice would it be if Eric Song compliments us on our food?

484
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.419
I should go inside and get ready.

485
00:32:39.943 --> 00:32:43.743
(Episode 26 will air shortly.)
