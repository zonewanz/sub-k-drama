00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:09.003
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:17.434
How much did you drink to not remember a thing?

3
00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.504
That's why I told you that I'll keep the ring.

4
00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:22.733
Goodness, I think I took it off because I didn't want to lose it.

5
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.443
Were you at a pub in Yeouido again? I'll go check.

6
00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:27.943
I went there already. They didn't have it.

7
00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:30.783
Goodness, it's not like that ring has legs.

8
00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:34.954
Hey, isn't that Jin Jin?

9
00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:43.963
He shouldn't have lost the ring. Why does he want to buy you food?

10
00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:46.893
He's a busy man.

11
00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:48.694
How could he keep track of such small props?

12
00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.664
That's not just a prop, and you have it.

13
00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:54.503
- I also don't know where it is. - You liar.

14
00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:57.603
Don't bring up the ring in front of Anthony, okay?

15
00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:01.344
I'm not doing this. Stop doing this nonsense.

16
00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:03.143
I'm hungry, so I wanted to eat.

17
00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.153
And we ran into Jin Jin by coincidence, and we can join her.

18
00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:08.914
She's got the time too.

19
00:01:08.914 --> 00:01:11.284
So what's the problem? What is it?

20
00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:12.683
Let's go and eat.

21
00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:22.263
Chul Min wanted to buy you a meal.

22
00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.963
Anyway, Jin Jin, I'm glad you had the time.

23
00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:27.403
Yes, thank you.

24
00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:29.304
- Sure. - Oh, goodness.

25
00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:32.703
I'm so sorry. I got a call from the producer.

26
00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:35.573
I have to go first.

27
00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:36.644
Pardon?

28
00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:39.683
Enjoy your meal with Chul Min today.

29
00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:42.483
Buy her something good, okay?

30
00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:45.453
- Eat before you go. - Goodness.

31
00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.494
Don't you know how he is?

32
00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:50.394
I don't want to mess with such an impatient guy.

33
00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:53.323
I have to walk in carefully, showing him that I surrender.

34
00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.733
Enjoy a great meal...

35
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.034
by yourselves.

36
00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:09.313
Oh, right.

37
00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:12.183
Jin Jin, I have to go and return sponsored clothes.

38
00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:13.213
What?

39
00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:16.683
Gangnam has heavy traffic, and I'm running late.

40
00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:18.454
Excuse me.

41
00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:20.824
Anthony, I'm sure you're very disappointed,

42
00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:23.424
but next time, I'll give you another chance to eat with me.

43
00:02:23.424 --> 00:02:24.894
Today isn't the only day we'll meet.

44
00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:27.294
Oh, sure. Thanks.

45
00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:40.174
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy.

46
00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:49.283
Am I sitting here eating alone with Anthony?

47
00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:52.924
Wait, it's a rather fancy restaurant,

48
00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:55.093
we're seated by the window that lets the sunlight in,

49
00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:57.663
there's a red rose on the table,

50
00:02:57.663 --> 00:02:59.394
and classical music is playing.

51
00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:01.463
Are we on a date?

52
00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:23.383
It's been a while since you've been on a variety show. Isn't it hard?

53
00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:25.554
You're never really on variety shows.

54
00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:30.524
I remember you bungee jumping back in Boys Be Ambitious days.

55
00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:34.633
You spun twice in the air when you jumped.

56
00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:36.093
I had just debuted,

57
00:03:36.663 --> 00:03:39.734
and the director told me to do it, so I had to. I was young and naive.

58
00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:43.903
I still find it pretty hard to cope with cameras following me around.

59
00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:46.343
Right, I agree.

60
00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:51.943
I think his portion is too small. Should I give him some of mine?

61
00:03:52.843 --> 00:03:54.213
Or should I order something else?

62
00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:57.183
But that means we'll have to wait until the food gets here.

63
00:03:57.824 --> 00:03:59.324
My gosh, should I just order some desserts?

64
00:04:02.623 --> 00:04:04.623
- Jin Jin. - Yes?

65
00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:06.264
Does the food taste bad?

66
00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:09.633
Oh, no. It's good.

67
00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:10.963
It's great.

68
00:04:19.804 --> 00:04:22.114
- Hey, you're home early. - I'm home.

69
00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:23.544
Yes, I wanted to eat at home.

70
00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:25.544
I'm glad you came early.

71
00:04:25.544 --> 00:04:27.484
I had no one to eat with,

72
00:04:27.484 --> 00:04:30.253
so I was about to eat by myself.

73
00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:32.083
The two of us can eat dinner together.

74
00:04:33.054 --> 00:04:35.554
Oh, is no one around?

75
00:04:35.554 --> 00:04:37.924
Yes, they're all out.

76
00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:40.933
I made some crab stew. Do you like it?

77
00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:42.364
Of course.

78
00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:44.063
Go and get changed.

79
00:04:44.063 --> 00:04:45.433
- Okay. - All right.

80
00:05:06.023 --> 00:05:07.154
Is it hot in here?

81
00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:10.054
Oh, are you hot?

82
00:05:10.464 --> 00:05:11.523
No.

83
00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:22.933
You can keep it open if you need some air.

84
00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:25.703
- Do you need some air? - No.

85
00:06:05.013 --> 00:06:06.313
Thank you.

86
00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:08.953
You must be tired. Thanks for giving me a ride.

87
00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:10.453
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

88
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.883
Drive safely, and have a good night.

89
00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:15.654
- Sure. - Thank you for everything.

90
00:06:52.494 --> 00:06:55.364
Guys, life is precious.

91
00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:58.464
If you endure through life, life will give you a present.

92
00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:01.633
What is this? An acceptance speech? Are you getting an award?

93
00:07:01.633 --> 00:07:05.104
You know what? Anthony and I just...

94
00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:06.244
Did you guys sleep together?

95
00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:09.873
We ate together. Just by ourselves!

96
00:07:55.994 --> 00:07:57.924
My gosh.

97
00:08:15.313 --> 00:08:17.643
Oh, I'm sorry.

98
00:08:18.643 --> 00:08:20.013
My gosh.

99
00:08:56.314 --> 00:08:58.553
- You should go. - Okay.

100
00:09:17.003 --> 00:09:18.503
Why are you home so late?

101
00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:26.513
I think Anthony's really awesome.

102
00:09:26.684 --> 00:09:28.883
This is why girls went mad for him.

103
00:09:29.153 --> 00:09:32.923
I knew he was a nice guy, but I didn't think he was this cool.

104
00:09:33.694 --> 00:09:36.253
You mean my brother? Were you with him until now?

105
00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:39.123
We had dinner. Him and me, just us two.

106
00:09:42.094 --> 00:09:43.163
Is it okay...

107
00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:46.434
for you to be out in public together?

108
00:09:47.173 --> 00:09:49.773
- Why? - Reporters might catch wind.

109
00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:51.403
It could also cause a scandal.

110
00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:53.643
Not him and me.

111
00:09:53.744 --> 00:09:55.814
I couldn't do that to him when he's led such a good life.

112
00:09:56.114 --> 00:09:58.883
Just one meal together won't cause a scandal.

113
00:10:00.653 --> 00:10:02.114
That's a relief to hear.

114
00:10:03.253 --> 00:10:05.923
Gong Ji Won, do you know this?

115
00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:10.053
If you like someone a lot, if that feeling overflows,

116
00:10:10.494 --> 00:10:12.263
it's not all that good.

117
00:10:12.923 --> 00:10:14.364
Some things are bad.

118
00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:16.633
What do you mean?

119
00:10:16.793 --> 00:10:18.633
I mean I'm hungry.

120
00:10:22.273 --> 00:10:24.474
It's finally ready.

121
00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:28.314
It smells great.

122
00:10:28.543 --> 00:10:30.714
You make the best ramyeon.

123
00:10:34.814 --> 00:10:35.814
Hurry, hurry.

124
00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:37.354
It looks so good.

125
00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:41.694
Does Anthony like ramyeon?

126
00:10:41.854 --> 00:10:43.763
What kind of kimchi does he like?

127
00:10:43.763 --> 00:10:46.864
Stop thinking about him and eat before it gets cold.

128
00:10:50.564 --> 00:10:52.204
- How is it? - It's fantastic.

129
00:10:54.334 --> 00:10:56.003
It's hot. Give me some more.

130
00:10:56.974 --> 00:10:58.474
(Detention Center)

131
00:11:00.314 --> 00:11:04.283
I'm Jang Young Shim, the lawyer your grandmother appointed.

132
00:11:06.314 --> 00:11:08.253
Let's see.

133
00:11:08.814 --> 00:11:10.653
You went online and took...

134
00:11:11.023 --> 00:11:14.793
5,400 dollars by lying about selling a phone. Is that true?

135
00:11:17.263 --> 00:11:20.194
That's illegal. You did a very bad thing.

136
00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:21.434
Do you feel bad?

137
00:11:22.694 --> 00:11:24.104
Why did you do it?

138
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.934
Did you need money? To buy something?

139
00:11:26.934 --> 00:11:28.204
Leave me alone.

140
00:11:28.503 --> 00:11:29.903
I'll stay in here.

141
00:11:32.244 --> 00:11:34.214
Okay then. That's fine.

142
00:11:38.913 --> 00:11:42.184
I don't really care whether you stay here or not.

143
00:11:43.184 --> 00:11:46.523
But your grandmother won't feel the same.

144
00:11:47.494 --> 00:11:50.423
Think about her. You only have each other.

145
00:11:52.094 --> 00:11:55.334
You won't feel like talking today.

146
00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:58.704
I'll come back again. When I do,

147
00:11:59.464 --> 00:12:00.873
tell me your story.

148
00:12:04.043 --> 00:12:05.074
Okay?

149
00:12:08.844 --> 00:12:09.913
Have you eaten anything?

150
00:12:11.584 --> 00:12:13.084
Do you sleep well?

151
00:12:14.783 --> 00:12:17.184
Are you in pain at all?

152
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:30.864
Grandma said...

153
00:12:32.434 --> 00:12:35.434
you treat her well every day.

154
00:12:37.803 --> 00:12:40.513
She said you gave her coffee every single day.

155
00:12:43.074 --> 00:12:45.043
I also wanted to give you something,

156
00:12:46.043 --> 00:12:47.114
but...

157
00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:50.153
I have nothing in here.

158
00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:04.763
I won't be long.

159
00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:06.503
Okay.

160
00:13:15.314 --> 00:13:18.944
So what I meant last time was...

161
00:13:19.744 --> 00:13:23.383
Jong Hwa's a minor and can be tried in juvenile court.

162
00:13:23.883 --> 00:13:26.994
That means he won't have a criminal record.

163
00:13:27.623 --> 00:13:31.724
So it means he won't become an ex-convict.

164
00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:36.094
Even if this goes to criminal court,

165
00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:40.133
5,400 dollars isn't a lot, so if you settle, he might be released.

166

I told you to clean your desk. Do you really need all this?

177
00:14:30.984 --> 00:14:34.793
Don't leave half-finished cans of sodas in the garbage can.

178
00:14:34.793 --> 00:14:38.293
It'll spill and leak. Then I'll have to clean that up.

My wedding was called off.

333
00:31:02.174 --> 00:31:05.083
Did you think Jin Jin would help you get the spotlight?

334
00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:07.613
I never had such thoughts after I met her.

335
00:31:07.613 --> 00:31:09.484
I became her fan.

336
00:31:09.684 --> 00:31:13.593
Ji Won, do you know what cosmos means?

337
00:31:13.924 --> 00:31:15.353
I love you.
