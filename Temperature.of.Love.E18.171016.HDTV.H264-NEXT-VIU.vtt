00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.526
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:13.391
(Producer Kim "Star's Favorite Dish")

3
00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:16.931
Yes, Producer Kim.

4
00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:18.562
Mr. Park,

5
00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:22.262
Apparently Chef On told us he won't be on the show anymore.

6
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:25.731
Aren't you changing your attitude too quickly?

7
00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:28.542
It hasn't been long since you asked me desperately to let him on.

8
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.942
I'll look into it.

9
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:32.942
Make sure he's on this episode.

10
00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:42.281
You have a 6pm dinner appointment with CP Yoo at Good Soup.

11
00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:45.921
Call Writer Ji Hong Ah to come if she's available.

12
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.061
And Director Min too.

13
00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:03.741
Have we met before?

14
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:05.641
I think I've seen you before.

15
00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:09.712
Yes, we met five years ago in Yeonnam-dong.

16
00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:12.311
You had Kenya Double A then.

17
00:01:13.182 --> 00:01:14.481
You have a good memory.

18
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:17.751
Can I talk to you comfortably?

19
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:24.061
You seem much older than my son.

20
00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:25.391
How much older are you?

21
00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:28.762
I'm not that older.

22
00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:31.171
I'm six years older.

23
00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:33.941
Only six years?

24
00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:36.841
Six years is nothing.

25
00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:40.941
After I ended things with Jung Sun's dad, I only met younger men.

26
00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:43.581
You can't go back to older guys after seeing younger men.

27
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:47.421
Whether they are older or younger, men are children.

28
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:49.751
It's better to humor younger men.

29
00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:52.652
I see.

30
00:01:55.022 --> 00:01:56.122
What do you do?

31
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:58.292
I'm a drama writer.

32
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.262
I'm preparing for a new project right now.

33
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.402
When it's not on air, I'm basically unemployed.

34
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.072
I like that you don't show off.

35
00:02:09.702 --> 00:02:13.212
Were you in touch with Chef On when he was in France?

36
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:15.841
No, we reconnected when he came back.

37
00:02:16.082 --> 00:02:19.281
Right? There's no way I wouldn't have known if you were in touch.

38
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:21.881
What do your parents do?

39
00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:24.191
They're both elementary school teachers.

40
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.321
That's nice.

41
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:30.791
I feel like they'll be young at heart like elementary school kids.

42
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.232
Yes, they are innocent.

43
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.971
Let's share phone numbers and be friends.

44
00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:42.372
I have to get going.

45
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.772
I'll get going too then.

46
00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:47.781
There's someone you should meet before you leave.

47
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:49.341
It's my fiancé.

48
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:56.281
Hello, Soo Jung.

49
00:02:57.122 --> 00:02:59.251
- Can I get another glass? - Sure.

50
00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:05.992
Professor Min.

51
00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:09.131
This is Chef On's girlfriend.

52
00:03:09.332 --> 00:03:10.432
Hello.

53
00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:11.732
Oh, are you?

54
00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:14.172
When did he get a girlfriend? He didn't have one before.

55
00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:18.642
They've had a platonic love relationship for a while now.

56
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:21.381
She's a drama writer.

57
00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:22.781
Oh, you're a writer?

58
00:03:23.552 --> 00:03:24.881
I'm a writer too.

59
00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:26.881
I'm basically unemployed now.

60
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.992
She's so humble.

61
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:31.851
It's not good to be so humble.

62
00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:34.922
She's older than Chef On.

63
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:36.691
It's less than our age gap though.

64
00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:40.601
I like that she's older than my son.

65
00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:43.161
Chef On and I are indeed similar.

66
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.202
Right, have a seat. Let's eat together.

67
00:03:46.432 --> 00:03:48.142
No, it's okay. I have some work to do.

68
00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:51.541
I'll get going then, Mother.

69
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:52.841
Mother?

70
00:03:53.511 --> 00:03:56.212
Oh my, it feels so strange to hear that.

71
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:58.982
Should I not call you that?

72
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.482
No, it's not that I don't like it.

73
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.452
Then see you later.

74
00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:05.052
Okay.

75
00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:24.842
Mr. Park.

76
00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:27.581
Hello. Where are you headed?

77
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:29.641
Home.

78
00:04:31.282 --> 00:04:32.311
Let's walk together.

79
00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:09.052
Is she even real?

80
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:10.722
I've never seen you with a woman.

81
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:12.592
Just get ready to greet her.

82
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.862
I'll look forward to it.

83
00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:34.412
Go in.

84
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:36.511
Okay.

85
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:37.811
Mr. Park.

86
00:05:41.722 --> 00:05:43.251
I have something to tell you.

87
00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:47.222
Number 1, it's personal. Number 2, it's work-related.

88
00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:50.362
Number one.

89
00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:52.862
Don't say it.

90
00:05:53.532 --> 00:05:54.532
I'm taking off.

91
00:06:29.802 --> 00:06:31.131
For the past 10 years, I planned to name...

92
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.542
my future company as "On".

93
00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:38.372
But as soon as I heard your name, On Jung Sun,

94
00:06:38.872 --> 00:06:41.182
I felt like I had lost.

95
00:06:44.912 --> 00:06:46.112
What are you thinking about?

96
00:06:48.922 --> 00:06:49.922
You.

97
00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:51.622
Goodness. Stop it.

98
00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:56.092
I heard you said you won't be on the show today.

99
00:06:56.891 --> 00:06:58.331
The producer called me.

100
00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:00.201
Are you in trouble?

101
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:02.662
A little bit.

102
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.032
I asked for you to be on the show.

103
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:08.802
So someone had an allergic reaction at Good Soup?

104
00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:11.612
Wow, you know everything.

105
00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:14.782
I've figured everything out.

106
00:07:16.482 --> 00:07:17.511
Go on the show.

107
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:20.521
I had some thoughts...

108
00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.852
while taking that customer to the emergency room.

109
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.722
"This isn't it."

110
00:07:26.722 --> 00:07:28.122
"This isn't the way to go."

111
00:07:29.162 --> 00:07:31.432
- You still have to go on once more. - No, I won't do it.

112
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:35.432
It's too early to let your guards down.

113
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:38.472
Your customers aren't coming to the restaurant for your cooking.

114
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:40.302
That's why I won't do it.

115
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:42.742
It's right to go slowly.

116
00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:47.881
As long as I don't lose the customers I have now, that's fine.

117
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:52.682
In the end, you'll do what you want...

118
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:54.682
regardless of what I say.

119
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:00.561
Then why do you need me?

120
00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:06.732
You may be the owner chef of Good Soup,

121
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.372
but don't forget I'm the person who can take you down from that place.

122
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:13.941
I haven't forgotten.

123
00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:16.842
That's why I'm making changes and compromises.

124
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.071
I feel like they aren't enough though.

125
00:08:19.672 --> 00:08:21.311
Can't you just trust me until the end?

126
00:08:21.842 --> 00:08:23.511
The same feeling you had in the beginning.

127
00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:27.521
Feeling.

128
00:08:32.852 --> 00:08:33.921
Feeling.

129
00:09:12.232 --> 00:09:13.261
What are you doing?

130
00:09:48.362 --> 00:09:50.501
(I have to talk to you. What are you doing?)

131
00:09:52.332 --> 00:09:54.202
(I have to talk to you. What are you doing?)

132
00:09:58.911 --> 00:09:59.942
Hyun Soo.

133
00:10:00.612 --> 00:10:02.911
Are you really going to start working now?

134
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:04.911
- You're up early. - Yes.

135
00:10:05.612 --> 00:10:06.921
Do you want some tea?

136
00:10:07.082 --> 00:10:09.082
No, I want food.

137
00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:12.852
How can you eat as soon as you wake up?

138
00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:24.602
What are you doing?

139
00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:27.041
She woke up early.

140
00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:39.881
Why are you eating that?

141
00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:41.822
You hate boiled eggs.

142
00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:44.251
You're right.

143
00:10:50.962 --> 00:10:52.131
I got changed.

144
00:10:52.592 --> 00:10:55.001
Where? Why were you changing?

145
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:57.001
He told me earlier that he's drinking water.

146
00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.531
Why did he drink water? What is he trying to do?

147
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:03.612
He should become a writer.

148
00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.342
He makes me so curious.

149
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:06.781
Hyun Soo.

150
00:11:07.212 --> 00:11:09.482
- Yes? - Do you like him that much?

151
00:11:11.812 --> 00:11:14.322
- Is it obvious? - It's very obvious.

152
00:11:15.322 --> 00:11:17.151
I want to date too.

153
00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:19.421
- You should. - With who?

154
00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:22.062
Where can I find a man like Chef On?

155
00:11:22.492 --> 00:11:24.592
You should find a man that suits you.

156
00:11:24.592 --> 00:11:25.891
Why are you looking at my man?

157
00:11:29.332 --> 00:11:30.671
What's wrong with me?

158
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:33.202
Did I really just say that?

159
00:11:34.901 --> 00:11:35.901
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:38.372
Do you like him that much?

161
00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:41.181
I do.

162
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:45.952
I might buy a bicycle.

163
00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:47.452
Why all of a sudden?

164
00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.281
If we want to do research,

165
00:11:49.781 --> 00:11:51.051
Good Soup...

166
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:53.562
is too close to drive and too far to walk.

167
00:11:53.722 --> 00:11:55.322
I can get there fast on a bicycle.

168
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:00.232
Is it Chef On? Like last time?

169
00:12:01.102 --> 00:12:02.462
- Oh, my. - No way.

170
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:07.641
Hyun Soo.

171
00:12:08.872 --> 00:12:10.271
Does he not have a home?

172
00:12:11.472 --> 00:12:13.141
No one's home anyway.

173
00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:38.702
What brings you here?

174
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:41.141
Make me some breakfast.

175
00:12:49.212 --> 00:12:51.011
You didn't have to make soup.

176
00:12:52.112 --> 00:12:53.582
I like making soup.

177
00:12:53.582 --> 00:12:56.151
I had to make a lot of soup because someone likes it.

178
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:06.931
Is it not good?

179
00:13:07.862 --> 00:13:09.602
No, it's delicious.

180
00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:11.832
Come.

181
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:13.242
Okay.

182
00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:26.212
Clams are good for people that have to use their brains.

183
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:55.712
Have you ever felt this?

184
00:13:56.582 --> 00:13:59.082
Once you find out the result of the things you didn't know,

185
00:13:59.751 --> 00:14:02.082
all the pieces come together like a puzzle, becoming a single picture.

186
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:04.192
Yes.

187
00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:05.391
Because of one incident,

188
00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:07.622
everything lines up, and you come to a realization.

189
00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:09.722
That's pretty good.

190
00:14:10.692 --> 00:14:14.531
If the woman you like likes another man,

191
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:16.202
will you give up?

192
00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:19.602
I might give up, but not before I give it my all.

193
00:14:20.872 --> 00:14:21.901
Same with me.

194
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:26.511
Then what if that man was me?

195
00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:28.612
Would you still go all the way?

196
00:14:30.712 --> 00:14:31.812
Of course.

197
00:14:32.312 --> 00:14:33.482
Wouldn't you do the same?

198
00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:41.222
I would.

199
00:14:42.222 --> 00:14:43.562
I'm going to propose next week.

200
00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:46.261
I'll make sure to prepare it well.

201
00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:50.171
Even if she likes someone else, you'll become the star that night.

202
00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:54.602
Eat this too.

203
00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:08.858
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E18 Temperature of Love "The Same Feeling"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

204
00:15:15.592 --> 00:15:16.592
(Lee Hyun Soo)

205
00:15:18.131 --> 00:15:19.161
What are you doing?

206
00:15:19.462 --> 00:15:21.161
Can I come over for an interview?

207
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.131
Let's go, Hyun Soo.

208
00:15:23.332 --> 00:15:24.801
He didn't reply yet.

209
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:28.702
How frustrating. Why are you texting him?

210
00:15:28.702 --> 00:15:30.972
Just call him.

211
00:15:31.072 --> 00:15:32.312
He's busy.

212
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:34.181
I might disturb him at work.

213
00:15:34.812 --> 00:15:36.181
What if he finds me annoying?

214
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:39.411
He loves you. Why would he think you're annoying?

215
00:15:40.582 --> 00:15:41.622
Here it is.

216
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:44.322
What are you doing?

217
00:15:45.192 --> 00:15:46.492
I'm going to an interview.

218
00:15:46.492 --> 00:15:47.562
(I'm going to an interview.)

219
00:15:48.421 --> 00:15:49.661
She's working.

220
00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:53.661
At least she's not seeing her boyfriend.

221
00:15:56.671 --> 00:15:57.671
It's for real this time.

222
00:15:58.431 --> 00:15:59.472
Come.

223
00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:02.171
Kyung, we should go now. Let's go.

224
00:16:02.602 --> 00:16:05.171
It's so strange to see you like this.

225
00:16:05.712 --> 00:16:06.881
I'm sorry, Kyung.

226
00:16:07.181 --> 00:16:08.942
Don't be sorry.

227
00:16:09.312 --> 00:16:11.212
I'm just saying I'm jealous.

228
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:15.982
Why are you here at this hour?

229
00:16:18.992 --> 00:16:20.862
I don't want to be a part of "Unruly Detectives".

230
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.862
You didn't say anything yesterday. What happened?

231
00:16:24.462 --> 00:16:27.202
I saw what Director Min's team wrote,

232
00:16:28.062 --> 00:16:29.301
and it's not going anywhere.

233
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:32.572
I'm sure it will fail. It'll just be hard work.

234
00:16:33.072 --> 00:16:34.602
I need you to take care of it.

235
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.771
All right. Let's do that.

236
00:16:38.771 --> 00:16:40.141
I like that it's simple.

237
00:16:40.342 --> 00:16:42.612
I'm glad I decided to work with you.

238
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:45.511
Please let me think the same about you too.

239
00:16:46.051 --> 00:16:47.122
Of course.

240
00:16:47.222 --> 00:16:50.722
You and I are both achievement-oriented people.

241
00:16:56.562 --> 00:16:57.592
But...

242
00:16:58.362 --> 00:17:00.462
there is one thing I'm worried about.

243
00:17:02.702 --> 00:17:06.131
You and I are really different when it comes to love.

244
00:17:07.042 --> 00:17:10.272
It was unexpected and disappointing.

245
00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:14.881
I know you like Hyun Soo.

246
00:17:16.582 --> 00:17:18.852
I'm very sharp when it comes to things like this.

247
00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:21.282
I knew it when I met you.

248
00:17:22.322 --> 00:17:23.322
And?

249
00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:24.792
Why haven't you made a move?

250
00:17:25.352 --> 00:17:27.792
You have all the qualifications of becoming the perfect man.

251
00:17:28.862 --> 00:17:32.431
I thought you would date Hyun Soo and marry her.

252
00:17:32.562 --> 00:17:34.862
What have you been doing for the last five years?

253
00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:36.931
Why are you behind?

254
00:17:37.302 --> 00:17:39.502
Do you even know who you're against?

255
00:17:39.502 --> 00:17:40.671
That's enough.

256
00:17:44.471 --> 00:17:45.572
Ms. Ji.

257
00:17:46.372 --> 00:17:48.842
You have a tendency to push people to the edge.

258
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:50.911
You aroused me enough.

259
00:17:51.881 --> 00:17:53.381
Please write your work like this.

260
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:05.562
It's so nice to eat while working.

261
00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:10.171
Isn't it good?

262
00:18:10.272 --> 00:18:12.272
How did he think of making a sandwich with sea urchin?

263
00:18:12.872 --> 00:18:15.641
Hyun Soo, do you think there is a reason why...

264
00:18:15.641 --> 00:18:18.441
the course meal is set this way? Maybe it's a theme.

265
00:18:19.211 --> 00:18:20.312
I'm sure.

266
00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:23.211
Do you want more wine?

267
00:18:23.211 --> 00:18:24.282
Yes, please.

268
00:18:32.022 --> 00:18:33.022
Is it okay?

269
00:18:33.592 --> 00:18:34.592
It's delicious.

270
00:18:34.991 --> 00:18:36.161
Enjoy.

271
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:39.792
Okay. I'll see you later.

272
00:18:40.102 --> 00:18:41.131
Okay.

273
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:48.901
"I'll see you later."

274
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.572
Gosh. I need to lie down.

275
00:18:52.812 --> 00:18:55.312
Kyung, please be understanding.

276
00:18:56.141 --> 00:18:58.812
It's because I've been holding it in for so long.

277
00:18:59.052 --> 00:19:01.151
Sure. I understand.

278
00:19:56.272 --> 00:19:57.772
Why haven't you made a move?

279
00:19:59.411 --> 00:20:01.681
What have you been doing for the last five years?

280
00:20:13.991 --> 00:20:15.062
What are you doing?

281
00:20:15.062 --> 00:20:16.092
(Come!)

282
00:20:19.262 --> 00:20:22.461
What do you think? I came to see you after work.

283
00:20:30.372 --> 00:20:32.411
Does it bother you that I'm always texting?

284
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:35.741
Are you always waiting for me since I reply slow?

285
00:20:35.741 --> 00:20:36.752
Yes.

286
00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:38.512
How did you know?

287
00:20:39.252 --> 00:20:40.651
Because everyone is like that.

288
00:20:41.322 --> 00:20:42.451
Same with me.

289
00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:46.052
Do you know what "What are you doing" means?

290
00:20:47.161 --> 00:20:48.191
What?

291
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:51.032
I miss you.

292
00:20:56.502 --> 00:20:58.631
Why don't you ever ask me what I'm doing?

293
00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:03.272
I'm always curious what you're doing,

294
00:21:04.272 --> 00:21:06.211
so whenever I open my eyes in the morning...

295
00:21:12.782 --> 00:21:14.322
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

296
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:16.122
Then I would have asked you.

297
00:21:26.362 --> 00:21:27.502
Can I touch it?

298
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:30.002
Go ahead.

299
00:21:36.772 --> 00:21:40.981
(Salt)

300
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:47.881
- Did it hurt? - Yes. It hurt a lot.

301
00:21:50.052 --> 00:21:51.221
How did you get hurt?

302
00:21:52.592 --> 00:21:54.762
- Were you beat? - No.

303
00:21:55.522 --> 00:21:56.991
It happens to all chefs.

304
00:21:59.391 --> 00:22:02.701
I got it while training. I'm still training now.

305
00:22:03.502 --> 00:22:04.772
That's a relief.

306
00:22:07.641 --> 00:22:10.171
Why did you get this? "Salt"?

307
00:22:11.512 --> 00:22:13.481
Is it because you can't season without salt?

308
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:16.481
Did you know that your brain is the one recognizing taste?

309
00:22:16.782 --> 00:22:19.151
- I do. - When the brain finds salty taste,

310
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:21.721
it helps you taste the other tastes as well.

311
00:22:22.582 --> 00:22:24.322
I guess salt is a good guy.

312
00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:27.491
It helps other tastes to come alive along with it.

313
00:22:27.762 --> 00:22:29.461
Yes, it's a good guy.

314
00:22:35.401 --> 00:22:37.201
After my parents got divorced,

315
00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:41.701
I moved to France with Mom, and it was really tough.

316
00:22:45.042 --> 00:22:47.082
I was 16 years old then.

317
00:22:51.582 --> 00:22:52.951
I was really lonely.

318
00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:58.421
But I couldn't be broken.

319
00:23:01.322 --> 00:23:02.322
That's why...

320
00:23:06.362 --> 00:23:07.431
Why are you crying?

321
00:23:08.631 --> 00:23:09.631
I'm not crying.

322
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:27.181
I want to kiss you.

323
00:23:33.691 --> 00:23:35.592
You can dodge me if you don't want to.

324
00:23:45.372 --> 00:23:47.241
Come on!

325
00:23:48.042 --> 00:23:50.241
Did you think I wouldn't dodge you? You can't laugh after crying.

326
00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:51.941
You're so mean.

327
00:23:55.181 --> 00:23:56.282
Back then,

328
00:23:57.752 --> 00:23:58.881
I...

329
00:23:59.651 --> 00:24:01.522
was really nervous that you might dodge me.

330
00:24:03.622 --> 00:24:05.122
I was so happy you didn't.

331
00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:06.961
Then why did you do this to me?

332
00:24:07.262 --> 00:24:08.622
To make you laugh.

333
00:24:11.362 --> 00:24:13.701
We can start kissing now.

334
00:24:14.762 --> 00:24:16.802
Then I won't let you just do it.

335
00:24:17.671 --> 00:24:18.671
Fine.

336
00:24:19.032 --> 00:24:20.072
You can choose.

337
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:23.842
The teenage version, the 20s version, or the 30s version?

338
00:24:24.812 --> 00:24:26.441
I'll take all, and add a refrigerator kiss on top.

339
00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:52.552
(Temperature of Love)

340
00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:54.491
Is Mr. Park getting married?

341
00:26:54.491 --> 00:26:56.562
I think he had someone in his mind for a long time.

342
00:26:56.562 --> 00:27:00.161
There won't be any space for you to get in between them.

343
00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:01.602
Did Mom call you?

344
00:27:01.602 --> 00:27:04.032
When are you getting married? You should do it soon.

345
00:27:04.131 --> 00:27:06.842
Was it strange when I proposed to you before?

346
00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:08.971
There's no answer to such a thing.

347
00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:10.671
We need to change our relationship.

348
00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:13.441
Mr. Park's proposal will succeed thanks to this cake.

349
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:16.211
I have a girlfriend now. I want to introduce her to you.

350
00:27:16.211 --> 00:27:18.552
You can ask her to come on the day I propose.

351
00:27:18.911 --> 00:27:19.981
Let's meet together.
