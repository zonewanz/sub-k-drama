(Seo Ji An is not Choi Eun Seok)

6
00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:32.572
Gather around and smile. I'll take your photo.

7
00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:34.272
1, 2, 3.

8
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:37.681
Ji An, how did you get here?

9
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.212
Just a moment.

10
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:45.651
Congratulations, Ji Tae.

11
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:46.822
Congratulations to you too.

12
00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:48.191
Thank you for coming.

13
00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:49.791
How did you get here?

14
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.392
I stopped by on my way to the airport. I should go.

15
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:55.532
Mom. Dad. Bye.

16
00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:57.462
Seo Ji An.

17
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.231
Your hair looks nice.

18
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:02.672
You should do that all the time.

19
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:04.002
Bye now.

20
00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:05.301
Hey, but...

21
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:10.581
What was that? She left so fast.

22
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.851
At least, she made it for the picture.

23
00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.782
She tried indeed.

24
00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:24.806
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

25
00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:27.861
It's that way.

26
00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:30.702
What are you doing here? I told you to go ahead.

27
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.471
Let's go.

28
00:02:12.342 --> 00:02:13.671
Thank you.

29
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:16.981
I really appreciate...

30
00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:19.981
how you helped me...

31
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:23.881
to be there for my brother's wedding.

32
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:25.451
Like I said before,

33
00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:28.291
you're both victims.

34
00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:32.092
And this moment can never be brought back.

35
00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:37.631
Did Ji Soo tell you that Ji Tae's wedding was here?

36
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:43.272
So Ji Soo asked you for a favor.

37
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:45.541
Did you know...

38
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:47.471
that I met Ji Soo?

39
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:49.941
She never lies to me.

40
00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:52.951
When she brought me sandwiches,

41
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:55.812
she told me that she met you.

42
00:02:57.752 --> 00:02:59.622
Hop in. Are you going to work?

43
00:02:59.691 --> 00:03:01.752
I'll go on my own.

44
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:03.562
We could say we met for work.

45
00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:05.062
It's fine to go together.

46
00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:06.731
No.

47
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.701
I delayed your work to bring you here.

48
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.661
I'm giving you a ride so you can go back faster.

49
00:03:15.502 --> 00:03:16.541
Get in.

50
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:33.351
You're grateful and sorry,

51
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:36.661
and I brought you here in secret.

52
00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:38.821
I don't know what I'm doing.

53
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:42.362
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:44.701
Stop apologizing. Please.

55
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:57.541
What are you going to do?

56
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:00.752
What are you going to do...

57
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:02.652
when the day comes?

58
00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:06.951
I have never thought...

59
00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:09.221
about something like that.

60
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.462
You don't have a plan?

61
00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:14.962
I'm already busy...

62
00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:18.862
taking care of the anniversary event.

63
00:04:19.362 --> 00:04:22.002
That's already more than I can handle.

64
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:26.972
So I must ask you for one more favor.

65
00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:29.912
I'm going to stay at the night duty room...

66
00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:32.881
until the anniversary event is over.

67
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:34.451
You're going to sleep there?

68
00:04:34.982 --> 00:04:37.451
I need to get some sleep.

69
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.691
I go home after 1am and leave before 6am.

70
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:42.992
I was able to do it until now,

71
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:45.792
but I still have one more week left until the event.

72
00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:48.062
I see.

73
00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:50.961
That might be easier for you.

74
00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:53.472
Let's do that.

75
00:04:53.932 --> 00:04:57.441
I'll stop by later to get my clothes.

76
00:04:59.571 --> 00:05:01.372
I'll tell my parents...

77
00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:04.812
that you can't come home starting today.

78
00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:10.252
We'll get going now.

79
00:05:10.252 --> 00:05:11.252
Bye.

80
00:05:11.252 --> 00:05:12.821
Give me a call when you get there.

81
00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:15.451
Say hello to Soo A's parents.

82
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:17.162
Yes.

83
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:19.162
You're not single anymore.

84
00:05:19.162 --> 00:05:20.792
You must be happy. Thanks to your wife,

85
00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.562
you're going to Canada for your honeymoon.

86
00:05:22.862 --> 00:05:23.961
Be nice to her.

87
00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:26.472
- I know. - Be nice.

88
00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:28.631
- We'll leave now. - Okay. Bye.

89
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:30.372
- Have a nice trip. - Have a safe trip.

90
00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:32.302
Let's go.

91
00:05:36.812 --> 00:05:39.482
It's been a while since I saw him smiling.

92
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:44.581
They look great together.

93
00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:49.761
I'm going to have my wedding here too.

94
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:51.891
Wedding?

95
00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:53.292
What?

96
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:55.831
Have you saved up? Do you have at least 100 dollars?

97
00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:58.102
I'll start saving up from now on.

98
00:05:58.102 --> 00:06:00.901
And you don't need money to have a wedding here.

99
00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:03.372
I'll wear my dress and handwrite the invitations.

100
00:06:03.372 --> 00:06:06.102
I'll make the sandwiches and the cake myself.

101
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:09.812
Get a boyfriend first.

102
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.451
Won't I have someone some day?

103
00:06:16.651 --> 00:06:19.992
Someone who loves me so much like he does.

104
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.432
- Thank you. - Keep up the good work.

105
00:07:00.062 --> 00:07:02.191
Myung Shin, what brings you here?

106
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:03.562
I was in the area,

107
00:07:03.562 --> 00:07:06.102
so I was about to call you to see if we could meet.

108
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:09.331
But who is that guy?

109
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:13.711
I'll tell you if you have lunch with me.

110
00:07:13.711 --> 00:07:15.472
You still haven't had your lunch?

111
00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:16.841
I was busy.

112
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:18.412
I can only spare 30 minutes now.

113
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:20.612
- Let's go. - Okay.

114
00:07:23.182 --> 00:07:25.552
So you went to Ji Tae's wedding...

115
00:07:25.552 --> 00:07:28.321
with your new brother?

116
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:29.451
Yes.

117
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:34.232
But why were you staring at his car?

118
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:36.862
I was sorry for him.

119
00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:38.401
Sorry about what?

120
00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:39.901
How annoyed would he be?

121
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:43.441
He can't turn his back as I once was his sister.

122
00:07:44.502 --> 00:07:47.812
He'll let me finish the project as it's necessary,

123
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.081
but I broke his car to prevent the chairman...

124
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:52.711
from finding out that I'm not Choi Eun Seok.

125
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:55.812
Even though we're busy, he took me...

126
00:07:55.812 --> 00:07:58.052
to Ji Tae's wedding because Ji Soo asked so.

127
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:01.591
When I went to see the natural dye master,

128
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:03.591
I made him come all the way to the mountain.

129
00:08:05.722 --> 00:08:06.831
However,

130
00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:09.631
since I got Mr. Jung to help us with the project,

131
00:08:09.631 --> 00:08:11.102
he can't be angry at me.

132
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.571
He's very particular about where he eats,

133
00:08:14.872 --> 00:08:16.742
but he must have been starving...

134
00:08:17.672 --> 00:08:20.511
to have eaten soup that was cooked a week ago.

135
00:08:21.271 --> 00:08:23.711
The bean sprouts were saggy like threads,

136
00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:25.641
and the spring onions were mushy.

137
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:28.151
Ji An.

138
00:08:29.112 --> 00:08:30.682
Do you like him?

139
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.651
Who?

140
00:08:32.752 --> 00:08:34.352
The guy who used to be your brother.

141
00:08:34.352 --> 00:08:36.122
Ji Soo's real brother.

142
00:08:36.122 --> 00:08:38.021
The vice president that you stared at.

143
00:08:38.021 --> 00:08:40.891
The person you are constantly talking about.

144
00:08:41.232 --> 00:08:42.232
What?

145
00:08:43.602 --> 00:08:46.472
You're talking nonsense.

146
00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:50.171
I'm grateful and sorry. I feel shameful.

147
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:53.641
I can't believe myself...

148
00:08:55.442 --> 00:08:58.112
I can't stop myself from wishing to rely on him...

149
00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:00.651
despite my embarrassment.

150
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:04.852
I keep wishing things from him.

151
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.452
Like what?

152
00:09:08.151 --> 00:09:10.521
I hope he helps...

153
00:09:12.622 --> 00:09:14.192
my parents...

154
00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:17.901
to be exempted from going to prison.

155
00:09:19.301 --> 00:09:20.671
I want Mother and Father...

156
00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:22.901
No, I mean...

157
00:09:24.472 --> 00:09:28.072
I wish he can stop the vice chairman and Ms. No.

158
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:31.842
He will.

159
00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:34.852
I'm sure he has gotten to know you better now.

160
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:36.982
I'm not sure.

161
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.852
Since he belongs to the Haesung family,

162
00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:42.222
I am not so sure.

163
00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:46.692
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:47.332 --> 00:09:49.291
I had no idea.

165
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:52.761
Just because you stared at him so much,

166
00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:53.801
I was mistaken.

167
00:09:55.271 --> 00:09:58.171
I get it though. How could you think about love...

168
00:09:58.401 --> 00:10:00.141
given the situation you are in now?

169
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:21.332
Yes, I'm going to send a few antitheft items,

170
00:10:21.332 --> 00:10:23.332
steelmates, figures for license plates,

171
00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:25.761
cell phone holders, and waterproof covers.

172
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:27.102
I'll send them first.

173
00:10:27.972 --> 00:10:30.641
Yes, I asked for the best prices available here.

174
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:32.602
So try to come up with a good deal...

175
00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:34.171
with the distribution company there.

176
00:10:35.171 --> 00:10:38.641
Okay. I will send it by express mail right now.

177
00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:41.551
Thank you. Goodbye.

178
00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:47.521
Mom.

179
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:52.761
How did you find the restaurant?

180
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.891
Did Hae Ja tell you?

181
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:57.631
I asked her.

182
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:01.002
I should know where you work. I'm your daughter.

183
00:11:01.472 --> 00:11:03.872
Why didn't you call me that you were coming?

184
00:11:04.972 --> 00:11:06.771
The restaurant seems like a clean, nice place.

185
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:09.072
I'm busy. You should go.

186
00:11:09.072 --> 00:11:10.112
Boss.

187
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:12.612
I think we need to order more vegetables.

188
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.482
"Boss"?

189
00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:17.781
Okay. You should get back to work.

190
00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:18.822
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:11:18.952 --> 00:11:21.322
Mom, is this restaurant yours?

192
00:11:23.021 --> 00:11:24.092
Well...

193
00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:26.592
This is...

194
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:30.202
a franchised restaurant of Haesung Corporation.

195
00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:33.102
A franchised restaurant of Haesung Corporation?

196
00:11:35.602 --> 00:11:37.872
Ji An's parents gave you this?

197
00:11:38.872 --> 00:11:39.942
Yes.

198
00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:43.181
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner.

199
00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:46.811
But I had my reasons for keeping it a secret.

200
00:11:49.352 --> 00:11:50.521
I see.

201
00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:54.122
This paints me in a bad light, doesn't it?

202
00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:55.891
I look shameless, don't I?

203
00:11:57.761 --> 00:11:59.891
Ji An is taking care of you even after she left.

204
00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:02.061
But I am your real daughter.

205
00:12:02.862 --> 00:12:05.801
Ji Soo, don't think that way.

206
00:12:05.901 --> 00:12:09.332
Mom, then I will help you after I finish work.

207
00:12:09.801 --> 00:12:11.842
The headquarters dispatch employees.

208
00:12:11.842 --> 00:12:13.372
Not anyone can just work here.

209
00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:15.072
That's all right. You should go now.

210
00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:17.541
Go meet your friends on your day off.

211
00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.442
Why did you come here? Come on, get going now.

212
00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:21.112
You should leave now, okay? I'm busy.

213
00:12:21.982 --> 00:12:23.151
Go on.

214
00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:27.092
The vice chairman is home.

215
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:35.362
You're home.

216
00:12:35.732 --> 00:12:36.732
Yes.

217
00:12:41.872 --> 00:12:44.342
What is it? Do you have something to say?

218
00:12:44.342 --> 00:12:46.041
Was her name Jo Soon Ok?

219
00:12:46.342 --> 00:12:48.742
The woman who took Eun Seok 25 years ago...

220
00:12:48.842 --> 00:12:50.511
and who helped us find Eun Seok.

221
00:12:51.612 --> 00:12:54.082
You said you gave them one million dollars.

222
00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:57.082
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

223
00:12:57.082 --> 00:12:58.352
Why did you just dismiss them?

224
00:12:58.352 --> 00:13:00.021
You should have at least gotten their address.

225
00:13:00.992 --> 00:13:03.061
Why are you bringing that up now?

226
00:13:03.061 --> 00:13:04.962
That might cause trouble again.

227
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:06.462
That's not like you.

228
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:09.531
You're the one who isn't acting like yourself.

229
00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:11.202
I said I took care of it.

230
00:13:12.801 --> 00:13:14.171
Do you think I would have let them...

231
00:13:14.332 --> 00:13:17.301
cause any trouble after I gave them one million?

232
00:13:18.141 --> 00:13:21.372
Then you probably don't know where they are now.

233
00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:25.181
They must be somewhere far away from me.

234
00:13:26.852 --> 00:13:27.952
I see.

235
00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:36.092
Is that all you have for me?

236
00:13:36.192 --> 00:13:37.322
Yes.

237
00:13:44.732 --> 00:13:46.332
What's gotten into him?

238
00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:48.702
I'm home.

239
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:51.502
At the company?

240
00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:54.411
As you know, this is an important event.

241
00:13:54.572 --> 00:13:56.482
Her work ends at nine.

242
00:13:56.482 --> 00:13:58.082
After she wraps it up and has dinner,

243
00:13:58.082 --> 00:14:00.982
she won't get much sleep at home.

244
00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:03.381
Are you referring to the room we made...

245
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:05.452
for the designers when they work all night?

246
00:14:05.452 --> 00:14:07.122
I told her to stay there...

247
00:14:07.122 --> 00:14:08.822
until the event is over.

248
00:14:09.092 --> 00:14:10.291
It's more comfortable...

249
00:14:10.291 --> 00:14:12.622
to sleep in her room even if it's for a short time.

250
00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:15.031
Eun Seok agreed with me.

251
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:16.301
There's a shower there as well.

252
00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:18.901
Tell her to do so then.

253
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:20.401
Her lack of sleep...

254
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.732
shouldn't cause problems at the anniversary event.

255
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:26.271
Let's give her a 10-day vacation...

256
00:14:26.271 --> 00:14:28.041
after the event, Do Kyung.

257
00:14:28.112 --> 00:14:29.641
Take care of her.

258
00:14:30.242 --> 00:14:33.582
Okay. I'll tell Ga Eun to pack Ji An's clothes.

259
00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:42.452
Mom, you're home.

260
00:14:42.452 --> 00:14:43.761
Aren't you tired?

261
00:14:44.122 --> 00:14:45.161
Not at all.

262
00:14:52.362 --> 00:14:54.531
Mom, what's that look on your face?

263
00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:57.401
It's the face you put on when you scold me.

264
00:14:57.742 --> 00:14:59.141
No, I'm not here for that.

265
00:14:59.401 --> 00:15:01.011
I came because I had to talk with you.

266
00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:02.942
Talk with me? What is it?

267
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:04.511
Ji Soo.

268
00:15:05.311 --> 00:15:06.681
Go study abroad.

269
00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:07.811
Study abroad?

270
00:15:08.281 --> 00:15:09.881
Mom, what do you mean?

271
00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:12.252
I researched a bit.

272
00:15:13.151 --> 00:15:14.752
You can't go to a French pastry school...

273
00:15:14.752 --> 00:15:16.992
because you would need to learn French.

274
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:19.732
I heard there are pastry schools in Canada too.

275
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:21.661
You want to send me abroad with the money...

276
00:15:21.661 --> 00:15:23.332
you earned at the restaurant?

277
00:15:23.602 --> 00:15:24.862
That's part of it.

278
00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:28.572
Your dad is starting a new business too.

279
00:15:28.572 --> 00:15:31.171
Dad told me the same. Now, you too?

280
00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:33.612
I already told Dad.

281
00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:35.141
I don't need to study abroad.

282
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:37.181
I just want to learn from Mr. Baker.

283
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:39.181
It'd be better to learn how to bake from abroad...

284
00:15:39.181 --> 00:15:41.212
since bread baking is a foreign technique.

285
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:45.082
Mom. I'm even scared of going to Itaewon...

286
00:15:45.082 --> 00:15:47.891
because foreigners might talk to me.

287
00:15:48.122 --> 00:15:50.822
I can't speak a word of English. No way.

288
00:15:50.891 --> 00:15:52.561
I don't want to do that. Never.

289
00:15:53.832 --> 00:15:55.332
Just think about it.

290
00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:15.181
This is comfortable.

291
00:16:20.952 --> 00:16:23.761
(Haesung Corporation)

292
00:16:35.131 --> 00:16:36.131
Here.

293
00:16:36.742 --> 00:16:38.271
I asked Ga Eun to pack it for you.

294
00:16:39.202 --> 00:16:41.242
Okay. Thank you.

295
00:16:41.242 --> 00:16:43.181
I got permission from my parents.

296
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:44.582
You should at least text them.

297
00:16:45.082 --> 00:16:46.181
I will.

298
00:16:48.511 --> 00:16:50.082
Wait.

299
00:16:57.561 --> 00:16:59.832
Here's the necklace you gave me...

300
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:03.232
and the money I got left after paying student loan.

301
00:17:03.662 --> 00:17:05.761
I'm sorry I spent it.

302
00:17:08.702 --> 00:17:10.071
You don't have to talk about the money.

303
00:17:10.702 --> 00:17:13.742
Let's just say I sponsored you.

304
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:16.811
As for the necklace...

305
00:17:18.882 --> 00:17:20.611
I gave it to you as my little sister,

306
00:17:21.412 --> 00:17:23.252
so I guess I should get it back.

307
00:17:24.452 --> 00:17:26.621
I was too busy to get it fixed.

308
00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:28.051
I am sorry.

309
00:17:28.992 --> 00:17:30.821
And I will make sure to pay back the money...

310
00:17:31.561 --> 00:17:34.892
I spent for my student loan.

311
00:17:38.162 --> 00:17:40.571
Okay. You can do that.

312
00:17:53.511 --> 00:17:55.081
Are you not going to eat breakfast?

313
00:17:55.311 --> 00:17:57.722
I need to leave early and do something.

314
00:17:58.422 --> 00:18:02.091
I got you 1,500 dollars for this month's expenses.

315
00:18:03.922 --> 00:18:05.222
Have a good day.

316
00:18:07.061 --> 00:18:09.232
He should've had breakfast.

317
00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:13.902
Who is it?

318
00:18:15.632 --> 00:18:17.101
- Hello. - Hello.

319
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:18.371
Here's the food you ordered.

320
00:18:18.371 --> 00:18:21.172
Thank you.

321
00:18:22.712 --> 00:18:25.011
- Did you order food? - Yes.

322
00:18:25.382 --> 00:18:28.652
Soo A is here, but I am too busy to cook.

323
00:18:28.652 --> 00:18:30.821
So I've decided to order the side dishes.

324
00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:35.392
That means I don't have to cook anymore.

325
00:18:36.152 --> 00:18:37.561
I was too busy anyway.

326
00:18:41.831 --> 00:18:42.831
It's delicious.

327
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:46.301
Did you think about what I told you yesterday?

328
00:18:46.301 --> 00:18:49.031
Mom, don't you know me?

329
00:18:49.031 --> 00:18:50.841
Have you seen me doing something I hate?

330
00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:53.212
This is good by the way.

331
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:07.192
- Ji Soo, come here. - Okay.

332
00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:11.861
Is castella the new menu?

333
00:19:12.591 --> 00:19:14.232
- Try it. - Okay.

334
00:19:17.831 --> 00:19:20.672
It's castella-like loaf.

335
00:19:21.672 --> 00:19:22.771
It's delicious.

336
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:27.311
How is it delicious? Explain to me.

337
00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:29.882
It's soft.

338
00:19:30.182 --> 00:19:32.611
It has the subtle flavor of whipped cream.

339
00:19:32.882 --> 00:19:34.712
I think it would make a great meal.

340
00:19:34.712 --> 00:19:36.152
Anyway, it's good.

341
00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:39.591
You say you're a baker, and yet, you're vague.

342
00:19:40.922 --> 00:19:43.892
Take this to the cafe, and ask what they think.

343
00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.732
The cafe?

344
00:19:47.531 --> 00:19:50.002
But Mr. Sun might be there.

345
00:19:50.702 --> 00:19:53.432
He will get wrong ideas if I keep taking things.

346
00:19:53.472 --> 00:19:56.301
I want to hear people's opinions on...

347
00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:57.702
our new bread.

348
00:19:57.702 --> 00:19:59.301
How can you let your feelings get...

349
00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:01.472
- in the way of... - That shouldn't happen.

350
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:03.242
I should go.

351
00:20:06.212 --> 00:20:08.252
And he's not Mr. Sun. He's Mr. Sunwoo.

352
00:20:08.252 --> 00:20:11.521
What? He's not Mr. Sun. He's Mr. Sunwoo.

353
00:20:12.051 --> 00:20:13.892
But his name is Sun Woo Hyuk.

354
00:20:14.222 --> 00:20:16.821
His name is Sunwoo.

355
00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:18.462
I mean...

356
00:20:18.462 --> 00:20:22.261
His last name is Sunwoo, and his name is Hyuk.

357
00:20:23.202 --> 00:20:24.531
Sunwoo Hyuk?

358
00:20:25.101 --> 00:20:26.132
Sunwoo...

359
00:20:28.972 --> 00:20:31.442
Like Dokgo, Namgoong...

360
00:20:32.672 --> 00:20:34.912
So his last name was Sunwoo.

361
00:20:37.182 --> 00:20:39.412
How did you know this by the way?

362
00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:44.621
The bread is going to get cold. Hurry up.

363
00:20:48.252 --> 00:20:49.662
Sunwoo Hyuk.

364
00:20:55.232 --> 00:20:56.301
You're here.

365
00:20:56.962 --> 00:20:58.232
Hello.

366
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:00.672
You're both here.

367
00:21:02.732 --> 00:21:05.172
- Hello, ma'am. - Welcome.

368
00:21:05.242 --> 00:21:06.672
What is that?

369
00:21:07.041 --> 00:21:08.742
It's our new menu.

370
00:21:08.742 --> 00:21:12.212
My boss asked for your opinion.

371
00:21:12.212 --> 00:21:15.152
Our baker asked for it.

372
00:21:15.152 --> 00:21:18.121
I am curious. Your bread is delicious.

373
00:21:18.452 --> 00:21:19.621
One second.

374
00:21:25.521 --> 00:21:27.232
Can I try it too?

375
00:21:28.492 --> 00:21:29.632
What?

376
00:21:30.132 --> 00:21:32.331
You only asked her to taste it.

377
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:35.571
Oh, I did.

378
00:21:36.841 --> 00:21:38.172
Have a seat.

379
00:21:44.882 --> 00:21:47.212
You can just eat it with a fork.

380
00:21:48.652 --> 00:21:51.351
Mr. Sunwoo and I...

381
00:21:51.351 --> 00:21:53.321
are not a big fan of bread.

382
00:21:53.321 --> 00:21:54.892
We can't digest it well.

383
00:21:55.321 --> 00:21:57.261
But your bread doesn't upset my stomach.

384
00:21:59.462 --> 00:22:01.232
It's delicious. It's soft.

385
00:22:04.232 --> 00:22:05.962
It would be perfect for breakfast.

386
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:08.732
Thank you.

387
00:22:09.472 --> 00:22:11.742
By the way, if you don't mind me asking,

388
00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:13.972
how old are you, Ji Soo?

389
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:16.882
Isn't it rude to ask a lady's age?

390
00:22:17.412 --> 00:22:19.311
No, it's okay.

391
00:22:19.551 --> 00:22:21.882
I am 28 years old.

392
00:22:22.412 --> 00:22:25.882
My goodness. You two are the same age.

393
00:22:26.422 --> 00:22:27.692
Are you the same age as me?

394
00:22:28.392 --> 00:22:29.992
I thought you were much younger than me.

395
00:22:30.922 --> 00:22:33.162
I am a little immature.

396
00:22:34.462 --> 00:22:35.892
So we are the same age.

397
00:22:36.662 --> 00:22:39.331
We could be friends.

398
00:22:40.831 --> 00:22:42.002
What?

399
00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:54.051
Friends.

400
00:22:56.152 --> 00:22:57.351
That's nice.

401
00:22:59.452 --> 00:23:03.021
I at least get to become friends with him now.

402
00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:04.521
Why? What is it?

403
00:23:05.422 --> 00:23:07.761
Did she say it was bad?

404
00:23:08.232 --> 00:23:09.601
What did she say about it?

405
00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:12.732
Of course she liked it. You made it.

406
00:23:15.732 --> 00:23:17.742
In what ways did she say it was delicious?

407
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:20.172
She said it was soft,

408
00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:23.811
and it had the subtle flavor of whipped cream.

409
00:23:24.412 --> 00:23:26.351
She said it would be perfect as a meal.

410
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:29.551
That's exactly the comment I was looking for.

411
00:23:30.222 --> 00:23:32.992
It's exactly what I said a while ago.

412
00:23:39.992 --> 00:23:42.232
Mr. Jo will take charge of the retro section.

413
00:23:42.232 --> 00:23:44.831
Ms. Yang will be in charge of the flee market.

414
00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:46.531
Mr. Song will be in charge of hand printing.

415
00:23:46.531 --> 00:23:48.472
Ms. Yoon will be in charge of the fashion show.

416
00:23:48.472 --> 00:23:50.371
Mr. Woo will be in charge of the concert.

417
00:23:50.371 --> 00:23:53.142
And I will be in charge of the natural dye workshop.

418
00:23:53.142 --> 00:23:56.142
I will go back and forth the office and the event.

419
00:23:56.482 --> 00:23:59.611
You should make sure it's hygienic and safe.

420
00:23:59.882 --> 00:24:00.882
Yes.

421
00:24:00.882 --> 00:24:03.781
Are you ready for the opening event?

422
00:24:03.781 --> 00:24:05.551
I just need to inform the press...

423
00:24:05.551 --> 00:24:07.252
and the film crew.

424
00:24:07.952 --> 00:24:09.962
Please recheck everything...

425
00:24:09.962 --> 00:24:12.021
so that your hard work won't be wasted.

426
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:14.761
I will see you tomorrow at the convention hall.

427
00:24:15.031 --> 00:24:16.031
Dismissed.

428
00:24:16.831 --> 00:24:19.061
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

429
00:24:23.002 --> 00:24:26.511
I took care of it. Do you think I would let them...

430
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:28.212
think about causing trouble again...

431
00:24:28.212 --> 00:24:29.581
after getting paid a million dollars?

432
00:24:37.952 --> 00:24:39.051
(Vice Chairman)

433
00:24:43.321 --> 00:24:44.462
Yes, sir.

434
00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:47.761
Ms. Min, please come to my office right now.

435
00:24:48.091 --> 00:24:49.831
Right now?

436
00:24:49.831 --> 00:24:51.561
I will send the driver. Take the car.

437
00:24:52.462 --> 00:24:55.432
Ms. Seo, how is everything going?

438
00:24:56.101 --> 00:24:58.502
I contacted the press, and they released...

439
00:24:58.502 --> 00:25:00.442
the article about Mr. Jung's workshop.

440
00:25:00.442 --> 00:25:02.811
And the advertisements on social media...

441
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:04.382
are all going as planned.

442
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:06.482
The vice chairman is particularly...

443
00:25:06.482 --> 00:25:07.752
interested in Mr. Jung.

444
00:25:07.752 --> 00:25:08.912
So take care of him well.

445
00:25:08.912 --> 00:25:10.982
I prepared a penthouse at Hotel MJ.

446
00:25:10.982 --> 00:25:12.121
I also sent him a car.

447
00:25:12.121 --> 00:25:13.192
Okay.

448
00:25:13.192 --> 00:25:14.892
Are we all ready then?

449
00:25:14.892 --> 00:25:18.591
Yes, at 3, they will start decorating the venue.

450
00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:20.932
You just need to check the progress then.

451
00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:22.492
Good job.

452
00:25:22.492 --> 00:25:23.702
Sir.

453
00:25:24.101 --> 00:25:27.371
Can I take a nap until 3pm?

454
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:28.871
Go ahead.

455
00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:30.442
It's going to be tiring until tomorrow.

456
00:25:30.442 --> 00:25:32.202
You should get some sleep too, Ji An.

457
00:25:32.202 --> 00:25:34.271
I will check the woods and sleep.

458
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:39.882
Hello?

459
00:25:39.882 --> 00:25:41.111
Hyuk, it's me, Ji An.

460
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:42.922
I called to inquire about the wood pillars.

461
00:25:43.252 --> 00:25:46.021
You need them at the venue before 3pm, right?

462
00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:47.952
I am taking them to Incheon right now.

463
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:49.561
Why Incheon?

464
00:25:49.662 --> 00:25:52.261
I have to go there to pick up our wood,

465
00:25:52.261 --> 00:25:54.432
and 3pm seemed too tight.

466
00:25:54.432 --> 00:25:57.632
So I will drop yours off on my way back.

467
00:25:57.962 --> 00:25:59.031
I'll go with you.

468
00:25:59.732 --> 00:26:00.801
With me?

469
00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:15.412
Do you have time to go to Incheon?

470
00:26:15.752 --> 00:26:19.021
They'll start decorating the venue at 3pm.

471
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:32.662
I have a question for you.

472
00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:36.972
You must know why I am asking you here.

473
00:26:37.442 --> 00:26:38.672
I will remember that.

474
00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:40.371
Where is Jo Soon Ok?

475
00:26:41.912 --> 00:26:43.912
- Sir? - Jo Soon Ok.

476
00:26:44.642 --> 00:26:46.482
When we were looking for Eun Seok,

477
00:26:46.482 --> 00:26:48.511
you went with Mr. No to meet her.

478
00:26:48.882 --> 00:26:50.952
I don't know where she is now.

479
00:26:50.952 --> 00:26:52.821
Don't you know her address?

480
00:26:52.821 --> 00:26:54.521
I want to meet her.

481
00:26:54.652 --> 00:26:56.861
They left right away.

482
00:26:57.992 --> 00:26:59.591
Do you think Mr. No doesn't know?

483
00:27:00.192 --> 00:27:01.791
As you know,

484
00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:04.732
Mr. No is not clumsy.

485
00:27:07.932 --> 00:27:09.031
Well.

486
00:27:10.301 --> 00:27:13.271
You got toothbrushes to get a DNA sample.

487
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:15.942
How did you confirm that it was Eun Seok's?

488
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:19.551
There were two toothbrushes.

489
00:27:19.682 --> 00:27:20.811
Two?

490
00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:21.882
Yes.

491
00:27:22.811 --> 00:27:25.422
Then how did you confirm that Ji An is Eun Seok?

492
00:27:25.482 --> 00:27:27.222
I was outside,

493
00:27:27.551 --> 00:27:29.291
and Ms. No went straight from Jo's house...

494
00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:32.162
to Mr. Seo's house.

495
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:34.791
She met with Ms. Yang...

496
00:27:35.331 --> 00:27:37.601
and got convinced.

497
00:27:37.662 --> 00:27:40.071
There was no additional DNA test?

498
00:27:40.071 --> 00:27:42.371
From my understanding, there was none.

499
00:27:48.442 --> 00:27:50.281
This is the last one.

500
00:27:50.682 --> 00:27:52.611
Get the last one.

501
00:27:54.712 --> 00:27:56.521
Any freebies?

502
00:27:56.521 --> 00:27:59.422
You're getting better each day, Mr. Sunwoo.

503
00:27:59.422 --> 00:28:01.291
The last one is the freebie.

504
00:28:02.351 --> 00:28:03.922
You don't get fooled now.

505
00:28:03.922 --> 00:28:06.331
Don't be silly in front of the beautiful lady.

506
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:07.561
Get going now.

507
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:10.561
I've known him for over three years,

508
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:12.462
and he's never brought his girlfriend here.

509
00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:14.672
- I.. - It's because she's not.

510
00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:20.511
Sunwoo, you're good at manual labor.

511
00:28:20.511 --> 00:28:22.611
I've been doing this once a year for years.

512
00:28:22.611 --> 00:28:25.081
But you studied interior design.

513
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:26.311
How did you end up doing this?

514
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:28.551
I never knew you wanted to become an entrepreneur.

515
00:28:28.551 --> 00:28:30.281
I don't want to become an entrepreneur.

516
00:28:30.281 --> 00:28:32.422
I enjoyed it, and that made me get this far.

517
00:28:32.422 --> 00:28:33.422
You enjoy it?

518
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:36.492
You run business for fun?

519
00:28:36.492 --> 00:28:38.692
Can't we talk about it while we eat?

520
00:28:38.692 --> 00:28:40.761
There's a nice restaurant nearby.

521
00:28:45.162 --> 00:28:46.271
I said I wanted to grab lunch.

522
00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:47.831
Why did you barge into my office?

523
00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:49.841
I already have a lunch appointment.

524
00:28:49.841 --> 00:28:51.172
I can't stay.

525
00:28:51.642 --> 00:28:54.142
What do you mean? Is something wrong?

526
00:28:54.142 --> 00:28:55.712
You're the one who's done something.

527
00:28:55.712 --> 00:28:56.712
Me?

528
00:28:56.712 --> 00:28:58.442
You asked me to hire someone.

529
00:28:58.642 --> 00:28:59.882
A 28-year-old lady...

530
00:28:59.882 --> 00:29:01.412
who majored in business management.

531
00:29:01.482 --> 00:29:03.452
Don't misunderstand me.

532
00:29:03.452 --> 00:29:06.081
She's the woman who you owed 20,000 dollars to.

533
00:29:06.851 --> 00:29:09.091
After you called, I thought about it.

534
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:11.761
After you decided on your engagement,

535
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:14.492
you've been keeping away from women.

536
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:17.101
The only new girl in your life...

537
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:18.761
is that 20,000-dollar lady.

538
00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:21.132
I told you not to misunderstand me.

539
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.942
You asked for a shopper for her, didn't you?

540
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:28.271
Gi Jae, your imagination is reasonable,

541
00:29:28.341 --> 00:29:30.142
but it's not as simple as that.

542
00:29:30.281 --> 00:29:31.742
I won't explain it to you,

543
00:29:31.742 --> 00:29:34.252
and you shouldn't have come here for that.

544
00:29:34.252 --> 00:29:36.011
But you did ask me to hire someone.

545
00:29:36.111 --> 00:29:37.652
It's very unlike you.

546
00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:40.892
I just want her to have a decent job.

547
00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:43.621
She keeps bothering me.

548
00:29:44.422 --> 00:29:45.962
If I give her a good position,

549
00:29:46.462 --> 00:29:47.992
will you feel at ease?

550
00:29:48.591 --> 00:29:49.761
Then I will do it.

551
00:29:51.331 --> 00:29:52.331
Please do it.

552
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:56.871
I heard your fiancee...

553
00:29:57.142 --> 00:29:59.642
is coming to Korea for a family event.

554
00:29:59.642 --> 00:30:01.841
Is she? When next week?

555
00:30:02.341 --> 00:30:03.742
I made furniture...

556
00:30:03.912 --> 00:30:06.111
and decorated the house of my two friends,

557
00:30:06.111 --> 00:30:08.051
and other friends asked too.

558
00:30:08.051 --> 00:30:09.521
That's when I started charging them.

559
00:30:09.521 --> 00:30:11.152
Was that the beginning?

560
00:30:11.652 --> 00:30:14.392
Our generation likes decorating our homes.

561
00:30:14.452 --> 00:30:16.321
We know the importance of space.

562
00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:18.162
That's fascinating.

563
00:30:18.321 --> 00:30:21.591
I thought you started with a business plan.

564
00:30:21.591 --> 00:30:22.692
A business plan?

565
00:30:23.702 --> 00:30:25.531
Life never works out the way you plan it.

566
00:30:25.932 --> 00:30:27.672
Having no plan is my plan.

567
00:30:28.101 --> 00:30:30.841
When I hated going to the wood workshop,

568
00:30:30.841 --> 00:30:32.341
you got me going.

569
00:30:32.841 --> 00:30:35.912
I didn't want to lose to a girl, so I tried harder.

570
00:30:36.242 --> 00:30:38.412
Then I fell in love with wood.

571
00:30:38.811 --> 00:30:40.511
But we were young then.

572
00:30:40.581 --> 00:30:41.712
Right. There's more.

573
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:43.781
You and I had a plan.

574
00:30:44.152 --> 00:30:46.192
We planned to study at Hongik University...

575
00:30:46.192 --> 00:30:47.821
and go abroad to study.

576
00:30:48.021 --> 00:30:49.821
But you ended up majoring in management,

577
00:30:49.821 --> 00:30:52.422
and I went to college that offered me a scholarship.

578
00:30:52.462 --> 00:30:53.761
Scholarship?

579
00:30:54.132 --> 00:30:56.162
My dad was a carpenter...

580
00:30:56.162 --> 00:30:57.861
who was always drunk, you know.

581
00:31:00.002 --> 00:31:02.402
Your profile says you went to Youngmin University.

582
00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:03.742
I transferred.

583
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:08.742
I did everything for a year.

584
00:31:11.382 --> 00:31:12.642
I see.

585
00:31:13.581 --> 00:31:15.752
You don't have to pity me like that.

586
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:18.121
I only did part-time jobs that I enjoyed.

587
00:31:18.452 --> 00:31:20.091
I am jealous of you.

588
00:31:21.752 --> 00:31:23.422
Do you live with your dad now?

589
00:31:23.422 --> 00:31:25.291
Dad lives by himself.

590
00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:27.132
I live in a shared house with my sister.

591
00:31:27.162 --> 00:31:28.531
In a shared house?

592
00:31:29.601 --> 00:31:32.301
The person who invested in it is very rich.

593
00:31:32.301 --> 00:31:34.432
He wants to have fun and make money,

594
00:31:34.432 --> 00:31:35.732
so he does strange things.

595
00:31:36.442 --> 00:31:39.202
Isn't your sister married?

596
00:31:40.212 --> 00:31:41.942
I am sorry.

597
00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:45.412
My sister, who is 12 years older than me,

598
00:31:45.412 --> 00:31:46.882
got divorced five years ago,

599
00:31:46.882 --> 00:31:48.652
and now, she's under my protection.

600
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:52.222
You seem so mature.

601
00:31:55.422 --> 00:31:57.662
Don't you just love this place?

602
00:31:57.662 --> 00:31:58.761
Isn't it delicious?

603
00:31:58.821 --> 00:31:59.861
Very delicious.

604
00:32:00.531 --> 00:32:02.531
You never used to eat this well before.

605
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:04.531
Right?

606
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:07.202
Strangely, I eat a lot when I am with you.

607
00:32:09.702 --> 00:32:10.771
After we eat,

608
00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:12.702
let's drink coffee at the seawall.

609
00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:14.071
The view is nice.

610
00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:16.611
I don't have time for that.

611
00:32:16.611 --> 00:32:18.142
I can't be late to the event.

612
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:24.321
I love I got to see the ocean.

613
00:32:24.652 --> 00:32:27.192
I think it's been about seven years.

614
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:28.791
Then we should come back again.

615
00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:30.121
You can see it again on the way back.

616
00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:38.502
Can you wait a week?

617
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:43.271
I know how strange I was...

618
00:32:43.271 --> 00:32:45.242
and how much I worried you.

619
00:32:45.902 --> 00:32:47.341
And I feel sorry about that.

620
00:32:48.942 --> 00:32:51.642
It would've been nice if I've been honest.

621
00:32:53.081 --> 00:32:54.382
But now,

622
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:57.482
I don't have the strength to talk about that.

623
00:32:59.382 --> 00:33:01.922
I have to use all my energy on this event.

624
00:33:02.752 --> 00:33:04.261
Okay. Do that.

625
00:33:05.722 --> 00:33:06.761
Thank you.

626
00:33:14.972 --> 00:33:16.571
This way.

627
00:33:21.912 --> 00:33:24.781
You can leave them here.

628
00:33:26.351 --> 00:33:28.611
Please move those here.

629
00:33:29.051 --> 00:33:30.581
This place is huge.

630
00:33:33.722 --> 00:33:36.521
This way, please.

631
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:37.922
Are those the wood pillars?

632
00:33:43.632 --> 00:33:46.002
They will be installed here and there.

633
00:33:46.002 --> 00:33:47.402
- Here and there? - Yes.

634
00:33:52.242 --> 00:33:54.611
Ji An, I'll get going now. Call me.

635
00:33:55.912 --> 00:33:57.142
Gosh.

636
00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:04.081
Was he the one...

637
00:34:04.952 --> 00:34:06.081
making the wood pillars?

638
00:34:10.661 --> 00:34:11.991
She said she severed all the connections.

639
00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:15.931
She must be preparing to go back to her life.

640
00:34:31.842 --> 00:34:32.982
You're back.

641
00:34:32.982 --> 00:34:35.482
Yes. Your coffee was indeed very nice.

642
00:34:35.882 --> 00:34:38.382
I'll drink vanilla latte today.

643
00:34:40.552 --> 00:34:41.592
Latte, please.

644
00:34:42.422 --> 00:34:44.391
Okay.

645
00:34:51.732 --> 00:34:52.831
Thank you.

646
00:34:54.931 --> 00:34:56.201
Enjoy.

647
00:35:01.512 --> 00:35:03.012
Do you live in this neighborhood?

648
00:35:04.482 --> 00:35:07.282
I have a business nearby.

649
00:35:11.252 --> 00:35:12.322
By the way,

650
00:35:13.121 --> 00:35:15.521
you didn't coffee before, did you?

651
00:35:16.862 --> 00:35:18.161
When is before?

652
00:35:18.692 --> 00:35:20.192
Oh, that time.

653
00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:23.762
Many years have passed.

654
00:35:25.002 --> 00:35:27.771
By the way,

655
00:35:28.201 --> 00:35:30.842
how do you still remember that time?

656
00:35:32.802 --> 00:35:36.041
I have a good memory for no reason.

657
00:35:37.541 --> 00:35:40.112
You open at 11am...

658
00:35:40.112 --> 00:35:41.752
and close at 10pm, right?

659
00:35:43.322 --> 00:35:44.382
Yes.

660
00:35:44.382 --> 00:35:46.451
How can you manage your family life?

661
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:49.561
You work alone at the cafe for 11 hours.

662
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:51.922
Why would you work like a manual laborer...

663
00:35:51.922 --> 00:35:53.161
for your hobby?

664
00:35:54.232 --> 00:35:57.632
Working at a cafe is not manual labor.

665
00:35:57.632 --> 00:35:58.762
Is it not?

666
00:35:59.061 --> 00:36:00.902
- It's not. - All right then.

667
00:36:03.342 --> 00:36:06.311
The coffee got cold while talking.

668
00:36:09.141 --> 00:36:10.712
I will make a new one.

669
00:36:14.081 --> 00:36:15.382
Thank you.

670
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:27.362
Please get me a cup of coffee, ma'am.

671
00:36:37.641 --> 00:36:40.041
You should hire another person.

672
00:36:40.041 --> 00:36:42.442
I will go somewhere else to learn to bake.

673
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:45.112
Ji Soo.

674
00:36:48.152 --> 00:36:50.322
Mr. Baker, what's wrong?

675
00:36:51.482 --> 00:36:53.192
- I need some milk. - Are you all right?

676
00:36:53.192 --> 00:36:55.092
- I just have heartburn. - Oh my gosh.

677
00:36:56.592 --> 00:36:59.661
Get me organic milk.

678
00:37:04.232 --> 00:37:06.471
Why didn't I think about this before?

679
00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:15.641
No one would recognize me, right?

680
00:37:33.032 --> 00:37:36.161
It's going to be dangerous if you hold me like that.

681
00:37:40.331 --> 00:37:41.572
The breeze is gentle, isn't it?

682
00:37:42.701 --> 00:37:46.371
It is nice, but we're star-crossed lovers.

683
00:37:46.371 --> 00:37:47.741
We can't expect more.

684
00:37:47.942 --> 00:37:48.971
I know.

685
00:37:49.911 --> 00:37:52.641
You should stop once I say no. Okay?

686
00:37:53.152 --> 00:37:54.552
Anytime.

687
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:01.521
My gosh.

688
00:38:10.502 --> 00:38:11.632
Were you startled?

689
00:38:12.362 --> 00:38:13.871
You did that on purpose.

690
00:38:22.112 --> 00:38:24.141
While we ride a bike together,

691
00:38:24.141 --> 00:38:26.141
just listen to music without thinking.

692
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:52.971
Hello? This is Seo Ji Ho speaking.

693
00:38:54.212 --> 00:38:56.041
Where is it?

694
00:38:57.141 --> 00:38:58.181
Hongdae?

695
00:38:59.141 --> 00:39:02.252
No thanks. College students never tip.

696
00:39:02.451 --> 00:39:05.282
I won't go unless it's in Gangnam.

697
00:39:05.282 --> 00:39:08.652
It's urgent as the waiters there quit without notice.

698
00:39:08.891 --> 00:39:10.291
You'll be paid for the day though.

699
00:39:10.791 --> 00:39:14.192
I'll double your pay. Just come with me, okay?

700
00:39:15.391 --> 00:39:16.502
Double pay?

701
00:39:27.672 --> 00:39:30.541
It was fun. I didn't know riding a bike was so fun.

702
00:39:31.342 --> 00:39:33.811
- Let's go then. - To where?

703
00:39:33.811 --> 00:39:35.782
We'll go to a drive-in movie theater.

704
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:37.752
A drive-in theater?

705
00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:40.092
You haven't been to a theater with a man before.

706
00:39:40.092 --> 00:39:42.752
It'd be safer in a drive-in theater.

707
00:39:42.891 --> 00:39:44.692
Are we going to watch a movie in a car?

708
00:39:44.991 --> 00:39:46.862
I hate being in a confined space.

709
00:39:47.532 --> 00:39:49.802
I can push the seat back if you want.

710
00:39:50.002 --> 00:39:51.161
Let's go to a club.

711
00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:53.732
You promised me not to go to a club again.

712
00:39:53.732 --> 00:39:55.831
I meant I won't go there alone.

713
00:39:55.831 --> 00:39:57.342
It's okay if you're coming with me.

714
00:39:57.641 --> 00:40:00.512
I've dreamed of going to a club with my boyfriend.

715
00:40:01.012 --> 00:40:02.311
We're not dressed for a club now.

716
00:40:02.311 --> 00:40:04.712
And we don't have anything to cover your face.

717
00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:07.911
Then let's go to a club in Hongdae.

718
00:40:07.911 --> 00:40:10.451
Our people only go to clubs in Gangnam.

719
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:11.451
Hongdae?

720
00:40:13.692 --> 00:40:14.822
Hongdae.

721
00:40:28.172 --> 00:40:29.701
I'm back.

722
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:31.572
We've got some customers who ordered whisky.

723
00:40:31.802 --> 00:40:35.012
They might tip you. I'll let you serve them.

724
00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:37.442
You're so nice.

725
00:40:37.442 --> 00:40:38.712
Where are they?

726
00:40:38.712 --> 00:40:41.482
They're over there. Do you see them?

727
00:40:47.991 --> 00:40:50.121
Why? Do you know that jerk?

728
00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:52.621
- That jerk? - Yes, the judo man.

729
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:53.831
Judo man?

730
00:40:54.532 --> 00:40:55.831
Is he an athlete?

731
00:40:57.262 --> 00:40:59.431
No, that's not it.

732
00:40:59.431 --> 00:41:02.172
He can lay down any woman he wants.

733
00:41:03.141 --> 00:41:04.342
Like a judo player.

734
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:06.871
Lay women down like a judo player?

735
00:41:07.612 --> 00:41:09.311
Gosh, that jerk...

736
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:16.052
And a secret affair with Cinderella?

737
00:41:18.552 --> 00:41:20.092
Oh, okay.

738
00:41:20.152 --> 00:41:22.092
Hey, just go to them.

739
00:41:22.092 --> 00:41:23.762
The girl will pay for the drinks.

740
00:41:23.862 --> 00:41:25.721
I think you should serve them instead.

741
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:27.092
Why? I'm trying to be nice to you.

742
00:41:27.092 --> 00:41:29.262
I'll serve the other tables. Just go.

743
00:41:29.262 --> 00:41:31.431
What's wrong with him?

744
00:41:35.771 --> 00:41:37.101
This is amazing.

745
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:40.212
The whisky is even better with some beer.

746
00:41:40.942 --> 00:41:42.541
I told you to have only one drink.

747
00:41:42.882 --> 00:41:44.012
It's okay.

748
00:41:44.112 --> 00:41:47.752
I told Ms. Min I'd go to a wrap-up party tonight.

749
00:41:51.982 --> 00:41:54.351
Get some fresh air so you can sober up.

750
00:41:57.121 --> 00:41:58.362
It's cool.

751
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:02.431
Turn your face away. People will see you.

752
00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:27.451
Wait a minute.

753
00:42:37.561 --> 00:42:39.101
- Excuse me. - Oh my gosh.

754
00:42:40.331 --> 00:42:41.502
What was that?

755
00:42:43.002 --> 00:42:44.072
You.

756
00:42:44.072 --> 00:42:47.342
Guys in the club keep asking me to pick her up.

757
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:52.612
Hi.

758
00:42:52.741 --> 00:42:53.882
You.

759
00:42:55.811 --> 00:42:58.822
Pull it up a little more.

760
00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:00.521
Just a little more.

761
00:43:15.271 --> 00:43:16.302
(Experience Hall for Indigo Natural Dyeing)

762
00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:24.911
There were two toothbrushes.

763
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:28.581
There was no additional DNA test?

764
00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:31.351
From my understanding, there was none.

765
00:43:35.621 --> 00:43:39.161
(Seo Ji An is not Choi Eun Seok)

766
00:43:43.362 --> 00:43:45.201
Why are you so quiet?

767
00:43:45.632 --> 00:43:46.902
Don't you want to go?

768
00:43:47.371 --> 00:43:48.971
Do you like working at the company more?

769
00:43:49.471 --> 00:43:52.572
I... I am...

770
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:22.532
It looks good.

771
00:45:32.172 --> 00:45:33.572
What do you think?

772
00:45:34.342 --> 00:45:35.971
I like the stage setting.

773
00:45:36.612 --> 00:45:38.911
Although we'll have to see how the event will go.

774
00:45:39.552 --> 00:45:42.652
I can tell you worked hard for the diverse events.

775
00:45:43.652 --> 00:45:44.951
Thank you.

776
00:45:44.951 --> 00:45:45.982
The opening is...

777
00:45:45.982 --> 00:45:48.391
Jung Kang Soo's dyeing event, right?

778
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:50.422
Yes. It begins at 10:30am.

779
00:45:50.422 --> 00:45:53.791
Can we come back for the fashion show after that?

780
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:54.831
Yes.

781
00:46:56.721 --> 00:46:58.561
I'll fix it right away.

782
00:46:58.991 --> 00:47:00.491
- Is it working? - No.

783
00:47:00.491 --> 00:47:01.862
Not yet?

784
00:47:05.032 --> 00:47:06.672
Engineering Team, there's an exposed wire...

785
00:47:06.672 --> 00:47:08.132
by the snack corner.

786
00:47:09.971 --> 00:47:11.172
Hello.

787
00:47:11.172 --> 00:47:12.842
Draw on the shirt over there,

788
00:47:12.842 --> 00:47:14.241
take a photo,

789
00:47:14.241 --> 00:47:15.672
and upload it to...

790
00:47:15.672 --> 00:47:17.081
our company's event webpage.

791
00:47:17.411 --> 00:47:19.382
Take your shirts.

792
00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:21.712
Here you go.

793
00:47:35.762 --> 00:47:38.431
Ms. Yang, I'll pay for this later.

794
00:47:38.762 --> 00:47:39.802
Thank you.

795
00:47:45.902 --> 00:47:50.842
Comfort me without a word

796
00:47:51.982 --> 00:47:56.982
The wind is so cold

797
00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:02.521
Fill my empty heart

798
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:08.431
A tear-stained letter

799
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:14.371
On the white paper

800
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:20.672
In your neat handwriting

801
00:48:20.971 --> 00:48:25.942
The truth you did not speak of

802
00:48:28.282 --> 00:48:29.482
No problems, right?

803
00:48:29.482 --> 00:48:30.882
None, sir.

804
00:49:03.652 --> 00:49:04.922
Yes, sir.

805
00:49:04.922 --> 00:49:07.721
They brought the podium for the stage.

806
00:49:07.922 --> 00:49:09.291
I'll be right there.

807
00:49:09.291 --> 00:49:12.561
Can you check if the dyed fabric's dry?

808
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:51.632
The fabric here...

809
00:49:51.632 --> 00:49:53.502
Go and get Mr. Jung.

810
00:49:53.502 --> 00:49:55.331
I called him at lunchtime.

811
00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:56.942
He left for Pyeongchang.

812
00:49:57.442 --> 00:49:58.502
What?

813
00:50:10.652 --> 00:50:12.382
Do any companies have blue fabric?

814
00:50:12.382 --> 00:50:14.351
Yes, I asked two to bring some.

815
00:50:14.822 --> 00:50:16.422
Who on earth took it?

816
00:50:16.891 --> 00:50:18.221
We went to such lengths...

817
00:50:18.221 --> 00:50:20.592
to find Mr. Jung to get the same color...

818
00:50:20.592 --> 00:50:23.061
before the launch of our premium line.

819
00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:24.902
Now, the colors won't match.

820
00:50:34.411 --> 00:50:36.181
I don't have any clothes to give you.

821
00:50:36.982 --> 00:50:39.411
Wrap this around your neck.

822
00:50:40.612 --> 00:50:41.882
Thank you.

823
00:51:19.152 --> 00:51:21.422
Is there a problem with the show?

824
00:51:29.232 --> 00:51:30.262
Sir.

825
00:51:30.262 --> 00:51:32.601
Sir, I have bad news.

826
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:34.431
A dye company just called.

827
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:36.541
The traffic's so heavy, and they can't...

828
00:51:36.541 --> 00:51:37.971
get here by 7pm.

829
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:39.241
They can't make it?

830
00:51:39.572 --> 00:51:41.512
Why are you the one telling me that?

831
00:51:41.771 --> 00:51:42.882
Where's Ms. Seo?

832
00:51:42.882 --> 00:51:44.811
They couldn't reach her, so they called...

833
00:51:44.811 --> 00:51:46.181
She can't be reached?

834
00:51:49.621 --> 00:51:51.581
The number you have dialed...

835
00:51:52.422 --> 00:51:54.422
Where are you, Ji An?

836
00:52:04.462 --> 00:52:05.601
Mr. Choi.

837
00:52:14.771 --> 00:52:16.012
Where'd you get this?

838
00:52:16.012 --> 00:52:17.681
It's what Mr. Jung gave me.

839
00:52:17.681 --> 00:52:19.141
I'd left it at work.

840
00:52:19.782 --> 00:52:21.712
I couldn't call because I was on a motorcycle.

841
00:52:21.712 --> 00:52:22.782
A motorcycle?

842
00:52:23.152 --> 00:52:24.951
You went there and back on a motorcycle?

843
00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:26.351
I went over the speed limit.

844
00:52:37.862 --> 00:52:40.172
We shall begin the customer...

845
00:52:40.172 --> 00:52:42.101
model fashion show.

846
00:52:42.101 --> 00:52:43.402
A round of applause, please.

847
00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:15.331
Well done.

848
00:54:16.402 --> 00:54:18.802
Spend this on a team dinner.

849
00:54:18.962 --> 00:54:20.101
Thank you, sir.

850
00:54:23.172 --> 00:54:24.302
Wrap things up.

851
00:54:24.502 --> 00:54:26.212
- Thank you. - Thank you.

852
00:54:33.112 --> 00:54:34.811
You should eat meat.

853
00:54:34.811 --> 00:54:36.282
Will this be enough?

854
00:54:36.282 --> 00:54:37.951
Meat calls for soju,

855
00:54:37.951 --> 00:54:40.552
and soju only causes a hangover.

856
00:54:40.822 --> 00:54:42.252
After a long day,

857
00:54:42.252 --> 00:54:44.161
nothing beats cold beer.

858
00:54:44.561 --> 00:54:46.762
I can't drink soju.

859
00:54:48.362 --> 00:54:50.402
If that's what you want, okay.

860
00:54:50.402 --> 00:54:51.502
I'm fine with it.

861
00:54:52.532 --> 00:54:55.101
It was a successful opening ceremony,

862
00:54:55.101 --> 00:54:57.371
the most important part of our 40th anniversary.

863
00:54:57.741 --> 00:54:59.041
Well done, everyone.

864
00:54:59.541 --> 00:55:01.512
- Well done. - Well done.

865
00:55:02.112 --> 00:55:03.842
- Well done. - Well done.

866
00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:05.581
- Well done. - Well done.

867
00:55:15.351 --> 00:55:16.491
Ms. Seo.

868
00:55:18.121 --> 00:55:19.632
You did great.

869
00:55:19.632 --> 00:55:21.991
You're amazing. I give you that.

870
00:55:22.431 --> 00:55:23.732
Thank you.

871
00:55:26.532 --> 00:55:27.802
Sorry for everything.

872
00:55:28.572 --> 00:55:30.541
I made you make coffee...

873
00:55:31.072 --> 00:55:32.942
and drive my car around.

874
00:55:34.172 --> 00:55:35.712
Is that all you're sorry for?

875
00:55:35.712 --> 00:55:36.882
What?

876
00:55:37.012 --> 00:55:38.712
If we start apologizing,

877
00:55:38.712 --> 00:55:40.311
we'll all have to say sorry.

878
00:55:40.311 --> 00:55:42.351
We all owe you something.

879
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:46.521
How about a toast of apology?

880
00:55:46.692 --> 00:55:49.021
Don't say that. Stop it.

881
00:55:49.252 --> 00:55:51.462
I like the sound of that. Let's do it.

882
00:55:52.592 --> 00:55:55.632
Don't you drink, sir?

883
00:55:56.362 --> 00:55:57.831
I don't like beer.

884
00:55:59.161 --> 00:56:00.271
Then go home.

885
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:02.032
Why stay if you can't drink?

886
00:56:02.032 --> 00:56:04.342
- Cheers. - Cheers.

887
00:56:04.342 --> 00:56:06.442
- Cheers. - Cheers.

888
00:56:06.942 --> 00:56:08.541
Sorry, Ji An.

889
00:56:09.311 --> 00:56:10.842
- Well done. - Great job.

890
00:56:10.842 --> 00:56:12.241
- Well done. - Well done.

891
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:26.021
You did great today.

892
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:28.931
Good for you.

893
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:34.502
You're picking a fight after just three glasses?

894
00:56:35.931 --> 00:56:37.241
I'm not picking a fight.

895
00:56:37.802 --> 00:56:40.672
I admit that you're better than me.

896
00:56:42.842 --> 00:56:45.081
This is why alcohol is good.

897
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:47.052
It makes people honest.

898
00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:50.282
I'm going to quit.

899
00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:52.681
You'll quit?

900
00:56:53.121 --> 00:56:55.451
I asked Dad to find me another job.

901
00:56:57.862 --> 00:56:59.592
Okay then. Quit.

902
00:57:00.232 --> 00:57:03.331
If you do, someone who really deserves...

903
00:57:03.331 --> 00:57:05.862
the job will be able to work.

904
00:57:06.532 --> 00:57:08.132
I don't care about that.

905
00:57:08.931 --> 00:57:10.871
I'm quitting because of you.

906
00:57:11.402 --> 00:57:12.572
I feel uncomfortable.

907
00:57:13.371 --> 00:57:14.471
It's annoying.

908
00:57:16.541 --> 00:57:20.382
Were you unhappy that I made you look bad?

909
00:57:21.112 --> 00:57:23.681
That I took what wasn't yours at all?

910
00:57:25.052 --> 00:57:27.152
You know you can never...

911
00:57:27.491 --> 00:57:29.521
beat me while you're here,

912
00:57:30.192 --> 00:57:31.621
so you're running away.

913
00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:37.061
I have so many other companies to go to.

914
00:57:37.061 --> 00:57:38.402
I'm sure you do.

915
00:57:39.002 --> 00:57:41.032
But wherever you are, don't forget that...

916
00:57:41.271 --> 00:57:43.541
people who know how you got in...

917
00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:47.842
will mock you and not take you seriously.

918
00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:49.842
What?

919
00:57:49.842 --> 00:57:53.782
They'll smile at you, but laugh at you inside.

920
00:57:53.782 --> 00:57:54.811
Why?

921
00:57:55.311 --> 00:57:57.121
Because you're actually a loser.

922
00:57:58.681 --> 00:58:01.152
You can say what you want.

923
00:58:01.752 --> 00:58:04.891
I'll actually have a better life than you.

924
00:58:04.891 --> 00:58:05.991
Sure.

925
00:58:06.661 --> 00:58:08.462
You'll have a great life.

926
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:12.061
You'll eat and sleep better than me forever.

927
00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:15.601
On the outside, of course.

928
00:58:15.771 --> 00:58:18.002
While others scorn you for what you are.

929
00:58:18.302 --> 00:58:19.371
I acknowledged that...

930
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:24.282
you're better than me because we were friends.

931
00:58:24.282 --> 00:58:26.782
I am better than you without your admittance.

932
00:58:27.581 --> 00:58:29.851
Did you think you'd feel better if you...

933
00:58:30.221 --> 00:58:32.021
said that before you resigned?

934
00:58:32.322 --> 00:58:33.491
No, you won't.

935
00:58:34.351 --> 00:58:36.021
You have no pride.

936
00:58:36.021 --> 00:58:38.661
- Hey! - You use connections.

937
00:58:38.862 --> 00:58:40.232
Live accordingly.

938
00:58:40.831 --> 00:58:42.462
Don't be proud that...

939
00:58:42.462 --> 00:58:44.061
your dad got you where you are.

940
00:58:44.931 --> 00:58:47.732
You should be ashamed. Be embarrassed.

941
00:58:54.411 --> 00:58:55.512
Bye.

942
00:59:04.121 --> 00:59:05.652
Let's go.

943
00:59:06.652 --> 00:59:08.491
Oh dear.

944
00:59:11.262 --> 00:59:12.491
- Mr. Lee. - Yes?

945
00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:14.831
Ms. Seo has to go to the office.

946
00:59:14.831 --> 00:59:16.262
I'll drop her off.

947
00:59:16.262 --> 00:59:17.561
Yes, sir.

948
00:59:17.802 --> 00:59:18.831
Sir.

949
00:59:18.831 --> 00:59:21.101
I called for a few taxis.

950
00:59:21.101 --> 00:59:22.732
Send the ladies off first.

951
00:59:23.971 --> 00:59:25.741
Ms. Seo, you wait here.

952
00:59:26.442 --> 00:59:27.442
Let's go.

953
00:59:28.672 --> 00:59:31.681
How about round two? More drinks.

954
00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:33.552
Follow me.

955
00:59:49.532 --> 00:59:51.101
She left already?

956
00:59:57.101 --> 00:59:58.271
Where are you?

957
00:59:58.802 --> 01:00:00.172
Sorry, sir.

958
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:02.212
I dozed off in the car.

959
01:00:02.212 --> 01:00:04.342
Some jerk parked in front of me...

960
01:00:04.442 --> 01:00:05.911
with the side brake on.

961
01:00:06.712 --> 01:00:07.782
Okay.

962
01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.822
Where did she go?

963
01:00:16.152 --> 01:00:17.822
How is my husband?

964
01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:20.061
He isn't home yet.

965
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:23.601
He left early saying he felt unwell...

966
01:00:23.802 --> 01:00:25.431
and he isn't home?

967
01:00:36.782 --> 01:00:39.782
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

968
01:00:43.451 --> 01:00:45.621
Sorry for asking to see you so late.

969
01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:48.922
It's okay. I was waiting since my senior called.

970
01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.132
Thank you in advance.

971
01:00:56.502 --> 01:00:57.502
Okay.

972
01:00:58.831 --> 01:01:00.831
(Choi Jae Sung)

973
01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:12.241
Ms. Seo.

974
01:01:20.422 --> 01:01:21.592
Ms. Seo.

975
01:01:26.762 --> 01:01:29.061
Get up. I'll drive you.

976
01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:33.331
No, sir. You don't need to.

977
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:35.172
Don't worry about me.

978
01:01:35.431 --> 01:01:37.842
I'm looking after a great employee.

979
01:01:38.002 --> 01:01:39.241
Not you in particular.

980
01:01:42.371 --> 01:01:43.911
I did do...

981
01:01:44.641 --> 01:01:46.782
pretty well today, didn't I?

982
01:01:47.382 --> 01:01:49.521
Right, Mr. Choi?

983
01:01:51.482 --> 01:01:52.482
Yes.

984
01:01:53.491 --> 01:01:54.991
You did well.

985
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:00.862
Can you give me five minutes?

986
01:02:01.061 --> 01:02:02.592
I'm so sleepy.

987
01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:09.672
Nap until Secretary Yoo brings the car around.

988
01:02:11.802 --> 01:02:14.471
About what I did today.

989
01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:18.982
Will you tell your mother...

990
01:02:19.212 --> 01:02:21.451
and father for me?

991
01:02:24.882 --> 01:02:26.021
I will.

992
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:29.692
Then promise you'll tell them...

993
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.561
what I did to get...

994
01:02:32.561 --> 01:02:35.831
the blue fabric from the office.

995
01:02:36.232 --> 01:02:39.232
Tell Ms. No and Mr. Choi for me.

996
01:02:43.172 --> 01:02:44.241
I will.

997
01:02:45.902 --> 01:02:47.012
I'll tell them.

998
01:02:58.782 --> 01:02:59.951
Today,

999
01:03:01.922 --> 01:03:03.661
you did very well.

1000
01:03:06.092 --> 01:03:07.962
You went through a lot.

1001
01:03:13.172 --> 01:03:14.601
Not just today.

1002
01:03:16.601 --> 01:03:17.842
Until today.

1003
01:03:20.811 --> 01:03:22.141
You did great.

1004
01:03:25.181 --> 01:03:26.951
You suffered a lot,

1005
01:03:28.552 --> 01:03:29.621
Seo Ji An.

1006
01:03:34.692 --> 01:03:36.092
Did I really?

1007
01:03:42.692 --> 01:03:43.701
I did.

1008
01:03:44.762 --> 01:03:49.132
I did really well today.

1009
01:03:52.672 --> 01:03:53.771
Yes.

1010
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.041
You did well.

1011
01:03:58.482 --> 01:04:00.351
I did great, didn't I?

1012
01:04:04.475 --> 01:04:09.475

1013
01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:13.232
You did...

1014
01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:17.061
so, so well.

1015
01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:21.072
You felt like a real brother just now.

1016
01:04:23.172 --> 01:04:24.842
I liked you when...

1017
01:04:25.771 --> 01:04:27.411
you were my brother.

1018
01:04:29.212 --> 01:04:31.581
It'll be all over in five days.

1019
01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:37.581
I don't think...

1020
01:04:38.982 --> 01:04:42.422
I'll be able to say goodbye then.

1021
01:04:43.362 --> 01:04:45.161
I'll say it now.

1022
01:04:49.632 --> 01:04:51.061
I was sorry.

1023
01:04:58.502 --> 01:05:00.342
I was grateful.

1024
01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:08.752
I hope...

1025
01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:12.351
you are well.

1026
01:05:37.982 --> 01:05:39.041
Let's...

1027
01:05:43.721 --> 01:05:45.382
never meet again.

1028
01:05:56.061 --> 01:05:57.161
Never again.
