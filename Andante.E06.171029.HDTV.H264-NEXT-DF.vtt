00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:54.857
I got it already.
<i>[Episode 6: 30,912 Hours, 14 Years, 10 Months, 10 Days]</i>

6
00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:56.930
I'm at the hospice.
I'll bring her home.

7
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.326
Okay, I'll take care of the apology.
Enough already.

8
00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:03.574
I even gave her the letter,
and she's still not home.

9
00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:06.549
Ring? I told you I haven't seen it.

10
00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.276
I never paid attention to any ring,
so I wouldn't know.

11
00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:14.934
When did it go missing?

12
00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:18.514
Uh, by the way...

13
00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:22.434
can you do me a favor?

14
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.496
Can you read this for me?

15
00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.942
I'm in no mood to read anything.

16
00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:34.341
My head hurts.

17
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.547
You sure are stingy.

18
00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:38.491
What did you say?

19
00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:41.171
Am I your personal secretary?

20
00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:43.460
Why are you asking me
to read that to you?

21
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.339
Don't you know how to read?

22
00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:48.832
I'm illiterate. Are you happy now?

23
00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:52.071
This is why I don't like you, Grandma!

24
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:54.579
Why are you spreading my letter
around all over the place?

25
00:01:58.912 --> 00:01:59.999
That rude girl...

26
00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:03.165
That rude girl from the fast food place.

27
00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:04.232
Be quiet!

28
00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:07.452
Who are you calling rude?

29
00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:10.633
The way I see it,
you're the rude person here.

30
00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.368
Why, you old grandma!

31
00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:14.490
So, you're sure she gave it to you?

32
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.053
Yes.

33
00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:19.451
I really had no intention
of accepting it though.

34
00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:22.421
Even if she gave it to you,
things could get complicated.

35
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.370
I don't know how it would work legally.

36
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.612
Wouldn't it be better
to discuss it with adults?

37
00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:31.460
Which adult?

38
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.761
My mom has so much
to worry about already.

39
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.870
My mom? My grandma?

40
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.596
We can't just ignore the issue.

41
00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.695
If you say you lost it...

42
00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:44.894
that daughter-in-law is no joke,
and she won't let it go.

43
00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:50.358
Also, I heard Grandma Ring is in
very bad condition right now.

44
00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:52.618
I don't know. I don't know.

45
00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:53.948
What are you two talking about?

46
00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.107
Lee Shi Young, what are you doing here?

47
00:02:58.107 --> 00:03:01.520
I asked what you're talking about.
Did you lose something expensive?

48
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.350
<i>What did you just say?</i>

49
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.209
Did I say something wrong?

50
00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.701
What have you done right
that allows you to look at me like that?

51
00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:11.729
I've come across all kinds
of people here.

52
00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.130
Though, I've never seen anyone like you.

53
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.478
Me?

54
00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:18.024
Why, you old grandma...

55
00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:20.842
Bong Sook is my friend,
and I've grown fond of her.

56
00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:23.465
She's not a stranger to me,
so I have to say my piece.

57
00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:24.538
Say your piece?

58
00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:27.994
How hilarious.

59
00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:29.645
Who are you, Grandma?

60
00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:32.918
Let's not drag this out.
You're very transparent, you wench.

61
00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:34.821
"You... you... you wench"?

62
00:03:34.821 --> 00:03:36.339
Grandma!

63
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.919
She doesn't have much time left to live.

64
00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.239
People should have some morals,
at the very least.

65
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.321
What did I do wrong? What did I do?

66
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:47.935
People should do as much as I do.

67
00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:50.094
She could be gone the day after tomorrow.

68
00:03:50.094 --> 00:03:52.535
Is that mere ring so important?

69
00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.326
She paid for your education,
paid for your house, and supported you.

70
00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:57.417
What more do you want?

71
00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.526
Stay put if you don't know anything.

72
00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:02.435
Do you know how much that ring is worth?

73
00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:05.865
No matter how much it's worth,
is it more important than a life?

74
00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:10.066
I wouldn't even leave you a copper ring!

75
00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:12.197
What is with you, you old grandma?

76
00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:15.615
Who do you think you are?
Are you her guardian?

77
00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:16.744
Are you a doctor?

78
00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:19.964
Friend? Friend, yeah right.

79
00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:23.500
My mother-in-law never made
an illiterate friend like you.

80
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.702
You old grandma!

81
00:04:24.702 --> 00:04:27.139
Don't get any closer to my grandma.

82
00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.509
What is this now?

83
00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.190
Ah, that rude girl.

84
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.962
The grandma and granddaughter
are quite a set.

85
00:04:34.962 --> 00:04:35.992
You're a set!

86
00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:37.620
What is going on here?

87
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.868
Why are you acting like this?

88
00:04:46.288 --> 00:04:50.111
You seem to do well and then blow up
once or twice a year.

89
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:53.118
Me? What are you talking about?

90
00:04:53.118 --> 00:04:55.021
- This is the first time.
- Huh?

91
00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.966
You always say it's the first time.

92
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.130
Why are you so stubborn about fighting?

93
00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:04.923
I would look the other way,
but she was too much.

94
00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:08.908
She doesn't have an ounce of affection
for her mother-in-law.

95
00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:11.613
She's always going on about that ring.

96
00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.591
You did well.

97
00:05:14.308 --> 00:05:16.462
Shi Kyung and Shi Young,
you're going home, right?

98
00:05:16.462 --> 00:05:18.615
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

99
00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:20.466
- No.
- What?

100
00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:23.053
Everyone go outside and wait.

101
00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:26.843
Shi Young, you stay and talk to me.

102
00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:32.613
Is that "copo" thing so important?

103
00:05:32.613 --> 00:05:36.973
"Cos-Play."
And yes, it's important to me.

104
00:05:36.973 --> 00:05:40.733
I wouldn't have thrown it out
if you had told me.

105
00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:43.183
That's not everything.

106
00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:44.444
What else?

107
00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:47.574
Why didn't you tell me
that you didn't know how to read Korean?

108
00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:50.824
Why would you ask that kind of lady,
of all people, to read my letter?

109
00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:52.187
What's wrong with that?

110
00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:55.435
I can't even read,
and you want me to be picky?

111
00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:57.574
You got into a fight,
and it was embarrassing.

112
00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:58.964
Embarrassing?

113
00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:01.945
Why? Because your grandma can't read?

114
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.647
Because your grandma threw out
that "copo" thing?

115
00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:08.233
Because I fought that rude woman
and cursed at her?

116
00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:10.908
That kind of thing is not what
is truly embarrassing.

117
00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.599
I may be ignorant.

118
00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.658
But, I'm not someone you ought
to be embarrassed of.

119
00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:17.288
I have a good idea.

120
00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:21.885
You and I are in the same position,
so how about this?

121
00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:22.995
What do you mean?

122
00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:24.788
I'll teach you how
to read Korean, Grandma.

123
00:06:25.247 --> 00:06:27.339
- What?
- In return...

124
00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:30.218
you can enter the talent show with me.

125
00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:33.738
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:43.471
Here.

127
00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:47.156
We're supposed to call
when Shi Young is out.

128
00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.925
My father will come with his car.

129
00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:51.087
Father?

130
00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:53.831
Father...

131
00:06:54.938 --> 00:06:57.019
- What about it?
- It's just amazing.

132
00:06:59.238 --> 00:07:01.190
I've never called someone father before.

133
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.920
When I was very young, my dad...

134
00:07:06.832 --> 00:07:10.671
he went missing when I was still
calling him "Dad, Dad."

135
00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:15.570
You're lucky.

136
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:17.615
Why?

137
00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:19.608
You don't have to
take bones out of your fish.

138
00:07:19.608 --> 00:07:22.690
- You're lucky.
- Why?

139
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.784
You have lots of women in your home.

140
00:07:26.106 --> 00:07:27.745
I told you to adopt Shi Young.

141
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.457
Oh no. We're splitting her.

142
00:07:32.546 --> 00:07:36.274
What is Shi Young talking about
with your grandma?

143
00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:39.716
I don't know. They're the same.

144
00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:41.856
Their personalities and stubbornness.

145
00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:44.925
Even the way they're both
good with their hands.

146
00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:46.736
I guess you're right.

147
00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:50.565
Why are there so many stars?
They all look the same too.

148
00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:52.803
What does it look like?

149
00:07:52.803 --> 00:07:54.351
A teardrop diamond.

150
00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:57.766
<i>The moment I saw the stars
spilling out of the sky...</i>

151
00:07:59.517 --> 00:08:01.382
<i>I was asking my dad.</i>

152
00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:06.226
<i>Dad, what should I do
at a time like this?</i>

153
00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:35.514
What is it?

154
00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.238
What do you want to do out here alone?

155
00:08:37.238 --> 00:08:38.967
How can you joke around right now?

156
00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:41.698
You couldn't find the ring, right?

157
00:08:41.698 --> 00:08:43.080
No.

158
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.258
What are you going to do?
It's all my fault.

159
00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:49.166
You're right. It is all your fault.

160
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:50.685
You pay for it.

161
00:08:53.938 --> 00:08:55.195
I'm just joking.

162
00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:59.493
I'm thinking about how to deal with it,
so you don't need to worry.

163
00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:02.105
Do you have an idea?

164
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.337
Not yet.

165
00:09:07.676 --> 00:09:10.320
December, 1876.

166
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.807
It was a musical concert
in honor of Tolstoy.

167
00:09:12.807 --> 00:09:17.012
There is a famous anecdote that
he... he cried after hearing this music?

168
00:09:17.012 --> 00:09:20.201
No! I shouldn't say that part first.

169
00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:24.313
I can't get confused like this.
I'm going crazy!

170
00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:27.486
It's so hot.

171
00:09:28.547 --> 00:09:30.094
Oh my goodness!

172
00:09:30.094 --> 00:09:31.492
Hurry up, and close the window.

173
00:09:31.492 --> 00:09:32.838
What do I do?

174
00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:36.705
How are you?

175
00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:41.410
I was doing all right just a moment ago,
but now I'm not so sure.

176
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.818
What?

177
00:09:45.088 --> 00:09:46.141
Here you go.

178
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:47.772
Thank you.

179
00:09:55.581 --> 00:09:57.555
What are you doing?

180
00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.571
You're going to practice anyway.

181
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:02.030
It's better to do it
in front of an audience.

182
00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:07.311
When I took over
the death experience classes

183
00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:10.681
I was so nervous
and felt such a burden.

184
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:14.699
I called all my old classmates
and bought them lots of drinks.

185
00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:16.430
I got them drunk.

186
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:20.421
They were all drunk
and lying on the ground.

187
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:23.206
It was much better after I practiced
in front of them.

188
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:27.020
Just relax when you do it.
No one will notice if you get it wrong.

189
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:32.131
Also, the worst that could happen
is that you don't get the job.

190
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.111
All right. Try it.

191
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:40.338
Relax, and try it with me.

192
00:10:40.338 --> 00:10:41.723
Okay.

193
00:10:41.723 --> 00:10:44.160
<i>Suppose that the ring
is worth 2 billion won.</i>

194
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.980
<i>What is the minimum wage?</i>

195
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.484
<i>Suppose it's 6,500 won.</i>

196
00:10:48.484 --> 00:10:50.550
<i>Divide 2 billion won by 6,500 won.</i>

197
00:10:51.982 --> 00:10:55.579
<i>How many zeroes is 2 billion won?</i>

198
00:10:55.579 --> 00:10:58.723
The song that brought tears
to Tolstoy's eyes

199
00:10:58.723 --> 00:11:02.552
came from the melody
of a folk song from rural Ukraine.

200
00:11:02.552 --> 00:11:08.945
Tchaikovsky happened to hear this
melody while passing through Kamionka.

201
00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:15.253
Something about this simple and modest
melody pulled at the hearts of people.

202
00:11:15.253 --> 00:11:17.390
There must've been something about it...

203
00:11:20.643 --> 00:11:24.103
Ah. Uh... well...

204
00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:29.353
Uh, well...

205
00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:37.145
What was it about this melody
that brought tears to Tolstoy's eyes?

206
00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:38.204
Aren't you curious?

207
00:11:38.204 --> 00:11:40.895
That is the healing power of music...

208
00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:43.852
30,912 hours, 14 years,
10 months, and 10 days!

209
00:11:44.612 --> 00:11:45.802
That's crazy!

210
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.401
Lee Shi Kyung.

211
00:12:05.155 --> 00:12:06.204
What?

212
00:12:06.204 --> 00:12:08.344
I've never had this happen before.

213
00:12:08.344 --> 00:12:12.313
The student dean, vice-principal, and
the homeroom teacher want to see you.

214
00:12:12.313 --> 00:12:15.502
Why? Is it because I yelled?

215
00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:18.473
I wouldn't know. I'm just the messenger.

216
00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:24.083
But, 30,912 hours?

217
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:25.794
What is that?

218
00:12:25.794 --> 00:12:29.290
Hello? Yeah, Mom.

219
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.816
<i>What's going on?</i>

220
00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:33.368
<i>What did you do during
your aunt's class to maker her cry?</i>

221
00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:35.377
Don't miss the talent show practice.

222
00:12:37.107 --> 00:12:39.578
I did cause some trouble.

223
00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:41.507
There's no need for her to cry.

224
00:12:41.507 --> 00:12:43.993
<i>Didn't you know what that class
meant to your aunt?</i>

225
00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:46.464
<i>Come home right after school.</i>

226
00:12:46.464 --> 00:12:50.046
<i>In times like this,
running away is the best.</i>

227
00:12:52.248 --> 00:12:54.560
I forgot to tell Bom that I was leaving.

228
00:13:00.229 --> 00:13:04.302
<i>I caught you. I caught you.</i>

229
00:13:06.443 --> 00:13:09.991
There doesn't seem to be much
that you can do.

230
00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:13.642
You can't return the ring
or buy a new one.

231
00:13:14.574 --> 00:13:15.906
I can't do much.

232
00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:22.710
Shouldn't you search for the best way
to resolve this?

233
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.228
<i>I know that.</i>

234
00:13:24.228 --> 00:13:27.350
<i>Vice-Principal, what is that best way?</i>

235
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.488
Take this, and go see the ring lady.

236
00:13:30.488 --> 00:13:33.489
I heard you haven't seen her
since you lost the ring.

237
00:13:35.242 --> 00:13:38.584
I went to see her,
but her daughter-in-law was there.

238
00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.580
Or, she was unconscious.

239
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.439
Try going there today.

240
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.320
This is the same ring that I lost.

241
00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:53.302
You want me to make you a ring
just like this?

242
00:13:53.302 --> 00:13:56.590
How fast can you do it?

243
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.204
How much and how fast?

244
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.863
This ring is a basic design,
so I have the setting already.

245
00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:03.965
Would you like to see it?

246
00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:05.114
Yes, please show me.

247
00:14:05.114 --> 00:14:06.565
Please hold on a moment.

248
00:14:11.988 --> 00:14:13.046
This is it, isn't it?

249
00:14:26.954 --> 00:14:28.004
Hello?

250
00:14:29.253 --> 00:14:32.425
I'd like to take that job
we spoke about before.

251
00:14:34.155 --> 00:14:35.166
Kim...

252
00:14:36.948 --> 00:14:38.143
Kim Min Ji.

253
00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:42.277
Yes. Yes, I'll be right there.

254
00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:45.747
But, can you pay in advance?

255
00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:47.863
It's urgent.

256
00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:50.776
Yes.

257
00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:58.517
<i>You know we have talent show
practice today, right?</i>

258
00:15:12.617 --> 00:15:14.208
Are you feeling better?

259
00:15:15.227 --> 00:15:16.741
Sorry, Jung Won.

260
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:19.951
I really tried to do well this time.

261
00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:23.652
You don't know yet.
You said you finished the class.

262
00:15:23.652 --> 00:15:27.032
I know I did,
but I was tripping over my words.

263
00:15:27.032 --> 00:15:29.935
Shi Kyung and Shi Young
will be embarrassed by me.

264
00:15:29.935 --> 00:15:33.474
They don't know those things.
Just wait and see.

265
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.483
Gosh, Lee Shi Kyung.

266
00:15:37.374 --> 00:15:39.741
Seriously, what happened to me?

267
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:43.690
I'm scared of the world
and scared of people too.

268
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:49.151
If things are that bad,
you should go see a professional.

269
00:15:50.334 --> 00:15:52.205
A professional? Who?

270
00:15:53.214 --> 00:15:57.982
<i>That Siberian husky-like piece of crap!
Tell him to go take a hike!</i>

271
00:15:57.982 --> 00:15:59.232
What is that?

272
00:16:02.551 --> 00:16:04.857
You want me to do this?

273
00:16:04.857 --> 00:16:07.411
I'm not such a crass person.

274
00:16:07.411 --> 00:16:09.371
It's just a song.

275
00:16:09.371 --> 00:16:10.775
We're not going to do it like that.

276
00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:13.665
First, ride the rhythm.

277
00:16:13.665 --> 00:16:16.368
Hey, ho. Whoa.

278
00:16:17.946 --> 00:16:19.256
Try it, Grandma.

279
00:16:23.588 --> 00:16:26.612
That's not it.
You need to ride the rhythm.

280
00:16:26.612 --> 00:16:28.772
Use your arms, and move your hips.

281
00:16:28.772 --> 00:16:31.111
Like this... like this.

282
00:16:31.111 --> 00:16:34.191
Are those hips the same as these hips?

283
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:37.661
Wait until you turn 70.
Your hips won't feel the same.

284
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:39.931
- You keep at it.
- Wait, Grandma.

285
00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:41.980
I said I'd teach you how to read Korean.

286
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.736
Forget it. I've been fine not
knowing how to read and write.

287
00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:48.414
You said you're illiterate.

288
00:16:48.414 --> 00:16:51.203
Don't you have any pride?
You're illiterate.

289
00:16:51.203 --> 00:16:54.801
You should do it with a friend.
Why are you bothering me?

290
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:57.324
I heard you're super popular
at the hospice.

291
00:16:57.324 --> 00:16:58.940
I thought people would like it.

292
00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:02.872
I am very popular.

293
00:17:03.684 --> 00:17:05.443
This is my aunt's phone.

294
00:17:05.443 --> 00:17:08.722
Even when I'm at school,
look at this and practice with my aunt.

295
00:17:09.887 --> 00:17:12.185
She's crazy. She must be crazy!

296
00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:15.827
What? Do as Shi Young says.

297
00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:17.906
You might as well get over
being scared of people.

298
00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:21.323
Jung Won, it would depend on the person.

299
00:17:21.323 --> 00:17:23.484
<i>Where are you, Jung Soo?</i>

300
00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:32.435
Did Jung Soo leave?

301
00:18:05.262 --> 00:18:06.492
Hey, crazy punk!

302
00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:09.010
You're here again?

303
00:18:13.031 --> 00:18:16.399
Hey, did you see anything here?

304
00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:17.414
I did.

305
00:18:17.414 --> 00:18:19.758
What? What did you see?

306
00:18:19.758 --> 00:18:20.773
You.

307
00:18:20.773 --> 00:18:23.320
I saw a crazy punk twice.

308
00:18:28.579 --> 00:18:31.000
<i>Grandma Ring is awake now.</i>

309
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.425
<i>Dad, what do I do?</i>

310
00:18:41.873 --> 00:18:43.218
Oh, Lee Shi Kyung.

311
00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:47.320
Ah, that grandma was looking for you.

312
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.339
Me?

313
00:18:49.242 --> 00:18:51.319
- Why?
- I don't know.

314
00:18:51.319 --> 00:18:55.338
She hadn't been conscious for days.
She asked for you and Grandma Duk Boon.

315
00:18:55.338 --> 00:18:56.697
Go on in.

316
00:18:56.697 --> 00:19:00.809
What about her daughter-in-law?

317
00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:04.168
Ah, she's alone. Go on in.

318
00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:20.895
I heard you asked for me.

319
00:19:23.222 --> 00:19:24.262
Why was that?

320
00:19:25.156 --> 00:19:29.547
Was it possibly... to get your ring back?

321
00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:31.847
Oh no.

322
00:19:31.847 --> 00:19:33.596
Just because.

323
00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:35.961
I wanted to see you.

324
00:19:35.961 --> 00:19:37.706
What?

325
00:19:37.706 --> 00:19:41.633
I realized I was breathing again.

326
00:19:45.189 --> 00:19:47.349
And I wanted to see someone.

327
00:19:56.198 --> 00:20:00.216
Thank you for coming to see me.

328
00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:07.953
What are you doing?

329
00:20:07.953 --> 00:20:10.252
Sit properly. You'll tire yourself.

330
00:20:11.383 --> 00:20:12.433
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:13.332 --> 00:20:15.204
About the ring you gave me...

332
00:20:17.532 --> 00:20:21.000
I tried to give it back to you.

333
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.573
I lost it by the river.

334
00:20:27.304 --> 00:20:28.914
I calculated it.

335
00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:34.585
I can buy it if I work 8 hours
for 14 years and 10 months.

336
00:20:36.175 --> 00:20:38.020
I have no other way to return it to you.

337
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.627
Oh my, to get that back...

338
00:20:40.627 --> 00:20:42.739
I'd have to live a long time.

339
00:20:42.739 --> 00:20:46.206
Sorry, that ring was everything you own.

340
00:20:46.206 --> 00:20:47.917
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:52.062 --> 00:20:54.163
That ring...

342
00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:30.953
Where did you find the ring?

343
00:21:30.953 --> 00:21:33.087
It wasn't there when we looked for it.

344
00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:35.656
It was stuck in the dirt.
I cleaned the dirt off.

345
00:21:35.656 --> 00:21:37.998
Wow, just thinking about this ring...

346
00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:42.319
But, this ring is a fake.

347
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.512
How do you know?

348
00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.619
How else would I know?

349
00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:48.358
Grandma Ring told me.

350
00:21:48.358 --> 00:21:51.089
So, that ring is really a fake?

351
00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:54.214
Yes, it's really a fake.

352
00:21:55.706 --> 00:21:57.822
When did you go to look for it?

353
00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:00.320
Earlier tonight.

354
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.630
Tonight? What time?

355
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.300
I don't know, around 8:00 p.m.

356
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.301
It was just past 8:00 p.m.

357

<i>[Grandmother has regained consciousness.]</i>

358
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:13.434
<i>That's odd.</i>

359
00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:16.290
<i>I was there at that time.</i>

360
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.659
Why?

361
00:22:19.189 --> 00:22:20.850
By any chance...

362
00:22:22.887 --> 00:22:24.126
did you see a crazy guy?

363
00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:25.669
What do you mean?

364
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.618
Just some nonsense.

365
00:22:29.258 --> 00:22:32.297
<i>What is this strange feeling I'm getting?</i>

366
00:22:32.297 --> 00:22:35.108
Did you practice for the talent show?

367
00:22:35.108 --> 00:22:36.501
Yes.

368
00:22:36.501 --> 00:22:40.415
The class president says to call if
you're going be absent all the time.

369
00:22:40.415 --> 00:22:42.985
- You're going to do it, right?
- Yes.

370
00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:51.485
What a relief.

371
00:22:58.612 --> 00:23:01.034
You found the ring,
so why do you look like that?

372
00:23:01.034 --> 00:23:02.812
I thought about it.

373
00:23:04.784 --> 00:23:08.005
That daughter-in-law lady
and I are not so different.

374
00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:10.772
- What?
- We didn't think of Grandma.

375
00:23:10.772 --> 00:23:12.823
That lady only wanted the ring.

376
00:23:14.072 --> 00:23:15.674
I didn't worry about Grandma Ring.

377
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.906
I only worried about losing the ring.

378
00:23:19.614 --> 00:23:20.694
We're the same.

379
00:23:21.744 --> 00:23:26.115
When she said she wanted to see me,
I felt so sorry to her.

380
00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:30.713
Honestly, I only worried about the ring.

381
00:23:31.444 --> 00:23:33.406
I didn't think much about her.

382
00:23:33.406 --> 00:23:34.858
That's because...

383
00:23:34.858 --> 00:23:38.902
Also, I feel like I'm wronging Bom too.

384
00:23:40.431 --> 00:23:42.460
Why did Bom go and find this ring?

385
00:23:43.852 --> 00:23:45.185
What do you mean by that?

386
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.291
No, it's nothing.

387
00:23:49.181 --> 00:23:52.193
You found the ring now,
so focus on the talent show.

388
00:23:52.193 --> 00:23:55.900
The mood's been so down
because you've been all depressed.

389
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.929
Yeah.

390
00:23:58.179 --> 00:24:00.002
I'll go give this ring back to her.

391
00:24:18.327 --> 00:24:20.388
Good, good, good.

392
00:24:23.192 --> 00:24:25.041
What is that?

393
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:26.865
It's too dark.

394
00:24:28.587 --> 00:24:29.749
Do I look okay?

395
00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:32.227
Hey oh.

396
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.349
My hips, your hips. Oh dear.

397
00:24:52.063 --> 00:24:54.519
Oh my, oh my. I feel great.

398
00:24:57.002 --> 00:24:58.147
We did it.

399
00:24:58.147 --> 00:25:01.906
- One, two, three. Let's do it!
- One, two, three. Let's do it!

402
00:25:21.552 --> 00:25:24.724
I haven't seen your
daughter-in-law around.

403
00:25:24.724 --> 00:25:27.049
She has no reason to come anymore.

404
00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:29.545
She'll come when I'm dead.

405
00:25:29.545 --> 00:25:31.233
Oh, what a nasty girl.

406
00:25:31.233 --> 00:25:34.339
I got into a fight with her.
Did you hear?

407
00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:35.599
Thank you.

408
00:25:36.847 --> 00:25:39.071
Don't blame my daughter-in-law.

409
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.550
It's because of the way I lived my life.

410
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.692
Where could that ring have gone?

411
00:25:46.692 --> 00:25:49.020
I wonder that myself.

412
00:25:50.623 --> 00:25:54.129
I envy you. You get to dance.

413
00:25:54.129 --> 00:25:57.491
Do you think I'm dancing
because I want to?

414
00:25:57.491 --> 00:26:00.420
My granddaughter begged me to do it.

415
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.256
I should have lived like you.

416
00:26:03.256 --> 00:26:05.802
The grass is always greener
on the other side.

417
00:26:05.802 --> 00:26:08.512
There's nothing to envy about me.

419
00:26:11.933 --> 00:26:13.144
Shi Young is looking for you.

420
00:26:13.144 --> 00:26:15.493
She's going to throw a fit again.

421
00:26:15.493 --> 00:26:17.531
I'm going to go now, okay?

422
00:26:17.531 --> 00:26:20.265
You know you have to vote for me.

423
00:26:20.265 --> 00:26:22.090
That way I win the prize.

424
00:26:31.422 --> 00:26:32.931
You'll come to see me later?

425
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:37.799
Of course, and I'll vote for you
and not your grandma.

426
00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:39.693
Oh, what a betrayal.

427
00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:48.635
- Here.
- Why this again?

428

I don't want it.

429

This ring is just like me.

430
00:26:54.034 --> 00:26:57.201
A fake, pretending to be real.

431
00:26:58.713 --> 00:27:00.548
Put it in my coffin with me.

432
00:27:02.891 --> 00:27:04.336
Make sure no one knows.

433
00:27:05.364 --> 00:27:10.234
There will be a big fuss
to look for this once I die.

434
00:27:11.339 --> 00:27:13.985
I don't want to see that happen
even after death.

Okay.

446
00:28:10.089 --> 00:28:11.878
I threw them out.

00:31:04.542 --> 00:31:05.597
Get on.

482
00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:07.854
You just want me to accept it?

483
00:31:07.854 --> 00:31:10.408
You could do that dance
before accepting it.

484
00:31:11.685 --> 00:31:13.053
I don't think so.

485
00:31:13.053 --> 00:31:15.916
I feel like I should
do something for you.

486
00:31:21.204 --> 00:31:23.435
Of course, you should. Take me home.

487
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:26.095
- Let's go.
- Okay.

488
00:31:57.328 --> 00:31:58.552
What now?

489
00:31:58.552 --> 00:31:59.965
I told you to lower your voice.

490
00:32:02.189 --> 00:32:04.527
I thought about it for days,
and I don't understand.

491
00:32:04.527 --> 00:32:05.561
What?

492
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:09.624
Why would a rude kid like you
hang around my mother-in-law?

493
00:32:09.624 --> 00:32:13.125
There's some reason
you're trying to look good.

494
00:32:13.125 --> 00:32:14.764
How do you know so much?

495
00:32:14.764 --> 00:32:16.208
That's right.

496
00:32:16.208 --> 00:32:18.994
I want something from her,
and that's why I'm friendly with her.

497
00:32:18.994 --> 00:32:21.694
Finally, you're admitting it.

498
00:32:21.694 --> 00:32:24.544
You hid the ring, didn't you?

499
00:32:24.544 --> 00:32:27.626
What do you mean I hid it?
It's right here.

500
00:32:27.626 --> 00:32:31.316
Why, you... give it.

501
00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:34.364
What do you think you're doing?
She gave it to me.

502
00:32:34.364 --> 00:32:36.737
Wh... what?

503
00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:40.041
What did you just say?

504
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:43.967
She gave this ring to me. It's mine now.

505
00:32:45.635 --> 00:32:48.714
You're crazy. You must be crazy.

506
00:32:48.714 --> 00:32:50.141
Give it to me now!

507
00:32:52.205 --> 00:32:54.106
Should I tell you something
even more shocking?

508
00:32:54.106 --> 00:32:58.031
This ring that you're so hung up on...

509
00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.020
is a fake.

510
00:33:04.339 --> 00:33:06.249
Nice show you're putting on.

511
00:33:06.249 --> 00:33:09.409
I'll know very quickly
once I get it appraised.

512
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:10.782
How dare you lie.

513
00:33:10.782 --> 00:33:14.229
Do you know why she said
this fake ring was real?

514
00:33:14.229 --> 00:33:16.490
You wouldn't come visit
if she didn't have the ring.

515
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.608
You would have ignored her if the ring
didn't exist. Isn't that true?

516
00:33:19.608 --> 00:33:23.059
Your mother-in-law told me
that she longs for people.

517
00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:26.571
When she realizes she's breathing,
she longs for people first.

518
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:29.181
Have you ever thought
about how she must feel?

519
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:30.361
What are you saying?

520
00:33:30.361 --> 00:33:33.317
She told me this ring is fake.

521
00:33:33.317 --> 00:33:36.137
She also told me not
to tell anyone that I have it.

522
00:33:36.137 --> 00:33:38.386
I couldn't keep that promise though.

523
00:33:38.386 --> 00:33:41.031
You can call the police
or do whatever you please.

524
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:44.299
But, I can't give you this ring.

525
00:33:44.299 --> 00:33:46.657
To me, this ring...

526
00:33:48.746 --> 00:33:49.966
symbolizes Grandma's feelings.

527
00:33:57.573 --> 00:34:00.156
Hey! Come back here!

528
00:34:26.685 --> 00:34:30.592
So, this was what that crazy punk
was looking for.

529
00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.377
Wow.

530
00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:41.038
Why isn't she picking up?

531
00:34:55.786 --> 00:34:57.965
Min Ji, I'm going to call
you soon, so pick up.

532
00:35:14.618 --> 00:35:16.777
<i>Grandma Oh Bong Sook is on her deathbed.</i>

533
00:35:16.777 --> 00:35:17.806
<i>She's looking for you.</i>

534
00:35:29.918 --> 00:35:31.078
What took you so long?

535
00:35:31.078 --> 00:35:32.413
What about Grandma Oh Bong Sook?

536
00:35:35.726 --> 00:35:38.087
<i>I was only a little bit late.</i>

537
00:35:38.087 --> 00:35:39.416
You should have come earlier.

538
00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:42.328
She called out your name
twice on her deathbed.

539
00:35:46.819 --> 00:35:49.027
<i>I can no longer see Grandma Bong Sook.</i>

540
00:35:50.875 --> 00:35:53.766
<i>This is that kind of place.</i>

541
00:35:55.237 --> 00:35:56.607
"Keep your promise."

542
00:35:57.708 --> 00:36:00.349
That was the last thing she said.

543
00:36:01.067 --> 00:36:02.116
Promise?

544
00:36:07.563 --> 00:36:09.493
Put it in my coffin with me.

545
00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.858
Make sure no one knows.

546
00:36:12.858 --> 00:36:15.692
Oh, right. The ring.

547
00:36:15.692 --> 00:36:16.931
Where are you going?

548
00:36:16.931 --> 00:36:18.032
The mortuary.

549
00:36:18.032 --> 00:36:19.400
She's not in there.

550
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.603
Her family called an ambulance
and left for Seoul.

551
00:36:22.603 --> 00:36:24.502
Seoul?

552
00:36:25.697 --> 00:36:26.853
Why Seoul?

553
00:36:26.853 --> 00:36:29.516
They're going to have
her funeral in Seoul.

554
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.828
<i>In the end...</i>

555
00:36:35.947 --> 00:36:38.377
<i>I could not keep my promise to her.</i>

556
00:36:39.978 --> 00:36:43.206
<i>Grandma Bong Sook, I'm sorry.</i>

557
00:36:45.884 --> 00:36:48.791
<i>What are you going to do with that ring?</i>

558
00:36:48.791 --> 00:36:52.512
I don't know.
What would the best thing to do?

559
00:36:54.824 --> 00:36:57.853
I can't get it into her coffin anyway.

560
00:36:57.853 --> 00:37:00.397
Should I say I lost it and throw it out?

561
00:37:00.397 --> 00:37:01.469
<i>No!</i>

562
00:37:02.737 --> 00:37:03.960
Don't throw it out.

563
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.878
It was really hard for me to find.

564
00:37:06.878 --> 00:37:09.029
So, don't ever throw it out.

565
00:37:17.614 --> 00:37:18.661
Okay.

566
00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:23.063
Wow, amazing.

567
00:37:23.063 --> 00:37:24.485
Hey.

568
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:28.694
Hold on.

569
00:37:28.694 --> 00:37:32.480
Isn't Shi Kyung's birthday
coming up sometime soon?

570
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.130
What's the date today, Mother?

571
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.630
Shi Kyung's birthday is this weekend.

572
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.290
Already?

573
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:41.261
She says it's this weekend, Mother.

574
00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:44.340
Right? My memory is correct.

575
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.049
I better soak the rice
before it's too late.

576
00:37:49.049 --> 00:37:50.641
What will you do with soaked rice?

577
00:37:50.641 --> 00:37:53.790
I have to make rice cake,
Shi Kyung's birthday rice cake.

578
00:37:54.817 --> 00:37:56.136
Birthday rice cake?

579
00:37:56.136 --> 00:37:58.409
Grandma, Grandma!

580
00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:01.199
Then, can I invite friends over
for my birthday?

581
00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:03.641
Why bother asking something so obvious?

582
00:38:03.641 --> 00:38:08.121
Invite all the kids you performed
that dance with.

583
00:38:08.121 --> 00:38:10.922
Your grandma will feed them so full
that their bellies burst.

584
00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:13.212
Awesome. What a prize, Lee Shi Kyung.

585
00:38:13.212 --> 00:38:15.543
Mother, why cause a fuss like that?

586
00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:17.819
You can buy them fast food and feed them.

587
00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:20.799
Both his mother and grandma
are alive and well.

588
00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:23.340
You shouldn't buy them food.

589
00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:25.965
When it was Shi Yoon's birthday

590
00:38:25.965 --> 00:38:29.489
there was barely any room
for all his friends in this house.

591
00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:31.951
Mom, don't worry.

592
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:33.110
I don't have many friends.

593
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:39.772
Since things worked out this way,
make sure to bring Bom.

594
00:38:41.534 --> 00:38:43.190
<i>How does Mom know about Bom?</i>

595
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:46.681
Yesterday, the owner of the chicken place
came to the hospice.

596
00:38:46.681 --> 00:38:49.391
He made a big sale thanks to you and Bom.

597
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:52.380
He gave a deep bow
to your mom and your grandma.

598
00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.156
There's no need for that.

599
00:38:55.531 --> 00:38:58.273
Ah, is there anything
you want for your birthday?

600
00:39:00.248 --> 00:39:01.355
That.

601
00:39:01.355 --> 00:39:02.398
This?

602
00:39:02.398 --> 00:39:04.920
Hey, I can't give you this.

603
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.188
I was just saying it.

604
00:39:06.188 --> 00:39:09.179
Hey, you know that bike?

605
00:39:09.179 --> 00:39:12.014
It's the same model as the one
Lee Shi Young won from the talent show.

606
00:39:12.014 --> 00:39:14.090
Huh? Yes.

607
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:17.121
Park Ga Ram, do you know what
she did with that bike?

608
00:39:18.031 --> 00:39:20.877
I wanted to ride it, and
she just sold it off somewhere.

609
00:39:20.877 --> 00:39:23.407
Shi Young said she sold it?

610
00:39:23.407 --> 00:39:25.043
It's obvious even if she doesn't say so.

611
00:39:25.043 --> 00:39:28.118
She sold it to buy those trash clothes.

612
00:39:29.168 --> 00:39:31.034
You said you want to divide
Lee Shi Young.

613
00:39:31.034 --> 00:39:33.753
If you're going to take her,
take her away quickly.

614
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.797
You're all going to Shi Kyung's
birthday party, right?

615
00:39:45.797 --> 00:39:49.337
Yes, what are you going
to buy him for his birthday?

616
00:39:49.337 --> 00:39:52.237
The hardest thing is picking a gift.

617
00:39:52.237 --> 00:39:53.839
I was wondering that too.

618
00:39:53.839 --> 00:39:56.531
Why don't we pool our money
and buy him something?

619
00:39:56.531 --> 00:39:58.429
- Let's do that.
- Sounds great.

620
00:40:01.817 --> 00:40:05.616
Bom... let's get her to join too.

621
00:40:05.616 --> 00:40:07.944
Hey, is Bom the same as us?

622
00:40:07.944 --> 00:40:12.623
She's Shi Kyung's girlfriend,
so she must have a special gift for him.

623
00:40:12.623 --> 00:40:13.940
A kiss?

624
00:40:20.498 --> 00:40:22.288
You... come see me.

625
00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:35.217
Lee Shi Kyung, am I
really your girlfriend?

626
00:40:35.217 --> 00:40:37.098
Why are you asking something
you already know?

627
00:40:37.098 --> 00:40:39.357
Then, why didn't you invite me
to your birthday party?

628
00:40:39.357 --> 00:40:42.165
Oh, that's all it is.
Is that why you're upset?

629
00:40:42.165 --> 00:40:43.529
"That's all it is"?

630
00:40:43.529 --> 00:40:47.186
Hey, a girlfriend wasn't invited
to her boyfriend's birthday party.

631
00:40:47.186 --> 00:40:49.654
If this wouldn't upset me,
then what would?

632
00:40:49.654 --> 00:40:51.288
- <i>At times like this...</i>
- Huh?

633
00:40:51.288 --> 00:40:53.192
<i>Bom seems like the women in my house.</i>

634
00:40:53.192 --> 00:40:55.121
Why aren't you saying anything?

635
00:40:58.329 --> 00:40:59.587
I'm sorry.

636
00:41:00.328 --> 00:41:04.119
I was going to tell you,
but I was strangely embarrassed.

637
00:41:04.978 --> 00:41:07.607
Embarrassed? Why?

638
00:41:07.607 --> 00:41:09.869
My mom told me to bring you.

639
00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:15.188
It seems like a formal greeting
if my girlfriend is going to meet my mom.

640
00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:17.288
A formal greeting?

641
00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:20.907
- Are you planning to marry me?
- What?

642
00:41:20.907 --> 00:41:23.373
A formal greeting comes before marriage.

643
00:41:23.465 --> 00:41:26.904
So, you've even
thought about marrying me.

644
00:41:26.904 --> 00:41:29.123
<i>Is that what it means?</i>

645
00:41:29.123 --> 00:41:33.735
<i>Ah, why am I always inflicting
useless inner conflict onto myself?</i>

646
00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:35.904
Get up.

647
00:41:41.067 --> 00:41:43.523
Don't kneel in front
of anyone other than me.

648
00:41:43.523 --> 00:41:45.038
Okay.

649
00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.579
What do you want for your birthday?

650
00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:50.163
I haven't thought about it.

651
00:41:50.163 --> 00:41:51.739
Think about it, and let me know.

652
00:41:51.739 --> 00:41:52.878
I'll do that.

653
00:41:52.878 --> 00:41:54.889
Oh yeah. Here.

654
00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.518
Why are you giving this to me?

655
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:03.599
Bom, you found it, so it seems right
for you to keep it.

656
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.724
You didn't tell Shi Kyung
that you gave me this bike.

657
00:42:12.724 --> 00:42:14.476
Why didn't you tell him?

658
00:42:14.476 --> 00:42:15.500
Just because.

659
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.766
Shi Kyung and I aren't the type
to tell each other every little detail.

660
00:42:19.766 --> 00:42:24.496
I thought you had some other reason,
so I didn't say anything.

661
00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:27.060
I've become a liar.

662
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.473
Oh, it's fine.

663
00:42:28.473 --> 00:42:31.614
Compared to Lee Shi Kyung,
this kind of lie is nothing.

664
00:42:31.614 --> 00:42:34.244
You don't need to feel guilty at all.

665
00:42:34.244 --> 00:42:37.395
I don't feel guilty.
I just feel a little bad.

666
00:42:37.395 --> 00:42:39.025
Oh, you goody two-shoes.

667
00:42:39.025 --> 00:42:42.224
You've never lied to your parents
and rebelled, have you?

668
00:42:42.224 --> 00:42:43.244
Is that how I seem?

669
00:42:43.244 --> 00:42:45.494
I have lots of secrets too.

670
00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:56.217
Oh, that feels good.

671
00:42:57.065 --> 00:42:59.944
Your hands feel great.

672
00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.627
You should try not to talk
and just close your eyes.

673
00:43:02.627 --> 00:43:07.846
Once you get some sleep,
your body will feel much lighter.

674
00:43:08.648 --> 00:43:09.936
I think I'll do that.

675
00:43:22.047 --> 00:43:23.576
What am I thinking?

676
00:43:23.576 --> 00:43:25.938
I'm not done yet.

677
00:43:34.775 --> 00:43:37.286
It's fine. Can you please leave?

678
00:43:37.286 --> 00:43:40.277
All right, then. I will go.

679
00:44:02.027 --> 00:44:04.206
- Yes, my daughter.
- Mom!

680
00:44:05.864 --> 00:44:08.962
Mom, what's with the towel on your head?
Are you at a sauna?

681
00:44:09.623 --> 00:44:12.826
No, I'm at a massage clinic.
I'm getting a massage.

682
00:44:15.882 --> 00:44:19.243
Mom, I really miss you.

683
00:44:19.243 --> 00:44:20.505
Me too.

684
00:44:20.505 --> 00:44:23.069
I miss you so much too.

685
00:44:24.592 --> 00:44:26.753
- A child in high school?
- Yes.

686
00:44:26.753 --> 00:44:29.628
All a nurse needs to do
is be good at being a nurse.

687
00:44:29.628 --> 00:44:33.518
Why does she care if her child
is in junior high or high school?

688
00:44:33.518 --> 00:44:37.828
The patient, Song Kyung Ae's daughter is
a junior at an international high school.

689
00:44:37.828 --> 00:44:40.451
She has a lot she needs
to organize for her.

690
00:44:40.451 --> 00:44:44.409
Because she's sick,
she needs someone to help her.

691
00:44:44.409 --> 00:44:47.757
She could die today or tomorrow.

692
00:44:47.757 --> 00:44:49.940
She really is acting over the top.

693
00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.980
Her daughter's attending an international
high school because of her mother.

694
00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.172
Do you know anyone?

695
00:44:57.172 --> 00:44:59.429
Someone with a child in high school?

696
00:44:59.429 --> 00:45:02.567
Also, someone who could be a nurse
to Song Kyung Ae.

697
00:45:03.482 --> 00:45:06.364
Well, there are plenty of nurses.

698
00:45:22.974 --> 00:45:25.070
What should I ask Bom
to give me for my birthday?

699
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.415
What is it that you want?

700
00:45:27.415 --> 00:45:28.471
Smart phone!

701
00:45:29.543 --> 00:45:30.732
Money?

702
00:45:30.732 --> 00:45:35.132
Not stuff you want from your mom.
What do you want from Bom?

703
00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.362
I don't know, and that's why
I'm asking you.

704
00:45:37.362 --> 00:45:40.395
How would I know if you don't, you dummy?

705
00:45:41.643 --> 00:45:43.253
<i>Honestly, I know.</i>

706
00:45:43.253 --> 00:45:47.243
<i>I know what I want
for my birthday from Bom.</i>

707
00:46:16.656 --> 00:46:18.156
What are you doing right now?

708
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.335
Gosh, were you kissing in your dreams?

709
00:46:22.335 --> 00:46:23.715
With whom? Bom?

710
00:46:23.715 --> 00:46:25.647
Get out. You better get out.

711
00:46:25.647 --> 00:46:28.016
Mom! Shi Kyung and Bom were...

712
00:46:29.536 --> 00:46:32.279
Mom! Shi Kyung and Bom were kiss...

713
00:46:32.279 --> 00:46:33.645
<i>What did you say?</i>

714
00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:35.545
<i>What did Shi Kyung do?</i>

715
00:46:35.545 --> 00:46:37.828
- It's nothing.
- Mom!

716
00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.967
- We're just playing around.
- Lee Shi Kyung.

717
00:46:40.587 --> 00:46:43.054
No, no. We're just kidding around.

718
00:46:43.054 --> 00:46:44.804
Hey. You better be quiet.

719
00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:55.373
Really?

720
00:46:56.657 --> 00:46:57.714
Yeah.

721
00:46:58.942 --> 00:47:00.152
Yes

722
00:47:00.152 --> 00:47:03.996
If the student she taught last year got
into a top college, then it sounds good.

723
00:47:03.996 --> 00:47:07.465
Can you give me that teacher's number?

724
00:47:08.297 --> 00:47:10.199
Thank you, Yae In's mom.

725
00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:12.070
Okay.

726
00:47:14.661 --> 00:47:17.313
Here is the nurse
you requested last time.

727
00:47:18.272 --> 00:47:19.467
Hello.

728
00:47:19.467 --> 00:47:23.663
She hasn't received her
nursing certification yet.

729
00:47:23.663 --> 00:47:26.583
She is currently taking classes
for medical treatment and care.

730
00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:29.724
- We are associated with that school--
- What about your kids?

731
00:47:31.493 --> 00:47:33.953
I have a son and daughter
who are juniors in high school.

732
00:47:33.953 --> 00:47:37.364
If they are juniors in high school,
we'll be able to converse easily.

733
00:47:37.364 --> 00:47:39.744
- Name?
- Oh Jung Won.

734
00:47:39.744 --> 00:47:41.306
I don't mean your name.

735
00:47:41.306 --> 00:47:42.482
Your children's names.

736
00:47:44.476 --> 00:47:46.134
My son's name is Shi Kyung.

737
00:47:46.996 --> 00:47:48.503
You can call me Shi Kyung's mom.

738
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:53.172
I look forward to our time together,
Shi Kyung's mom.

739
00:47:53.172 --> 00:47:54.255
Yes.

740
00:47:57.893 --> 00:48:02.313
The word baroque means imperfect pearl.

741
00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:05.723
Why did the classics use this expression?

742
00:48:05.723 --> 00:48:10.503
Oh well, it was because
of the traits of baroque music.

743
00:48:12.828 --> 00:48:16.150
One of the traits
of baroque was monody...

744
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.339
Gosh! It's so noisy that I can't sleep!

745
00:48:24.436 --> 00:48:26.328
Excuse me, you there.

746
00:48:28.286 --> 00:48:29.286
What?

747
00:48:34.174 --> 00:48:35.311
The consultation office.

748
00:48:35.815 --> 00:48:38.331
Go to the consultation
office after class.

749
00:48:47.996 --> 00:48:49.674
You called me here. Say something.

750
00:48:49.674 --> 00:48:52.333
Hey, now. I was about to.

751
00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:54.103
Yong Gi, you...

752
00:48:56.753 --> 00:48:58.101
Do you want to come to our house?

753
00:48:59.246 --> 00:49:00.295
What?

754
00:49:00.295 --> 00:49:04.625
Huh? Well, not my house.

755
00:49:04.625 --> 00:49:05.935
Shi Kyung's house.

756
00:49:05.935 --> 00:49:09.092
Come over for Shi Kyung's birthday.

757
00:49:18.404 --> 00:49:21.235
How was your first class today?

758
00:49:21.235 --> 00:49:22.835
It was good.

759
00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:25.815
The kids followed along well
and took notes too.

760
00:49:25.815 --> 00:49:28.232
They answered questions
when I asked them.

761
00:49:28.232 --> 00:49:30.583
Really? Wow!

762
00:49:30.583 --> 00:49:32.715
What a betrayal.

763
00:49:32.715 --> 00:49:34.431
They discriminate like this.

764
00:49:34.431 --> 00:49:37.241
They were really terrible
during my first class.

765
00:49:37.241 --> 00:49:39.471
Half were sleeping, and half
were doing something else.

766
00:49:39.471 --> 00:49:43.692
I started to wonder why
I became a teacher at all.

767
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.741
- To tell you the truth...
- Ms. Oh.

768
00:49:49.261 --> 00:49:51.714
- How was your class today?
- Excuse me?

769
00:49:51.714 --> 00:49:56.277
Did anyone ruin your class today
like Lee Shi Kyung did last time?

770
00:49:56.277 --> 00:49:58.846
No, that didn't happen.

771
00:49:58.846 --> 00:50:02.007
Apparently, her class went great.

772
00:50:02.007 --> 00:50:03.221
Really?

773
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:04.552
That's unlike that class.

774
00:50:04.552 --> 00:50:05.730
Right?

775
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.940
Ms. Oh.

776
00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.253
Unless you want to get pushed around,
you have to do well from the beginning.

777
00:50:10.253 --> 00:50:13.228
The relationship between teacher
and student is like a married couple.

778
00:50:13.228 --> 00:50:16.465
You have to take control
right from the very start!

779
00:50:16.465 --> 00:50:17.665
Do you understand?

780
00:50:17.665 --> 00:50:19.560
Yes.

781
00:50:31.846 --> 00:50:34.686
This is a list of the things
my Soo Bin needs for her personnel file.

782
00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:39.277
These are the things she needs
for her personal history.

783
00:50:39.277 --> 00:50:42.677
This is a report
of her reading activities.

784
00:50:42.677 --> 00:50:45.960
This is a report of the subjects
she has learned and her progress.

785
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.811
Also, a report of her creative arts.

786
00:50:50.261 --> 00:50:52.632
What is that?

787
00:50:52.632 --> 00:50:54.583
Her participation in the creative arts.

788
00:50:57.442 --> 00:50:59.743
Don't you know about clubs or charities?

789
00:51:01.255 --> 00:51:02.413
Ah...

790
00:51:03.962 --> 00:51:08.241
You can earn two points during evaluation
for admissions, so it's important.

791
00:51:09.362 --> 00:51:12.643
It's so much and so complicated.
You take care of all of this?

792
00:51:12.643 --> 00:51:16.692
I can't leave this to a child
who's already working hard studying.

793
00:51:16.692 --> 00:51:19.282
It's so hard to rank second
at an international high school.

794
00:51:19.282 --> 00:51:22.302
She sleeps three to four hours
a day and studies.

795
00:51:22.302 --> 00:51:24.284
I feel so bad for her.

796
00:51:24.284 --> 00:51:26.583
You feel that way too, right?

797
00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:29.384
Yes, I suppose I do.

798
00:51:32.174 --> 00:51:35.364
I feel like I'm in a cafe
talking here with you.

799
00:51:35.364 --> 00:51:37.060
A cafe?

800
00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.096
You know after you send the kids off
to the tutoring academies...

801
00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:44.052
Moms gather to talk
and share information.

802
00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:47.190
Yes.

803
00:51:50.123 --> 00:51:52.364
Thinking about those times
is making me crave coffee.

804
00:51:53.958 --> 00:51:57.710
Shi Kyung's mom, I'd like
to have some good drip coffee.

805
00:52:04.672 --> 00:52:06.186
Look at that.

806
00:52:18.103 --> 00:52:20.034
<i>Shi Kyung, run an errand for me.</i>

807
00:52:22.784 --> 00:52:26.185
<i>Mother, your son is working on the
upcoming performance assessments.</i>

808
00:52:29.259 --> 00:52:30.485
It's so funny.

809
00:52:40.453 --> 00:52:41.536
Lee Shi Young.

810
00:52:42.424 --> 00:52:44.384
- Mom.
- What are you doing here?

811
00:52:45.652 --> 00:52:47.762
- What are these clothes?
- These?

812
00:52:48.804 --> 00:52:50.243
The uniform for here.

813
00:52:50.243 --> 00:52:53.353
But, why are you wearing the uniform?

814
00:52:53.353 --> 00:52:55.273
Are you working here?

815
00:52:56.384 --> 00:52:57.627
Yes, yes.

816
00:52:57.627 --> 00:52:58.704
For how long?

817
00:52:58.704 --> 00:53:00.177
Not even a month.

818
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:03.295
You should have told me
if you were going to do this.

819
00:53:03.295 --> 00:53:05.152
How could you do this without telling me?

820
00:53:05.152 --> 00:53:07.257
I was only going to do it for a month.

821
00:53:08.436 --> 00:53:10.085
Only for a month, right?

822
00:53:10.085 --> 00:53:11.175
Yes.

823
00:53:11.175 --> 00:53:14.514
Why are you here and not at the hospice?

824
00:53:14.514 --> 00:53:16.284
Oh...

825
00:53:17.308 --> 00:53:19.804
I wanted some coffee, so I bought some.

826
00:53:19.804 --> 00:53:23.270
Lady Oh, how cool of you.

827
00:53:24.228 --> 00:53:27.438
Shi Kyung said he's studying for the
performance assessment with friends.

828
00:53:27.438 --> 00:53:28.768
Don't you need to?

829
00:53:28.768 --> 00:53:29.933
What do you mean?

830
00:53:29.933 --> 00:53:33.143
Lee Shi Kyung is watching
a movie with his girlfriend.

831
00:53:38.964 --> 00:53:40.308
Seriously, that kid.
