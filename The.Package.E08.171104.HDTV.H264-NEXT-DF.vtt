<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:23.850
<i>I wonder who this person is.</i>

4
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:34.059
Did you cry to your heart's content?

5
00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:38.681
<i>- Is he a cat?</i>
- So So!

6
00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.476
What is it?

7
00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:41.921
Help me.

8
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.549
<i>Is he a puppy?</i>

9
00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:51.662
- Why are you back already?
- Because I missed you.

10
00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:55.080
<i>Is he a fox?</i>

11
00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.507
Sleep with me tonight.

12
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:03.635
<i>Is it fate?</i>

13
00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:18.681
<i>I wonder...</i>

14
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.479
<i>how long I'll have him for.</i>

15
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.991
<i>[The time it takes to break up.]</i>

16
00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:54.146
So So, wait.

17
00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:04.274
Talk to me. Talk to me!

18
00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.755
- It hurts.
- Does it hurt?

19
00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:11.113
Yes.

20
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.213
Love always hurts.

21
00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:23.149
Are you a pervert?
How could you imagine that?

22
00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.160
I saw everything. Why are you surprised?

23
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.101
What did you see?

24
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:30.106
Madam, it's a big size.

25
00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:35.088
I said it was a friend's request.
What about you?

26
00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.500
You bought something more perverted.

27
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.160
Mine was a friend's request too.

28
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.637
I can tell what you're like by knowing
your friend's taste. You're the same.

29
00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:52.927
<i>You should tell me now.
Don't make me childishly ask you.</i>

30
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.885
This friend was my high school classmate.

31
00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:02.667
- His name was Na Byung Sae.
<i>- Not about your friend.</i>

32
00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.784
We entered the same company.

33
00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.939
- We're in the same department.
<i>- Not about your company either.</i>

34
00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.064
We joined the military together,
but he became a foot soldier

35
00:03:12.064 --> 00:03:14.806
and I joined the special forces.

36
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:19.362
<i>- Don't talk about the military.</i>
- I worked in search operations.

37
00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:22.604
I mainly worked at the DMZ.

38
00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:26.854
What about your girlfriend?
Did you make up?

39
00:03:26.854 --> 00:03:30.570
<i>In the end, you made me
ask this childish question.</i>

40
00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.459
- I have nothing to say to her.
<i>- Did you break up?</i>

41
00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.731
I don't want to say
anything to her either.

42
00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:42.973
<i>Maybe not.</i>

43
00:03:43.684 --> 00:03:45.313
Let's just talk about us.

44
00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:49.132
<i>This is about us, stupid.</i>

45
00:03:51.223 --> 00:03:53.552
I didn't ask because I was curious.

46
00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:57.843
You just seem like a player
who doesn't look like one.

47
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.635
Hold on.

48
00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:05.172
Hey, wait.

49
00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:07.938
- What are you doing? Wait.
- Hey, wait...

50
00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.055
Hello?
(In French)

51
00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:33.638
You called me out at this hour!
How long are we supposed to wait for?

52
00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:35.360
Don't yell.

53
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.715
At a time like this,
the louder voice wins.

54
00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:39.799
Tell your boss to come out here!

55
00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:44.617
Call his cell phone! Answer me!

56
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:48.237
If you continue to yell,
I won't treat you like a customer.

57
00:04:48.237 --> 00:04:51.311
Yeah, you should answer me.
You finally understood me.

58
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:53.739
Call your boss down here!

59
00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:56.340
What's the matter?

60
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.374
Hey, Big Sis Guide, good thing
you're here. Talk to him.

61
00:05:01.374 --> 00:05:04.054
Why are they asking you
to leave your room?

62
00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:07.542
What? They want me to leave?
Are you telling me to leave?

63
00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:10.242
This is a final warning.
Please don't yell.

64
00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:13.377
- What did he say?
- He told you to quiet down.

65
00:05:13.377 --> 00:05:14.626
How can I quiet down right now?

66
00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:16.790
I'll report you to the police
for public disturbance.

67
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.362
Wait, please wait.

68
00:05:19.362 --> 00:05:21.883
I'll listen to what he has to say first.

69
00:05:23.843 --> 00:05:26.115
- What?
- Right, my bad.

70
00:05:26.115 --> 00:05:30.439
- First, calm down.
- Why don't you catch your breath first?

71
00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.032
- Hello!
- Hey!

72
00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:37.071
Earlier, I lay down to sleep

73
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:40.357
but these punks pounded on my door...

74
00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:42.614
They didn't pound.
They rang the door bell.

75
00:05:42.614 --> 00:05:46.266
Yeah, they pressed it
as if they were pounding it.

76
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:50.441
I opened the door in shock,
and they dragged us down here.

77
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.699
Did you do anything wrong?
Did you damage anything or yell...

78
00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.718
Do I look like I yell all the time?

79
00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:59.489
I understand, Father. Please wait.

80
00:06:00.963 --> 00:06:04.093
He said he did nothing wrong.

81
00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:10.540
Are you sure about that?

82
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.826
- What's this?
- Open it.

83
00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:22.807
Please tie it back up.

84
00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.713
Father, what's this?

85
00:06:28.713 --> 00:06:31.100
It's ripened kimchi stew.

86
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.552
What do I do?

87
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.333
I'm really sorry. It was his fault.

88
00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:40.949
Do you know how many customer
complaints we received because of it?

89
00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:42.566
I'm really sorry.

90
00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:45.703
He'll be careful
not to do this ever again.

91
00:06:45.703 --> 00:06:49.692
I'll follow the regulations.
I will kick him out of his room

92
00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:52.138
and charge him 600 euros
for curtain and bedding cleaning

93
00:06:52.138 --> 00:06:54.924
and 500 euros for the three-day
vacancy of his room.

94
00:06:54.924 --> 00:06:59.773
That's a total of 1,100 euros
that he needs to pay.

95
00:06:59.773 --> 00:07:01.792
I will formally apologize.

96
00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:05.439
There's no use.
He just needs to pay the fee.

97
00:07:09.073 --> 00:07:12.677
- You can't eat this in your room.
- Why not?

98
00:07:12.677 --> 00:07:15.386
Everyone cooks
in their rooms on vacation.

99
00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:18.167
People can't stand
the smell of kimchi here.

100
00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:22.410
He's going to charge you
for cleaning and loss of customers.

101
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.752
- Around 1.5 million won.
- 1.5 million?

102
00:07:24.752 --> 00:07:26.530
Goodness.

103
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.468
Wait, is it a crime for
a Korean to eat kimchi?

104
00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:34.603
Do you see me as a pushover?

105
00:07:34.603 --> 00:07:36.199
Call the police!

106
00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.028
Last year, another customer
made crab stew in their coffee pot.

107
00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:44.412
They called the police after fighting,
but ended up paying two million won.

108
00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:46.937
In situations like this,
you have no other choice.

109
00:07:46.937 --> 00:07:50.415
Please tell him we're sorry.
We can't pay 1.5 million won.

110
00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:52.115
What?

111
00:07:53.383 --> 00:07:58.927
I... wasn't trying to cook
ripened kimchi stew.

112
00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:03.634
I brought kimchi here,
but it ripened itself

113
00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:05.780
so it became ripened kimchi.

114
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.898
That's right. Please tell him that.

115
00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:12.989
If they refuse to pay,
I'll call the police.

116
00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:15.189
Please wait a moment.

117
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:18.511
If... if only you ate properly.

118
00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:21.081
This happened because you wouldn't eat.

119
00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:24.963
I'm sure there's medicine
that people don't know of.

120
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.896
Medicine that cures cancer
and lack of appetite.

121
00:08:28.807 --> 00:08:31.941
- I'll talk to the manager.
- What could you possibly say?

122
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:34.972
It's a lot of money,
and it'll ruin their vacation.

123
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.777
We should reason with him.

124
00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:40.704
There's no use. They don't have the
same kind of affection Koreans have.

125
00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:43.776
It's still worth a try.
Father, can I give it a try?

126
00:08:43.776 --> 00:08:45.223
Yeah, go ahead.

127
00:08:58.502 --> 00:09:03.260
French people
are really asking for it now.

128
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.387
This is why I don't want to
go anywhere with you.

129
00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:11.561
You ate two bowls of rice
saying it was delicious.

130
00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:13.405
This woman.

131
00:09:19.613 --> 00:09:22.810
That lady is very sick.

132
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.251
Really? In what way?

133
00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:28.799
People naturally grow ill
as they get older.

134
00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.589
Please tell him that.

135
00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:38.609
That lady has late stage cancer,
so she's terminally ill.

136
00:09:38.609 --> 00:09:42.163
That's why she's embarked
on her very last vacation.

137
00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:45.487
She said she wanted to go to
France more than anywhere else.

138
00:09:45.487 --> 00:09:50.079
And she especially wanted
to come here, to Honfleur.

139
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:54.958
That lady has late state cancer,
so she's terminally ill.

140
00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.299
That's why she came here
for her last vacation.

141
00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:02.304
She said she wanted to go to France
more than anywhere else.

142
00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:04.623
And she especially wanted to
come here, to Honfleur.

143
00:10:04.623 --> 00:10:06.966
Imagine you went
on a vacation with your wife

144
00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:10.925
but you had to eat
English food all week long.

145
00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:15.318
Imagine you went on
a vacation with your wife

146
00:10:15.318 --> 00:10:19.255
but had to eat English food
all week long.

147
00:10:19.255 --> 00:10:20.674
Oh my goodness.

148
00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:26.308
French food is the best
in the world, but they're old now

149
00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:28.872
so they can't adjust to new foods.

150
00:10:28.872 --> 00:10:33.163
The wife starved for a few days,
and the husband... had to do something.

151
00:10:33.163 --> 00:10:40.318
English food tastes like hell,
and French food tastes like heaven.

152
00:10:40.318 --> 00:10:45.896
But they're old, so they're
unable to adjust to new foods.

153
00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:55.115
The wife starved for a few days,
and the husband had to do something.

154
00:10:59.178 --> 00:11:00.857
I'm begging you.

155
00:11:00.857 --> 00:11:05.779
Can't you show kindness to those people
who are here for their last vacation?

156
00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:11.607
I'm begging you. Please be kind
to those people on their last vacation.

157
00:11:11.607 --> 00:11:14.803
Why is that punk
glancing over at us like that?

158
00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:21.269
It's resolved. It must be resolved.

159
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.573
It has been resolved.
It's all thanks to him.

160
00:11:28.573 --> 00:11:30.348
What did you say to him?

161
00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:32.713
I said Koreans usually
eat in their hotel rooms.

162
00:11:32.713 --> 00:11:34.300
I asked for his forgiveness.

163
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.597
- You're an elite, after all.
- Please go back up and sleep.

164
00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:41.272
But you mustn't cook kimchi stew
in your room ever again, okay?

165
00:11:41.272 --> 00:11:43.459
Won't it be okay in other hotels?

166
00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:46.030
We won't do it ever again. We're sorry.

167
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.690
Madam?

168
00:11:49.061 --> 00:11:50.958
Who is he calling "Madam"?

169
00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.665
Thank you for coming to France.

170
00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:57.027
This is a gift from the hotel.

171
00:11:57.027 --> 00:11:59.963
Take it. It's a gift from the hotel.

172
00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:03.959
Gosh, you don't have to do that.

173
00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:06.145
Thank you very much.

174
00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:08.102
Have a good vacation.

175
00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:14.810
- What's this bastard doing to my wife?
- You're such a good husband.

176
00:12:18.232 --> 00:12:21.665
I'll let it go just this once, got it?

177
00:12:21.665 --> 00:12:23.959
Father!

178
00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:30.251
You surprised me.
How could you lie so naturally?

179
00:12:30.925 --> 00:12:34.719
It was half true.
This will be their last vacation.

180
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:38.065
Why? Does she really have cancer?

181
00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:43.583
No, my parents also
fought on their vacation

182
00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:45.881
and agreed to never
travel together again.

183
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:53.026
- Come inside.
- I don't enter my customers' rooms.

184
00:12:53.026 --> 00:12:54.641
I'll go now.

185
00:12:57.372 --> 00:12:59.569
I'm not a customer, though.

186
00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:03.190
I'm a guide. I'll see you tomorrow.

187
00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:06.622
I'll walk you back.

188
00:13:19.102 --> 00:13:21.372
- How did it go?
- I had diarrhea.

189
00:13:21.372 --> 00:13:23.347
Geez, does it hurt a lot?

190
00:13:23.347 --> 00:13:25.996
Your stomach must be upset
because of what you ate.

191
00:13:25.996 --> 00:13:29.410
I'm sure a glass of wine
will make it better.

192
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.216
You look really pretty right now.

193
00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:55.707
Thanks.

194
00:13:55.707 --> 00:13:59.598
Did you know the guide is having
a fling with the solo traveler?

195
00:13:59.598 --> 00:14:02.240
They were together at dawn.

196
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.104
- When?
- Yesterday.

197
00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:07.199
I caught them together on my way
down from watching the sunrise.

198
00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:10.536
They had grass on their backs.

199
00:14:10.536 --> 00:14:13.525
- That means they lay down together.
- Really?

200
00:14:13.525 --> 00:14:17.447
- 100 percent sure.
- Wow, that's so cool.

201
00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:23.294
They say the best love
happens in a third country.

202
00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:26.271
Not my country, not your country

203
00:14:26.271 --> 00:14:29.202
but an explosive love that
happens in a different country.

204
00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.564
How is that love?
They're just playing with fire.

205
00:14:31.564 --> 00:14:35.425
Why not? It's love
for as long as it's lit up.

206
00:14:35.998 --> 00:14:37.751
On that note...

207
00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:41.334
On that note?

208
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:43.559
You know...

209
00:14:49.819 --> 00:14:53.246
This is a third country for us.

210
00:14:53.246 --> 00:14:57.365
It's not my country,
and it's not your country either.

211
00:14:58.984 --> 00:15:00.545
I love you.

212
00:15:03.555 --> 00:15:05.144
I'm on my period.

213
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.238
- What?
- I started my period.

214
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.399
Hey, do you really want to be
on your period in France?

215
00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:42.967
You're tired, or you have to poop.
I set up a romantic mood in France.

216
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:45.261
Don't you have a conscience?

217
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:47.064
My stomach hurts.
Is that what's important?

218
00:15:47.064 --> 00:15:49.058
How is it not important?

219
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.061
Forget it. I'm going to sleep.

220
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:54.818
Yeah, don't worry about me.

221
00:16:26.683 --> 00:16:29.438
Do you only have pajamas
that make you look middle-aged?

222
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:35.832
This is the best. It's easy to
put on and take off. It's breezy too.

223
00:16:35.832 --> 00:16:38.424
It makes you look unattractive.

224
00:16:44.728 --> 00:16:47.877
What is it? Did that woman
tell you she loves you?

225
00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:54.568
- It's my colleague.
- You're lying.

226
00:16:54.568 --> 00:16:56.251
I'm telling the truth.

227
00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:58.170
I said I'm telling the truth.

228
00:17:02.203 --> 00:17:03.602
It's true, though.

229
00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:08.976
Should play the truth game?

230
00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:12.671
We shouldn't play games
with the truth. I'm not playing.

231
00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:14.771
- Play.
- No.

232
00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:17.601
I'll start. Why did you ask me
to come on this vacation?

233
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:20.742
- Because I love you.
- This is the truth game.

234
00:17:20.742 --> 00:17:22.332
Tell me the truth.

235
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:25.584
Why did you ask me
to come on this vacation?

236
00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:35.051
Why do you think I came here with you?

237
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.490
Geez, seriously.

238
00:17:55.791 --> 00:17:57.104
So Ran.

239
00:17:59.065 --> 00:18:00.546
Han So Ran.

240
00:18:02.162 --> 00:18:06.245
Hey, get up. Get up, Han So Ran. Hurry.

241
00:18:06.245 --> 00:18:09.846
- Hurry!
- Don't do that!

242
00:18:09.846 --> 00:18:13.302
Take your medicine.
You don't have painkillers.

243
00:18:13.302 --> 00:18:16.793
I bought you chocolate too.
I'll get you water.

244
00:18:29.081 --> 00:18:30.232
Here.

245
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.211
Don't be sick.

246
00:19:05.068 --> 00:19:07.837
Tour guides don't have
nights and days, do they?

247
00:19:07.837 --> 00:19:13.560
I'm everyone's mother, teacher,
and maid until the end of their trip.

248
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.579
It's not an easy job, is it?

249
00:19:16.581 --> 00:19:19.666
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

250
00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:24.615
<i>You should ask if you
can come inside, stupid.</i>

251
00:19:26.713 --> 00:19:28.132
Have a good night.

252
00:19:29.214 --> 00:19:30.640
Goodbye.

253
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.182
Does it still hurt?

254
00:19:53.182 --> 00:19:56.260
I wonder why. It's been a while
since I took the medicine.

255
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.221
Is it weak because it's from
an advanced country?

256
00:19:59.221 --> 00:20:02.484
Is it really a painkiller?
Why don't you look it up?

257
00:20:02.484 --> 00:20:05.092
Hey, I told you it is.

258
00:20:23.735 --> 00:20:27.565
- Why is this digestive medicine?
- What did you ask for?

259
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.192
No me. No me.

260
00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.379
Girlfriend. Girlfriend.

261
00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:40.291
Stomach. Stomach pain.

262
00:20:41.776 --> 00:20:45.495
Yes. Yes. You know what I mean, right?

263
00:20:47.382 --> 00:20:49.693
I'm going crazy.

264
00:20:49.693 --> 00:20:53.403
You made fun of me for my English,
but you can't even buy painkillers.

265
00:20:53.403 --> 00:20:55.754
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

266
00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:59.732
I said it correctly. He must have
misunderstood. I'll be back.

267
00:20:59.732 --> 00:21:03.180
That's okay. Don't go.
Just keep my stomach warm.

268
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.184
- Should I?
- Yeah.

269
00:21:05.184 --> 00:21:06.834
Okay.

270
00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:19.576
I'm sorry for getting mad at you
when you're sick.

271
00:21:27.242 --> 00:21:31.609
<i>There are people who split up
because of one bad thing.</i>

272
00:21:31.609 --> 00:21:36.578
<i>And there are people who can't split up
because of one good thing.</i>

273
00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:39.315
<i>He's warm.</i>

274
00:22:06.387 --> 00:22:08.684
I wish he could have gone a size bigger.

275
00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:24.273
What is it? Did you forget something?

276
00:22:24.273 --> 00:22:27.394
No, I want to sleep here tonight.

277
00:22:33.849 --> 00:22:36.062
What is it? Did you forget something?

278
00:22:36.062 --> 00:22:39.224
No, I want to sleep here tonight.

279
00:22:40.722 --> 00:22:43.126
A customer can enter
the guide's room, right?

280
00:22:44.665 --> 00:22:47.749
Are we... allowed to do this?

281
00:22:47.749 --> 00:22:52.455
There will always be a tomorrow,
but there won't be another today.

282
00:23:30.635 --> 00:23:34.413
Boss, please send my sister home.

283
00:23:37.434 --> 00:23:40.242
How can I control an animal
with its own two feet?

284
00:23:40.242 --> 00:23:42.615
Hurry up and go. You'll miss your flight.

285
00:23:44.837 --> 00:23:47.052
I usually don't do this.

286
00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:57.634
Thank you, for taking care
of my big sister.

287
00:23:58.858 --> 00:24:01.011
What are you doing? This isn't like you.

288
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:06.896
Please help me by sending
my big sister home later.

289
00:24:09.412 --> 00:24:10.875
Take a seat.

290
00:24:20.885 --> 00:24:24.644
Everyone goes on a vacation
sometime in their lives.

291
00:24:24.644 --> 00:24:30.152
It could be for couple of days,
or for a year to 10 years.

292
00:24:30.152 --> 00:24:31.846
That's what So So is doing.

293
00:24:31.846 --> 00:24:36.252
It seems like she's been
on this vacation for a long time.

294
00:24:37.176 --> 00:24:42.915
But no matter who it is, everyone
goes back home after their vacation.

295
00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:44.412
Got that?

296
00:24:46.337 --> 00:24:47.633
Here.

297
00:24:48.488 --> 00:24:52.614
Buy some macarons
on your way to the airport.

298
00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:59.514
Boss, when I meet you again...

299
00:24:59.514 --> 00:25:01.349
I'll treat you like my big brother.

300
00:25:01.349 --> 00:25:03.706
Don't treat me like your big brother

301
00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:07.646
and just be a good son
to your parents, okay?

302
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.695
Wow, this is nice.

303
00:25:20.695 --> 00:25:24.301
- We should grill meat here.
- Right, Father?

304
00:25:24.301 --> 00:25:26.357
It's even better when it rains.

305
00:25:26.357 --> 00:25:30.634
If you sit over there, and grill
some pork belly with soju...

306
00:25:31.853 --> 00:25:33.911
Big Sis Guide knows what's up!

307
00:25:33.911 --> 00:25:37.396
I can't do my job without knowing that.

308
00:25:37.396 --> 00:25:40.443
Honfleur used to be a war city.

309
00:25:40.443 --> 00:25:45.379
During the Hundred Years' War,
France and England battled here.

310
00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:49.230
If you go over there,
it's England's territory.

311
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.059
After the war,
it became the city of explorers.

312
00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:57.225
In 1608, Samuel de Champlain

313
00:25:57.225 --> 00:26:01.115
departed from here and
discovered Québec, Canada.

314
00:26:01.115 --> 00:26:05.451
After the exploration era,
it became a city of art.

315
00:26:11.537 --> 00:26:13.568
Isn't the light beautiful here?

316
00:26:13.568 --> 00:26:15.685
- Yes.
- Yes.

317
00:26:15.685 --> 00:26:18.289
There was a painter named Eugène Boudin.

318
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:22.510
And he started to come outside to paint
because of the beautiful sunlight.

319
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.655
They normally painted
in ateliers back then.

320
00:26:26.655 --> 00:26:30.245
- What's an atelier?
- It's like a workroom.

321
00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:31.386
Photographers work in...

322
00:26:31.386 --> 00:26:34.947
Do you see that? Her makeup is different.

323
00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:38.732
- It looks the same.
- No, it's different.

324
00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:42.757
- In what way?
- It's a different vibe.

325
00:26:42.757 --> 00:26:46.559
And look at that guy.
He only looks at her.

326
00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:50.790
- But she doesn't look back at him.
- There are galleries and souvenir shops.

327
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.603
Hey.

328
00:26:52.603 --> 00:26:56.026
I thought you were in pain because
of your period. How did you notice that?

329
00:26:57.657 --> 00:26:59.674
Let's go up.

330
00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:03.761
This is Saint Catherine's Church.

331
00:27:03.761 --> 00:27:06.511
It's very different from
other churches, right?

332
00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:08.123
- Yes.
- Yes.

333
00:27:08.123 --> 00:27:11.325
It's the biggest wooden church in France.

334
00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:15.437
Do you see the roof?
It's shaped like an upside down boat.

335
00:27:15.437 --> 00:27:17.232
Do you know who built it?

336
00:27:17.232 --> 00:27:19.848
- People who built boats?
- That's right.

337
00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:22.658
Engineers of the 1500s made it.

338
00:27:22.658 --> 00:27:27.104
That's why it looks concise,
but antique-like as well.

339
00:27:27.104 --> 00:27:30.915
That's it for me.
You have free time until lunch

340
00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:32.609
so enjoy your day.

341
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:36.973
Remember that this is a good place
to lazily spend the day at a cafe.

342
00:27:36.973 --> 00:27:39.437
Excuse me, what can we buy here?

343
00:27:39.437 --> 00:27:44.481
This place is slanted, so they make
wine out of apples instead of grapes.

344
00:27:44.481 --> 00:27:49.492
The wine shops offer free samples,
so try some and buy a bottle.

345
00:27:49.492 --> 00:27:51.820
Then, which shops are the cheapest?

346
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.623
They're all equally expensive.
This is France.

347
00:27:56.193 --> 00:27:59.783
Please look around,
and meet here at 12 p.m.

348
00:27:59.783 --> 00:28:02.887
- so we can have lunch.
- Yes.

349
00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:05.279
- Take a look.
- Yes.

350
00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:08.261
Big Sis Guide.

351
00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:14.040
- Take this.
- What is this?

352
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.473
It's not much. Take it.

353
00:28:16.473 --> 00:28:20.171
We all pitched in because
you're working so hard.

354
00:28:20.171 --> 00:28:22.356
I collected everything.

355
00:28:22.356 --> 00:28:27.317
Big Sis Guide is working really hard,
so why don't we pitch in 30,000 won each?

356
00:28:27.317 --> 00:28:31.126
That sounds good, sir.
Then, 30,000 won per person?

357
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:35.598
Hey, we're not rich.
Let's pitch in 30,000 per couple.

358
00:28:35.598 --> 00:28:39.821
Thank you. I should work
even harder since you tipped me.

359
00:28:39.821 --> 00:28:42.455
You don't need to.
You're the best already.

360
00:28:42.455 --> 00:28:45.685
I am the best guide of our travel agency.

361
00:28:45.685 --> 00:28:48.835
Yes, buy something good to eat.

362
00:28:48.835 --> 00:28:51.646
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

363
00:28:56.232 --> 00:29:01.050
You two look quite good together...
standing like that.

364
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.636
- Hurry up!
- I'm leaving now.

365
00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:12.388
I told you not to stand beside me.

366
00:29:16.069 --> 00:29:19.493
If the customers start to spread rumors,
it'll make things difficult for me.

367
00:29:19.493 --> 00:29:22.693
People who like each other have
a good scent, so everyone can tell.

368
00:29:22.693 --> 00:29:26.734
Don't stick to me all the time,
and stop staring at my face.

369
00:29:26.734 --> 00:29:30.175
Don't get drunk off all the free wine

370
00:29:30.175 --> 00:29:33.982
and if you wonder if you can try
something, don't even think about it.

371
00:29:33.982 --> 00:29:36.241
- Okay?
- Okay.

372
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:39.098
- Where are you going?
- A gallery.

373
00:29:39.989 --> 00:29:42.915
- That way.
- Maybe we'll run into each other.

374
00:29:42.915 --> 00:29:45.509
Remember to meet here on time.

375
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:46.645
Okay.

376
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:08.901
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E08 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

377
00:30:27.072 --> 00:30:28.883
You might as well do 108 bows.

378
00:30:31.838 --> 00:30:36.800
Honey, come here and sit down.

379
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:42.819
Do your legs hurt?

380
00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:45.321
Pray.

381
00:30:46.896 --> 00:30:49.469
Why would Buddhists pray
in a place like this?

382
00:30:49.469 --> 00:30:51.550
Just do it.

383
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.508
Praying won't give us rice cakes or rice.

384
00:30:56.975 --> 00:31:02.039
Have you... ever prayed for me?

385
00:31:06.384 --> 00:31:08.482
You haven't, have you?

386
00:31:11.924 --> 00:31:13.763
Pray with me.

387
00:31:39.473 --> 00:31:42.837
Cut. I told you
not to look at the camera.

388
00:31:42.837 --> 00:31:44.418
Again.

389
00:31:44.418 --> 00:31:46.822
Geez, seriously.

390
00:31:53.084 --> 00:31:55.572
Cut. Again.

391
00:31:55.572 --> 00:31:58.239
Try to look cooler.

392
00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:14.808
Never mind.

393
00:32:16.341 --> 00:32:20.556
Hey! Hey! What the heck?

394
00:32:20.556 --> 00:32:24.550
It seems like one of us
doesn't have talent.

395
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.655
I can't create a masterpiece.

396
00:32:26.655 --> 00:32:31.206
Just get over it. It's easy
to become a movie director.

397
00:32:31.206 --> 00:32:34.867
I said I wanted to do it,
but I didn't say I would do it.

398
00:32:37.819 --> 00:32:42.398
Come here. Stand here.
Over here. Right? Stand there.

399
00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:45.223
This is great. Stand there.

400
00:32:46.483 --> 00:32:50.511
Ready? Say, "I love you."

401
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:53.348
Why? Are you going to use it against me?

402
00:32:53.348 --> 00:32:56.762
- "If you love me, give me money."
- Ready?

403
00:32:56.762 --> 00:32:59.050
- I'm not doing it.
- Action!

404
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:03.502
- I love you.
- Look at the camera.

405
00:33:03.502 --> 00:33:07.192
- You told me not to look!
- You have to this time!

406
00:33:09.857 --> 00:33:12.177
- I love you.
- Again.

407
00:33:17.214 --> 00:33:18.835
I love you.

408
00:33:18.835 --> 00:33:22.336
You can't do movements or say lines.
At least we have a title.

409
00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:24.482
- What is it?
- "The Man Who Can't."

410
00:33:24.482 --> 00:33:27.864
I can act. I wanted be
an actor as a college student.

411
00:33:27.864 --> 00:33:30.383
- Go again.
- No, I want to stop.

412
00:33:31.528 --> 00:33:33.744
Hey, try it again.

413
00:33:33.744 --> 00:33:35.578
I'm ready.

414
00:33:37.165 --> 00:33:39.270
I love you.

415
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.684
How's that? Wasn't that killer?

416
00:33:41.684 --> 00:33:43.763
Kill me.

417
00:33:43.763 --> 00:33:46.965
Hey, I was emotional that time!

418
00:33:46.965 --> 00:33:50.184
You think... this or this?

419
00:34:00.357 --> 00:34:03.211
I think so too. Yes.

420
00:34:03.211 --> 00:34:05.508
Okay, this one.

421
00:34:05.508 --> 00:34:08.425
You think, this or this?

422
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.392
Okay, this one.

423
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.274
- That! I wanted to buy that!
- What?

424
00:34:20.897 --> 00:34:25.381
You think, this or this?

425
00:34:32.486 --> 00:34:35.615
You think, this or this?

426
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:38.410
Wow, you bought so much.
You're done, right?

427
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:42.595
They say there's an end to space
before there's an end to shopping.

428
00:34:42.595 --> 00:34:46.368
- Hey, who said such a thing?
- Me.

429
00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:48.530
Geez.

430
00:34:53.671 --> 00:34:54.988
Let's go now.

431
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.200
You think, this or this?

432
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.464
Wow, your English is the most
effective English I've ever heard.

433
00:35:02.464 --> 00:35:05.671
This is better. This one!

434
00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:53.325
You're really here.

435
00:35:53.883 --> 00:35:56.330
Say hello. This is my friend, Didier.

436
00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:59.718
He was a huge help when I
first started working as a guide.

437
00:36:14.843 --> 00:36:18.115
He said it's nice to meet you,
and welcomes you to Honfleur.

438
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.517
It's nice to meet you too.

439
00:36:21.068 --> 00:36:22.642
You're handsome.

440
00:37:19.798 --> 00:37:22.432
- Bye, see you.
- Bye.

441
00:37:35.093 --> 00:37:36.597
Why were you laughing earlier?

442
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.897
He said he'll visit my hotel tonight.

443
00:37:39.897 --> 00:37:43.490
Didier tends to strip naked
when he's drunk.

444
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.055
That's what we were laughing about.

445
00:37:46.211 --> 00:37:50.066
I see. He strips naked, huh?

446
00:37:50.066 --> 00:37:52.785
You think he's just fine,
but he changes in an instant.

447
00:37:52.785 --> 00:37:54.970
He's the type to
get drunk all of a sudden.

448
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.682
You never know what will happen.

449
00:37:59.388 --> 00:38:00.694
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

450
00:38:00.694 --> 00:38:02.002
A condom.

451
00:38:02.618 --> 00:38:05.406
- Do you carry one around?
- Isn't that a given?

452
00:38:05.406 --> 00:38:07.580
Why is that a given?

453
00:38:08.209 --> 00:38:10.269
You have no reason to bring one around.

454
00:38:13.356 --> 00:38:15.700
You never know what will happen.

455
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.097
Yeah, that could happen.

456
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.720
- Where are you going now?
- I'm going to meet a friend.

457
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.055
A male or female?

458
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:28.664
- Allan!
- So So!

459
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:47.292
Say hello. This is my friend, Allan.

460
00:38:47.292 --> 00:38:50.577
He was a huge help
when I first started as a guide.

461
00:38:51.356 --> 00:38:53.780
How and why did he help you?

462
00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.274
He's a good friend who was
always there when I was lonely.

463
00:38:57.274 --> 00:39:00.481
I see. I'll go back down first.

464
00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:03.617
Go ahead. I'll meet you at 12.

465
00:39:27.823 --> 00:39:30.950
Hey, Mister! What the heck are you doing?

466
00:39:33.073 --> 00:39:36.201
Hey, Mister! What the heck are you doing?

467
00:39:37.214 --> 00:39:38.511
Hold on.

468
00:39:41.183 --> 00:39:43.616
Did you learn to kick artwork
in the country you're from?

469
00:39:43.616 --> 00:39:45.513
Look, it's all crinkled!

470
00:39:45.513 --> 00:39:47.277
What happened?

471
00:39:47.277 --> 00:39:50.614
I don't know. I kicked some empty cans

472
00:39:50.614 --> 00:39:52.665
but she came out and got mad at me.

473
00:39:52.665 --> 00:39:55.156
Did you kick these?

474
00:39:55.997 --> 00:39:59.404
I'm sorry. He doesn't know better...

475
00:39:59.404 --> 00:40:01.290
Why did you kick those?

476
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.065
It was there,
so I wondered if I could kick it.

477
00:40:04.065 --> 00:40:06.596
I told you not to do anything
you could wonder about.

478
00:40:06.596 --> 00:40:08.779
This is her handicraft.

479
00:40:09.993 --> 00:40:11.138
Did you make those yourself?

480
00:40:11.138 --> 00:40:15.312
I put them on display because
they hold a lot of meaning.

481
00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:19.076
"Politician's Brain,
Financial Ethics, Religious Soul"

482
00:40:19.076 --> 00:40:21.024
And "Your Wallet."

483
00:40:21.024 --> 00:40:22.962
These are worth 320 euros.

484
00:40:23.507 --> 00:40:24.705
What did she say?

485
00:40:26.107 --> 00:40:29.000
"Politician's Brain, Financial Ethics"

486
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.991
"Religious Soul," and "Your Wallet."

487
00:40:32.852 --> 00:40:36.187
They're worth 380 euros. 507,000 won.

488
00:40:36.741 --> 00:40:39.765
Wait, these four cans
are worth 500,000 won?

489
00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:43.433
No matter how trifling something is,
meaning gives it value.

490
00:40:43.433 --> 00:40:46.736
You're driving me crazy. Why...

491
00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:51.439
People of this country are serious
about the value of their art.

492
00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:53.111
So So, what's the matter?

493
00:40:57.625 --> 00:41:00.826
Allan, that person ruined my art.
Do you know them?

494
00:41:00.826 --> 00:41:02.558
Really? Let me see.

495
00:41:05.683 --> 00:41:08.629
It's broken,
so there's not much we can do.

496
00:41:08.629 --> 00:41:11.913
You'll have to compensate her,
but I'll talk to her.

497
00:41:11.913 --> 00:41:13.361
Really?

498
00:41:14.136 --> 00:41:17.473
This is great.
Allan will talk to her for you.

499
00:41:17.473 --> 00:41:19.587
That's okay. I'm fine.

500
00:41:19.587 --> 00:41:22.382
It was my fault,
so I'll take responsibility.

501
00:41:22.382 --> 00:41:25.723
- Allan will help you.
- I don't need it.

502
00:41:26.792 --> 00:41:28.114
Do you take this?

503
00:41:29.899 --> 00:41:31.174
Okay.

504
00:41:33.198 --> 00:41:35.147
I'll make a lump sum payment.

505
00:41:52.413 --> 00:41:55.102
- What is it?
<i>- You don't sound happy to talk to me.</i>

506
00:41:55.102 --> 00:41:56.783
Yeah, I'm not happy.

507
00:41:56.783 --> 00:42:00.018
- When are you coming back?
<i>- After my vacation.</i>

508
00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:04.245
The youngest employee combined
all of his vacations to take a long trip.

509
00:42:04.245 --> 00:42:07.196
I'm jealous of you. I'm stuck here.

510
00:42:07.196 --> 00:42:09.569
Do you know how impressionist
painters came to exist?

511
00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:12.283
They went outside with a paint brush.

512
00:42:12.283 --> 00:42:14.672
You should just leave
without worrying about them.

513
00:42:14.672 --> 00:42:18.022
- Shut up. Any romance?
- I'm hanging up.

514
00:42:18.022 --> 00:42:21.776
<i>Woody Allen said Paris is one
of the top three places to find love.</i>

515
00:42:21.776 --> 00:42:25.370
<i>But then again,
he found love anywhere he went.</i>

516
00:42:26.814 --> 00:42:29.520
I bought a really famous work of art.

517
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.219
It has a deep meaning.

518
00:42:31.861 --> 00:42:33.977
Buy it from me for 507,000 won.

519
00:42:33.977 --> 00:42:38.015
<i>I'm hanging up. And come back soon.
I have a lot of questions.</i>

520
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.598
Did you go safely?

521
00:42:48.814 --> 00:42:52.094
It feels refreshing to receive
a greeting after going to the bathroom.

522
00:42:52.094 --> 00:42:54.341
Half of company work life
is about the greetings.

523
00:42:54.341 --> 00:42:57.658
Yeah, I hate it, but that's the truth.

524
00:42:59.422 --> 00:43:02.377
Did you sign the confirmation form?

525
00:43:02.377 --> 00:43:05.486
- Can I ask you a question first?
- No.

526
00:43:05.486 --> 00:43:09.765
Why do you suddenly want us
to sign a form to take down Ma Ru?

527
00:43:09.765 --> 00:43:11.366
Don't ask any questions.

528
00:43:11.366 --> 00:43:14.864
Ma Ru is good with his greetings,
works overtime hours

529
00:43:14.864 --> 00:43:17.294
and he doesn't even steal any A4 paper.

530
00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.631
Doesn't he deserve an award,
at the very least?

531
00:43:19.631 --> 00:43:21.663
I was told to do it.

532
00:43:23.056 --> 00:43:25.640
Did you sign it too?

533
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.223
- It's so flat.
- I can't sign it.

534
00:43:30.223 --> 00:43:32.761
You'll be at a disadvantage
during personnel evaluation.

535
00:43:32.761 --> 00:43:35.386
I told Ma Ru I'd ask him questions
when he got back.

536
00:43:35.386 --> 00:43:39.250
"Did you neglect your duties?
Did you damage goods?"

537
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.051
"Did you violate company rules?
Did you crack down on secrets?"

538
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:44.480
If he says yes, I'll sign it then.

539
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.368
Byung Sae, what do you think
company life is about?

540
00:43:48.882 --> 00:43:50.558
It's all about rank.

541
00:43:51.448 --> 00:43:56.578
Although, some people say
it's still the same company.

542
00:43:56.578 --> 00:44:00.797
But those people have never
worked at a large corporation.

543
00:44:00.797 --> 00:44:04.218
They've never experienced the power
our business cards give us.

544
00:44:04.218 --> 00:44:06.761
But we're still nothing but employees.

545
00:44:06.761 --> 00:44:08.977
Be more honest with yourself, Byung Sae.

546
00:44:08.977 --> 00:44:13.102
For commoners like us, large corporations
are more than a workplace.

547
00:44:13.993 --> 00:44:17.819
Between the human Oh Ye Bi, and
World Pharmaceuticals Oh Ye Bi...

548
00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:21.098
who do you think is worth more?

549
00:44:21.098 --> 00:44:22.710
The human Oh Ye Bi.

550
00:44:23.352 --> 00:44:25.261
You're still young, aren't you?

551
00:44:26.482 --> 00:44:29.500
Excuse me, another beer, please.

552
00:45:11.022 --> 00:45:13.676
You're so pretty today, So So.
You shine more in this sunlight.

553
00:45:15.632 --> 00:45:17.917
Did you sleep with that Oriental man?

554
00:45:20.957 --> 00:45:23.239
What is she laughing about?

555
00:45:23.828 --> 00:45:25.681
You're not just fooling around, are you?

556
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:29.482
- We're not. It's more than that.
- Then?

557
00:45:29.482 --> 00:45:33.256
There's a 51 percent chance
that he's my fated love.

558
00:45:33.256 --> 00:45:37.442
You finally found it. The angel's feet.

559
00:45:43.477 --> 00:45:46.221
Didier, wait!

560
00:45:53.218 --> 00:45:54.846
Wait...

561
00:45:56.535 --> 00:45:59.607
I'm so uncomfortable
because you're acting like this.

562
00:45:59.607 --> 00:46:02.875
You should resolve your misunderstanding
and be your old selves again.

563
00:46:02.875 --> 00:46:04.810
I'm not misunderstanding anything.

564
00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:09.020
I didn't know you'd call me out
to see this person. I'm disappointed.

565
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.344
You pretended not to know I was here.
Your hypocrisy is more disgusting.

566
00:46:12.344 --> 00:46:15.263
- Stop it!
- I'll let you hit me once!

567
00:46:15.263 --> 00:46:18.882
Stop it! Stop it!

568
00:46:22.873 --> 00:46:24.770
- Stop it!
- Stay out of it. It's our problem.

569
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:26.924
Yes, it's your problem!

570
00:46:33.986 --> 00:46:35.835
Please stop it!

571
00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:40.067
I love both of you!
I can't lose either of you!

572
00:46:43.415 --> 00:46:47.227
I hate this about myself,
but I have no choice.

573
00:46:48.344 --> 00:46:51.741
Can't we love each other, just like this?

574
00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.714
I can't stand to watch you fight over me.

575
00:47:11.448 --> 00:47:14.085
<i>That is one shocking love triangle.</i>

576
00:47:21.507 --> 00:47:23.469
Yoon So So.

577
00:47:23.469 --> 00:47:25.973
I don't think this is right.

578
00:47:33.529 --> 00:47:37.136
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know either.

579
00:47:44.602 --> 00:47:46.129
I think he's mad.

580
00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:48.370
Is it because of the cans?

581
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.556
I'm an artist too,
but those cans were overpriced.

582
00:47:59.227 --> 00:48:00.765
Hurry up!

583
00:48:08.093 --> 00:48:13.288
Honey, can we sit over there
and drink some coffee?

584
00:48:13.288 --> 00:48:15.627
That's a waste of money.

585
00:48:15.627 --> 00:48:19.198
Have some tonic with the money
you'd spend on coffee.

586
00:48:22.428 --> 00:48:24.547
Hello!

587
00:48:24.547 --> 00:48:27.904
- You bought so much.
- We didn't buy much.

588
00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:30.451
They're just clothes,
shoes, and souvenirs.

589
00:48:30.451 --> 00:48:34.707
I'm jealous. We've never spent money,
so we're unable to buy anything.

590
00:48:34.707 --> 00:48:38.573
You have to save to live well!
Kids overspend these days.

591
00:48:38.573 --> 00:48:41.466
We didn't overspend.
None of these were expensive.

592
00:48:41.466 --> 00:48:45.236
- I wasn't talking to you.
- That's enough.

593
00:48:45.236 --> 00:48:48.491
- Do what makes you happy.
- I'm already doing that.

594
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:50.154
We did overspend.

595
00:48:50.154 --> 00:48:53.111
Should we have some coffee
as just us girls?

596
00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:54.678
Should we do that?

597
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:58.681
- We meet again.
- Hey, where did you go?

598
00:48:58.681 --> 00:49:00.555
We just took a lap.

599
00:49:00.555 --> 00:49:03.285
- Nothing special, huh?
- It was the same old.

600
00:49:03.285 --> 00:49:06.321
- Did you see a lot?
- We just bought a lot.

601
00:49:06.321 --> 00:49:09.373
- Would you like to have coffee?
- Yes.

602
00:49:09.373 --> 00:49:10.685
Let's go.

603
00:49:14.219 --> 00:49:15.388
- Hey.
- What the heck?

604
00:49:15.388 --> 00:49:17.145
Why do you need coffee?

605
00:49:18.527 --> 00:49:21.245
- We should have fun too!
- Yes, shall we?

606
00:49:22.482 --> 00:49:24.538
It's nice and warm, isn't it?

607
00:49:24.538 --> 00:49:25.908
It doesn't cost us money. either.

608
00:49:29.707 --> 00:49:32.631
- A plane's flying by.
- Where?

609
00:49:40.498 --> 00:49:43.183
Wow, are you serious?

610
00:49:43.183 --> 00:49:46.431
Did you design the poop designs
for The Magic Door?

611
00:49:46.431 --> 00:49:49.564
Yeah, I just draw
those things all day long.

612
00:49:49.564 --> 00:49:53.783
What do you mean? They're
no joke. They're so impactful.

613
00:49:53.783 --> 00:49:57.031
- What is it?
- It's a game item.

614
00:49:57.031 --> 00:49:59.602
<i>So Ran drew all the poop bottles.</i>

615
00:49:59.602 --> 00:50:00.913
Poop bottles?

616
00:50:00.913 --> 00:50:03.462
I'll gift you with two water bottles
when I get back to work.

617
00:50:03.462 --> 00:50:06.042
Really? You're amazing!

618
00:50:06.042 --> 00:50:08.544
So Ran, can I get your number?

619
00:50:08.544 --> 00:50:12.127
Call me when you get to Seoul.
Text me if I don't answer.

620
00:50:12.127 --> 00:50:14.614
Your business card is cool too.

621
00:50:14.614 --> 00:50:20.379
By the way, who's the man
you came here with?

622
00:50:21.132 --> 00:50:22.748
A man who gives me money.

623
00:50:27.995 --> 00:50:31.890
- So Ran, let's take a selfie together.
- Sure.

624
00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:35.504
One, two, three. Thank you.

625
00:50:49.442 --> 00:50:52.852
San Ma Ru is late. Did he get lost?

626
00:50:53.332 --> 00:50:56.303
How can an elite get lost?

627
00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:59.779
And people can run late sometimes.
Why fret over it?

628
00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:06.386
I'll try calling him.

<i>I'll skip lunch
and go straight to the bus.</i>

632
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:54.071
San Ma Ru doesn't feel well,
so he'll rest in the bus.

633
00:51:54.071 --> 00:51:56.227
Let's get going.

634
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.995
<i>Where are you? I'll meet you there.</i>

635
00:52:38.625 --> 00:52:39.993
It's a gift.

636
00:52:53.643 --> 00:52:55.138
You're really here.

637
00:53:05.413 --> 00:53:08.207
That's right. The shoes.

638
00:53:22.772 --> 00:53:23.819
Hello?

639
00:53:23.819 --> 00:53:26.410
Is this Yoon So So of Eurobike Tour?

640
00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:28.065
Yes, that's me.

641
00:53:28.065 --> 00:53:32.526
Are you in charge of
San Ma Ru of Room 305?

642
00:53:32.526 --> 00:53:34.529
Yes, he's my traveler.

643
00:53:34.529 --> 00:53:37.203
He left something in his room.

644
00:53:37.203 --> 00:53:40.277
Okay, I'll pick it up right now.

645
00:54:05.794 --> 00:54:09.471
Please check the contents
and sign the receipt.

646
00:54:09.471 --> 00:54:11.390
- Okay.
<i>- Sir?</i>

647
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:14.178
Yes? Excuse me.

648
00:55:27.247 --> 00:55:29.053
<i>Whose shoes are they?</i>

649
00:55:31.935 --> 00:55:33.694
What about your girlfriend?

650
00:55:34.339 --> 00:55:36.607
I don't have anything to say.

651
00:55:40.422 --> 00:55:42.294
<i>Weren't they for me?</i>

652
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:48.736
Did you break up?

653
00:55:50.669 --> 00:55:52.520
Let's just talk about us.

654
00:55:55.783 --> 00:55:59.181
<i>Did I delude myself into thinking
it was a gift for me?</i>

655
00:56:10.281 --> 00:56:11.591
It's a gift.

656
00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:22.986
<i>A man who gives the same gift
to two different women.</i>

657
00:56:35.971 --> 00:56:37.669
San Ma Ru.

658
00:56:38.239 --> 00:56:41.518
I don't think this is right.

659
00:56:54.156 --> 00:56:56.051
This is my traveler, San Ma Ru.

660
00:56:56.051 --> 00:56:58.285
He could become my boyfriend.

661
00:56:58.285 --> 00:57:01.640
He could become my boyfriend.

662
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640
Then?

663
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.669
There's a 51 percent chance
that he's my fated love.

664
00:57:51.321 --> 00:57:53.457
<i>I wonder who he was.</i>

665
00:57:57.152 --> 00:57:58.915
Did you cry to your heart's content?

666
00:58:00.245 --> 00:58:02.180
<i>That son of a bitch.</i>

667
00:58:02.844 --> 00:58:06.596
- Why are you back already?
- I missed you.

668
00:58:07.279 --> 00:58:08.890
<i>That bastard.</i>

669
00:58:11.522 --> 00:58:13.259
Sleep with me tonight.

00:58:49.136 --> 00:58:50.627
You're really here.

675
00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:53.520
Say hello. This is my friend, Didier.

676
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.897
He was a huge help
when I first started as a guide.

677
00:58:57.486 --> 00:59:01.928
This is my traveler, San Ma Ru.
He could become my boyfriend.

678
00:59:01.928 --> 00:59:03.286
It's nice to meet you.

679
00:59:04.913 --> 00:59:08.826
So So is a sad girl, so be good
to her so she doesn't cry.

680
00:59:08.826 --> 00:59:11.667
If you become her boyfriend, that is.

681
00:59:12.292 --> 00:59:15.895
He says it's nice to meet you,
and welcomes you to Honfleur.

682
00:59:15.895 --> 00:59:19.848
It's nice to meet you too.
You're handsome.

683
00:59:20.426 --> 00:59:22.466
He says you're handsome.

684
00:59:23.319 --> 00:59:27.330
You're cute. You possess
the charm Oriental men have.

685
00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.515
Wait, did you fall for him already?

686
00:59:29.515 --> 00:59:32.893
Maybe. What are you doing tonight?

687
00:59:32.893 --> 00:59:34.500
I'm heading over to Deauville.

688
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:37.857
It's been a long time.
Don't you have time for a glass of wine?

689
00:59:37.857 --> 00:59:41.359
I'm here for a day, so I have no choice.

690
00:59:42.051 --> 00:59:43.411
Okay.

691
00:59:43.411 --> 00:59:47.386
Then I'll go to Deauville.
Tell me your hotel's address.

692
00:59:47.386 --> 00:59:52.248
Do I have to see you strip naked again?
Don't come to Deauville.

693
00:59:52.248 --> 00:59:57.866
This is just a shell.
Just like your clothes.

694
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.928
I'll stay for longer next time
so we can drink.

695
01:00:01.928 --> 01:00:03.515
Let's just have coffee today.

696
01:00:03.515 --> 01:00:09.989
Meet me at our favorite cafe
in 30 minutes.

697
01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:12.170
- Allan!
- So So!

698
01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:14.913
How have you been, Allan?

699
01:00:14.913 --> 01:00:17.268
I missed you so much.

700
01:00:17.268 --> 01:00:18.654
Who's that?

701
01:00:19.413 --> 01:00:23.946
He could become my boyfriend.

702
01:00:23.946 --> 01:00:26.989
- Are you finally opening up?
- Yeah.

703
01:00:28.776 --> 01:00:31.801
- Stop it!
- I'll let you hit me once!

704
01:00:39.156 --> 01:00:41.281
- Stop it!
- Stay out of it. It's our problem.

705
01:00:41.281 --> 01:00:43.123
Yes, it's your problem!

706
01:00:43.123 --> 01:00:46.652
But you two are
my only friends in France.

707
01:00:46.652 --> 01:00:49.676
I want to stay out of it, but I can't.

708
01:00:49.676 --> 01:00:53.399
It was wrong for Allan to
go clubbing without telling you.

709
01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:57.692
But he felt sorry,
and cried to me about it afterward.

710
01:00:58.877 --> 01:01:02.169
He promised not to look
at any other man ever again.

711
01:01:02.169 --> 01:01:05.507
And you cried because
you couldn't get over Allan.

712
01:01:05.507 --> 01:01:10.870
People break up sometimes.
But you love each other too much.

713
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:14.509
You're still unable to
forget about each other.

714
01:01:14.509 --> 01:01:18.484
It takes a short moment to love someone.

715
01:01:19.585 --> 01:01:24.832
But it takes an
entire lifetime to get over it.

716
01:01:26.636 --> 01:01:29.270
I don't want you to go through that.

717
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.495
It hurts a lot.

718
01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:35.049
That's what I wanted to tell you today.

719
01:01:50.515 --> 01:01:54.678
<i>See? She won't look him in the eye.
They were whispering to each other.</i>

720
01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:58.498
<i>Big Sis Guide, do you have a boyfriend?
How about our elite?</i>

721
01:01:58.498 --> 01:02:01.377
<i>He came by himself too.
A round of applause for them!</i>

722
01:02:02.632 --> 01:02:05.902
<i>Don't you feel bad that
we came on this vacation together?</i>

723
01:02:05.902 --> 01:02:09.924
<i>- Why wouldn't I be sorry?
- Then don't get married.</i>

724
01:02:11.221 --> 01:02:14.649
<i>In the processes of relationships
being formed and broken</i>

725
