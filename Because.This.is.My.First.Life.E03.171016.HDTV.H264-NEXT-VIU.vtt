1
00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:20.693
I'm a melodrama's...

2
00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:23.723
(From the shelf...)

3
00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.033
assistant writer.

4
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:30.134
The total amount of your loan is 187,260 dollars,

5
00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:32.473
and your installment is 865 dollars.

6
00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:34.103
You're going to become an aunt.

7
00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:35.974
- Hold on, Dad. - It's a boy.

8
00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:38.643
Game over.

9
00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:41.484
She wants you to move in now.

10
00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:42.914
I can do that.

11
00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:47.554
(I moved in as scheduled.)

12
00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.764
I'm embarrassed by myself.

13
00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:04.704
I couldn't differentiate love from kindness until this age.

14
00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:07.974
The neocortex is located...

15
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.174
at the outer part of your brain,

16
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.213
and it's in charge of the concept of time like the age of 20 or 30.

17
00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:15.543
Whether they're 30 or 40, it's the same today for cats.

18
00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:18.683
His nonsense comforted me...

19
00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:20.314
more than anything else that day.

20
00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:23.054
Hello, you were home...

21
00:01:24.823 --> 00:01:28.224
When I heard your name, I thought you were a woman.

22
00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:29.894
- Did you... - Yes?

23
00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:32.593
fix the tiles in the bathroom?

24
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.433
Did you clean the windows in the living room too?

25
00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:37.873
Yes, I did. That's what I do before I write...

26
00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:39.334
I see.

27
00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:44.974
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

28
00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:49.013
Who's there?

29
00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:51.614
When I decided to follow my dream,

30
00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:53.483
I thought my life would be...

31
00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.784
like walking through...

32
00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:58.453
a dark tunnel.

33
00:01:58.823 --> 00:02:02.493
But I didn't know it was going to be this dark.

34
00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.933
I didn't know it was going to be...

35
00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:08.703
this lonely.

36
00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:15.543
I have...

37
00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:18.043
something to say.

38
00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:20.444
Okay.

39
00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.643
If you have some time...

40
00:02:23.113 --> 00:02:24.214
Yes?

41
00:02:24.553 --> 00:02:27.714
Would you marry me?

42
00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.523
Yes.

43
00:02:32.793 --> 00:02:33.893
What?

44
00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.194
What did you say?

45
00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:40.763
Marriage.

46
00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:44.634
Why would I... Marriage?

47
00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:47.103
Why would we get married?

48
00:02:47.273 --> 00:02:50.444
Why should you and I do something like that?

49
00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:52.744
Why?

50
00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.353
Never mind. Please consider it never happened.

51
00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:02.953
- What? - I didn't mean it. Just forget it.

52
00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:07.323
I better sleep.

53
00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:11.934
The sheets are still there in your old room.

54
00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:15.733
- I'm washing the pillow cover... - No, it's okay.

55
00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:19.333
It's not very clean to sleep without a cover.

56
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.103
No, I mean I'll get going.

57
00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.513
I told you. I'm just out for a walk.

58
00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:42.694
I'll head out. Thank you for the beer.

59
00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:05.613
(Search destination)

60
00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:12.194
(Gayang-dong, Gangseo-gu)

61
00:04:12.194 --> 00:04:15.064
(Mangwon-dong)

62
00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:21.463
How can I not have anywhere to go?

63
00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:31.174
(Landlord sent you a new message.)

64
00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:03.504
I'm texting you because you won't find a taxi at this time.

65
00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:05.814
The password is the same as it was.

66
00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:12.653
If you have some time...

67
00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:16.153
Would you marry me?

68
00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:19.354
He definitely...

69
00:05:20.723 --> 00:05:22.723
asked me to marry him.

70
00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:27.093
Why does he always...

71
00:05:27.163 --> 00:05:30.763
I'm the one that should be locking. Is he joking?

72
00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:33.333
Get married? We just met.

73
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.073
How can he lock the door after asking me such a question?

74
00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:36.674
Seriously.

75
00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.013
I'm going to leave on the first train out.

76
00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:04.533
Yes, this is unit 401.

77
00:06:04.674 --> 00:06:08.544
I think my neighbor is getting a renovation without informing me.

78
00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:29.894
Yes, this is unit 401.

79
00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:33.905
I think my neighbor is getting a renovation without informing me.

80
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.170
I see.

81
00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.399
The sound wasn't from a construction.

82
00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.449
I'll only stay until the subway starts running.

83
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.680
I won't be here when you get up, so goodbye.

84
00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.380
I'll forget I heard it.

85
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.640
The number you're calling is not available. To leave...

86
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.680
It's me.

87
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.050
Why isn't Ji Ho picking up? She's ignoring my chats.

88
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.879
Really? Did she go in a meeting?

89
00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.550
Ho Rang, I have to go.

90
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.520
It didn't get approved. What will you do?

91
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.390
- You can't do it like that. - He's right.

92
00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:09.619
This is an organization...

93
00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:14.329
Ms. Woo. Are you getting fresh air?

94
00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:15.400
Yes.

95
00:08:15.859 --> 00:08:18.869
You should smoke with us.

96
00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:21.440
Well?

97
00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.940
You shouldn't joke about things like that.

98
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.369
It's okay, it's Ms. Woo.

99
00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:28.479
Ms. Woo.

100
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.510
- That's true. - She's okay.

101
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.410
The number you're calling is not available. To leave...

102
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.680
She's really not picking up.

103
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.989
I was wondering why you didn't come today.

104
00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.589
We only have a few left of this.

105
00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:48.329
You should buy it instead of keep testing it.

106
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.869
Really? This is no good.

107
00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:53.869
I wanted to buy this for my house when I get married.

108
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.640
- Will there be more next year? - Next year?

109
00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:00.170
Just tell your boyfriend you should get married soon.

110
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.109
You better get married while you're still so pretty.

111
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.910
He's such a busy guy.

112
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.510
He graduated from Seoul National University.

113
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.079
Really? What does he do?

114
00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:10.079
You won't understand because it's too complicated.

115
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.249
- You're showing off. - Yes.

116
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.810
(5pm)

117
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.079
Gosh, that scared me.

118
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.449
I feel so rested for only sleeping two hours.

119
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.829
Why would you eat at five in the morning?

120
00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:29.099
No, no. Be quiet.

121
00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:30.959
You'll wake up your owner.

122
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.099
Please eat quietly.

123
00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.040
Where are you coming from?

124
00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:45.780
Work.

125
00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.109
At this hour?

126
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.520
Yes.

127
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.020
Did you just wake up?

128
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.989
Yes.

129
00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:56.989
- At this hour? - Yes.

130
00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:05.030
I'm sure I told you yesterday...

131
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.969
that I'll leave on the first train.

132
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.570
Do you mean the last train?

133
00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:11.609
The last train?

134
00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:14.640
You're being harsh.

135
00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:16.510
What do you mean the last train?

136
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.579
What do you take me for?

137
00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:21.550
You've been harsh on me since last night.

138
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:27.790
I had a lot on my mind so I barely slept for two hours.

139
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.359
I woke up so early so I could take the first train.

140
00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:33.430
I didn't know you would be so rude.

141
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.999
I'm just telling you the facts.

142
00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:39.629
The first train isn't running right now.

143
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.099
- Pardon? - Right now,

144
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.969
it's five in the evening.

145
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.839
You cannot take the first train.

146
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.440
You might take the last train, though.

147
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.780
It's not 5am?

148
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.290
- It's 5pm? - Yes.

149
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.619
So I didn't sleep for two hours...

150
00:12:03.619 --> 00:12:06.089
You slept exactly 14 hours.

151
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.869
Is this real?

152
00:12:14.969 --> 00:12:16.900
Yes. This is real.

153
00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.650
I set the alarm wrong.

154
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.949
I really had planned to leave on the first train.

155
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:07.219
Yes. You were deeply asleep, so I couldn't wake you.

156
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.690
I guess you couldn't sleep well for the last few days.

157
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.930
It must not be comfortable where you are right now.

158
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.540
Why are you...

159
00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:24.510
doing this to me?

160
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.239
Why are you nice to me?

161
00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:30.640
- Me? - Yes.

162
00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:32.849
You gave me the bigger ramyeon.

163
00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:36.719
- You gave me a new pillow case. - That's...

164
00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:39.989
You even asked me to marry you.

165
00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:42.959
I asked you to consider it never happened...

166
00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.930
- last night. - But I heard you.

167
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.729
- You don't have to mind... - I mind.

168
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.900
They will get soggy. Let's eat.

169
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.040
Do you...

170
00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.079
like me?

171
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.859
(Episode 3: Because This Is My First Proposal)

172
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.690
Do you like me?

173
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.180
No.

174
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.150
I gave you that ramyeon because I'm bad with spicy food.

175
00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:43.150
I gave you a pillow case...

176
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.190
because it's not sanitary to sleep without one.

177
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.589
As for the proposal...

178
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.959
I asked you because I need to.

179
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.999
- You need me? - Yes.

180
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.570
If I must get married,

181
00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:02.140
I thought that you were the perfect fit.

182
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.869
What made you...

183
00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:09.239
What made you come to that conclusion?

184
00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:12.510
I need someone to manage the house, and you need a house.

185
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.420
I need someone to pay rent on a regular basis,

186
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.849
and you need a room without paying the deposit.

187
00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:21.119
Aren't we the best fit to live together?

188
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.820
That's why I asked.

189
00:15:24.359 --> 00:15:25.790
It didn't mean anything else.

190
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.560
But still, how can you propose?

191
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.199
Even still, why would you get married for a house?

192
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.940
Then why do you think people get married?

193
00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:38.670
You know... Love, affection...

194
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.109
That's why people get married.

195
00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:43.879
Right.

196
00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:46.379
That's what most people think.

197
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.180
However, do you need love and affection...

198
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.320
right now?

199
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.290
More than a place to live?

200
00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:04.499
Maybe...

201
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.500
not right now,

202
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.109
but I'll need it one day too.

203
00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:16.210
I see.

204
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.550
I thought you were someone in the same category as I am.

205
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.990
I made a misjudgment.

206
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.629
Please consider this conversation never happened.

207
00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:36.960
Please enjoy your ramyeon before you go.

208
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.480
Ms. Woo, are you still here?

209
00:16:57.119 --> 00:16:58.889
Yes, I'm wrapping things up.

210
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.260
Oh, it's due tomorrow.

211
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.119
Why didn't you let the subordinates take care of it?

212
00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.689
You're too experienced to do such things.

213
00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:10.200
Don't be too nice to them because you're a woman.

214
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.929
You should give out orders properly.

215
00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.230
Aren't you going home?

216
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:15.740
Well, I have some things to do.

217
00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:18.810
I should go first since you're here.

218
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.379
Pardon? What's that to do with you going home early?

219
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.109
That's...

220
00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:28.119
not something to do with my work, but what others think.

221
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.550
- Pardon? - The boss said this the other day.

222
00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:35.260
He told me not to work late...

223
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.560
with a single woman like you.

224
00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:38.490
You know how it is.

225
00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:40.790
I know that you don't get it since you're single,

226
00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:44.329
but for married men like me, I have to be careful of rumors.

227
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.629
If nasty rumors start to spread...

228
00:17:47.629 --> 00:17:50.040
Then I'll go home first.

229
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:53.439
That doesn't mean you can go home so early.

230
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.210
Scumbag.

231
00:17:58.349 --> 00:18:00.679
- Thank you for coming. Goodbye. - Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

232
00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.829
- Let's wrap up and go home. - Okay.

233
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:20.899
- Please clean here. - Okay.

234
00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:22.970
- Please check over here. - Okay.

235
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:29.609
- How about pho for today? - I love it.

236
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.609
That sounds delicious.

237
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.550
Isn't that guy incredibly cute?

238
00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.189
- Unbelievable. - He's totally my style.

239
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.760
He's really good-looking.

240
00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:47.129
Isn't he the boyfriend of the manager?

241
00:18:47.629 --> 00:18:50.230
- I didn't know. - I'm sorry about that.

242
00:18:51.129 --> 00:18:52.300
Isn't he super good-looking?

243
00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:54.470
I'll get going first. See you tomorrow.

244
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.240
- See you tomorrow. - See you.

245
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.639
- Honey. - You're here.

246
00:19:00.609 --> 00:19:02.109
How sweet.

247
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.450
Didn't the manager tell us they went out for a long time?

248
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.250
Didn't she say they went out for about seven years?

249
00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:11.619
But he still picks her up when she works late.

250
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.220
- Isn't it amazing? - It is.

251
00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.089
- I'm so jealous. - He's so amazing.

252
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.970
- What did you do today, honey? - Today?

253
00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.409
I did some amazing things today.

254
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.250
Did you find some investors? Are they going to invest?

255
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.450
Take a look at this. This is the graph I completed yesterday.

256
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.020
Isn't it really pretty?

257
00:19:46.349 --> 00:19:48.419
Honey, doesn't it look like a constellation?

258
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.889
I guess what Carl Sagan said must be true.

259
00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:53.760
In the end, humans and universe are all connected.

260
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.000
Isn't that really beautiful?

261
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.129
Yes, it is. It looks like some jeon made from a restaurant.

262
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.869
Honey, remember about the sofa I talked about?

263
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.939
Which one? Oh, you mean the new one that came in the store?

264
00:20:08.179 --> 00:20:09.210
Yes.

265
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.609
I heard there are only a few of them left.

266
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.450
I know. Only those who really want it will buy it.

267
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.550
Despite the economic setback, rich ones buy whatever they want.

268
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.359
I heard a lot of newlyweds buy that sofa.

269
00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.659
I heard the sofa is perfect for newlyweds' homes.

270
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.929
That's why I said the rice ones.

271
00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:32.869
The rich ones buy whatever they want despite the economy.

272
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.740
Gosh, Korea is so far behind.

273
00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:44.750
Did something bad happen today?

274
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.780
No, I had such a great day today.

275
00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:57.560
Why is she mad then? I didn't do anything wrong today.

276
00:20:58.129 --> 00:20:59.560
Did I do something wrong?

277
00:21:00.089 --> 00:21:02.730
Hey, what's the address where Ji Ho is living?

278
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:04.599
Soo Ji wants to know because Ji Ho's not picking up her phone.

279
00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:07.399
Ji Ho? She went out of that house last week.

280
00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:08.939
- What? - What?

281
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.240
Didn't you know?

282
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.310
Then where's she been sleeping all this time?

283
00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:22.550
I thought you were the same type of person as I am.

284
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.990
What's that supposed to mean?

285
00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:27.389
What does he mean I'm the same?

286
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.720
Goodness, he's so weird.

287
00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:46.869
(10 Murderers)

288
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.419
Soo Ji, it's me.

289
00:21:58.419 --> 00:22:00.020
Hey, where are you?

290
00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:02.560
You wouldn't even pick up your phone nor text back.

291
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.659
I'll tell you in detail later.

292
00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:09.329
Oh, I'm at where I used to live with the new landlord.

293
00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.770
I'm somewhere near there. Where are you exactly?

294
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.970
Oh, really? I'm at a bus stop.

295
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.540
Okay. I see the bus stop.

296
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.970
Some crazy woman is wearing pajamas there.

297
00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:20.710
Where are you?

298
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.679
Well...

299
00:22:25.879 --> 00:22:28.320
That's me.

300
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.450
Ji Ho, did you sleep on the street?

301
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.629
Hey, hey.

302
00:22:52.169 --> 00:22:54.070
What? That's ridiculous.

303
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.109
So did you get out in your pajamas?

304
00:22:57.439 --> 00:23:01.149
That stupid jerk. I should kill him in the middle of night.

305
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.220
Do your director and writer know about this?

306
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.990
That's such nonsense. What a jerk.

307
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.820
I should seriously kill him!

308
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.720
Hey! What's his number?

309
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.889
Hey, come on. Let me talk to her properly.

310
00:23:13.189 --> 00:23:14.359
No one knows.

311
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.530
I just came out of the house without thinking much.

312
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.669
Why didn't you call us?

313
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.300
I didn't know you eat and sleep in the office.

314
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.000
You should have called me.

315
00:23:24.139 --> 00:23:27.609
Then why did you go there when you don't live there anymore?

316
00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:32.210
Just because. I just kept walking.

317
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.520
What do you mean by that? The office is super far.

318
00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:45.159
Ji Ho, do you have something going on with him?

319
00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:47.689
Are you going to fall in love with him?

320
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.159
No, it's not like that. What are you talking about?

321
00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:53.369
I smell something fishy.

322
00:23:53.369 --> 00:23:54.770
It's really nothing.

323
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.510
- But you're stuttering. - That's not true!

324
00:24:02.139 --> 00:24:04.909
Okay, there's no reason to get mad at me.

325
00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:08.050
Hey, just go home already.

326
00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:10.520
Ji Ho, I'm taking you to my house.

327
00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:38.210
Hello.

328
00:24:38.409 --> 00:24:41.750
My name is Hwang Jae Hyun, and I got your number from Ms. Nam.

329
00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:44.889
Hello. Nice to know you.

330
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.520
I believe in fate.

331
00:24:52.089 --> 00:24:53.159
Darn it.

332
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:55.030
Do you have time tomorrow?

333
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.810
Why are you sitting there when there's bed?

334
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.040
Guests shouldn't sleep on the floor.

335
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:12.609
I love sleeping on the floor, don't you know?

336
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:16.349
Ji Ho, you wouldn't mind me working, do you?

337
00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:19.119
It's because a client asked for it.

338
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.260
- A demo day? - Yes.

339
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.460
It's an event where start-up CEOs and investors can meet and chat.

340
00:25:27.929 --> 00:25:29.530
It's like a blind date.

341
00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:33.030
That's a unique name for a company.

342
00:25:36.399 --> 00:25:38.240
This is an online dating app. Haven't you tried it?

343
00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:41.780
If you post up your photo here,

344
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:43.609
people will rate you.

345
00:25:43.939 --> 00:25:45.109
Rate me?

346
00:25:45.349 --> 00:25:47.280
According to the score, people are placed in different levels.

347
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.419
Then the app introduces you to a man with the same level.

348
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.119
Then...

349
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.859
can't I meet someone who's in a higher level?

350
00:25:54.859 --> 00:25:57.159
Yes, but if you want to meet someone like that,

351
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.530
you have to pay more. Isn't it unbelievable?

352
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.659
Is this like a caste system or something?

353
00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:05.169
I think it'll make some people feel bad.

354
00:26:05.929 --> 00:26:08.240
You know, there are so many people who use this app.

355
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.399
They are the most prominent ones for the event tomorrow.

356
00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:12.909
Every investor wants to invest in it.

357
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.540
People have such healthy mental health these days.

358
00:26:15.939 --> 00:26:19.450
Of course. You have to have a strong mentality to date anyone.

359
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.679
Otherwise, you won't be able to.

360
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.450
Dating is a competition these days.

361
00:26:23.649 --> 00:26:25.720
- You know what I'm saying? - Yes, I do.

362
00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:29.460
Do you have a hole in your jaw? Why do you spill so much?

363
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:30.889
Goodness.

364
00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:32.760
Humans are simpler than you think.

365
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.359
We focused on that thought.

366
00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:37.929
Why do so many people fail in blind dates?

367
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.629
Having good conversations and good feelings towards each other...

368
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.169
is too subjective.

369
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.070
We decided to be more honest.

370
00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.740
We thought humans have basic instincts and came up with the app.

371
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.379
Men tend to focus on women's looks.

372
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.950
On the other hand, women focus on what men are capable of.

373
00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:58.889
It considers the physical distance between people too.

374
00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:02.089
It sets you up with the person who's the closest to you.

375
00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:05.560
As a result, 350,000 people signed up in 5months.

376
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.829
Our sales reached 380,000 dollars per month.

377
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.700
By the way,

378
00:27:11.899 --> 00:27:13.030
Yes.

379
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.139
Why is the application called "Dating, Not Marriage"?

380
00:27:18.139 --> 00:27:22.310
Isn't it better to emphasize on the result of love, marriage?

381
00:27:22.409 --> 00:27:25.780
How can the marriage be the result of love?

382
00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:29.720
Don't you date someone to get married?

383
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.589
So how is it not the result of love?

384
00:27:31.589 --> 00:27:33.050
Marriage limits your freedom.

385
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:36.820
In modern society, marriage is just a system to preserve your genes.

386
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.760
It's nothing more than that.

387
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.129
Are you talking about the result of love?

388
00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:43.560
That's a false hope of those people who are far behind the times.

389
00:27:43.659 --> 00:27:46.929
They just want to continue the system in the name of love.

390
00:27:46.929 --> 00:27:49.500
- What is he talking about? - What is far behind the times?

391
00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:54.240
Why is he doing that now?

392
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.179
Are you saying that people of my generation are...

393
00:27:57.179 --> 00:28:00.109
behind the times?

394
00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:03.879
No, that's not what we are talking about.

395
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.419
Our application is aiming for...

396
00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:08.260
dating, not marriage.

397
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.960
Everyone has different values, and it affects...

398
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.230
what they focus on and how it happens when it comes to marriage.

399
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.859
However, you share only one value with the person you date.

400
00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:19.200
It's love.

401
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.909
(Love is science. Use your data for Dating, Not Marriage.)

402
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.280
He knows how to sell things.

403
00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:39.720
I told you not to get any questions. That was my role.

404
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.990
You just needed to show your fine face to the investors. Is that hard?

405
00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:47.030
Is it that difficult to act like a normal person for just a little bit?

406
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.159
Am I asking you too much?

407
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.800
Nam Se Hee, your presentation was fantastic. It was amazing.

408
00:28:54.869 --> 00:28:56.970
Se Hee, where are you going?

409
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.240
We just started it off. We have to go to the networking event.

410
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.710
I don't care. You are the normal one. So you can take care of that.

411
00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:04.379
Don't you think so, Mr. Ma?

412
00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:09.750
He does hold a grudge against me quite often.

413
00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:11.750
That's one of his charming points.

414
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.720
I will make him a better person though.

415
00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:36.510
(Myung Villa)

416
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.820
The door is locked.

417
00:29:43.079 --> 00:29:44.550
I came here to pick my things up.

418
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:51.020
The door is locked.

419
00:29:51.329 --> 00:29:52.960
Can I take my things now?

420
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.240
Give me my things, punk.

421
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.109
(Ms. Hwang)

422
00:30:13.409 --> 00:30:16.250
Here's your coffee. Isn't this what you only drink?

423
00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.050
Thank you.

424
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.720
Drink up.

425
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:26.859
Are you still upset at me?

426
00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:31.200
- I'm not, but... - I know.

427
00:30:33.829 --> 00:30:34.939
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:41.439
I've been thinking about what you said. You are right.

429
00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:45.579
I always say that I want to do something new and creative.

430
00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:48.750
But we end up doing what we always do.

431
00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.050
It's always the same.

432
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.720
Things become the revision of what we did before.

433
00:30:55.419 --> 00:30:57.889
I wasn't like that when I just made my debut though.

434
00:30:57.889 --> 00:31:00.230
But I had to survive.

435
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.639
You know how long we've worked together.

436
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.510
It's been five years.

437
00:31:14.579 --> 00:31:17.609
You know I always want you to be successful.

438
00:31:17.849 --> 00:31:20.050
Do you know that?

439
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:23.379
Yes, I know.

440
00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:26.450
I always appreciate it.

441
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.520
Then why did you do that?

442
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.629
You are smiling now.

443
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.300
Let's go have some drinks today.

444
00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:38.030
Just the two of us?

445
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.770
- Why? Do you not like it? - No, that's not it.

446
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.300
Do you not drink that much anyway?

447
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.740
Why not? I can drink some today.

448
00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:48.540
Let's go out.

449
00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:51.010
Ms. Hwang.

450
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.950
Thank you.

451
00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:55.649
Don't say that.

452
00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.189
Let's go.

453
00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.649
You still have some left.

454
00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:04.730
- Hello. - Welcome.

455
00:32:06.659 --> 00:32:09.159
So, finding a date based on a rating system...

456
00:32:09.399 --> 00:32:10.960
sounds like a new caste system to me.

457
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.300
How much do you expect for the estimated revenue?

458
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.700
Well, since we released the last updated version last week,

459
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.810
I'm expecting it to be 300% more than usual.

460
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.740
It's a bit embarrassing, but I humbly say so.

461
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.250
Doesn't that mean you wouldn't need investors like us?

462
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.550
Your investment is what we need to grow up more.

463
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.089
It's our lifeline to go further.

464
00:32:31.419 --> 00:32:34.520
Until we make an IPO, please don't hesitate to support us.

465
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.929
I love his attitude.

466
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.129
- He's not like other young CEOs. - I agree.

467
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.929
- Mr. Park. - Hello, sir.

468
00:32:46.129 --> 00:32:47.470
How have you been?

469
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.570
- How are you? - I'm good.

470
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:50.740
- Hi. - Nice to meet you.

471
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.810
- Hello. - Hi.

472
00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.139
- Your work is very impressive. - Thank you.

473
00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.240
Don't you think so, Ms. Woo?

474
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.079
Yes, I do. I love how clear the message was.

475
00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.609
Have you used the application too?

476
00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:04.079
I think you will get the diamond level.

477
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.089
Sadly, that didn't happen.

478
00:33:08.089 --> 00:33:09.490
I don't believe you.

479
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:10.990
Isn't that because you only uploaded pictures of your face?

480
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.760
You should upload the picture of your head to toe.

481
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.559
Really? Are those pictures looking that good?

482
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:19.530
- I had no idea. - Of course.

483
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.100
Not only is she smart, but she also has a great feature.

484
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.039
She's at the top of the tree.

485
00:33:25.939 --> 00:33:27.939
- Ms. Woo is also... - Mr. Park.

486
00:33:28.709 --> 00:33:31.249
I'm sorry, but can I borrow you a cigarette by any chance?

487
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.010
- I left mine in the car. - Let me see...

488
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:35.780
Speaking of that, why don't we go out and smoke now?

489
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.120
- Shall we? - I would love that.

490
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.120
- Please come this way. - Let's go.

491
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.019
Wait.

492
00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.890
Ms. Woo, you should come with us too.

493
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.089
What are you talking about?

494
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.490
I'll see you later.

495
00:33:59.614 --> 00:34:02.846

496
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.089
The rooftop is the best spot to smoke.

497
00:34:17.689 --> 00:34:20.289
By the way, do you not remember me?

498
00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:24.100
I think I do. Didn't we meet at the wedding?

499
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.970
Yes, that's right. That's where we first met.

500
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.370
- What a small world. - I know, right?

501
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.140
Do you not remember anywhere else?

502
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.580
We met at the rooftop party last year.

503
00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:49.120
We were talking like this and I even lit up your cigarette.

504
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.019
We were drinking beer together.

505
00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:54.229
Oh, you drank a cocktail. After that, we...

506
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:01.240
Okay.

507
00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:03.640
I guess you don't want to talk about it.

508
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.740
No, that's not it.

509
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.039
Well, since you brought it up. I will talk about it.

510
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.879
We slept together, didn't we?

511
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.180
I was going to pretend it didn't happen.

512
00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.320
Did I sleep with you...

513
00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:23.059
last year?

514
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.089
Do you really not remember anything?

515
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:30.459
It was the room 303. We stayed in that room.

516
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.300
How can you not remember that?

517
00:35:35.769 --> 00:35:38.169
I thought we got along pretty well. Do you not remember that?

518
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.180
I'm sorry.

519
00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:45.309
I usually remember the guys I slept with.

520
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:49.080
But I can't remember you at all.

521
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.390
I guess you were not that impressive.

522
00:35:58.059 --> 00:35:59.589
Did she say she didn't remember me?

523
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:02.499
How can that happen? I thought it was very memorable.

524
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.999
How can she not remember my impressive skills?

525
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.510
- Isn't this place great? - Yes, it is.

526
00:36:27.249 --> 00:36:29.160
- Cheers! - Cheers!

527
00:36:32.789 --> 00:36:35.459
I heard Yong Suk...

528
00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:39.030
found a place for Ji Ho.

529
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.470
That's so special. You guys look great together.

530
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.600
I agree.

531
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.709
I like how kids can be friends with the opposite gender these days.

532
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.809
There was nothing like that when I was young.

533
00:36:48.809 --> 00:36:50.510
It was impossible then.

534
00:36:50.609 --> 00:36:53.180
There used to be rumors if they stayed up overnight together.

535
00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.479
- It was considered serious then. - That's right.

536
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.749
We suffered a lot because of that.

537
00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.490
It's not the case for me, but you're different.

538
00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.189
You liked me for real then.

539
00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.959
What's wrong with you? Don't be like this.

540
00:37:05.959 --> 00:37:08.959
Why would you bring that up now? Stop it.

541
00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:10.430
How could you change like this?

542
00:37:11.169 --> 00:37:12.729
Well, Ji Ho.

543
00:37:13.129 --> 00:37:14.939
Let me pour you a drink.

544
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:18.470
Here.

545
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.010
You know, when young people work together,

546
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:27.709
there are all kinds of happenings.

547
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:30.180
- It's the same everywhere. - Right.

548
00:37:30.519 --> 00:37:31.789
You punk.

549
00:37:32.289 --> 00:37:34.459
Apologize to her.

550
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.689
I heard he made a huge mistake to you.

551
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.589
So I scolded him so much...

552
00:37:40.629 --> 00:37:42.499
last night.

553
00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:45.930
He said he wanted to apologize to you.

554
00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:48.769
- So I brought him here with me. - Good job.

555
00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:51.510
Ms. Yoon.

556
00:37:52.039 --> 00:37:55.479
I was too drunk that I must've lost my mind.

557
00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.950
I'm sorry.

558
00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:02.149
I was going to beat you up to death.

559
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:04.450
But I didn't for Mr. Park's sake. Do you understand?

560
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.359
What...

561
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.830
are you all doing now?

562
00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:15.899
Why...

563
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:19.800
Why...

564
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.470
Why would you scold him?

565
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.680
Why would you say that?

566
00:38:32.249 --> 00:38:33.510
I'm...

567
00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.450
the victim here.

568
00:38:40.089 --> 00:38:41.260
What do you mean, victim?

569
00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:43.689
I don't think that's appropriate.

570
00:38:43.789 --> 00:38:45.160
I was sexually harassed.

571
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.430
No, I was almost raped.

572
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.070
So it's appropriate to call myself a victim.

573
00:38:52.269 --> 00:38:53.669
What do you mean?

574
00:38:54.129 --> 00:38:55.600
How could you say that?

575
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.910
You shut your mouth before I put you in prison.

576
00:38:58.209 --> 00:39:01.039
Ms. Yoon. You're out of line.

577
00:39:01.209 --> 00:39:04.410
We're like family, so you shouldn't behave this way.

578
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:08.050
We gathered here because of you, and he apologized.

579
00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.050
I know.

580
00:39:10.879 --> 00:39:13.220
Why did you have to make such a gathering?

581
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.519
I don't know...

582
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:22.629
why I should get his apology this way.

583
00:39:23.059 --> 00:39:24.160
Hold on.

584
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:25.970
Ji Ho.

585
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800
We're precious to each other.

586
00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:32.539
So we're trying not to break our teamwork.

587
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.809
You're trying?

588
00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.379
You call this trying?

589
00:39:36.939 --> 00:39:39.780
It's like I've been struck by a rock and am bleeding now.

590
00:39:42.419 --> 00:39:45.019
Carrying me to a hospital should be considered trying in this situation.

591
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.720
You're rather forcing me to keep going my way,

592
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.459
telling me that I seem all right and I'm not bleeding that much.

593
00:39:50.559 --> 00:39:53.289
You're dragging me by force. This isn't trying.

594
00:39:55.129 --> 00:39:57.729
I'm bleeding so much and hurt to death.

595
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.269
Ji Ho.

596
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.470
You think you're in a college club or something?

597
00:40:05.609 --> 00:40:08.109
If you whine like this for something so trivial,

598
00:40:08.379 --> 00:40:10.240
you won't be able to make any drama.

599
00:40:10.709 --> 00:40:13.350
Drama is about teamwork.

600
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.780
It's related to your past and your future too.

601
00:40:17.019 --> 00:40:20.220
Without us, it's impossible for you to get your script chosen.

602
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.089
Yes,

603
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:26.430
I'm aware.

604
00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:31.059
So I...

605
00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:34.740
won't write scripts anymore.

606
00:40:36.169 --> 00:40:37.399
I quit.

607
00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:42.280
So don't call me ever again.

608
00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:48.580
Ji Ho.

609
00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:59.490
("A Lucky Day" by Hyun Jin Geon)

610
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.169
Good job.

611
00:41:10.839 --> 00:41:12.539
You did a great job, Ji Ho.

612
00:41:15.709 --> 00:41:16.979
You didn't cry either.

613
00:41:17.879 --> 00:41:19.410
Great job.

614
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.339
- Here, drink one more. - What?

615
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:49.640
I've had five glasses of it already.

616
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.450
What do you mean, already? It's yet.

617
00:41:51.879 --> 00:41:55.050
You have to drink all night on the day you resign from work.

618
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:59.189
Right, you just have to repeat drinking and throwing up tonight.

619
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.950
We'll take care of the rest.

620
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:02.089
You're scary.

621
00:42:02.289 --> 00:42:04.490
- You said you'd comfort me. - Exactly.

622
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.629
Here's another drink of comfort. Cheers.

623
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.309
I can't drink anymore.

624
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.879
Or my stomach will explode.

625
00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.680
Then shall we set off now that you're fueled up?

626
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.919
- To where? - Of course, to a karaoke bar.

627
00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.149
No, I really can't.

628
00:42:34.149 --> 00:42:36.289
I'll throw up for certain if I go now.

629
00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:38.559
- Please. - I know you won't. Let's go.

630
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:40.629
- Please... - Let's go.

631
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.680
Soo Ji and Ho Rang have always been like this.

632
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.510
When I go through a hard time,

633
00:43:32.249 --> 00:43:35.019
they never ask me what happened or why it happened...

634
00:43:36.149 --> 00:43:38.050
like others do.

635
00:43:39.089 --> 00:43:42.990
They chat and laugh as usual.

636
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.959
To think, that's the biggest comfort I can ever get.

637
00:43:53.629 --> 00:43:54.700
What?

638
00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:56.769
So are we seeing them tomorrow?

639
00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.039
Why would you take care of the matter this poorly?

640
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.479
Okay, I'll go check now.

641
00:44:04.979 --> 00:44:06.249
Do you need to go?

642
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:08.649
It's about our important client. Things got messed up.

643
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.749
This is why I wanted to turn my phone off.

644
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.390
No, it's all right. Hurry and go.

645
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:13.850
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.559
Yes, sir.

647
00:44:18.629 --> 00:44:20.089
Gosh, I'm sorry.

648
00:44:32.769 --> 00:44:34.269
I thought she wanted to drink all night.

649
00:44:36.479 --> 00:44:37.979
(Honey)

650
00:44:40.649 --> 00:44:41.780
Hi, Won Seok.

651
00:44:42.649 --> 00:44:43.720
Gosh, she's so heavy.

652
00:44:45.519 --> 00:44:48.189
You quit your job, so why did she get so excited?

653
00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:50.660
I know. She's not good at drinking either.

654
00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.990
How should you go home? It's too late.

655
00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:55.100
- Sleep over at our house. - Come on.

656
00:44:55.499 --> 00:44:57.600
Don't forget that we're 30, not 20.

657
00:44:57.999 --> 00:44:59.129
Here's a taxi.

658
00:44:59.399 --> 00:45:00.729
Oh, taxi.

659
00:45:01.169 --> 00:45:02.269
Thank you.

660
00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:05.870
Thank you.

661
00:45:10.709 --> 00:45:12.050
But they all...

662
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.120
have a place to return to.

663
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:22.519
All the buses have stopped running.

664
00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.160
Except for me.

665
00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:38.640
Why do I always wander around on streets?

666
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.850
(Mom)

667
00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.850
Hello?

668
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.050
Where are you? Aren't you going to bed?

669
00:45:54.289 --> 00:45:57.220
I'm still outside. I had some things to do.

670
00:45:57.459 --> 00:45:59.089
Don't stay outside until too late.

671
00:45:59.459 --> 00:46:02.229
It won't make a good impression on your housemate.

672
00:46:02.229 --> 00:46:03.359
I'm on my way home now.

673
00:46:03.499 --> 00:46:05.499
Keep your room tidy all the time.

674
00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:07.499
Wash your cup right after you finish your coffee.

675
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700
Okay.

676
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.539
Don't just come out after drying your hair.

677
00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:14.209
Wipe the floor every morning and night to remove your hair.

678
00:46:14.209 --> 00:46:17.140
Gosh, please stop nagging. I said okay.

679
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.550
Why you... Why are you throwing a tantrum?

680
00:46:19.709 --> 00:46:22.350
I'm only telling you this stuff because I'm worried.

681
00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:23.979
How can I do any better?

682
00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.450
You think everything will work out if I do things well?

683
00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.959
You don't know anything.

684
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:37.059
Okay.

685
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.669
Go home and don't forget to eat your meals.

686
00:46:41.839 --> 00:46:43.070
I'm hanging up.

687
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.839
Ji Ho.

688
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.010
Yes.

689
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.979
You can come down here if Seoul is too cold.

690
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.249
Your room is still here.

691
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.789
You can come anytime, okay?

692
00:47:40.129 --> 00:47:42.300
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

693
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.600
Take this.

694
00:47:45.999 --> 00:47:47.600
- Is it mine? - Yes.

695
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.600
Some man gave it to me, saying it's for unit 401.

696
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.709
I see.

697
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:55.580
(I'm leaving the bag here as you told me not to call you. Yong Suk.)

698
00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:12.930
What's this?

699
00:48:13.359 --> 00:48:16.160
I took your things from the security office.

700
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.870
I guess my former workplace sent it...

701
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.499
it to that address according to the contract.

702
00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:26.109
I'm sorry about that. Can I go get it today?

703
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.680
Of course. Come anytime you want.

704
00:48:38.019 --> 00:48:41.589
What's this? I haven't had breakfast for so long!

705
00:48:43.089 --> 00:48:44.890
You should have breakfast from time to time.

706
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.930
How can you never have the food that your mom sent you?

707
00:48:48.399 --> 00:48:51.330
Hey, you know my mom makes so much food every time.

708
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.669
Do you want to go out since it's the weekend?

709
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.269
Soo Ji.

710
00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:01.339
I'm going to Namhae today.

711
00:49:01.339 --> 00:49:04.410
You should. Go and take a rest there.

712
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.879
No. I mean, I'm going there for good.

713
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:08.419
I'm leaving Seoul.

714
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.649
What?

715
00:49:10.649 --> 00:49:14.149
My scenario didn't work, and I have nothing else to do.

716
00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:20.229
If it's about housing, you can stay here.

717
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:21.999
I'm really okay with it.

718
00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.059
It's not about that.

719
00:49:24.769 --> 00:49:25.930
I just...

720
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.169
think Seoul is...

721
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.209
too cold that I'm tired of it.

722
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.640
I'm going to Namhae.

723
00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.120
The receiver cannot be reached. Please leave a message...

724
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.459
Is he not in there?

725
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.850
Hey, you. How have you been?

726
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.109
Have you eaten yet?

727
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.320
Let's go.

728
00:50:32.499 --> 00:50:35.439
I'm leaving the bag as you told me not to call you.

729
00:50:35.769 --> 00:50:36.899
I'm sorry.

730
00:50:47.879 --> 00:50:49.820
(Turtle Student Residence)

731
00:50:53.419 --> 00:50:56.160
I can't throw it by myself.

732
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.899
Let me just leave it here.

733
00:51:03.399 --> 00:51:05.200
Please recycle it for me.

734
00:51:11.439 --> 00:51:12.570
Hello.

735
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.580
What did you say to her?

736
00:51:17.439 --> 00:51:21.479
What did you say that her parents are so mad?

737
00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:26.919
What did you say you want from her?

738
00:51:26.919 --> 00:51:29.260
- I asked her to pay monthly rent. - Are you out of your mind?

739
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.689
Why would you get a monthly rent from your future wife?

740
00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:33.689
Because I need rent.

741
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:36.499
She said she wants to quit her work, have a baby,

742
00:51:36.499 --> 00:51:39.229
and travel when we get married.

743
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.800
So I told her that I want my roommate to pay rent,

744
00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:44.839
do recycling, and clean up after my cat's poop.

745
00:51:44.839 --> 00:51:46.140
That's what I told her.

746
00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:48.309
- Is that wrong? - What do you mean by that?

747
00:51:48.379 --> 00:51:50.839
I mean, even if you don't like her,

748
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:54.350
is it something normal for you to say on a blind date?

749
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.820
That's definitely not normal.

750
00:51:56.879 --> 00:51:58.689
What is being normal?

751
00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:01.760
Just give and receive love like most men do.

752
00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.760
Give birth and live like other people do.

753
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.160
- How's that normal? - That's indeed normal.

754
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.559
Everyone lives like that. What's so hard about it?

755
00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:13.999
Do you know the average cost for getting married in Korea?

756
00:52:14.669 --> 00:52:17.740
I guess it would cost around 50,000 to 60,000 dollars.

757
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.939
The average is 2.7 million dollars.

758
00:52:18.939 --> 00:52:20.510
It costs 3 million dollars to raise a kid.

759
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.209
Why would I get married to a woman...

760
00:52:22.209 --> 00:52:25.080
who doesn't even know the difference between plastic and styrofoam...

761
00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.680
and spend so much money?

762
00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.820
What on earth are you saying?

763
00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.720
Are we having a job interview?

764
00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:32.749
She's really pretty.

765
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:35.959
Every man would fall for that.

766
00:52:35.959 --> 00:52:38.229
I'm just satisfied with this young and pretty cat.

767
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.399
Do you by any chance...

768
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.399
have a problem?

769
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:46.970
A problem?

770
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.709
I mean, are you affected by environmental hormones...

771
00:52:52.709 --> 00:52:55.339
that your sexual capability...

772
00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:57.979
- Mother. - Whatever.

773
00:52:57.979 --> 00:52:59.950
Matchmakers think you're weird.

774
00:53:00.479 --> 00:53:04.890
There won't be any more blind dates, so apologize to Ms. Hwang.

775
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.450
I think she still likes you.

776
00:53:08.019 --> 00:53:10.760
- Why would I... - If your dad divorces me...

777
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:13.260
because of you, I'm going to live here.

778
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.859
You know your dad well, so I won't say much.

779
00:53:17.059 --> 00:53:19.399
Choose if it'd be better to live with your old mother...

780
00:53:19.399 --> 00:53:23.470
or with a young and beautiful wife. It's up to you.

781
00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:27.510
Gosh.

782
00:53:38.149 --> 00:53:39.249
- Excuse... - Goodness!

783
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:44.654
- Excuse... - Goodness!

784
00:53:49.507 --> 00:53:50.617
Well...

785
00:53:56.432 --> 00:53:57.653
I'm really sorry.

786
00:53:57.851 --> 00:53:59.991
I didn't want to be busted by your mother.

787
00:53:59.991 --> 00:54:03.092
No, it's okay. I'm grateful that you did that.

788
00:54:04.362 --> 00:54:07.431
But why did you bring all your luggage?

789
00:54:08.002 --> 00:54:10.061
Did you get kicked out?

790
00:54:10.061 --> 00:54:12.172
Well, yes.

791
00:54:12.572 --> 00:54:15.402
I'm actually going home in Namhae.

792
00:54:15.402 --> 00:54:16.672
What about your job?

793
00:54:17.712 --> 00:54:18.942
I quit it.

794
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:25.982
I want to thank you for renting me such a nice room.

795
00:54:28.081 --> 00:54:31.692
I could write my first proper scenario here thanks to you,

796
00:54:32.491 --> 00:54:34.661
even though it didn't go well.

797
00:54:35.721 --> 00:54:38.331
You'll do well wherever you go.

798
00:54:38.592 --> 00:54:40.391
You're a very responsible person.

799
00:54:41.561 --> 00:54:45.572
You scored the highest among all the tenants who lived here.

800
00:54:46.371 --> 00:54:50.042
That's right. You'll do well too.

801
00:54:50.272 --> 00:54:53.511
You'll marry a nice woman soon as well.

802
00:54:54.681 --> 00:54:55.842
I don't know.

803
00:54:56.141 --> 00:54:58.982
I don't know if I will be able to marry someone.

804
00:54:59.781 --> 00:55:02.781
Why not? You proposed to me as well.

805
00:55:03.322 --> 00:55:04.721
Why wouldn't you be able to get married?

806
00:55:05.451 --> 00:55:06.692
It's because it was you.

807
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:11.431
I did that because it was you.

808
00:55:12.561 --> 00:55:14.732
You scored the highest as the tenant.

809
00:55:15.931 --> 00:55:18.831
I need you, not a marriage.

810
00:55:19.031 --> 00:55:20.402
That's why I proposed to you.

811
00:55:22.002 --> 00:55:26.072
I knew it was not the right moment to fall for him.

812
00:55:27.942 --> 00:55:29.581
I need a roommate...

813
00:55:30.112 --> 00:55:33.351
who can guarantee me monthly rent instead of marriage.

814
00:55:36.281 --> 00:55:37.422
But still,

815
00:55:39.851 --> 00:55:41.121
it was the first time...

816
00:55:47.362 --> 00:55:50.331
hearing that someone needs me.

817
00:55:54.502 --> 00:55:56.871
(Boarding Direction)

00:56:00.712 --> 00:56:02.641
- Where are you heading? - The earliest ticket to Namhae.

819
00:56:03.141 --> 00:56:04.581
Throughout my life in 20s,

820
00:56:06.081 --> 00:56:09.552
I worked hard to be a person who's needed for something.

821
00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:22.502
I crossed the Han River Bridge whenever I went through a hard time.

822
00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:25.302
Looking over Han River,

823
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:28.842
I thought there might be...

824
00:56:30.042 --> 00:56:31.741
at least one place...

825
00:56:32.612 --> 00:56:34.781
that needed me in this big city.

826
00:56:44.552 --> 00:56:46.092
That's how I thought.

827
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:05.042
For 10 years,

828
00:57:06.471 --> 00:57:09.112
this luggage got scratched up so much like me.

829
00:57:11.011 --> 00:57:14.052
It was shiny when I first came to Seoul with it.

830
00:57:20.451 --> 00:57:23.391
(Seoul to Namhae)

831
00:57:28.061 --> 00:57:30.701
For what did I try so hard to live,

832
00:57:32.072 --> 00:57:36.201
when I'd go back to Namhae without any achievement?

833
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:40.442
There wasn't any place for me...

834
00:57:42.612 --> 00:57:44.252
from the beginning anyway.

835
00:58:07.201 --> 00:58:08.241
What are you doing here?

836
00:58:09.741 --> 00:58:12.042
- How... - Why didn't you answer your phone?

837
00:58:14.042 --> 00:58:16.842
It ran out of battery.

838
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:20.712
You left these in your room.

839
00:58:23.281 --> 00:58:25.491
Did you come here to give me these?

840
00:58:25.692 --> 00:58:27.692
I was on my way out,

841
00:58:28.422 --> 00:58:30.721
and I remembered you said your bus departs at 7pm.

842
00:58:32.491 --> 00:58:34.331
It seemed like you needed these.

843
00:58:38.902 --> 00:58:39.931
Yes.

844
00:58:42.042 --> 00:58:43.471
I need them.

845
00:58:43.542 --> 00:58:45.141
We'll depart shortly.

846
00:58:46.311 --> 00:58:47.411
Then, goodbye.

847
00:58:48.411 --> 00:58:49.482
Bye.

848
00:59:18.042 --> 00:59:19.342
It's because it was you.

849
00:59:20.942 --> 00:59:22.681
I did that because it was you.

850
00:59:26.712 --> 00:59:30.252
He's the first person...

851
00:59:31.951 --> 00:59:33.891
who said he needed me.

852
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:45.802
The driver won't wait long because he's upset.

853
00:59:46.132 --> 00:59:47.471
So give me a quick answer.

854
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:49.572
Okay.

855
00:59:50.101 --> 00:59:51.141
Will you...

856
00:59:52.141 --> 00:59:53.411
marry me?

857
00:59:56.141 --> 00:59:58.982
Hurry. He's waiting.

858
01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:01.951
Okay.

859
01:00:02.382 --> 01:00:04.451
Then I'll go unload my luggage.

860
01:00:04.951 --> 01:00:06.752
He's very upset.

861
01:00:08.092 --> 01:00:09.192
Look.

862
01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:12.831
I have something to ask before then.

863
01:00:13.061 --> 01:00:14.531
Go ahead.

864
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:16.201
By any chance,

865
01:00:20.101 --> 01:00:21.442
do you like me?

866
01:00:24.971 --> 01:00:26.112
No.

867
01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:37.692
That's how...

868
01:00:41.592 --> 01:00:42.962
our proposal began.

869
01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:07.081
(Because This Is My First Life)

870
01:01:07.351 --> 01:01:09.681
I decided to marry my tenant today.

871
01:01:10.382 --> 01:01:12.552
Are you serious? Are you sure you're marrying a girl?

872
01:01:12.552 --> 01:01:14.792
We've known only for a short time,

873
01:01:14.792 --> 01:01:17.261
but he's someone I need.

874
01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:19.991
- You need him? - I know why you're marrying him.

875
01:01:20.232 --> 01:01:23.101
You can fool everyone, but not me.

876
01:01:23.261 --> 01:01:24.701
- She's pretty. - Is she?

877
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:27.701
My family is very patriarchal.

878
01:01:27.772 --> 01:01:29.971
Shall I make a scene here?

879
01:01:31.141 --> 01:01:32.411
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

880
01:01:32.542 --> 01:01:35.382
I thought he loved you at least.

881
01:01:36.241 --> 01:01:37.752
Will you be all right?

882
01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:40.011
Why do you ask such a question?

883
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:42.221
I love him.

884
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:46.991
Marrying this tenant is the answer indeed.
