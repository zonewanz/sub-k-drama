<i>[This program is suitable

3
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:18.077
No, I feel sad sometimes...

4
00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:21.814
but I don't feel depressed.
I'm not lonely either.

5
00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:25.161
I think I'm doing quite well.

6
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.861
- You can speak comfortably.
- I'm comfortable.

7
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:33.512
You don't have to worry about what
others will think if they heard you.

8
00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.417
You must be honest here.

9
00:00:36.146 --> 00:00:38.319
I'm being honest.

10
00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.572
The thing is...

11
00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:54.557
I want to die.

12
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.500
If I die, I don't
have to live any longer.

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.850
What's the use of living?

14
00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:03.438
Hold on.

15
00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:09.575
Yes, Gapyeong Garden.

16
00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.789
Yes, a reservation? Yes.

17
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.570
A group of 32 people?

18
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.524
You'd like marinated duck?
Yes. Yes, I got it...

19
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.090
We'll give you the blankets,
but you must bring the hwatu cards.

20
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.841
Yes, thank you very much.

21
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.641
Where did we leave off?

22
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.066
- You said you want to die.
- Yes.

23
00:01:43.058 --> 00:01:45.784
I really want to die.

24
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.572
Yes, Gapyeong Garden.

25
00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:52.584
<i>[Gapyeong Garden]</i>

26
00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:57.295
<i>I'm sorry. I get a lot of
reservation calls on the weekends.</i>

27
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.234
<i>I own a restaurant.</i>

28
00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:03.070
Here you go. Here you go.

29
00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:08.907
Attention! Attention!
Hold your glasses up!

30
00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:13.576
With World Pharmaceuticals,
which is spreading across the world

31
00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:19.259
this is for our chief, who made time for
us on the weekend for our team's unity!

32
00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.197
- Cheers!
- We worked hard!

33
00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:22.973
We worked hard!

34
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.540
- Excuse me!
<i>- Yes?</i>

35
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.651
Please get us a few more beers and soju!

36
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.193
Yes!

37
00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.193
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38
00:02:45.193 --> 00:02:48.330
<i>We were conned,
and our rent increased a lot.</i>

39
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.100
<i>We couldn't save much money.</i>

40
00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:55.991
<i>My husband worked very hard
by himself all these years.</i>

41
00:02:56.568 --> 00:03:01.513
<i>Women feel happy even if the man
stays by her side without doing anything.</i>

42
00:03:02.811 --> 00:03:06.878
But the truth is, I feel uneasy
when I'm with my husband.

43
00:03:06.878 --> 00:03:09.907
He has a difficult personality

44
00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:13.403
and even when he says something right

45
00:03:13.403 --> 00:03:15.986
he knows how to make
the listener feel bad.

46
00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:18.286
- Be careful.
- I'm fine.

47
00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:19.774
Let's go.

48
00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.406
It's 650,000 won.

49
00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:25.740
- The drinks are on us.
- Thank you.

50
00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:29.980
Charge me 1 million won,
and give me 300,000 won in cash.

51
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.796
You can keep 50,000 won.

52
00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.153
- This is a company card.
- It is.

53
00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.473
You can't do that with a company card.

54
00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:44.538
There's nothing we can't do in Korea.

55
00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:48.477
I won't accept your company card.

56
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.084
You sure run your business
in a strange way.

57
00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:57.889
Hurry up and charge it.

58
00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:04.037
I already said I won't take it!
Where did you learn your manners?

59
00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:08.394
What? You must be crazy!

60
00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:12.693
Hey, bring your boss out.
I want to talk to your boss!

61
00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:17.189
I'm right here.
What are you going to do, huh?

62
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.500
What's wrong? Please stop.

63
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.081
He's playing tricks
with his company card!

64
00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:27.095
This is why our country can't reunite!

65
00:04:27.095 --> 00:04:30.237
- Please stop.
- Is that why we can't reunite?

66
00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:31.747
Pay me in cash!

67
00:04:31.747 --> 00:04:34.430
I'm paying with my card
because I don't have cash!

68
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.896
Where's your boss? What's his number?

69
00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:43.057
I probably said this the most
while living with him.

70
00:04:43.057 --> 00:04:46.937
Please stop. Please stop, Honey.

71
00:04:46.937 --> 00:04:48.418
Please stop.

72
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:51.567
You always tell me to stop, this woman.

73
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:54.519
And when I do, he gets mad.
He makes me feel bad.

74
00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:57.750
Do you want to die
because of your husband?

75
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.213
No. It's definitely not like that.

76
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:06.071
I don't need any of this! Call your boss!

77
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:10.084
Is this sightseeing?
People don't go sightseeing like this!

78
00:05:10.084 --> 00:05:13.723
- Do you think you did a good job?
<i>- Gosh.</i>

79
00:05:13.723 --> 00:05:16.189
<i>I should just die.</i>

80
00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:18.867
Then why do you want to die?

81
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.081
Everything is pretty.

82
00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:28.199
The mountains are pretty,
and the trees are pretty.

83
00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:30.721
The sky is pretty too.

84
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.944
I feel like I'm the only one
who's not living a pretty life.

85
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:58.952
<i>[Don't cry, or a snake will come out.]</i>

86
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.447
Don't go!

87
00:06:09.237 --> 00:06:11.954
Who are you? You...

88
00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.033
- You know her, don't you?
- Huh?

89
00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:17.963
If you speak Japanese, I'll kill you!

90
00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.906
You locked us up
at the airport on the first day!

91
00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:33.279
You made us run a marathon today!

92
00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.420
We're here to have fun,
not for national training!

93
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.112
I'm sorry. We're late for lunch.

94
00:06:38.112 --> 00:06:41.165
In France, they're strict about
reservations, so we could miss lunch.

95
00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:44.189
- Then we should have met up earlier!
- Mister!

96
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.247
- Can't you speak quietly?
- Big Sis, don't butt into this!

97
00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:49.490
- Wait.
- You're too noisy!

98
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.581
I have a reason to be noisy!
Did we come here for this?

99
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:56.423
- Wait!
- Sir, I think...

100
00:06:56.423 --> 00:07:00.011
- Why are you butting in?
- I told you to be quiet!

101
00:07:04.586 --> 00:07:07.790
I think we forgot someone.

102
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.011
Pardon?

103
00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:29.790
- Take a break!
- Shut up!

104
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.269
Hey!

105
00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:34.391
Geez, good going, Big Sis Guide.

106
00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:36.338
You'll be on the news!

107
00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:38.521
Excuse me, shouldn't we turn around?

108
00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:40.744
Why don't you call him first?

109
00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:44.249
He must be startled
that he was left behind.

110
00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:47.036
I'm sorry. I'll try calling him.

111
00:07:55.954 --> 00:07:58.187
- Yes, this is San Ma Ru!
<i>- Hey, you punk!</i>

112
00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:00.168
Why haven't you sent me the file yet?

113
00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:01.752
There's an urgent matter!

114
00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:04.271
What's more urgent than your work?

115
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:06.670
I'm sorry! I'll send it right away!

116
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.064
<i>The number you've called is busy,
so after the beep...</i>

117
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.930
Hey!

118
00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:17.862
Pardon? What did you say?

119
00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:22.168
Your vacation request hasn't been
approved. You're absent without notice.

120
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.480
- Damn it.
- "Damn it"?

121
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.983
- This bastard!
- I didn't say that to you!

122
00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:29.966
Are you crazy?

123
00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:33.716
I have a reason! Wait! Wait!

124
00:08:33.716 --> 00:08:37.006
<i>The number you've called is busy,
so after the beep...</i>

125
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.870
His line is busy.
The restaurant is nearby

126
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.851
so you can eat while I bring him back.

127
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:49.566
Will that be okay? You said France
doesn't feed us if we're late.

128
00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:55.225
It's okay. In France,
there's a saying, "ça dépend."

129
00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:58.897
For example, if you go somewhere
and they refuse to serve you

130
00:08:58.897 --> 00:09:02.134
there are times when the place
next door will do it for you.

131
00:09:02.134 --> 00:09:06.461
The result is different depending on
the person and situation. "Ça dépend."

132
00:09:06.461 --> 00:09:08.854
Repeat after me, "ça dépend."

133
00:09:08.854 --> 00:09:10.424
- Ça dépend.
- Yes.

134
00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:12.687
That's nonsense.

135
00:09:12.687 --> 00:09:15.686
You said we couldn't be late,
but now we can be.

136
00:09:15.686 --> 00:09:18.986
- It's not consistent!
- I wish you'd stop.

137
00:09:18.986 --> 00:09:20.133
Be quiet.

138
00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.217
- Have one.
- No, that's okay.

139
00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:38.010
If you're down, sad, or angry

140
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.653
eat something sweet and close
your eyes. You'll feel much better.

141
00:09:42.653 --> 00:09:44.075
Have one.

142
00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:07.038
Why are you eating sweets?
You'll lose your appetite.

143
00:10:07.038 --> 00:10:08.263
Spit it out!

144
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.344
Thank you.

145
00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:29.980
I mean, thank you.

146
00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:07.201
- Hello, San Ma Ru?
- Yes, I missed the bus.

147
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:10.836
- I know. Why was your line busy?
- There was an urgent matter.

148
00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:14.256
- What's more urgent than this?
- By the way

149
00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:17.203
is that person good at fighting?

150
00:11:17.203 --> 00:11:19.922
Why? Is he still chasing you?

151
00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:22.014
Don't fight him.
He's a really good fighter.

152
00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:26.182
- I've fought too.
- He was a professional boxer.

153
00:11:32.868 --> 00:11:33.953
Pardon?

154
00:11:35.442 --> 00:11:36.500
Where are you?

155
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.635
You wouldn't know if I told you.
Where are you?

156
00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:39.775
Parking lot!

157
00:11:40.147 --> 00:11:41.191
Parking lot!

158
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:45.518
First, get cab and let me talk to
the driver. I'll tell him the directions.

159
00:11:50.163 --> 00:11:53.423
- Are you a Miss or Mrs.?
- Pardon?

160
00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:58.461
I own a restaurant, and this is
our most famous side dish.

161
00:11:58.461 --> 00:12:03.500
I see. You don't have to. You carried
this all the way here. You should eat it.

162
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.654
That's okay. We ate some already.
It's marinated duck.

163
00:12:07.654 --> 00:12:12.375
It's good for your skin and
circulation. It's very healthy.

164
00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:16.773
- You can cook duck this way?
- I don't know if you'll like it.

165
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.075
It's noisy because
of my husband, isn't it?

166
00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:22.488
Geez, not at all.

167
00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:24.645
Yes, it's pretty noisy.

168
00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:27.542
- Hey.
- What?

169
00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:32.134
I'm sorry, but he doesn't have
the right to yell because he's older.

170
00:12:32.134 --> 00:12:35.797
He was always like this,
but he's been worse these days.

171
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.528
I'm sorry. I'll make him be more careful.

172
00:12:39.528 --> 00:12:41.183
Please eat your food.

173
00:12:41.183 --> 00:12:43.846
- Yes, thank you.
- No problem.

174
00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:48.996
I wouldn't be able to live with him.

175
00:12:48.996 --> 00:12:51.582
Hey, middle-aged men are like that.

176
00:12:51.582 --> 00:12:55.841
That lady has depression.
She looks sad when she smiles.

177
00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:58.703
It must be because of her husband.
I feel bad for her.

178
00:12:58.703 --> 00:13:02.120
Can I eat this? Will it smell?

179
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.490
- I can't eat duck.
- But I like it.

180
00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:10.660
What is it? Is something wrong?

181
00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:15.865
Please have this and cheer up.

182
00:13:15.865 --> 00:13:20.879
It's good for your skin and digestion.
It's the best health food.

183
00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:23.977
Geez, this is so precious.

184
00:13:23.977 --> 00:13:26.950
I was wondering
how you had such nice skin.

185
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.499
Gosh, your skin is better.

186
00:13:31.115 --> 00:13:32.822
Are you unmarried?

187
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.275
- Take a guess.
- He's a father who pretends to be.

188
00:13:39.275 --> 00:13:40.731
He's a cheater.

189
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:47.854
Yes, thank you.

190
00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:54.125
Why aren't you eating?

191
00:13:54.764 --> 00:13:58.274
People talk about French food,
but there's nothing to eat.

192
00:13:58.274 --> 00:14:01.248
- It doesn't taste good.
- Are you sick?

193
00:14:02.794 --> 00:14:05.092
Why did you give them food?

194
00:14:05.092 --> 00:14:07.552
That young punk is rude.

195
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.889
And what's their relationship?

196
00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:13.658
Please stop. They'll hear you.

197
00:14:15.962 --> 00:14:17.686
He's here.

198
00:14:22.763 --> 00:14:25.660
You must be thirsty. Have some water.

199
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.717
Enjoy your food.
Enjoy your food. Enjoy your food.

200
00:14:47.717 --> 00:14:49.568
We already finished!

201
00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:55.601
Did you enjoy your food? Did you
enjoy your food? Did you enjoy your food?

202
00:15:15.865 --> 00:15:21.168
Auvers-sur-Oise is a small village
where the grave of the great painter

203
00:15:21.168 --> 00:15:24.815
Vincent van Gogh is located.

204
00:15:24.815 --> 00:15:27.950
Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet

205
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.735
- is worth 58 billion won.
- That much?

206
00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:36.558
The truth is, he was only able to sell
one painting while he was alive.

207
00:15:36.558 --> 00:15:38.284
He was a poor painter.

208
00:15:38.284 --> 00:15:40.700
He was only acknowledged after he died.

209
00:15:41.711 --> 00:15:46.195
<i>I wonder what it means
to be remembered after death.</i>

210
00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:50.998
I know there's no use

211
00:15:52.005 --> 00:15:54.494
but I feel greedy.

212
00:15:55.807 --> 00:15:59.125
I want my funeral photo to be beautiful.

213
00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:02.681
I don't want it to be
the generic from the photo studio.

214
00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:04.144
Honey.

215
00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:07.149
Take a picture of me.

216
00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:09.422
Take it from my waist up.

217
00:16:09.422 --> 00:16:14.480
"That person must have
lived a beautiful life."

218
00:16:15.027 --> 00:16:17.754
A picture that will
make people think that way.

219
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:23.918
A lot of packages don't include
Auvers-sur-Oise because it's not as fun

220
00:16:23.918 --> 00:16:27.102
- but I make sure to include it.
- Then why are we going?

221
00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:29.115
Then why are we going?

222
00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:32.474
It will be a great time for meditation.

223
00:16:33.436 --> 00:16:38.798
These are diaries.
I'll give them to you as gifts.

224
00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:41.717
- Give me one more.
- Hey, stop it.

225
00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:45.681
- Thank you.
- Yes, here you go.

226
00:16:49.178 --> 00:16:50.883
- Yes.
- Thank you.

227
00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.868
We have to drive for another hour,
so let's get some rest.

228
00:17:00.868 --> 00:17:02.491
Yes!

229
00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:11.922
<i>The people who were
at Montmartre are splitting up.</i>

230
00:17:11.922 --> 00:17:15.519
Rouen, Auvers-sur-Oise

231
00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:19.035
Mont Saint-Michel.

232
00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.192
Where did she go?

233
00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:28.047
It's the most famous site
within the French Alps.

234
00:17:29.776 --> 00:17:32.482
- Read this.
- What is this?

235
00:17:33.734 --> 00:17:35.439
Mont Blanc?

236
00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:38.317
Look here.

237
00:17:38.317 --> 00:17:41.501
I'm not looking down on you right now

238
00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:47.117
but if you're here to find someone,
shouldn't you pronounce words clearly?

239
00:17:47.117 --> 00:17:51.105
It's not Mont Blanc, but Mont Blanc.

240
00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:52.667
Mont Blanc.

241
00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:56.576
Read this.

242
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.854
Mont Saint-Michel.

243
00:18:01.073 --> 00:18:02.708
Repeat after me.

244
00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:04.993
Mont Saint-Michel.

245
00:18:04.993 --> 00:18:06.726
Mont Saint-Michel.

246
00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:10.319
Roll your tongue. Mont Saint-Michel.

247
00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:14.467
I got it. Mont Saint-Michel.

248
00:18:14.467 --> 00:18:16.913
Is that where So So went?

249
00:18:16.913 --> 00:18:20.171
- I'm not saying that.
- Geez, seriously!

250
00:18:21.063 --> 00:18:23.336
You shouldn't treat
a fellow Korean that way.

251
00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:28.382
I don't care! My family was ripped apart
and I went to jail because of her!

252
00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:32.929
So So is my employee and family member.

253
00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:37.053
If you come here
and scare me and threaten me

254
00:18:37.053 --> 00:18:40.741
do you think I'll tell you where she is?

255
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:46.713
In my life, I've also been beaten
around, did you know that?

256
00:18:46.713 --> 00:18:48.582
Get out of here!

257
00:18:56.939 --> 00:18:59.618
Why are you shaking, Boss?

258
00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:01.968
Where is So So?

259
00:19:05.782 --> 00:19:08.829
Repeat after me. Mont Saint-Michel.

260
00:19:08.829 --> 00:19:11.411
Are you messing with me?

261
00:19:16.923 --> 00:19:21.615
This is Église Notre-Dame d'Auvers.
Van Gogh painted this church.

262
00:19:21.615 --> 00:19:24.788
If you go inside, you'll see a notebook.

263
00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.378
They say if you write your wish,
it'll come true.

264
00:19:27.378 --> 00:19:30.395
Please write down a wish
on our way back down.

265
00:19:37.701 --> 00:19:41.267
No one loved or acknowledged Van Gogh.

266
00:19:41.267 --> 00:19:43.550
No woman loved him either.

267
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.146
No one even bought any of his paintings.

268
00:19:47.146 --> 00:19:50.857
Van Gogh was very lonely until he died.

269
00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:53.137
That was his life.

270
00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:55.826
<i>How nice would it be to die?</i>

271
00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:02.022
<i>I wouldn't be lonely, or scared.</i>

272
00:20:02.471 --> 00:20:05.930
He's a world famous painter,
but his grave is shabby.

273
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.153
You can see Van Gogh's
painting over there

274
00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:13.383
so take a walk and gather
at the bus in one hour.

275
00:20:13.383 --> 00:20:17.019
We don't need an hour.
They're not our ancestors.

276
00:20:19.959 --> 00:20:23.335
Yes, Chief. I'm almost done.
I just need to finish it off.

277
00:20:23.335 --> 00:20:26.356
Yes, I just need five minutes.

278
00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:30.915
The time will fly by.
Let's meet in one hour.

279
00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:36.779
Yes, Chief.

280
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.050
No.

281
00:20:45.442 --> 00:20:47.539
How nice.

282
00:20:49.805 --> 00:20:52.121
Bury me like this when I die.

283
00:20:53.678 --> 00:20:58.500
What are you saying?
Why are you saying that at your age?

284
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.987
- Let's go down.
- In a little bit.

285
00:21:01.987 --> 00:21:06.050
Let's go down. This is
a same-old graveyard.

286
00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.623
- Go ahead.
- Let's go.

287
00:21:08.623 --> 00:21:12.307
- Why are you being like that?
- You're so stubborn.

288
00:21:12.988 --> 00:21:14.200
Hurry up.

289
00:21:36.489 --> 00:21:40.419
- Don't film other people.
- Give it back.

290
00:21:40.419 --> 00:21:43.884
- What are you filming?
- I said, give it back!

291
00:21:43.884 --> 00:21:46.015
You filmed me in the bath, didn't you?

292
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.105
Give it back, please.

293
00:21:55.943 --> 00:22:01.229
If you do that again, I'll kill you.
Let's respect each other's privacy.

294
00:22:02.473 --> 00:22:05.951
Where are you going?
I'm going to stay here for a bit.

295
00:22:21.817 --> 00:22:24.241
Don't you want to see more?
You like Van Gogh.

296
00:22:24.241 --> 00:22:27.065
I like his paintings, not his grave.

297
00:22:27.065 --> 00:22:31.804
Geez, you went on
about his life and death.

298
00:22:31.804 --> 00:22:34.380
His life and death were both impactful.

299
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.932
It's really cold out.

300
00:22:36.932 --> 00:22:40.133
- Cross your arms.
- Okay.

301
00:22:45.009 --> 00:22:49.545
I told you... I didn't tell him
you went there.

302
00:22:49.545 --> 00:22:53.761
- Of course not.
- But he's very mannerly.

303
00:22:53.761 --> 00:22:56.461
I think he was raised well.

304
00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:58.318
I'm an ex-convict.

305
00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:02.481
- Live nicely.
- I almost killed someone.

306
00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:04.833
Live as a nice human being.

307
00:23:05.615 --> 00:23:06.644
Help me.

308
00:23:06.644 --> 00:23:11.856
I'm helping you by not reporting you
to the police. Get out of here.

309
00:23:12.932 --> 00:23:14.824
Please help me, Boss.

310
00:23:15.778 --> 00:23:17.663
I really need to find her.

311
00:23:22.525 --> 00:23:26.326
Geez, why are you doing this to me?

312
00:23:26.326 --> 00:23:29.134
I came here because I hated her
so much I wanted to kill her...

313
00:23:29.836 --> 00:23:32.195
but if I don't find her, I might die.

314
00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:38.126
I need to know
if she's smiling or crying.

315
00:23:38.653 --> 00:23:41.136
I should see that before I go.

316
00:23:44.305 --> 00:23:47.212
<i>He seems very sensible.</i>

317
00:23:47.212 --> 00:23:49.884
- I got it. I'm hanging up.
<i>- So So.</i>

318
00:23:49.884 --> 00:23:53.420
With family... even if you run away...

319
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.423
you're not running away.

320
00:23:57.423 --> 00:24:02.875
And that's why family...
is stronger than anything.

321
00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:04.963
I don't have a family.

322
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:15.382
It's not fair that
my vacation was canceled.

323
00:24:15.382 --> 00:24:19.241
I'm already here, so you shouldn't
call it absence without notice.

324
00:24:19.241 --> 00:24:21.133
Do you hate working here?

325
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.529
- No.
- Then what should you do?

326
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:28.258
- A good job.
- What does that mean?

327
00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:31.608
It means I should listen well
and do as I'm told

328
00:24:31.608 --> 00:24:35.977
- with reference.
- Then why aren't you doing that?

329
00:24:35.977 --> 00:24:41.788
I won't call you again. Come to work
tomorrow, while I ask nicely.

330
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:54.190
What? What did I do wrong?
Fine, do what you want!

331
00:25:03.163 --> 00:25:08.300
What? What did I do wrong?
Fine, do what you want!

332
00:25:15.233 --> 00:25:16.605
Hello.

333
00:25:24.451 --> 00:25:28.659
This is that place.
Barley Field with Crows.

334
00:25:29.894 --> 00:25:32.050
Wheatfield with Crows.

335
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:36.173
Yes. Barley Field with Crows.

336
00:25:37.726 --> 00:25:41.728
I'm sorry about earlier.
I didn't know you missed the bus.

337
00:25:41.728 --> 00:25:43.545
I apologize.

338
00:25:43.545 --> 00:25:46.038
No, that's okay.

339
00:25:47.169 --> 00:25:51.194
Take a look around and come back.
We'll wait even if you're late.

340
00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:57.945
Wait, when that man fell...

341
00:25:57.945 --> 00:26:00.788
Please don't talk about him.

342
00:26:05.784 --> 00:26:09.909
I'm sorry. I don't want
to listen or know.

343
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:12.538
Sure, let's go.

344
00:26:23.788 --> 00:26:26.557
Did he fall down?

345
00:26:26.557 --> 00:26:27.963
Yes.

346
00:26:28.737 --> 00:26:31.228
Did he get hurt?

347
00:26:31.228 --> 00:26:33.778
His leg seemed hurt.

348
00:26:33.778 --> 00:26:37.038
- A lot?
- Just a little bit.

349
00:26:37.038 --> 00:26:39.996
- Was he bleeding?
- No.

350
00:26:43.172 --> 00:26:45.612
I've screamed here many times.

351
00:26:45.612 --> 00:26:49.647
Yes, this is nice for screaming.
There's no one around.

352
00:26:49.647 --> 00:26:53.096
At times, I wish people were around.

353
00:26:53.096 --> 00:26:55.818
I want them to ask me
if something is okay.

354
00:26:55.818 --> 00:26:58.601
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

355
00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:02.950
They say people who come alone
are sad because they're alone.

356
00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:06.089
Haven't you felt that way?

357
00:27:06.603 --> 00:27:08.567
I've never felt that way.

358
00:27:15.471 --> 00:27:19.070
- I think you have.
- You sound like you've seen me.

359
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.810
Guides know a lot of things
without seeing.

360
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.988
You missed everything because you were
on the phone. I'll show you around.

361
00:27:25.988 --> 00:27:27.291
Sure.

362
00:27:41.163 --> 00:27:43.458
I should have buried you
in a place like this.

363
00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:45.106
In a pretty place.

364
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:10.868
Why did you commit suicide?

365
00:28:18.337 --> 00:28:20.961
You painted so beautifully.

366
00:28:30.985 --> 00:28:34.217
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E03 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

367
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:47.480
Mister, can't you hurry up?

368
00:28:49.147 --> 00:28:50.775
Mister?

369
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.838
Let's come back.

370
00:29:00.403 --> 00:29:03.807
Gosh, is he writing a novel?

371
00:29:07.317 --> 00:29:11.083
- What are you going to write?
- I'm going to ask for a raise.

372
00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:13.772
Hey, you should write that
on the company's bulletin board.

373
00:29:13.772 --> 00:29:18.211
I'll get in trouble if I do that.
What are you going to write?

374
00:29:18.211 --> 00:29:24.049
Me? I'm going to ask for an investment.
Then I could spread my wings and fly.

375
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:27.510
If you keep wishing that,
you might just become a bird.

376
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:32.586
I'll know in two to three days. I went
to the same college with the investor

377
00:29:32.586 --> 00:29:34.884
and he was my high school senior, too.

378
00:29:35.652 --> 00:29:39.462
Is he trustworthy?

379
00:29:39.462 --> 00:29:43.885
Yeah, of course. We're like brothers.

380
00:29:43.885 --> 00:29:47.828
He said he'll take responsibility
for everything. Don't worry.

381
00:29:50.238 --> 00:29:53.279
Would you like to lead the
entire project after your renewal?

382
00:29:53.852 --> 00:29:55.289
Me?

383
00:29:56.287 --> 00:29:58.573
No way...

384
00:29:58.573 --> 00:30:00.125
Really?

385
00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:04.086
Do you remember what I said
about your designs when I got here?

386
00:30:04.086 --> 00:30:06.963
Yes, you said they were mannerless.

387
00:30:06.963 --> 00:30:12.509
If you stay in this field, you develop
habits. But I liked that you didn't.

388
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:16.356
But what if I do the whole thing
by myself and ruin it?

389
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:17.888
I'll take responsibility for it.

390
00:30:17.888 --> 00:30:20.096
Don't worry.

391
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:27.029
Then, should I come up
with a draft of the concept first?

392
00:30:31.144 --> 00:30:34.101
I saw your vacation request.
Are you going somewhere?

393
00:30:34.101 --> 00:30:37.810
- Yes, France.
- You're going on vacation.

394
00:30:38.564 --> 00:30:40.133
Who are you going with?

395
00:30:41.585 --> 00:30:45.541
Yeah, I hope it all works out.

396
00:30:50.174 --> 00:30:55.047
Gosh, seriously. He's too much.
He's writing a long novel.

397
00:31:00.528 --> 00:31:04.174
Vincent's younger brother
was Theodore van Gogh.

398
00:31:04.174 --> 00:31:06.710
They wrote each other often.

399
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.529
The older brother wrote that
he was tired and needed strength.

400
00:31:10.529 --> 00:31:14.608
And the younger brother cheered him up
and told him he was doing a good job.

401
00:31:14.608 --> 00:31:19.320
Van Gogh was only able to sell
one painting while he was alive.

402
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.288
He was a poor painter, but his brother
believed in him until the end.

403
00:31:24.288 --> 00:31:27.847
Did he really believe in him,
or did he just give him courage?

404
00:31:27.847 --> 00:31:31.702
I'm not sure, but I think
he really believed in him.

405
00:31:31.702 --> 00:31:34.160
He might have really
believed in his skills

406
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.298
or maybe he kept believing
because he started already.

407
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.757
Can you... believe in me until the end?

408
00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:47.625
Fine, I'll believe in you until the end.

409
00:31:49.188 --> 00:31:52.239
No one will believe in you until the end.

410
00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:53.884
I think it's possible.

411
00:31:54.884 --> 00:31:59.155
- Really?
- I have someone.

412
00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:00.576
I'm jealous.

413
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:07.372
It's a burden to live with
someone else's trust on my shoulders.

414
00:32:10.267 --> 00:32:12.851
Shall we write our wishes
in the notebook in the church?

415
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.537
Will our wishes really come true?

416
00:32:15.537 --> 00:32:18.326
That church is rumored
to be very powerful.

417
00:32:27.651 --> 00:32:29.913
<i>Where do they go?</i>

418
00:32:31.708 --> 00:32:34.913
At times, people think this way.

419
00:32:34.913 --> 00:32:37.855
That they went somewhere nice.

420
00:32:38.457 --> 00:32:43.420
But... where is that place?

421
00:32:46.925 --> 00:32:51.704
<i>Where... does everyone go?</i>

422
00:32:56.011 --> 00:32:59.684
<i>We don't even know where we'll go in life</i>

423
00:32:59.684 --> 00:33:03.230
<i>so how would we know
where we go after we die?</i>

424
00:33:05.848 --> 00:33:10.001
<i>We all live without knowing anything</i>

425
00:33:10.001 --> 00:33:13.976
<i>and die without knowing anything.</i>

426
00:33:25.232 --> 00:33:31.615
Mont Saint-Michel was the first UNESCO
World Heritage Site of France.

427
00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:35.457
It looks like a castle,
but it's a monastery.

428
00:33:35.457 --> 00:33:39.961
Pilgrims of the middle ages
called it a place of the angels.

429
00:33:39.961 --> 00:33:42.377
And Victor Hugo, who wrote Les Misérables

430
00:33:42.377 --> 00:33:48.887
expressed it as a pyramid of the ocean,
like the ones in Egypt.

431
00:33:55.809 --> 00:33:58.663
Yes, San Ma Ru.

432
00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:04.384
The monastery looks close, but it's
one hour away, so please stay here.

433
00:34:04.384 --> 00:34:09.887
After dinner, get some rest
and gather here at 8 a.m.

434
00:34:09.887 --> 00:34:12.505
- Are we eating French for dinner?
- No.

435
00:34:12.505 --> 00:34:16.806
Since we came a long way,
we're eating Italian food today.

436
00:34:16.806 --> 00:34:18.876
Same thing.

437
00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:22.494
- Is there a Korean restaurant?
- No.

438
00:34:22.494 --> 00:34:25.998
- Anywhere nearby?
- Stop it. She said there isn't.

439
00:34:25.998 --> 00:34:29.829
People need to eat rice.
We keep eating tasteless food.

440
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:33.105
Let's go. What time is dinner?

441
00:34:33.105 --> 00:34:37.306
- Let's meet at 8 p.m.
- Yes, let's go.

442
00:34:37.306 --> 00:34:39.398
I'll see you at 8 p.m.

443
00:34:47.655 --> 00:34:49.411
Bis Sis! Hot water here!

444
00:34:49.411 --> 00:34:51.387
One moment.
(In French)

445
00:34:51.387 --> 00:34:53.681
What's wrong with her?
A customer called her.

446
00:34:53.681 --> 00:34:55.853
You can't do that.

447
00:34:55.853 --> 00:34:58.744
Then should I call her a waiter?

448
00:34:58.744 --> 00:35:02.204
- Waitress.
- You're not supposed to call her.

449
00:35:02.204 --> 00:35:07.380
If you pick and put your menu down,
they'll come here themselves.

450
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.960
And when you enter,
you must sit where they direct you.

451
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.813
I can sit anywhere I want!
The customer is the king.

452
00:35:13.813 --> 00:35:17.570
Among the perceptions
that you mustn't have in France

453
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.974
"The customer is the king"
is one of them.

454
00:35:19.974 --> 00:35:23.389
It's not a joke.
France killed their king.

455
00:35:23.389 --> 00:35:26.485
- Who killed the king?
- The citizens.

456
00:35:26.485 --> 00:35:30.313
They were all traitors!

457
00:35:30.985 --> 00:35:34.391
- Ask for hot water.
- You can't eat that at a restaurant.

458
00:35:34.391 --> 00:35:37.409
- Who said that?
- Isn't it basic manners?

459
00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:39.945
Since when was ramen a mannerless food?

460
00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:45.501
I've seen many Koreans eating ramen at
hotel breakfasts and famous restaurants

461
00:35:45.501 --> 00:35:48.047
but they don't like it.

462
00:35:48.047 --> 00:35:51.184
Their customers may dislike
the smell of ramen

463
00:35:51.184 --> 00:35:53.666
and it's not respectful
to the restaurant either.

464
00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:57.907
You're right. It's similar to
if a customer came to my restaurant

465
00:35:57.907 --> 00:36:00.992
and ordered black bean noodles.

466
00:36:02.643 --> 00:36:06.235
Then you should have told me earlier.

467
00:36:06.762 --> 00:36:09.873
Fine, this will be the last time.

468
00:36:09.873 --> 00:36:13.686
- Please stop.
- I need soup to eat food!

469
00:36:13.686 --> 00:36:17.266
- Ask for hot water!
- He's too much.

470
00:36:18.784 --> 00:36:22.603
- Why do you keep doing this?
- Ask for hot water.

471
00:36:23.172 --> 00:36:25.840
- This is the last time.
- Father...

472
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.777
- Ask them for hot water!
- Just today.

473
00:36:28.777 --> 00:36:30.443
Honey. Honey.

474
00:36:30.443 --> 00:36:33.530
All my life, I worried about
what my husband thought

475
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.945
and worried about what other people
thought because of my husband.

476
00:36:37.538 --> 00:36:41.023
"All the other couples
are living happily. Why me?"

477
00:36:41.023 --> 00:36:45.159
"It's not going to get better,
so I'll just die."

478
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:46.777
Is that how you feel?

479
00:36:47.755 --> 00:36:50.018
You could be a fortune teller.

480
00:37:01.583 --> 00:37:03.128
Aren't you going to sleep?

481
00:37:04.362 --> 00:37:05.929
I will.

482
00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.661
Go to bed early.

483
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:11.233
I will.

484
00:37:18.842 --> 00:37:21.275
Should we sell our restaurant?

485
00:37:22.463 --> 00:37:27.070
We'll only get 50 to 60 million from our
security deposit. Can we retire on that?

486
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.436
We can just sell everything and have fun.

487
00:37:29.436 --> 00:37:32.525
It's nice traveling around.

488
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:35.672
Go to bed.

489
00:37:37.864 --> 00:37:39.402
Isn't it nice?

490
00:37:41.295 --> 00:37:45.409
- Go to bed.
- Why? You don't like it?

491
00:37:48.244 --> 00:37:50.119
I told you to go to bed.

492
00:38:24.746 --> 00:38:27.293
- Yeah.
<i>- It's me.</i>

493
00:38:27.293 --> 00:38:28.742
I know.

494
00:38:29.842 --> 00:38:34.146
- Did you arrive at Mont Saint-Michel?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

495
00:38:34.146 --> 00:38:36.172
You're really mad, aren't you?

496
00:38:37.284 --> 00:38:39.268
What do you want to say?

497
00:38:39.268 --> 00:38:41.547
Come back to work.

498
00:38:41.547 --> 00:38:44.599
Come back, hand in the file,
and beg for forgiveness.

499
00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:48.498
I did nothing wrong.
Can't you just take my side?

500
00:38:48.498 --> 00:38:51.141
Taking your side won't solve anything.

501
00:38:51.141 --> 00:38:54.195
<i>You're being negligent by
being absent without notice.</i>

502
00:38:54.195 --> 00:38:58.181
Hand in the file, come back
to work, and apologize.

503
00:38:58.181 --> 00:39:00.735
You know how scary companies are.

504
00:39:00.735 --> 00:39:03.918
Is that why you didn't come?
Were you scared?

505
00:39:03.918 --> 00:39:07.643
- Don't speak that way.
- You said you'd trust me until the end.

506
00:39:07.643 --> 00:39:11.092
Was I wrong for not going on
vacation with you?

507
00:39:11.092 --> 00:39:13.469
- Yeah.
- Did I betray you?

508
00:39:13.469 --> 00:39:15.204
You did.

509
00:39:19.132 --> 00:39:23.501
Are you stupid?
Would anyone take your side here?

510
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:27.233
I'm the only one who can protect you.
Why don't you realize that?

511
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.840
Just stop it and come back.

512
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.110
Go back where? To you?

513
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.414
- Or to the company?
- Both.

514
00:39:40.784 --> 00:39:44.561
You're a courageous person. I know that.

515
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:49.164
You need courage to change the world,
but you need courage to maintain it.

516
00:39:49.164 --> 00:39:52.054
Let's be more wise, okay?

517
00:39:55.456 --> 00:39:59.315
<i>Let's resolve this issue
and go on an year-end vacation.</i>

518
00:39:59.315 --> 00:40:01.280
For Christmas.

519
00:40:02.539 --> 00:40:04.969
I'll be waiting. Hurry back.

520
00:40:07.724 --> 00:40:10.465
<i>Can you answer me, Ma Ru?</i>

521
00:40:11.893 --> 00:40:16.041
I got it. I'll check if there's
a flight for tomorrow.

522
00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:18.652
<i>Thank you. I'm hanging up now.</i>

523
00:40:18.652 --> 00:40:20.157
<i>I love you.</i>

524
00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:27.208
<i>I printed it because I was suspicious.</i>

525
00:40:27.208 --> 00:40:30.262
The company is doing weird things.

526
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:42.000
You know the medicine
we donated to Africa?

527
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.547
I checked it again because
the inventory numbers were off.

528
00:40:47.373 --> 00:40:50.085
It's not normal medicine,
but new medicine still in development.

529
00:40:50.085 --> 00:40:53.215
How could they donate medicine
that is still in development?

530
00:40:53.215 --> 00:40:56.233
How did you find these?

531
00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:59.239
I entered the server
with the head chief's ID.

532
00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:03.409
- Why did you use his ID?
- He asked the chief to do something

533
00:41:03.409 --> 00:41:05.827
but he handed it over to me.

534
00:41:05.827 --> 00:41:08.847
- He gave me his ID and password.
- I'm going crazy.

535
00:41:11.512 --> 00:41:15.097
- Pretend you don't know.
- How could I do that?

536
00:41:15.097 --> 00:41:19.715
This... is pharmaceutical testing.

537
00:41:19.715 --> 00:41:24.306
You can't butt into this.
You might be the only one to get hurt.

538
00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:28.393
I was the one who led the
medicine donation project.

539
00:41:28.393 --> 00:41:31.684
- You didn't know.
- If I knew, I'd be a bad person.

540
00:41:32.251 --> 00:41:36.364
And if I didn't know,
that'd make me a pitiful and bad person.

541
00:41:37.237 --> 00:41:41.822
I need to tell the head chief
and hear the company's side.

542
00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:48.364
Where's the original file?

543
00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:55.023
I thought you quit smoking.

544
00:41:55.023 --> 00:41:56.936
I started again because of you.

545
00:41:56.936 --> 00:41:59.552
Oh my, what did I do?

546
00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.612
Did you call him?

547
00:42:02.764 --> 00:42:05.606
Yes, he's coming back tomorrow.

548
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:08.239
- Where did he put the file?
- I'm sure he deleted it.

549
00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:09.391
It wasn't on his computer.

550
00:42:09.391 --> 00:42:13.407
Deputy Oh, you're the ace
of this company.

551
00:42:13.925 --> 00:42:16.485
Pay attention to what side
you should be on.

552
00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:19.400
Companies last longer than human beings.

553
00:42:20.635 --> 00:42:24.360
We need to find the file
and shut Ma Ru's mouth.

554
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.597
If we find the file and stay quiet...

555
00:42:28.824 --> 00:42:30.967
will Ma Ru be okay?

556
00:42:34.284 --> 00:42:36.945
He already committed
too many sins.

557
00:42:36.945 --> 00:42:39.143
He can't be saved.

558
00:42:51.472 --> 00:42:54.248
These are diaries.

559
00:42:54.248 --> 00:42:56.543
I'll give them to you as a gift.

560
00:43:27.362 --> 00:43:30.521
- Who is it?
<i>- It's your guide.</i>

561
00:43:36.907 --> 00:43:40.021
- You weren't sleeping, were you?
- I wasn't.

562
00:43:40.021 --> 00:43:41.963
Come in. I'll make you some coffee.

563
00:43:41.963 --> 00:43:45.826
That's okay. Guides don't
enter the travelers' rooms.

564
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:50.210
If you're not tired, would you
like to go to Mont Saint-Michel?

565
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.132
- Right now?
- Yes.

566
00:43:52.132 --> 00:43:54.454
- Just the two of us?
- Yes.

567
00:43:54.954 --> 00:43:56.143
Why?

568
00:43:57.429 --> 00:44:01.043
It's really nice at night
because there are no people.

569
00:44:06.998 --> 00:44:10.567
If you're not tired, would you
like to go to Mont Saint-Michel?

570
00:44:10.567 --> 00:44:12.577
- Right now?
- Yes.

571
00:44:12.577 --> 00:44:14.974
- Just the two of us?
- Yes.

572
00:44:15.559 --> 00:44:16.713
Why?

573
00:44:18.025 --> 00:44:21.650
It's really nice at night
because there are no people.

574
00:44:25.289 --> 00:44:28.802
I charge an additional
30 euros for night tours.

575
00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:35.735
- I'm not going.
- Okay, then get some rest.

576
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.253
<i>Thank you and sorry for today.</i>

577
00:45:00.253 --> 00:45:05.608
<i>I'll make it up to you with
a free night tour of Mont Saint-Michel.</i>

578
00:45:05.608 --> 00:45:09.806
<i>You'll be able to see
beautiful courage given by belief.</i>

579
00:45:18.614 --> 00:45:22.965
"You'll be able to see
beautiful courage given by belief."

580
00:47:04.385 --> 00:47:07.311
- I'm going to study abroad.
- Are you crazy?

581
00:47:07.311 --> 00:47:10.563
You're not studying abroad!
You're running off with a guy!

582
00:47:10.563 --> 00:47:14.335
I can get my PhD.
I'll come back to be a professor.

583
00:47:14.335 --> 00:47:17.085
Why would anyone in your field
get their PhD in France?

584
00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:20.545
Was this that punk's idea? Did he
convince you? Tell him to come here!

585
00:47:20.545 --> 00:47:24.835
Why do you keep calling him a punk?
If he called you a wench

586
00:47:24.835 --> 00:47:28.157
- would you be happy?
- You've gone insane.

587
00:47:28.157 --> 00:47:30.900
You need a beating.
Where's the cane? Where is it?

588
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.512
So So, you're 31 years old.

589
00:47:33.512 --> 00:47:36.773
- I know. I'm grown up now.
- You're still young.

590
00:47:36.773 --> 00:47:40.795
Grandma says you're young too.
Then who's an adult in this world?

591
00:47:40.795 --> 00:47:44.563
Honey, bring over
a bigger stick than a cane!

592
00:47:44.563 --> 00:47:47.409
- Wait!
- Do what you want!

593
00:47:47.409 --> 00:47:49.503
- I'm going no matter what.
- Yoon So So!

594
00:47:49.503 --> 00:47:52.074
I'm not deaf!

595
00:47:52.717 --> 00:47:55.184
If you're anxious,
I can get married first.

596
00:47:55.184 --> 00:47:59.443
You're seriously! Geez... Geez...

597
00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:00.849
What?

598
00:48:02.262 --> 00:48:04.583
Stop acting. You're being immature.

599
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:10.867
Is a man more important than your family?

600
00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:13.701
He's my family too.

601
00:49:21.155 --> 00:49:24.471
If I think, "I'd better die..."

602
00:49:24.471 --> 00:49:27.027
I can only think of my faults.

603
00:49:27.585 --> 00:49:29.590
"Why did I do that?"

604
00:49:30.666 --> 00:49:32.771
"I shouldn't have."

605
00:49:33.864 --> 00:49:36.931
I regret the fact that I have regrets.

606
00:50:11.797 --> 00:50:14.237
Don't put everything
on the line for a man.

607
00:50:14.237 --> 00:50:16.375
That's the worst thing
you can do as a woman.

608
00:50:39.467 --> 00:50:40.996
Dad.

609
00:50:44.737 --> 00:50:50.485
Daughter, don't run away because
we won't send you abroad to study.

610
00:51:14.018 --> 00:51:17.429
Gosh, I won't cry anymore.
Crying won't change anything.

611
00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:21.237
You're right. Life is too short,
even if we laugh for all of it.

612
00:51:21.237 --> 00:51:22.663
Of course.

613
00:51:22.663 --> 00:51:26.896
How we live is important,
but how we die is important too.

614
00:51:26.896 --> 00:51:30.527
The hospital told you you have
seven to eight months to live, right?

615
00:51:32.257 --> 00:51:35.826
At the longest. But it can be short as...

616
00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:37.472
five to six months.

617
00:51:40.179 --> 00:51:43.342
The cancer spread all over,
so they can't operate.

618
00:51:43.342 --> 00:51:46.027
Did you tell your husband?

619
00:51:53.518 --> 00:51:55.827
<i>He doesn't know anything.</i>

620
00:51:55.827 --> 00:51:58.922
Gosh, I don't want to tell him either.

621
00:51:58.922 --> 00:52:02.016
- You should.
- I don't want to be bothered.

622
00:52:02.016 --> 00:52:04.496
He'll tell me what to do.

623
00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:07.943
I couldn't live the way I wanted

624
00:52:07.943 --> 00:52:10.320
so I won't be able to die
the way I want either.

625
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.047
You still need to tell him.

626
00:52:12.697 --> 00:52:16.005
We don't go through death alone.

627
00:52:18.181 --> 00:52:23.467
That man... will get angry
that I'm going to die.

628
00:52:23.467 --> 00:52:26.297
He'll ask me why
I went off and got cancer.

629
00:52:26.297 --> 00:52:29.454
He gets angry
when he doesn't like something.

630
00:52:30.094 --> 00:52:34.936
Gosh, if I'm going to die,
I might as well die early.

631
00:53:12.409 --> 00:53:14.510
You can speak to me comfortably.

632
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:17.474
Yes, I did.

633
00:53:17.474 --> 00:53:20.710
I mean, you should be honest.

634
00:53:21.257 --> 00:53:24.280
I was being honest, though.

635
00:54:24.793 --> 00:54:28.563
Mister, can't you hurry up?

636
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:32.217
Mister?

637
00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.804
I...

638
00:54:49.971 --> 00:54:51.969
want to live.

639
00:54:54.885 --> 00:54:57.003
I really want to live.

640
00:54:59.507 --> 00:55:02.764
Beautifully, for a long time.

641
00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:07.208
Without being sick.

642
00:55:14.418 --> 00:55:20.972
<i>[Honey, don't be sick, and live long...]</i>

643
00:55:22.204 --> 00:55:24.929
I said I wanted to live longer.

644
00:55:25.525 --> 00:55:27.949
I asked them to save me.

645
00:55:33.856 --> 00:55:36.855
But the doctor said he can't.

646
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.280
I was so scared...

647
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.574
I couldn't tell anyone. I was too scared.

648
00:56:05.105 --> 00:56:07.434
Why are you eating candy
instead of sleeping?

649
00:56:07.434 --> 00:56:09.150
Your teeth will rot!

650
00:56:10.275 --> 00:56:12.643
You always make noise at night.

651
00:56:13.472 --> 00:56:15.833
This woman.

652
00:57:53.041 --> 00:57:57.543
That's business. That wasn't
our first rude customer.

653
00:57:58.822 --> 00:58:01.635
Why are you crying
because of those drunk people?

654
00:58:04.306 --> 00:58:06.416
I told you not to cry!

655
00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:10.318
Geez.

656
00:58:11.813 --> 00:58:15.858
- It's a snake!
- Where? Where? Where?

657
00:58:20.282 --> 00:58:24.864
Don't cry. If you cry at night,
a snake will come out.

658
00:58:27.253 --> 00:58:28.485
Hurry up.

659
00:58:45.585 --> 00:58:47.427
That's right.

660
00:58:48.806 --> 00:58:51.425
I liked that part about him.

661
00:58:52.034 --> 00:58:56.646
When I cried, he said this.

662
00:59:01.018 --> 00:59:03.137
<i>"Don't cry."</i>

663
00:59:06.331 --> 00:59:09.219
<i>"If you cry at night,
a snake will come out."</i>

664
00:59:14.478 --> 00:59:21.125
