3
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:28.045
- I almost missed today's lectures. 
- Seol Ah!

4
00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:30.647
Seol Ah!

5
00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:33.984
Seol Ah!

6
00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:44.628
I love you!

7
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:47.764
Let's love each other forever.

8
00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:49.900
Awesome.

9
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.035
I love you, Seol Ah.

10
00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:57.908
I love you, Seol Ah.

11
00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.345
You must be so happy. He loves you so much.

12
00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:04.881
Of course, I'm happy.

13
00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:08.351
It's so embarrassing.

14
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:10.120
Say something!

15
00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:11.621
He's waiting for your answer.

16
00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:13.156
Hold on.

17
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.660
I love you too.

18
00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:21.231
I love you more with my whole heart.

19

(Kiss Day, June 14th, 2014)

(Seol Ah)

21
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.366
The person you have 
dialed cannot be reached...

22
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.310
That's strange. Did she change the code?

23
00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:33.503
Hello. I'm the boyfriend of the girl next door.

24
00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:36.072
Is it possible if you could keep this in the fridge?

25
00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:38.074
I was going to leave it at the door,

26
00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:40.377
but I was afraid that it might melt as it's a cake with whipped cream.

27
00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:41.912
Thank you.

28
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.321
It seemed like he was also preparing a surprise party.

29
00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.325
Seol Ah will be so surprised when she sees the cake.

30
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.760
(I love you, Seol Ah.)

31
00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.965
Did you really make this?

32
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:05.068
I'm so touched.

33
00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.674
It's so delicious.

34
00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:13.810
Why don't you...

35
00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.414
stay with me tonight?

36
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:19.749
Oh gosh.

37
00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:22.285
I'm not ready yet.

38
00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:30.026
Let's break up.

39
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.103
What a horrible joke.

40
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:42.639
You shouldn't joke like this.

41
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.649
The person you have dialed cannot be reached at this moment.

42
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.151
Please leave a message after the beep.

43
00:03:58.588 --> 00:03:59.589
Don't ever call me again.

44
00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.224
Why are you doing this?

45
00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:03.693
Do I have to explain it?

46
00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:06.396
How would I know if you don't tell me?

47
00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.131
Exactly.

48
00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:09.966
You don't know how women think.

49
00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:12.269
You don't know how women think.

50
00:04:13.203 --> 00:04:14.204
You...

51
00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:16.640
don't know how women think.

52
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.076
You don't know how women think.

53
00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:21.211
Is she breaking up with me...

54
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.581
just because I don't know...

55
00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:27.717
how women think?

56
00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.515
If I knew you well,

57
00:05:33.383 --> 00:05:35.852
you wouldn't have left me like this.

58
00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:39.222
I wouldn't have died like this.

59
00:05:54.404 --> 00:05:56.139
You could have told me then.

60
00:05:56.473 --> 00:05:58.408
What did I do wrong?

61
00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:00.443
What's wrong with not knowing how women think?

62
00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:01.911
Is that such a big crime?

63
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:03.713
How would I know what you think?

64
00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:06.082
I can't hear or see how you think.

65
00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:07.951
How would I know?

66
00:06:20.597 --> 00:06:25.902
(I will kill them all.)

67
00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.642
What was that?

68
00:06:59.602 --> 00:07:01.538
In Heukseok-dong, Dongjak-gu,

69
00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:03.039
a young woman in her 20s was found dead...

70
00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.208
in her studio apartment this morning.

71
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.143
The police started investigating the case.

72
00:07:07.143 --> 00:07:10.013
She was found naked in her bath tub.

73
00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:13.016
However, the police thinks that she was murdered.

74
00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.584
Reporter Yoon Mi Ra will explain in details.

75
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:18.388
In Heukseok-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul,

76
00:07:18.388 --> 00:07:21.291
a young woman in her 20s was found dead in her studio apartment.

77
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:24.027
The police was informed at 6am in the morning.

78
00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.028
The police arrived at the scene...

79
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.464
Parents nag me if I don't date anyone.

80
00:07:27.464 --> 00:07:29.833
They nag me if I don't get married.

81
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.701
They nag me if I don't get pregnant.

82
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.336
They nag me all the time.

83
00:07:35.138 --> 00:07:38.274
It was my mistake to put myself into this.

84
00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:46.216
Sir, are you awake?

85
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.020
Gosh. You were mugged in the middle of the night.

86
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.456
Your life is also a mess.

87
00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:06.202
Excuse me. Why are you cursing?

88
00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:09.005
Pardon? Was I?

89
00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:10.807
How did he know?

90
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.076
You kept complaining and cursing about your life.

91
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.211
And you were cursing me out too.

92
00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:17.614
No, sir. I didn't do such a thing.

93
00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:18.915
I don't know how to curse.

94
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:22.118
No. You were good at it.

95
00:08:22.452 --> 00:08:25.088
I said it wasn't me. Why are you saying that?

96
00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:27.590
Your doctor will be here soon. Please wait.

97
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.825
Wait a minute.

98
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:55.218
What was that?

99
00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:02.959
Excuse me. Where is room 512?

100
00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.627
This is the fourth floor.

101
00:09:05.094 --> 00:09:06.729
You have to go up one more floor.

102
00:09:06.729 --> 00:09:09.365
Gosh. Thank you so much.

103
00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:13.336
Boys are so weak these days. He's pale and so skinny.

104
00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:15.505
I wonder if he does his job properly at night.

105
00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:19.475
Ma'am, what did you just say?

106
00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:21.377
I thanked you.

107
00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:23.212
No. After that.

108
00:09:23.212 --> 00:09:25.415
You looked at me and said something.

109
00:09:25.415 --> 00:09:28.585
What? I didn't say anything.

110
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.490
He's so handsome.

111
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.093
- Right? - He's my style.

112
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.669
- He looks so handsome today. - I wonder why.

113
00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.307
- Hello. - Thank you for the coffee.

114
00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:55.845
That's...

115
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.982
What's going on?

116
00:09:59.983 --> 00:10:04.921
I see myself.

117
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:07.123
I can see the enemy.

118
00:10:07.123 --> 00:10:08.758
I can also see the whole world.

119
00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:12.195
People who are awake can see everything.

120
00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:14.564
This is how mind reading works.

121
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:16.499
Mind reading.

122
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.102
Mind reading.

123
00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.972
I think I can read minds.

124
00:10:36.352 --> 00:10:37.720
No way.

125
00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:42.125
You remember nothing?

126
00:10:42.992 --> 00:10:45.061
- Nothing at all? - No.

127
00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.462
Well,

128
00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:50.600
I remember grabbing his foot like this.

129
00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:52.568
- And... - And?

130
00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.805
Wasn't there something else after that?

131
00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:57.373
Sir.

132
00:10:58.474 --> 00:11:00.443
Whenever I touch someone,

133
00:11:00.443 --> 00:11:02.311
I can hear the person's thoughts.

134
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:05.048
I can also see how people think.

135
00:11:05.048 --> 00:11:06.249
I think that...

136
00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.084
after the incident, I learned mind reading.

137
00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.953
You know what mind reading is, right?

138
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:16.325
Okay. Get some rest.

139
00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:20.329
Please contact me when you remember anything.

140
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:21.998
Take care.

141
00:11:21.998 --> 00:11:24.233
- Sir. - Yes?

142
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.103
Please look into my eyes.

143
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:30.573
This is strange.

144
00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:33.309
Why can't I hear his thoughts?

145
00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:41.451
Eun Ho.

146
00:11:43.086 --> 00:11:44.854
I've heard. Are you okay now?

147
00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:47.190
Yes. I feel fine.

148
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.959
That's good. I will see you later.

149
00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:54.931
I knew it. Mind reading doesn't work.

150
00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:57.967
I think I was crazy for a while.

151
00:12:01.337 --> 00:12:02.705
Hey.

152
00:12:03.573 --> 00:12:05.341
Let's break up.

153
00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:08.244
Why?

154
00:12:08.578 --> 00:12:10.179
What's the reason?

155
00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:12.482
You don't know what women think.

156
00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.584
You could just tell me then.

157
00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:17.954
I am good at...

158
00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:20.556
learning things.

159
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.205
Please wait for me.

160
00:12:37.807 --> 00:12:39.375
Thank you.

161
00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:41.177
He's not my style.

162
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.612
- Sorry? - Sorry?

163
00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:45.848
What did you just... Never mind.

164
00:12:57.927 --> 00:13:00.096
- Who is this jerk? - He looks so dumb.

165
00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:02.465
- I want to take my bra off. - It's so hot today.

166
00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:05.368
- The lift is going up. - Don't push me.

167
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:07.336
(- I want to go to the toilet. - I want to go travel.)

168
00:13:07.403 --> 00:13:09.172
I didn't shave my legs. Oh no.

169
00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:13.075
(I want to skip the lectures.)

170
00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:15.611
I want to have chicken feet today.

171
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:17.814
I want to take my bra off.

172
00:13:17.814 --> 00:13:20.082
(I want to buy a purse.)

173
00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:45.074
Gosh. They are so noisy. What was that all about?

174
00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:47.143
Why is this happening again?

175
00:13:50.213 --> 00:13:52.114
Your doctor will be here soon. Please wait.

176
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:53.249
Wait a minute.

177
00:13:55.218 --> 00:13:56.452
Thank you.

178
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.431
Women.

179
00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:12.368
It only works on women.

180
00:14:16.706 --> 00:14:17.940
Excuse me, ma'am.

181
00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:25.248
What's wrong with him? How did he pee like that?

182
00:14:25.248 --> 00:14:26.849
He peed so strongly.

183
00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:29.218
Can't you pee properly?

184
00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:30.553
If I could,

185
00:14:30.553 --> 00:14:33.756
I would have kicked you in the groin.

186
00:14:47.336 --> 00:14:49.372
You don't know how women think.

187
00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.209
Seol Ah.

188
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.753
Seol Ah. I know you're in there. Please open up.

189
00:15:03.753 --> 00:15:05.621
Seol Ah. Seol Ah.

190
00:15:08.057 --> 00:15:09.759
What on earth are you doing?

191
00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:12.094
You must be sad that I didn't know...

192
00:15:12.094 --> 00:15:13.195
how you think, right?

193
00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.097
- What? - Don't worry.

194
00:15:15.097 --> 00:15:16.565
I handled everything.

195
00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:19.235
You don't need to say anything from now on.

196
00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:22.805
Because I can hear what you think.

197
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:37.086
No. It can't be.

198
00:15:39.055 --> 00:15:41.457
- I must be wrong, right? - What are you talking about?

199
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:43.059
Who is it?

200
00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:56.973
You guys can talk. I will come back later.

201
00:16:27.703 --> 00:16:29.472
Did you break up with me...

202
00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:31.741
because of him?

203
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.476
No.

204
00:16:35.011 --> 00:16:37.013
I broke up with you because of you.

205
00:16:37.013 --> 00:16:38.714
Then who is that guy?

206
00:16:38.714 --> 00:16:39.982
He's someone I know.

207
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.618
I told him that it's scary to be alone, and he came.

208
00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:46.455
He's like my brother from when I was little.

209
00:16:46.489 --> 00:16:47.723
He's like your brother?

210
00:16:47.857 --> 00:16:49.225
Didn't you see it?

211
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:51.694
Didn't you see the barricade tape at the next door?

212
00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:54.964
A few days ago, the girl next door...

213
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:58.501
Do you sleep with someone...

214
00:16:59.068 --> 00:17:00.536
who is like your brother?

215
00:17:01.003 --> 00:17:02.104
What?

216
00:17:03.372 --> 00:17:05.274
Don't you dare lie to me.

217
00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:09.245
I can find out what you're thinking if I want to.

218
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.481
- What is he saying? - Tell me the truth.

219
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:15.484
Who is he?

220
00:17:15.484 --> 00:17:17.420
What were you guys doing?

221
00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:44.713
Please.

222
00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:47.616
Please tell me nothing's going on between you two.

223
00:17:49.952 --> 00:17:51.487
If you say that,

224
00:17:53.222 --> 00:17:54.623
I will trust you.

225
00:18:01.464 --> 00:18:02.565
Sorry.

226
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.055
(Eun Ho)

227
00:18:33.762 --> 00:18:36.732
That's strange. Did she change the code?

228
00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:50.746
It's nothing.

229
00:19:08.197 --> 00:19:10.366
Hold on. One second.

230
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.444
I'm good now.

231
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:37.726
(Let's break up.)

232
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:46.702
You're bleeding.

233
00:19:47.636 --> 00:19:49.705
You're bleeding. Are you okay?

234
00:19:53.142 --> 00:19:55.144
- You little... - What?

235
00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:00.783
You're sorry?

236
00:20:01.717 --> 00:20:04.653
You broke up with me by text while sleeping with someone,

237
00:20:04.653 --> 00:20:06.155
and you're sorry?

238
00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:10.993
How did you know that?

239
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.563
You don't know the least of what's called common courtesy.

240
00:20:14.763 --> 00:20:16.365
You are such a bad person.

241
00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.201
And you are such a low-life.

242
00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:23.706
Okay then.

243
00:20:24.173 --> 00:20:27.243
Then I guess I don't need to explain any further.

244
00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:29.411
Please leave.

245
00:20:30.246 --> 00:20:32.514
How can you do this to me?

246
00:20:32.514 --> 00:20:33.949
Did you ever like me?

247
00:20:34.116 --> 00:20:35.918
What about you? Did you ever like me?

248
00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:39.021
Of course. I liked you so much.

249
00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:41.357
You liked yourself, not me.

250
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:42.658
What?

251
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.460
You liked doing surprise events in front of people.

252
00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:46.929
You shouted that you loved me in front of people.

253
00:20:47.363 --> 00:20:50.633
You gave me the bag and hairpin that you made yourself.

254
00:20:52.701 --> 00:20:53.936
You also gave me...

255
00:20:55.037 --> 00:20:56.205
the tampon you made yourself.

256
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.243
When did I ever ask for those?

257
00:21:02.811 --> 00:21:05.481
I hate receiving handmade gifts.

258
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:09.318
Have you ever tried to...

259
00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:13.022
find out what I like?

260
00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:18.661
See? You didn't like me.

261
00:21:18.661 --> 00:21:21.397
You just wanted to be a devoted boyfriend.

262
00:21:21.397 --> 00:21:22.464
You're wrong.

263
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:25.200
I tried everything I could to make you happy.

264
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.402
You cannot...

265
00:21:27.403 --> 00:21:28.737
learn about love from textbooks.

266
00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:30.806
It's not an exam...

267
00:21:31.607 --> 00:21:34.476
that you can be rewarded from liking somebody.

268
00:21:36.111 --> 00:21:37.313
Don't you get it?

269
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:51.193
It's not an exam...

270
00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:54.463
that you can be rewarded from liking somebody.

271
00:21:56.198 --> 00:21:57.366
Don't you get it?

272
00:21:58.767 --> 00:22:00.402
What's wrong with...

273
00:22:02.438 --> 00:22:03.872
trying my best?

274
00:22:05.207 --> 00:22:06.675
She's so mean.

275
00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:08.477
He's such a jerk.

276
00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:22.958
What are you looking at?

277
00:22:23.459 --> 00:22:24.993
Is it your first time to see a drunk girl...

278
00:22:24.993 --> 00:22:26.495
who just got dumped?

279
00:22:36.238 --> 00:22:37.373
He's a jerk.

280
00:22:38.407 --> 00:22:40.876
Me? Why are you saying that?

281
00:22:40.976 --> 00:22:42.878
I liked him so much.

282
00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:45.214
I liked him a lot.

283
00:22:46.014 --> 00:22:47.783
How can he disappear like that?

284
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.419
He's such a jerk.

285
00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:02.464
I got dumped today as well.

286
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:10.672
I finally know...

287
00:23:11.206 --> 00:23:12.875
what she likes...

288
00:23:15.043 --> 00:23:17.679
or what she hates even if she doesn't tell me.

289
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.283
But it's useless now.

290
00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:24.286
I really liked her with my everything.

291
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:27.423
She said that liking somebody...

292
00:23:29.057 --> 00:23:30.893
isn't all about trying hard.

293
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:34.563
What on earth are you talking about?

294
00:23:36.565 --> 00:23:39.134
It's like a miracle...

295
00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:43.205
to be able to like somebody.

296
00:23:44.907 --> 00:23:47.843
It's right to like somebody...

297
00:23:48.977 --> 00:23:53.315
with everything you have.

298
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:55.451
Right?

299
00:23:57.719 --> 00:23:59.354
I wasn't wrong, right?

300
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:00.756
Of course, you weren't.

301
00:24:01.123 --> 00:24:04.293
Let's drink to that.

302
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.162
Here. Drink it.

303
00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:11.533
You don't need to be sad over that kind of girl.

304
00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:13.669
Just forget her.

305
00:24:14.303 --> 00:24:15.737
- Drink it. - What?

306
00:24:15.938 --> 00:24:17.005
Bottoms up.

307
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:39.261
You are drinking too much.

308
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:40.496
That's mine.

309
00:24:42.364 --> 00:24:44.466
No. This is mine.

310
00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:46.768
Get your own drinks.

311
00:24:47.436 --> 00:24:48.871
Hey.

312
00:24:49.304 --> 00:24:50.806
Are you drunk?

313
00:24:58.881 --> 00:24:59.982
Do you want to...

314
00:25:01.483 --> 00:25:02.985
know something cool?

315
00:25:03.852 --> 00:25:04.887
What is it?

316
00:25:06.121 --> 00:25:07.356
Actually,

317
00:25:08.657 --> 00:25:11.159
I can hear people's thoughts...

318
00:25:12.528 --> 00:25:14.363
if I hold hands like this.

319
00:25:14.663 --> 00:25:17.032
Oh gosh. Really?

320
00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:20.168
Okay. Try it on me.

321
00:25:20.802 --> 00:25:24.439
What am I thinking right now?

322
00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:39.855
There are 2 people, not 1.

323
00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:51.967
Take a guess.

324
00:25:59.875 --> 00:26:01.476
There are really 2 people.

325
00:26:30.706 --> 00:26:32.174
Hey, you.

326
00:26:32.641 --> 00:26:34.276
You shouldn't sleep here.

327
00:26:34.543 --> 00:26:35.944
Get up.

328
00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:41.683
Where is she?

329
00:26:41.683 --> 00:26:43.685
What? Who?

330
00:26:44.052 --> 00:26:45.854
There was a girl with me.

331
00:26:46.455 --> 00:26:47.956
What are you talking about?

332
00:26:48.457 --> 00:26:49.891
Are you still drunk?

333
00:26:52.527 --> 00:26:53.795
Gosh.

334
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.898
The unemployment of young people is a big problem.

335
00:27:01.236 --> 00:27:02.237
(You're crazy.)

336
00:27:02.237 --> 00:27:03.438
"You're crazy"?

337
00:27:05.607 --> 00:27:06.875
You're crazy.

338
00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:11.179
("Studies of Criminology")

339
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.751
So you're saying that if you hold a person with your right hand,

340
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:17.219
you can hear the person's thoughts?

341
00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:19.955
Yes. Sometimes, I can see things too.

342
00:27:19.955 --> 00:27:21.456
But not always what I want to see.

343
00:27:22.658 --> 00:27:24.526
It only works on women?

344
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.730
Hold on. I have a senior who went to the same college as me.

345
00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:30.899
She's a psychiatrist.

346
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:32.134
I'm telling you the truth.

347
00:27:32.134 --> 00:27:33.135
It's okay.

348
00:27:33.135 --> 00:27:35.237
Stress can make you feel that way. It's normal.

349
00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:37.806
Here it is. Doctor Kim.

350
00:27:37.806 --> 00:27:40.542
It's also popular to receive a psychological counselling.

351
00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:42.544
What can I do to make you trust me?

352
00:27:42.544 --> 00:27:44.680
Would you trust you if you were me?

353
00:27:45.914 --> 00:27:47.282
You need some professional help.

354
00:27:49.985 --> 00:27:51.753
You guys must be having a talk.

355
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:53.255
I will come back later.

356
00:27:59.795 --> 00:28:00.962
Professor.

357
00:28:01.963 --> 00:28:05.067
What do you think of Professor Kim?

358
00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:06.134
What?

359
00:28:07.636 --> 00:28:10.272
What do you think of Professor Kim?

360
00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:13.475
What's wrong with him?

361
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:28.790
What was that all about?

362
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.493
Did you have to embarrass me in front of everyone?

363
00:28:32.494 --> 00:28:35.197
What is wrong with asking you to swap our lecture rooms...

364
00:28:35.197 --> 00:28:36.732
when I had more students than your class?

365
00:28:37.199 --> 00:28:38.467
Don't you think it would be more productive...

366
00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:41.503
to figure out what to teach for your students...

367
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.972
instead of complaining about your lecture room?

368
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.408
You were a scumbag since when we were in college.

369
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.718
And one more thing.

370
00:28:58.353 --> 00:28:59.888
You are still sexy.

371
00:29:05.727 --> 00:29:07.562
Can we delay the next lecture for 10 minutes?

372
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.202
I didn't want to know that.

373
00:29:47.636 --> 00:29:48.737
- What's wrong with him? - What?

374
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.305
I don't know.

375
00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:53.108
He kept saying that he sees things.

376
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.046
"You were a scumbag since when we were in college."

377
00:30:05.353 --> 00:30:06.421
"And one more thing."

378
00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:09.391
"You are still sexy."

379
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.462
Can we delay the next lecture for 10 minutes?

380
00:30:20.302 --> 00:30:25.207
That's not it. He kept saying something strange.

381
00:30:31.813 --> 00:30:33.715
Can you trust me now?

382
00:30:37.485 --> 00:30:39.187
Yes! Yes!

383
00:30:39.187 --> 00:30:41.022
- Hello, sir. - Hello, sir.

384
00:30:41.022 --> 00:30:42.958
Hello guys.

385
00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:45.393
Don't skip your lectures.

386
00:30:45.393 --> 00:30:46.928
I told you not to do that.

387
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:50.765
What do I do?

388
00:30:50.966 --> 00:30:52.567
Why are you worried?

389
00:30:52.567 --> 00:30:53.935
You are blessed to have your hands.

390
00:30:53.935 --> 00:30:56.638
It's like a gift from the above.

391
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:58.440
How can it be a gift...

392
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.475
when I even see the things that I don't want to?

393
00:31:01.243 --> 00:31:03.278
Stop with the nonsense already.

394
00:31:03.812 --> 00:31:04.813
Hi, guys.

395
00:31:07.148 --> 00:31:08.149
Think about it.

396
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:09.718
Imagine yourself holding girls' hands...

397
00:31:09.718 --> 00:31:12.053
and asking what they want to do.

398
00:31:12.053 --> 00:31:13.922
Then they will tell you what they want to do.

399
00:31:13.922 --> 00:31:15.891
The places that they want to visit or the things that they want to do.

400
00:31:16.524 --> 00:31:18.727
Or if they want to do it tonight or not.

401
00:31:18.727 --> 00:31:19.961
I'm so jealous.

402
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.898
Then,

403
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:25.000
I can also change people's mind.

404
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.967
Don't.

405
00:31:26.067 --> 00:31:28.169
Young man, dream big.

406
00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:31.640
You can already win every woman's hearts.

407
00:31:31.873 --> 00:31:33.308
Think of it.

408
00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:35.043
Kim Hye Soo,

409
00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:37.145
Jun Ji Hyun, and Song Hye Kyo.

410
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:39.881
That's not everything. You can also go international.

411
00:31:46.588 --> 00:31:47.889
Scarlett Johansson,

412
00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:50.892
Jennifer Lopez, or even the princess of Monaco.

413
00:31:51.293 --> 00:31:53.194
They said it's like winning the whole world...

414
00:31:53.194 --> 00:31:54.562
if you can have all women.

415
00:31:54.562 --> 00:31:58.333
You already have the whole world.

416
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:03.939
What should we do first?

417
00:32:03.972 --> 00:32:05.273
Which major has the most female students?

418
00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:09.477
Shall we go to Food and Nutrition course or dance classes?

419
00:32:09.477 --> 00:32:10.612
Let's go.

420
00:32:10.612 --> 00:32:13.848
But I enlisted myself in a fit of anger.

421
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:15.650
What?

422
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.718
Salute.

423
00:32:16.885 --> 00:32:19.454
I've been dismissed from the army.

424
00:32:19.454 --> 00:32:22.324
It's so good to see you all, my friends.

425
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.127
Oh no.

426
00:32:26.728 --> 00:32:32.000
(Protecting Our Nation)

427
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.568
Hey.

428
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.271
Come here.

429
00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:38.173
You have to do as I say.

430
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.508
Don't do any hard work.

431
00:32:40.608 --> 00:32:41.910
Take care of your hands all the time.

432
00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:42.978
Okay.

433
00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:45.847
Our lives depend on your hands.

434
00:32:45.847 --> 00:32:47.582
No. Your life depends on your hands.

435
00:32:47.582 --> 00:32:49.584
You have to remember this.

436
00:32:49.584 --> 00:32:50.852
Okay.

437
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:52.921
Take care.

438
00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:55.056
You can go now.

439
00:32:55.423 --> 00:32:58.326
Trainers, come forward.

440
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:00.328
Move quickly.

441
00:33:00.328 --> 00:33:02.297
Faster! Now!

442
00:33:10.138 --> 00:33:11.940
Dae Chul. When I get dismissed from the army,

443
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.075
I promise you that I will have the most awesome girlfriend.

444
00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:16.544
- I'm going now. - Take care.

445
00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:41.236
(May, 2017)

446
00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:43.605
(3 years later)

447
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:45.340
(Job Fair)

448
00:33:50.311 --> 00:33:52.213
She is so pretty.

449
00:33:53.381 --> 00:33:55.984
I wish I could date her. I really want to date her.

450
00:33:55.984 --> 00:33:59.254
Such a pervert. You're crazy.

451
00:33:59.421 --> 00:34:00.688
Why would she date someone like you?

452
00:34:00.688 --> 00:34:02.524
What? Can't I even dream about it?

453
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.229
I wonder who will date a girl like her.

454
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.799
He must be amazing.

455
00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.767
He can't be compared to losers like us.

456
00:34:14.402 --> 00:34:15.670
I want to take this home.

457
00:34:16.604 --> 00:34:19.040
Stop it, you pervert.

458
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.442
You will kill yourself.

459
00:34:20.442 --> 00:34:21.509
Excuse me.

460
00:34:32.687 --> 00:34:34.422
Where is the Department of Psychology?

461
00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:42.230
A submitted report says that they developed this study...

462
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.199
further and used for humans.

463
00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:47.268
We try to prove to those interested in an unscientific area...

464
00:34:47.268 --> 00:34:50.105
like supernatural powers with more scientific approach.

465
00:34:50.105 --> 00:34:54.309
I believe this is the right attitude...

466
00:34:54.309 --> 00:34:58.079
for us to have as psychology students.

467
00:35:01.216 --> 00:35:04.352
This is the end of my presentation. Thank you.

468
00:35:15.063 --> 00:35:16.698
That was a good presentation.

469
00:35:17.632 --> 00:35:19.968
It must have been tough for you to catch up.

470
00:35:19.968 --> 00:35:21.769
- Great work. - Thank you.

471
00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:26.441
This is the end of today's lecture.

472
00:35:33.581 --> 00:35:34.582
Who is she?

473
00:35:46.961 --> 00:35:48.530
Are you done for today's lecture?

474
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.732
If you will excuse me, I just have to talk to him.

475
00:35:53.067 --> 00:35:54.102
Jae Hee?

476
00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:12.620
I love you, Eun Ho.

477
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:05.540
Is it okay for you to be here?

478
00:37:05.873 --> 00:37:07.008
There are so many people.

479
00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:10.211
How could you not call me after your discharge?

480
00:37:10.211 --> 00:37:11.379
Didn't you miss me?

481
00:37:11.713 --> 00:37:13.214
You look even prettier.

482
00:37:14.249 --> 00:37:15.316
Wait.

483
00:37:17.085 --> 00:37:18.486
One on the fourth floor. 11 o'clock.

484
00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:19.988
One on the rooftop. Two o'clock.

485
00:37:20.855 --> 00:37:22.423
The one on the rooftop is from Dispatch.

486
00:37:22.423 --> 00:37:24.559
The other one is from your agency.

487
00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:28.730
You want to have a scandal with a non-celebrity?

488
00:37:29.631 --> 00:37:31.699
Isn't this scandal too small to cover...

489
00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:32.767
your previous cheating scandal?

490
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.273
You want to look like you were waiting for my discharge?

491
00:37:38.773 --> 00:37:41.776
It's quite different.

492
00:37:42.443 --> 00:37:43.578
How did you know it?

493
00:37:47.081 --> 00:37:48.082
It's obvious.

494
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:50.652
You look like a person that only listens to pop.

495
00:37:50.652 --> 00:37:52.353
But you actually love opera.

496
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:55.156
You prefer warm refined rice wine on snowy days…

497
00:37:55.156 --> 00:37:56.791
than wine.

498
00:37:57.625 --> 00:37:59.627
On your day-off,

499
00:37:59.627 --> 00:38:01.462
you secretly do volunteer work without telling your agency.

500
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:03.464
You look cold and smart.

501
00:38:03.464 --> 00:38:06.000
However, you are actually very loving and indecisive.

502
00:38:06.668 --> 00:38:09.671
You can't say no to guys that have feelings for you.

503
00:38:10.238 --> 00:38:13.808
That's how you ended up cheating on them.

504
00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:17.045
Can you be my boyfriend?

505
00:38:17.145 --> 00:38:20.581
I told you already. I'm not interested in dating.

506
00:38:21.749 --> 00:38:23.351
Why are you not interested?

507
00:38:23.351 --> 00:38:24.519
Is there something wrong with you?

508
00:38:25.253 --> 00:38:29.090
There is. It's one big problem.

509
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.892
Oh my gosh. Look at this.

510
00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:33.795
- What is it? - Isn't this Eun Ho from Psychology?

511
00:38:34.462 --> 00:38:36.564
- Isn't he? - I think he's dating her.

512
00:38:36.831 --> 00:38:37.832
That's shocking.

513
00:38:37.899 --> 00:38:41.169
I heard that he doesn't date anyone.

514
00:38:41.169 --> 00:38:42.236
What do you mean?

515
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.639
He got into college in 2014. He is way older than us then.

516
00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:46.107
How can he be younger?

517
00:38:46.207 --> 00:38:47.709
That is...

518
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:52.080
Eun Ho!

519
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.249
Would you like to go watch a movie with me this weekend?

520
00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:57.151
Sorry. I'm not interested in dating.

521
00:39:00.788 --> 00:39:02.657
Eun Ho, if you are not busy,

522
00:39:02.657 --> 00:39:03.891
- do you want to have lunch with me? - No.

523
00:39:03.891 --> 00:39:04.892
I am not interested in dating.

524
00:39:07.562 --> 00:39:09.497
Eun Ho. Do you want to...

525
00:39:10.298 --> 00:39:13.134
Sorry. I'm not interested in dating.

526
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.770
Eun Ho. Don't forget me.

527
00:39:17.338 --> 00:39:19.240
He never dates anyone.

528
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.676
He doesn't date.

529
00:39:21.676 --> 00:39:23.044
That's how people started referring him.

530
00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:25.947
But he now dates...

531
00:39:26.047 --> 00:39:29.650
the idol singer, Jae Hee.

532
00:39:30.084 --> 00:39:32.353
I should have asked him out.

533
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.422
- Eun Ho. - Eun Ho.

534
00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:36.124
It will be quiet for a while.

535
00:39:36.557 --> 00:39:37.859
I should have done this sooner.

536
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:47.602
Hey.

537
00:39:48.269 --> 00:39:50.004
Get up.

538
00:39:50.538 --> 00:39:51.672
Get up.

539
00:39:51.873 --> 00:39:53.541
What are you doing?

540
00:39:53.775 --> 00:39:55.209
You might die.

541
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.148
Have a look at this.

542
00:40:01.582 --> 00:40:02.817
This is from three years ago.

543
00:40:03.751 --> 00:40:04.986
And this is from last week.

544
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.988
Do you see this white thing?

545
00:40:07.255 --> 00:40:08.790
Do you see your blood vessels bursting?

546
00:40:11.392 --> 00:40:15.062
It's okay to use your power from time to time.

547
00:40:15.229 --> 00:40:18.332
But if you get too much information at once,

548
00:40:18.332 --> 00:40:20.902
it will cause a burn out in your brain.

549
00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:23.371
You kept feeling dizzy these days, right?

550
00:40:23.538 --> 00:40:24.605
This might be the reason.

551
00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:26.040
Dae Chul. I understand.

552
00:40:26.374 --> 00:40:28.309
I will be careful. Stop nagging me.

553
00:40:28.409 --> 00:40:29.944
Nagging?

554
00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:32.313
Why did you dump Jae Hee? Who do you think you are? Why?

555
00:40:32.313 --> 00:40:33.581
I was waiting for you to ask me.

556
00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:40.354
What did you say to me before you went to the army?

557
00:40:40.755 --> 00:40:41.756
You said you will date girls.

558
00:40:41.756 --> 00:40:43.691
You said you will date awesome girlfriends.

559
00:40:43.958 --> 00:40:45.693
You've dumped...

560
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:47.128
so many girls already.

561
00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:48.229
Ha Na, Mi Sook...

562
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.632
6, 7... I don't have enough fingers to count them all.

563
00:40:51.732 --> 00:40:53.601
What's the problem?

564
00:40:53.668 --> 00:40:55.503
You lured them all.

565
00:40:55.603 --> 00:40:57.038
Why don't you date them?

566
00:40:57.038 --> 00:40:59.774
If I were you, I would have... Gosh.

567
00:40:59.774 --> 00:41:01.442
What? What are you looking at?

568
00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:05.046
Dae Chul. Imagine that you can hear what your girlfriend is thinking...

569
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:06.080
when you're making a move.

570
00:41:17.024 --> 00:41:18.926
It's been 10 minutes already.

571
00:41:18.926 --> 00:41:21.829
Don't waste your energy. Make a move.

572
00:41:27.335 --> 00:41:30.338
- What's wrong? - Nothing. It's nothing

573
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:10.945
This is boring.

574
00:42:11.479 --> 00:42:13.714
I want to go home and sleep after a shower.

575
00:42:34.602 --> 00:42:36.938
You see? It's not good to know everything.

576
00:42:37.939 --> 00:42:40.141
I can see them lying and pretending like they're innocent.

577
00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:41.309
I can see everything.

578
00:42:41.676 --> 00:42:43.377
I let it slip a few times.

579
00:42:44.378 --> 00:42:46.714
If it repeats, you will be disappointed at the end.

580
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:50.751
After three years of experience, that's what I've learned.

581
00:42:50.918 --> 00:42:52.920
How can a woman not act innocent?

582
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.689
We just have to ignore it.

583
00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:57.758
Anyway, don't tell me to date girls from now on.

584
00:42:58.192 --> 00:43:00.728
If you introduce me to someone different,

585
00:43:01.329 --> 00:43:02.396
I might consider dating her.

586
00:43:02.396 --> 00:43:03.998
You mean like a rude girl?

587
00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:05.733
No, she needs four qualities.

588
00:43:06.601 --> 00:43:09.270
She must not pretend, put on an innocent face, lie,

589
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.838
and cannot be predicted.

590
00:43:11.372 --> 00:43:12.440
In short,

591
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.375
I'll date only if I can fall in love with her soul.

592
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:16.444
There's no such woman in the world.

593
00:43:16.777 --> 00:43:20.214
Exactly. I don't think there is.

594
00:43:47.174 --> 00:43:49.043
(Criminal Investigation)

595
00:43:58.586 --> 00:44:00.588
Gosh. You surprised me.

596
00:44:03.691 --> 00:44:04.759
You know me, right?

597
00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:12.099
I do know you.

598
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.068
I knew it.

599
00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:15.903
How do you know me?

600
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.338
From where and why?

601
00:44:17.338 --> 00:44:18.606
I saw you earlier.

602
00:44:20.141 --> 00:44:21.208
Don't talk.

603
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:23.444
I don't want to know it.

604
00:44:23.978 --> 00:44:25.046
No.

605
00:44:25.046 --> 00:44:26.981
You asked me first, and you don't want to hear it.

606
00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:29.350
I don't care where, why, and how we met.

607
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.584
It wasn't me.

608
00:44:30.818 --> 00:44:33.120
You should therefore forget me totally.

609
00:44:33.187 --> 00:44:34.622
Right now. Okay?

610
00:44:36.157 --> 00:44:37.191
And...

611
00:44:38.359 --> 00:44:39.960
Let's pretend like we don't know each other at school.

612
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:55.543
Who is that psycho?

613
00:44:56.644 --> 00:44:58.979
She looks familiar somehow.

614
00:45:00.247 --> 00:45:03.384
Happy Birthday to you.

615
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:06.353
Happy Birthday to you.

616
00:45:06.854 --> 00:45:10.191
Happy Birthday, dear my darling.

617
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.227
- Happy Birthday to you. - Happy Birthday to you.

618
00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:21.402
You are the biggest present from above.

619
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.738
Thank you for being born.

620
00:45:24.772 --> 00:45:26.273
Thank you so much.

621
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:29.710
What is this? Is this a present?

622
00:45:33.447 --> 00:45:34.815
I love you, baby.

623
00:45:36.083 --> 00:45:38.519
This is so wonderful. This is so cute.

624
00:45:38.519 --> 00:45:40.988
- Right? - I love the necklace too.

625
00:45:43.624 --> 00:45:45.426
Gosh. Stupid couple.

626
00:45:48.229 --> 00:45:51.298
It's not right to sit so close to each other in public.

627
00:45:51.398 --> 00:45:54.668
I should break them apart...

628
00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:56.771
like this.

629
00:46:05.713 --> 00:46:06.714
Gosh.

630
00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:10.151
Excuse me.

631
00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:15.489
You have to clean up the mess you guys made.

632
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.059
Baby, do you feel tired now?

633
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.427
No. I'm good.

634
00:46:22.963 --> 00:46:24.064
People are looking.

635
00:46:24.098 --> 00:46:25.833
I don't care.

636
00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:27.768
I don't care either.

637
00:46:33.674 --> 00:46:35.042
What an eyesore.

638
00:46:35.442 --> 00:46:38.078
How could he date someone while he was in the army?

639
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:40.981
- That's amazing. - Don't you know it?

640
00:46:41.649 --> 00:46:44.251
He's from the same troop as Eun Ho.

641
00:46:46.353 --> 00:46:47.988
He went on a blind date during his holiday.

642
00:46:47.988 --> 00:46:49.623
But he got dumped harshly.

643
00:46:49.924 --> 00:46:50.958
He could not...

644
00:46:50.958 --> 00:46:52.660
eat or sleep for days.

645
00:46:54.128 --> 00:46:55.629
I think I can help you.

646
00:46:57.998 --> 00:47:00.501
Show her to me just for once.

647
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.708
I've heard a lot about you.

648
00:47:08.108 --> 00:47:09.376
I just wanted to say hi.

649
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.080
I am Eun Ho. Please take good care of him.

650
00:47:15.649 --> 00:47:16.717
Sure.

651
00:47:37.671 --> 00:47:39.874
- Let's go. - Let's go.

652
00:47:39.874 --> 00:47:41.108
Shall we have chicken?

653
00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:42.710
I want half fried and half with sauce.

654
00:47:47.581 --> 00:47:49.483
This story of miracle spread...

655
00:47:49.483 --> 00:47:51.018
really fast inside the army.

656
00:47:51.518 --> 00:47:53.254
All the soldiers did as Eun Ho told them to.

657
00:47:53.254 --> 00:47:54.788
The girls who left them...

658
00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:56.924
came back to see them again.

659
00:48:03.998 --> 00:48:12.339
- Yoo Eun Ho. - Yoo Eun Ho.

660
00:48:13.007 --> 00:48:15.509
Even the soldiers who did not have girlfriends met girlfriends...

661
00:48:15.509 --> 00:48:18.212
before they were discharged.

662
00:48:18.212 --> 00:48:19.813
This is a legendary story.

663
00:48:19.813 --> 00:48:24.151
Everyone knows about this legendary story.

664
00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:26.787
Listen.

665
00:48:27.755 --> 00:48:30.758
Jae Hee did a concert at his army, and she met him there.

666
00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:33.961
Gosh. You are so mean.

667
00:48:41.368 --> 00:48:44.772
I respect this legend.

668
00:48:44.772 --> 00:48:47.207
- Hold on. - Where are you going?

669
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:51.478
Excuse me. Hello.

670
00:48:51.645 --> 00:48:52.980
I am a junior in Psychology.

671
00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.982
I remember you, Byung Cheol.

672
00:48:54.982 --> 00:48:56.350
We met in a lecture a while ago.

673
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.518
Please help me.

674
00:49:15.402 --> 00:49:18.138
He's Eun Ho from Psychology.

675
00:49:19.006 --> 00:49:20.374
Are you okay?

676
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:22.676
I am okay.

677
00:49:22.943 --> 00:49:24.979
What do I do? I am not okay.

678
00:49:25.479 --> 00:49:26.480
Sorry?

679
00:49:28.148 --> 00:49:29.583
You got injured.

680
00:49:30.351 --> 00:49:32.753
I am sorry, but I'm not okay with this.

681
00:49:36.657 --> 00:49:38.292
She's Kim Go Eun and came to the college in 2015.

682
00:49:39.193 --> 00:49:40.394
I like your name.

683
00:49:52.272 --> 00:49:53.273
No way.

684
00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:57.144
Kim Go Eun studies fashion.

685
00:49:58.078 --> 00:50:00.481
Did she really say that she didn't know me?

686
00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:03.350
You should have told me that you guys don't know each other.

687
00:50:04.018 --> 00:50:07.087
For a case like this, we have to plan things...

688
00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:08.155
She's lying.

689
00:50:08.522 --> 00:50:10.657
We spent so many nights together.

690
00:50:10.958 --> 00:50:12.459
I did everything for her.

691
00:50:13.827 --> 00:50:15.129
How can she say that she didn't know me?

692
00:50:15.229 --> 00:50:17.231
Byung Cheol, are you okay?

693
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:22.503
Hey. Byung Cheol!

694
00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:25.672
They spent nights together?

695
00:50:27.541 --> 00:50:31.311
This case was on March 3, 2014. Kim Yoon Hee was 22 years.

696
00:50:31.645 --> 00:50:33.847
She was found dead in her bathtub.

697
00:50:34.748 --> 00:50:36.483
She was strangled.

698
00:50:37.518 --> 00:50:39.253
They could not find...

699
00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:42.523
the victim's fingerprints or evidence.

700
00:50:42.923 --> 00:50:44.625
There were none of those in the scene.

701
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:48.896
From this, we can tell that it was planned ahead.

702
00:50:49.463 --> 00:50:52.399
Three months after the incident,

703
00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:56.070
on June 14, 2014,

704
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:57.871
a 25-year-old woman named Lee Sun Mi,

705
00:50:58.272 --> 00:51:01.442
was found dead in the bathtub.

706
00:51:02.943 --> 00:51:04.478
June 14th?

707
00:51:12.352 --> 00:51:13.353
Sadly,

708
00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:16.590
there were only fake security cameras in the building,

709
00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:18.559
so it was impossible to trace the murderer.

710
00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:34.541
(I will kill everyone.)

711
00:51:41.381 --> 00:51:46.220
Do you think that these two girls were...

712
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.188
killed by the same murderer?

713
00:51:48.489 --> 00:51:49.523
Raise your hands if you think they were.

714
00:51:52.626 --> 00:51:53.627
Okay.

715
00:51:57.064 --> 00:51:59.633
Kim Go Eun from the Department of Fashion.

716
00:52:04.671 --> 00:52:06.940
What? Is she also taking this class?

717
00:52:14.581 --> 00:52:15.649
Kim Go Eun.

718
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:17.985
Yes?

719
00:52:26.193 --> 00:52:27.528
Why is she Go Eun?

720
00:52:27.961 --> 00:52:29.396
Who was the other girl then?

721
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.299
You think that they were killed by the same killer.

722
00:52:32.299 --> 00:52:33.400
Can you explain?

723
00:52:34.501 --> 00:52:36.403
I think it can happen again.

724
00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:39.606
Since the killer is still not caught,

725
00:52:40.174 --> 00:52:42.276
there is a possibility that he will kill someone again.

726
00:52:44.144 --> 00:52:46.213
It can happen now as well.

727
00:52:46.713 --> 00:52:49.983
Therefore, it is right that they were both killed by the same killer.

728
00:52:51.351 --> 00:52:52.519
Go Eun!

729
00:52:54.087 --> 00:52:55.289
Go Eun!

730
00:52:56.156 --> 00:52:57.958
- What is it? - Who is it?

731
00:52:58.292 --> 00:52:59.560
- Go Eun. - What's going on?

732
00:53:00.327 --> 00:53:01.728
Where is this sound coming from?

733
00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:07.234
Sir, come and look here.

734
00:53:10.003 --> 00:53:11.038
Go Eun.

735
00:53:11.538 --> 00:53:12.906
(I love you, Go Eun.)

736
00:53:12.906 --> 00:53:13.941
Go Eun.

737
00:53:15.509 --> 00:53:16.777
Go Eun.

738
00:53:17.644 --> 00:53:18.712
Go Eun.

739
00:53:18.812 --> 00:53:20.347
- Who is he? - Is he crazy?

740
00:53:20.347 --> 00:53:22.049
Hey. Stop it now.

741
00:53:27.921 --> 00:53:31.258
Byung Cheol, please calm down.

742
00:53:31.858 --> 00:53:33.727
- Come down. - Hey!

743
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:36.063
Come down now.

744
00:53:37.064 --> 00:53:39.399
I gave everything to you.

745
00:53:41.001 --> 00:53:43.003
I did everything as you said.

746
00:53:44.338 --> 00:53:46.873
But why are you ignoring my heart?

747
00:53:49.943 --> 00:53:51.979
Please let me be next to you.

748
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.749
I am already too into you.

749
00:53:57.317 --> 00:53:58.418
Go Eun.

750
00:54:02.289 --> 00:54:04.057
Please take my heart.

751
00:54:11.598 --> 00:54:12.699
I brought her.

752
00:54:12.699 --> 00:54:14.067
She is Kim Go Eun.

753
00:54:14.067 --> 00:54:16.370
- What's going on? - Go Eun?

754
00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:32.753
You are not Go Eun.

755
00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:39.559
Who are you then?

756
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.117
(Meloholic)

757
00:55:04.918 --> 00:55:07.621
It feels so different from other girls.

758
00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:09.389
What are you doing?

759
00:55:09.489 --> 00:55:11.958
Gosh. He's driving me crazy.

760
00:55:11.958 --> 00:55:15.329
I think there's something since she says it's her personal life.

761
00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:16.730
You got here now?

762
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.398
She flirted with me.

763
00:55:18.598 --> 00:55:19.599
Gosh.

764
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.768
You are very new and sexy.

765
00:55:22.102 --> 00:55:24.438
What's the point of having the power if you don't know how to use it?

766
00:55:24.438 --> 00:55:25.739
Why is this happening?

767
00:55:26.673 --> 00:55:28.041
I will protect you...

768
00:55:28.308 --> 00:55:29.309
like today.

769
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:30.444
Come back to your senses.

770
00:55:31.778 --> 00:55:34.981
Won't you give me one last chance?
