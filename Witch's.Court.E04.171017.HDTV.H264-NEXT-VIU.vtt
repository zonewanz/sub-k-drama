(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:13.985
I didn't know it was a trap she had set.

4
00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:14.985
Woo Sung.

5
00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:17.525
It's because you're incompetent...

6
00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:20.295
you keep turning towards ways to cheat!

7
00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:21.955
Are you dying to move up?

8
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.554
Do you have someone to avenge?

9
00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.765
I'll find her myself. If she really ran away,

10
00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.135
I'm going to succeed and make her come to me.

11
00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:35.075
- This isn't you, is it? - The sex video case...

12
00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:37.244
The prime suspect, Sang Gyoon Kim,

13
00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:39.975
is her ex-boyfriend from two years ago.

14
00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.944
He lied about deleting it and kept it! I'm positive.

15
00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.344
There's a good chance he approached girls...

16
00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.155
with the intention of filming sex videos.

17
00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.855
I won't testify. I almost died.

18
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:50.924
I'm chasing a punk...

19
00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:53.895
who posts videos of his girlfriend online.

20
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:55.924
You are a woman.

21
00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.795
We'll get a warrant and put out an APB on him.

22
00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.694
It'll take at least at a couple of days.

23
00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.804
Then we have to let him go.

24
00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:06.405
You're a punk who shoots videos secretly.

25
00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:07.704
How dare you harass a prosecutor?

26
00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:09.775
I'll take you in as soon as I find evidence.

27
00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:11.974
Wait quietly within a five-mile radius.

28
00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:18.114
(Episode 4)

29
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:33.224
Finally home.

30
00:02:33.994 --> 00:02:35.125
What the...

31
00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:42.195
I'm glad you're here.

32
00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:44.325
Unit 803 was just rented.

33
00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:48.035
The young man is very decisive.

34
00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:50.765
Did he just leave? Was he wearing a black cap?

35
00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:53.065
Yes, black cap. That's right.

36
00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.075
What's the security code for 803?

37
00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:04.974
Are you okay?

38
00:05:04.974 --> 00:05:06.675
What's wrong with you?

39
00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:08.544
Can you just barge in if you're the landlord?

40
00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:09.875
Just now on the first floor...

41
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:10.945
Hold on.

42
00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:14.584
Did you come in here when I wasn't around?

43
00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:16.654
- What? - Aren't you...

44
00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:18.825
the perverted one who set the camera...

45
00:05:18.825 --> 00:05:20.024
in the bathroom?

46
00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:22.925
Gosh.

47
00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.664
So that man named Kim Sang Gyoon...

48
00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.974
told you he just needed access to this unit?

49
00:05:33.974 --> 00:05:35.034
Yes, that's right.

50
00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:40.245
It's not like these perverts...

51
00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:42.745
look like they're perverts.

52
00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:43.985
How would I know?

53
00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.644
Fine, let's say you didn't know.

54
00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:48.485
Then when he was setting up the camera,

55
00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:50.255
what were you doing?

56
00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:52.485
I had a business call,

57
00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:54.954
so I left the unit. That's when...

58
00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:58.065
I have no excuses.

59
00:05:58.065 --> 00:05:59.524
Here you go.

60
00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:10.474
Let's check on the camera first.

61
00:06:13.544 --> 00:06:14.615
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:17.485
Pardon?

63
00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:22.284
The culprit just turned himself in.

64
00:06:27.995 --> 00:06:30.495
- Do you admit to it? - Yes.

65
00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:32.094
You sure are brave.

66
00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:35.235
How can you go into a prosecutor's home?

67
00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.865
I must have been crazy.

68
00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:39.865
The prosecutor treated me like a criminal...

69
00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.135
during the interrogation.

70
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.375
She was coercive.

71
00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:47.375
My anger got to the best of me.

72
00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:51.644
I should have just died.

73
00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.144
Where is this jerk?

74
00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:57.425
You...

75
00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:06.094
Don't make a scene here.

76
00:07:06.094 --> 00:07:08.635
You'll give him an extenuation.

77
00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:11.865
He'll say that you performed violence on him.

78
00:07:13.104 --> 00:07:14.904
If you want that, then go ahead.

79
00:07:17.005 --> 00:07:18.505
I'm sorry, ma'am.

80
00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:20.474
I'm really sorry.

81
00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:23.445
Did you enjoy it?

82
00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:26.584
How does it feel to see my body?

83
00:07:27.015 --> 00:07:28.385
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:35.555
You.

85
00:07:37.394 --> 00:07:39.024
I'll break you to pieces.

86
00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:46.865
You have a nice back.

87
00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.044
It was too good...

88
00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:54.044
to watch by myself.

89
00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:58.214
What?

90
00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:00.354
How many years will you give me?

91
00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:04.255
I'll see how far I'll go...

92
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.294
depending on what you do.

93
00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:19.305
We've been investigating him...

94
00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:21.204
as a suspect of a sex video case.

95
00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:23.875
Today's crime will become an extension.

96
00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:25.245
We'll investigate both cases together.

97
00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:37.054
It's a realtime IP camera.

98
00:08:37.554 --> 00:08:40.154
It's like a wireless CCTV.

99
00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:41.255
Whatever it captures,

100
00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:42.924
you can see the video in realtime.

101
00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:45.394
Then this camera only took the clips...

102
00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.765
The video should be in here.

103
00:08:47.765 --> 00:08:49.434
Okay, let's look at it.

104
00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:50.865
Shall we?

105
00:08:51.235 --> 00:08:52.265
Let's see.

106
00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:53.505
Wait.

107
00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:55.404
We're going to watch it together?

108
00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:57.274
Forget it. I'll check.

109
00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:58.304
Ms. Ma.

110
00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.574
I know how you feel, but...

111
00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:02.814
How would you know?

112
00:09:03.174 --> 00:09:04.745
Have you been a victim of a hidden camera?

113
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:07.284
Have you been shot in your underwear?

114
00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:09.284
We still have to check. This is evidence.

115
00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:12.024
He got me taking a shower.

116
00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.865
Did you get the clips of Song Ga Young?

117
00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:20.765
I'm working on it.

118
00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:22.495
Hurry up and find that first.

119
00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:24.335
We'll throw him in as soon as we get that.

120
00:10:34.174 --> 00:10:35.304
What do I do?

121
00:10:50.824 --> 00:10:52.485
(Prosecutor's office)

122
00:10:59.064 --> 00:11:01.235
He committed a crime against a prosecutor?

123
00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:02.794
Is he crazy?

124
00:11:02.794 --> 00:11:04.465
We need to teach him a lesson.

125
00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:06.404
Exactly. This is...

126
00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:09.005
a terrorism against all female prosecutors.

127
00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:11.475
I know how you all feel,

128
00:11:11.644 --> 00:11:13.245
but we must keep our cool...

129
00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:15.345
and investigate objectively.

130
00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:17.985
If we get emotional,

131
00:11:18.314 --> 00:11:20.144
we'd be no different from Kim Sang Gyoon.

132
00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:22.855
Did you check the video?

133
00:11:23.255 --> 00:11:24.585
How much did he get?

134
00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:31.294
Ms. Ma took it so she can check.

135
00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.105
I'm in a lot of shock.

136
00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:39.904
I was trying to check, but I was too nervous.

137
00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:42.635
Of course you're in shock.

138
00:11:42.804 --> 00:11:44.644
Just hearing about it makes me tremble.

139
00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:47.544
Ms. Min, I'll take over this case.

140
00:11:47.544 --> 00:11:50.144
I know how to handle a lunatic like him.

141
00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:51.485
I'll help.

142
00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:54.314
Ms. Jang, Ms. Seo.

143
00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:57.085
Thank you for worrying about me.

144
00:11:57.355 --> 00:11:59.554
However, one must solve their own problems.

145
00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:01.324
I created this mess,

146
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.824
so I should solve it.

147
00:12:03.794 --> 00:12:05.324
If a victim interrogates the assailant,

148
00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:06.894
that would be revenge, not an investigation.

149
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:09.394
You're mistaken. It's just that...

150
00:12:09.394 --> 00:12:11.465
I'm the prosecutor of Song Ga Young's case.

151
00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:15.074
I meant I'll do my best.

152
00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:17.005
Fine.

153
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.274
Yeo, you can take Ma's case.

154
00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:22.544
You were on Kim Sang Gyoon from the start.

155
00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.024
Okay...

156
00:12:31.024 --> 00:12:33.054
I won't take your case.

157
00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:35.355
Do you think I don't know what you're up to?

158
00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:36.625
You won't pass over the tablet.

159
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.794
You'll push me around since I'm your junior.

160
00:12:38.794 --> 00:12:41.235
Don't be so stubborn.

161
00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:43.434
You need to be flexible.

162
00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:44.465
How?

163
00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:46.804
It's proven that he broke in,

164
00:12:46.804 --> 00:12:47.934
and we found the camera.

165
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:49.835
Most of all, he admitted to the crime.

166
00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:52.044
It's enough to get him prosecuted.

167
00:12:52.044 --> 00:12:53.044
Do you want him...

168
00:12:53.044 --> 00:12:55.475
to be prosecuted just for those crimes?

169
00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.444
What about the videos he recorded?

170
00:12:57.585 --> 00:12:58.585
Is it okay to let that pass?

171
00:12:58.585 --> 00:13:00.485
We have the camera, so...

172
00:13:00.485 --> 00:13:02.914
It's not enough evidence to have a camera.

173
00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:04.855
We need the video...

174
00:13:04.855 --> 00:13:07.394
to prove that it was indeed a hidden camera.

175
00:13:09.794 --> 00:13:10.824
It's still a no.

176
00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:13.965
Fine, then. Me too.

177
00:13:14.465 --> 00:13:16.635
You're being too harsh.

178
00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:19.865
You're responsible for this case too.

179
00:13:20.064 --> 00:13:23.274
- How so? - Think about what you did.

180
00:13:23.274 --> 00:13:25.875
You've been pushing me to move out.

181
00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:28.944
You told me I made you tired.

182
00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:31.284
If you didn't pressure me as a landlord...

183
00:13:31.284 --> 00:13:33.985
at this time of housing shortage,

184
00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:37.184
I wouldn't have told a realtor about the unit.

185
00:13:37.955 --> 00:13:39.085
I also wouldn't have...

186
00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:41.255
been caught on camera...

187
00:13:43.424 --> 00:13:46.095
and go through this humiliation.

188
00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:48.694
I'm so embarrassed I can't even look up.

189
00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:49.965
This doesn't suit you.

190
00:13:49.965 --> 00:13:51.235
I know.

191
00:13:51.235 --> 00:13:52.404
Can you see how desperate I am?

192
00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:53.904
Fine.

193
00:13:54.404 --> 00:13:56.475
I admit I'm partially responsible.

194
00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.644
I'll give you one day to give me the video.

195
00:13:58.644 --> 00:14:00.944
If you don't, I'll report for hiding evidence.

196
00:14:00.944 --> 00:14:01.944
Fine.

197
00:14:02.314 --> 00:14:04.985
- Please vote number one. - Thank you.

198
00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.784
Please vote for candidate number one.

199
00:14:06.784 --> 00:14:07.914
- Cho Gap Soo. - He's number one.

200
00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:10.784
- Cho Gap Soo! - Hello.

201
00:14:10.784 --> 00:14:13.324
- Hello, there. - Cho Gap Soo!

202
00:14:13.324 --> 00:14:15.824
- Cho Gap Soo! - Number one, Cho Gap Soo.

203
00:14:15.824 --> 00:14:17.495
Are you well, ma'am?

204
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.365
I'm number one.

205
00:14:20.365 --> 00:14:22.064
- I'm number one. - Yes, yes.

206
00:14:22.064 --> 00:14:23.294
Ma'am, vote number one.

207
00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:25.635
- Cho Gap Soo! - Hello!

208
00:14:25.635 --> 00:14:27.304
Candidate number one, Cho Gap Soo!

209
00:14:27.304 --> 00:14:29.534
- Have you been well? - Yes.

210
00:14:29.674 --> 00:14:31.304
Congratulations.

211
00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:32.544
Gosh.

212
00:14:32.544 --> 00:14:34.215
- He's number one! - Cho Gap Soo!

213
00:14:34.215 --> 00:14:36.644
- Vote for Cho Gap Soo! - Number one.

214
00:14:46.054 --> 00:14:47.294
I, Cho Gap Soo,

215
00:14:47.355 --> 00:14:48.755
will make...

216
00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:52.564
a unified Yeongpa City like this bibimbap.

217
00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:16.154
It's such a bother every election.

218
00:15:19.154 --> 00:15:20.154
Yes?

219
00:15:29.894 --> 00:15:31.064
Hey.

220
00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:32.705
I asked you to be careful...

221
00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:34.404
until the end of elections.

222
00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:36.605
I did it all for you.

223
00:15:38.574 --> 00:15:39.875
Let's sell...

224
00:15:40.975 --> 00:15:43.074
Hyungjae Hotel once I become the mayor.

225
00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:44.814
The election is just around the corner.

226
00:15:45.215 --> 00:15:47.684
You're neck in neck. Will you be okay?

227
00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:50.085
Are you worried about me?

228
00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:53.694
I'm more worried about you going bankrupt...

229
00:15:53.794 --> 00:15:55.324
because of that building.

230
00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:58.725
Enough nonsense. Send a lawyer over.

231
00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.365
Give me someone smart.

232
00:16:07.274 --> 00:16:11.345
If he wasn't family, I would have beat him.

233
00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:24.585
I want to spearhead the Hyungjae Hotel.

234
00:16:25.725 --> 00:16:26.995
You're really fast.

235
00:16:27.995 --> 00:16:30.564
I was in charge of Hyungjae Group before.

236
00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:33.225
I'll work without making any noise.

237
00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:36.294
I'm confident I can get a great sales value.

238
00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:37.564
Forget it.

239
00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:42.135
I'm going to get someone who used to be a judge.

240
00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.774
Do you mean a previous prosecutor?

241
00:16:45.745 --> 00:16:48.215
How about that prosecutor...

242
00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:50.284
that was against you during that trial?

243
00:16:50.284 --> 00:16:51.485
She looked smart.

244
00:16:53.184 --> 00:16:56.215
She's a punk who only takes rape cases.

245
00:16:56.684 --> 00:16:58.085
How can you trust her with this?

246
00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:00.394
You're the one that lost to that punk!

247
00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:02.794
I don't need to see it all to know.

248
00:17:04.594 --> 00:17:05.665
You're dismissed.

249
00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:09.935
Sang Ho. Bring me that prosecutor.

250
00:17:10.604 --> 00:17:11.705
Yes, sir.

251
00:17:29.354 --> 00:17:30.384
What is it?

252
00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:32.784
The sex video case.

253
00:17:40.195 --> 00:17:43.034
I only get leftovers now?

254
00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:03.884
I talked to the people in here,

255
00:18:04.524 --> 00:18:06.084
and they told me I'm lucky to have you.

256
00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:10.124
I heard you have a high winning rate.

257
00:18:12.495 --> 00:18:14.564
It depends on the client.

258
00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:19.505
Circulating sex videos and housebreaking.

259
00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:21.534
You even uploaded the videos.

260
00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:23.905
You need at least three lawyers...

261
00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:25.905
who used to be a judge or a prosecutor.

262
00:18:27.415 --> 00:18:29.614
There's no evidence that I uploaded them.

263
00:18:30.384 --> 00:18:31.814
Also, that prosecutor...

264
00:18:33.384 --> 00:18:35.114
won't be able to reveal the evidence.

265
00:18:40.854 --> 00:18:42.054
If she reveals it,

266
00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.925
I threatened her...

267
00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:46.765
I'd spread it on the internet.

268
00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:50.334
Is your goal to make the judge hate you...

269
00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:53.165
and to get sentenced to prison?

270
00:18:53.364 --> 00:18:55.274
I'll do well at trial.

271
00:18:55.774 --> 00:18:57.074
It's my first offense.

272
00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:01.874
I'll shed a few tears as if I regret it.

273
00:19:03.074 --> 00:19:05.685
Then you should defend yourself.

274
00:19:12.725 --> 00:19:13.824
Are you upset?

275
00:19:14.755 --> 00:19:17.995
I usually wouldn't take such a case.

276
00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.594
So?

277
00:19:19.995 --> 00:19:23.235
You should be thankful you took her video.

278
00:19:24.465 --> 00:19:25.965
Let me tell you this in advance.

279
00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:28.834
If you want to get out with just a penalty,

280
00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:33.274
you better tell me every single thing.

281
00:19:33.814 --> 00:19:35.044
Everything?

282
00:19:37.445 --> 00:19:39.284
(Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office)

283
00:19:50.395 --> 00:19:53.294
Ms. Son, did Ms. Ma come in yet?

284
00:19:54.265 --> 00:19:56.834
I'm not sure. I think she's in.

285
00:19:58.304 --> 00:19:59.304
Okay.

286
00:20:23.665 --> 00:20:25.594
Gosh. I'll get...

287
00:20:25.794 --> 00:20:29.235
Kim Sang Gyoon with Song Ga Young's video.

288
00:20:29.935 --> 00:20:32.364
Wait until we find the original video.

289
00:20:41.975 --> 00:20:44.185
You're so persistent.

290
00:20:44.614 --> 00:20:45.945
(Koo Suk Chan)

291
00:20:48.485 --> 00:20:49.485
Yes?

292
00:20:49.485 --> 00:20:51.455
It's regarding Song Ga Young's video.

293
00:20:52.255 --> 00:20:54.054
Did you really delete it?

294
00:20:54.324 --> 00:20:55.554
Yes.

295
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:58.665
He put passwords on the videos he took.

296
00:20:59.094 --> 00:21:01.235
It took a while to restore them.

297
00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.804
What's this? What about the video?

298
00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:09.604
The file was damaged too much.

299
00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.804
I could only get the sound.

300
00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:14.574
What a waste of time.

301
00:21:15.344 --> 00:21:16.915
You said you could restore it.

302
00:21:17.284 --> 00:21:18.284
Well...

303
00:21:19.614 --> 00:21:23.955
I could only restore the sound for this video,

304
00:21:25.155 --> 00:21:29.495
but there are many files with proper videos.

305
00:21:30.225 --> 00:21:33.165
There's a flight attendant and a teacher.

306
00:21:33.324 --> 00:21:35.265
There's also a model. It's very detailed.

307
00:21:35.735 --> 00:21:37.564
He categorized them by occupation.

308
00:21:37.804 --> 00:21:41.475
But what you need is Song Ga Young's file.

309
00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:44.844
It didn't work out so well.

310
00:21:46.844 --> 00:21:47.915
What do we do?

311
00:21:47.975 --> 00:21:49.245
(Day of closed jury trial)

312
00:21:49.245 --> 00:21:52.485
I cannot accept the prosecution's evidence.

313
00:21:53.344 --> 00:21:57.524
First, the video is not a proper digital evidence.

314
00:21:58.124 --> 00:22:00.895
It only has sound and no visuals.

315
00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.195
Didn't you see the list below?

316
00:22:03.594 --> 00:22:06.564
They're videos we restored from his computer.

317
00:22:07.064 --> 00:22:10.465
The accused lives with a roommate.

318
00:22:11.005 --> 00:22:12.965
Of course they would share the computer.

319
00:22:13.334 --> 00:22:16.874
Those videos could belong to his roommate.

320
00:22:19.245 --> 00:22:20.344
Second,

321
00:22:20.415 --> 00:22:23.044
they did not go through a legitimate process.

322
00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:24.344
What do you mean?

323
00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:27.114
They arrest him without a warrant...

324
00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:29.715
or any proper reason. They broke into his house...

325
00:22:29.784 --> 00:22:31.324
and collected the evidence illegally.

326
00:22:31.554 --> 00:22:33.755
The order changed, that's all.

327
00:22:33.854 --> 00:22:35.925
We had no choice since he might...

328
00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:37.064
destruct the evidence.

329
00:22:38.124 --> 00:22:39.225
Prosecution.

330
00:22:39.564 --> 00:22:42.634
Why do we need processes if you act on your own?

331
00:22:43.165 --> 00:22:45.604
- Pardon? - You broke in...

332
00:22:45.735 --> 00:22:47.475
without a warrant...

333
00:22:47.804 --> 00:22:49.975
and collected evidence illegally.

334
00:22:50.445 --> 00:22:53.175
You also hid this fact all this time.

335
00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:55.515
All of these could become problems.

336
00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:57.485
- Your Honor. - On top of that,

337
00:22:57.614 --> 00:23:01.084
the video is of no force per defense's claim.

338
00:23:01.655 --> 00:23:03.884
We'll exclude the video and end it here.

339
00:23:06.995 --> 00:23:09.495
Is this all the evidence you have...

340
00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:10.765
for Ms. Ma's hidden camera case?

341
00:23:11.824 --> 00:23:13.594
Aren't you going to hand in the video?

342
00:23:16.794 --> 00:23:17.834
Well...

343
00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:21.274
There's a problem with it.

344
00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.175
A problem?

345
00:23:24.574 --> 00:23:26.274
No, Your Honor. It's being restored.

346
00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:27.945
We'll have it ready for trial.

347
00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:36.584
Didn't you see the missed calls?

348
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.354
Why didn't you pick up?

349
00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:42.895
What will you do now?

350
00:23:43.094 --> 00:23:45.124
Song Ga Young's video was excluded.

351
00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.495
He might be released without charges.

352
00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:52.265
You still want us to fight without your video?

353
00:23:53.304 --> 00:23:54.874
- Ms. Ma! - What?

354
00:23:56.104 --> 00:23:59.175
Let me ask you again. Where is the tablet?

355
00:24:01.475 --> 00:24:02.515
I threw it out.

356
00:24:03.685 --> 00:24:04.814
What?

357
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:05.985
I threw it out.

358
00:24:05.985 --> 00:24:07.915
I hammered it and threw it in the river!

359
00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:10.054
Don't joke with me!

360
00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:12.255
Do I look like I'd joke with you?

361
00:24:12.655 --> 00:24:15.225
It's the truth! I really threw it out!

362
00:24:19.864 --> 00:24:22.794
Let me go. Let go of me.

363
00:24:23.034 --> 00:24:26.034
How dare you detain a prosecutor?

364
00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:29.534
Hey, I'm a prosecutor!

365
00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:31.304
Come on. You're being too harsh.

366
00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:33.005
- Please... - I'm sorry!

367
00:24:33.945 --> 00:24:37.584
We have no choice. We were told to do this.

368
00:24:38.084 --> 00:24:39.544
(Ma Yi Deum, Yeo Jin Wook)

369
00:24:40.884 --> 00:24:44.554
Don't be too rough since it belongs to Ms. Ma.

370
00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:48.524
All we have to do is find the tablet.

371
00:24:53.548 --> 00:24:56.871
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E04 Witch's Court "From Prosecuter to Victim"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

372
00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:04.774
I don't think it's here.

373
00:25:05.005 --> 00:25:06.505
The place is a mess.

374
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.314
It looks like she hasn't been here in a while.

375
00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:13.685
It always looks like this.

376
00:25:13.685 --> 00:25:14.685
True.

377
00:25:14.985 --> 00:25:17.584
Who'd want to sleep where hidden cameras were?

378
00:25:17.854 --> 00:25:19.524
I'd sleep elsewhere too.

379
00:25:20.455 --> 00:25:22.124
- Ms. Son. - Yes?

380
00:25:22.124 --> 00:25:23.594
The sleeping room has lockers, right?

381
00:25:23.624 --> 00:25:24.794
Lockers?

382
00:25:25.495 --> 00:25:29.195
I know Ma is out of control.

383
00:25:29.195 --> 00:25:30.505
What were you doing?

384
00:25:30.834 --> 00:25:32.705
What were you doing...

385
00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:34.304
while Ma hid the evidence?

386
00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:35.334
My apologies.

387
00:25:36.074 --> 00:25:37.344
Forget that.

388
00:25:37.604 --> 00:25:38.804
Prepare a written report...

389
00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:40.915
and book Ma for hiding public property.

390
00:25:44.784 --> 00:25:46.485
I'll submit the report,

391
00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:47.755
but...

392
00:25:48.955 --> 00:25:51.985
can't you let Ms. Ma go this one time?

393
00:25:52.324 --> 00:25:54.925
- What? - To be honest,

394
00:25:54.925 --> 00:25:56.655
I don't want to go easy on her.

395
00:25:57.195 --> 00:25:59.995
But when we consider her a victim like the others,

396
00:26:00.265 --> 00:26:01.864
I can sort of understand...

397
00:26:02.235 --> 00:26:03.935
how she feels right now.

398
00:26:05.965 --> 00:26:08.235
And I'm sure she didn't throw away the tablet.

399
00:26:09.205 --> 00:26:10.205
She isn't...

400
00:26:10.205 --> 00:26:12.145
thoughtless enough to destroy evidence.

401
00:26:22.985 --> 00:26:24.024
Come out.

402
00:26:32.725 --> 00:26:33.765
Are you hungry?

403
00:26:48.814 --> 00:26:50.314
You really won't hand it over?

404
00:26:51.645 --> 00:26:53.685
Give it to me before you regret it.

405
00:26:53.985 --> 00:26:55.455
Seriously.

406
00:26:55.755 --> 00:26:57.584
Are you threatening me?

407
00:26:57.584 --> 00:26:58.824
Do you look down on me...

408
00:26:58.824 --> 00:26:59.925
because I rent and was secretly filmed?

409
00:26:59.925 --> 00:27:01.725
I don't look down on you, but it is a bit...

410
00:27:01.725 --> 00:27:02.955
A bit what?

411
00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:06.124
You said before that you'd never be filmed.

412
00:27:07.665 --> 00:27:09.735
How does it feel, now that you're a victim?

413
00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:12.235
Can you finally relate now?

414
00:27:12.235 --> 00:27:14.405
I was wondering when you'd say that.

415
00:27:14.405 --> 00:27:15.735
Are you happy...

416
00:27:15.735 --> 00:27:17.945
seeing me suckered after our conversation?

417
00:27:17.945 --> 00:27:19.445
I was at first, to be honest.

418
00:27:19.445 --> 00:27:21.515
- What? - At least now,

419
00:27:22.415 --> 00:27:24.515
you must realize now that no one becomes a victim...

420
00:27:24.515 --> 00:27:26.044
because they want to be.

421
00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:28.515
Just as you unwillingly became a victim,

422
00:27:28.515 --> 00:27:30.384
Song Ga Young and Oh Min Jung...

423
00:27:30.755 --> 00:27:33.084
did nothing wrong to become victims.

424
00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:39.864
Without your video,

425
00:27:40.735 --> 00:27:41.864
we may...

426
00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.304
have to let Kim Sang Gyoon go.

427
00:27:44.465 --> 00:27:46.905
Oh Min Jung mustered up courage to testify.

428
00:27:48.005 --> 00:27:50.005
So you need to decide as well.

429
00:27:51.975 --> 00:27:52.975
What?

430
00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:55.114
Whether I'll resign as prosecutor...

431
00:27:55.675 --> 00:27:57.584
or show the world my nude body?

432
00:27:57.584 --> 00:27:58.584
No.

433
00:27:59.245 --> 00:28:01.755
Whether you'll help us prosecute the perpetrator,

434
00:28:01.755 --> 00:28:04.155
or keep running away as a victim.

435
00:28:28.344 --> 00:28:29.475
(Ma Yi Deum)

436
00:28:54.304 --> 00:28:55.304
No evidence?

437
00:28:57.745 --> 00:28:59.804
(There are no files.)

438
00:29:03.715 --> 00:29:05.314
No evidence?

439
00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:06.415
What do you mean?

440
00:29:06.415 --> 00:29:08.185
I have an app on the tablet...

441
00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:10.884
that deletes the videos after a set time.

442
00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:12.455
After a set time?

443
00:29:12.485 --> 00:29:14.155
An hour after viewing the video.

444
00:29:14.854 --> 00:29:15.995
I'm sure...

445
00:29:15.995 --> 00:29:17.564
they never thought of that.

446
00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:22.265
There's a low probability.

447
00:29:23.064 --> 00:29:24.205
That prosecutor...

448
00:29:24.634 --> 00:29:26.604
shouldn't be underestimated.

449
00:29:26.705 --> 00:29:29.235
Then they would've submitted the evidence.

450
00:29:31.145 --> 00:29:32.445
Ms. Ma Yi Deum.

451
00:29:32.975 --> 00:29:34.874
Why is this here instead of the evidence...

452
00:29:34.874 --> 00:29:36.215
of the hidden camera?

453
00:29:36.215 --> 00:29:37.715
There's been a situation.

454
00:29:39.485 --> 00:29:42.054
I'm positive the evidence is gone.

455
00:29:42.554 --> 00:29:43.584
We can...

456
00:29:44.155 --> 00:29:45.925
win this trial.

457
00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:52.495
Case number 2017GO7631,

458
00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.765
regarding the violation...

459
00:29:54.765 --> 00:29:56.895
of sexual assault laws...

460
00:29:56.895 --> 00:30:00.505
and case number 2017GO7642...

461
00:30:00.705 --> 00:30:02.304
will be joined.

462
00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:04.705
I lost everything...

463
00:30:05.374 --> 00:30:07.215
because of that video.

464
00:30:09.445 --> 00:30:11.314
But he, the assailant,

465
00:30:11.544 --> 00:30:13.245
is doing just fine.

466
00:30:13.985 --> 00:30:16.084
I felt like that was unfair.

467
00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:18.024
Back then,

468
00:30:18.384 --> 00:30:20.955
I avoided it for fear the video would spread,

469
00:30:21.755 --> 00:30:23.395
but I was wrong.

470
00:30:23.594 --> 00:30:25.024
If I had stopped it then,

471
00:30:25.794 --> 00:30:27.235
there wouldn't have been...

472
00:30:28.265 --> 00:30:29.895
more victims like me.

473
00:30:30.735 --> 00:30:31.804
I know I'm late,

474
00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:34.205
but I want him to be punished...

475
00:30:34.935 --> 00:30:37.544
and make him feel at least a small portion...

476
00:30:38.245 --> 00:30:39.505
of the pain that I...

477
00:30:40.975 --> 00:30:42.374
and the other victims...

478
00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:45.715
have suffered.

479
00:30:50.284 --> 00:30:51.284
No more questions.

480
00:30:55.225 --> 00:30:57.064
Two years ago, when you filmed...

481
00:30:57.064 --> 00:30:58.864
the video with the defendant,

482
00:30:59.165 --> 00:31:00.265
you wanted...

483
00:31:00.665 --> 00:31:02.195
to film it as well, correct?

484
00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:03.705
Your Honor.

485
00:31:04.134 --> 00:31:05.604
I'll rephrase that.

486
00:31:10.505 --> 00:31:12.104
You agreed to film it, correct?

487
00:31:13.544 --> 00:31:14.544
Yes.

488
00:31:15.475 --> 00:31:17.915
But he promised to delete it,

489
00:31:18.215 --> 00:31:19.215
and the secretly...

490
00:31:19.215 --> 00:31:20.985
Please answer "Yes," or "No."

491
00:31:20.985 --> 00:31:22.854
You agreed, correct?

492
00:31:26.054 --> 00:31:27.054
Yes.

493
00:31:27.824 --> 00:31:29.155
How did you find out...

494
00:31:29.155 --> 00:31:30.965
that the video was leaked?

495
00:31:31.124 --> 00:31:33.895
A friend sent me the video.

496
00:31:33.895 --> 00:31:35.995
So you did not see the defendant...

497
00:31:35.995 --> 00:31:37.804
upload the video yourself,

498
00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:39.235
is that it?

499
00:31:39.235 --> 00:31:40.874
Must I see it to know?

500
00:31:41.304 --> 00:31:43.175
If not him, who would've done it?

501
00:31:43.175 --> 00:31:44.574
Then...

502
00:31:44.574 --> 00:31:46.344
did the defendant...

503
00:31:46.344 --> 00:31:49.215
threaten to circulate the video...

504
00:31:49.215 --> 00:31:51.145
or demand money?

505
00:31:53.485 --> 00:31:55.415
- No. - The defendant...

506
00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:57.755
did not gain financially then.

507
00:31:57.755 --> 00:31:59.854
But he enjoyed it.

508
00:32:00.255 --> 00:32:01.655
Isn't that a gain?

509
00:32:01.655 --> 00:32:03.895
You're making assumptions based on circumstances.

510
00:32:03.895 --> 00:32:05.094
You have zero proof...

511
00:32:05.094 --> 00:32:07.235
that he posted the video.

512
00:32:12.405 --> 00:32:15.804
Just as we confirmed from the witness' statement,

513
00:32:15.804 --> 00:32:18.774
how the video was leaked has not been proven.

514
00:32:18.774 --> 00:32:20.005
Furthermore,

515
00:32:20.274 --> 00:32:23.044
the defendant did not gain anything...

516
00:32:23.044 --> 00:32:25.685
by the video being leaked.

517
00:32:25.685 --> 00:32:28.515
Moreover, prosecution...

518
00:32:28.814 --> 00:32:31.584
cannot produce the original video...

519
00:32:31.584 --> 00:32:34.124
of Song Ga Young as evidence.

520
00:32:34.655 --> 00:32:36.925
What could this mean?

521
00:32:38.225 --> 00:32:42.165
It means the violations of the sexual assault law,

522
00:32:42.165 --> 00:32:45.104
which prosecution asserts...

523
00:32:45.104 --> 00:32:47.574
the defendant is guilty of,

524
00:32:47.874 --> 00:32:51.344
do not apply to the defendant.

525
00:32:59.314 --> 00:33:00.415
(Song Ga Young video trial)

526
00:33:00.415 --> 00:33:04.884
(Joint trial of Ma Yi Deum Break-in)

527
00:33:04.884 --> 00:33:06.824
(Trial in Session)

528
00:33:07.195 --> 00:33:08.195
(Evidence)

529
00:33:10.294 --> 00:33:11.965
What I'm holding...

530
00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:13.395
are cameras that defendant...

531
00:33:13.395 --> 00:33:15.495
Kim Sang Gyoon installed in the victim's home.

532
00:33:18.834 --> 00:33:21.005
You entered her apartment with the intent...

533
00:33:21.405 --> 00:33:23.175
of installing these cameras, correct?

534
00:33:24.945 --> 00:33:27.215
Yes. I'm sorry.

535
00:33:27.515 --> 00:33:28.675
Why did you do it?

536
00:33:29.614 --> 00:33:30.614
Pardon?

537
00:33:30.745 --> 00:33:33.044
What was your motive for installing the cameras?

538
00:33:34.314 --> 00:33:35.384
Well...

539
00:33:37.054 --> 00:33:38.584
"I'm sorry."

540
00:33:40.655 --> 00:33:41.824
I'm sorry.

541
00:33:42.054 --> 00:33:44.564
You said this during the police investigation.

542
00:33:45.024 --> 00:33:46.965
You were angry at the prosecutor,

543
00:33:47.495 --> 00:33:48.794
and resented her.

544
00:33:48.864 --> 00:33:50.165
Do you remember that?

545
00:33:51.435 --> 00:33:52.435
Yes.

546
00:33:52.435 --> 00:33:54.034
There were other ways...

547
00:33:54.034 --> 00:33:55.675
to protest unfair treatment.

548
00:33:55.675 --> 00:33:58.505
Why did you choose illegal filming?

549
00:33:59.574 --> 00:34:00.574
Pardon?

550
00:34:00.715 --> 00:34:03.915
In other cases where people protested,

551
00:34:04.584 --> 00:34:06.185
some threw acid,

552
00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:09.884
and some assaulted the prosecutor.

553
00:34:10.554 --> 00:34:12.054
However, the defendant...

554
00:34:12.054 --> 00:34:13.924
installed hidden cameras. Why is that?

555
00:34:16.795 --> 00:34:18.094
That's what I'm asking.

556
00:34:19.225 --> 00:34:20.225
Well...

557
00:34:21.134 --> 00:34:23.194
Were you planning to make...

558
00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:25.504
the female prosecutor feel ashamed as you did...

559
00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:26.975
to Song Ga Young and Oh Min Jung,

560
00:34:27.904 --> 00:34:29.404
and enjoy watching her?

561
00:34:35.745 --> 00:34:36.775
No more questions.

562
00:34:42.415 --> 00:34:44.984
You admitted to installing...

563
00:34:45.085 --> 00:34:48.455
hidden cameras in the victim's home.

564
00:34:48.694 --> 00:34:49.694
Correct?

565
00:34:50.225 --> 00:34:51.295
Yes.

566
00:34:51.395 --> 00:34:52.495
Then...

567
00:34:52.895 --> 00:34:54.864
were you planning...

568
00:34:55.364 --> 00:34:57.364
to film a video as prosecution asserts?

569
00:34:57.364 --> 00:34:58.864
I was not.

570
00:34:59.565 --> 00:35:02.634
It's true that I was angry and installed the cameras,

571
00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:06.375
but how could I think of filming a prosecutor?

572
00:35:07.415 --> 00:35:09.214
I never even considered that.

573
00:35:10.015 --> 00:35:11.145
I see.

574
00:35:11.515 --> 00:35:14.915
Then do you regret your actions?

575
00:35:15.585 --> 00:35:16.614
Yes.

576
00:35:16.884 --> 00:35:18.784
If I could turn back time,

577
00:35:19.654 --> 00:35:20.995
I'd like to.

578
00:35:21.355 --> 00:35:23.924
Why did you do something that you regret so much?

579
00:35:24.464 --> 00:35:27.134
It's true that I filmed videos of my girlfriends.

580
00:35:28.634 --> 00:35:30.605
But when the videos were leaked,

581
00:35:31.964 --> 00:35:33.674
I was also hurt.

582
00:35:34.534 --> 00:35:37.475
But the prosecutor...

583
00:35:39.475 --> 00:35:43.375
concluded that I was a sick pervert...

584
00:35:44.315 --> 00:35:45.884
and treated me like a criminal.

585
00:35:47.754 --> 00:35:50.324
That angered me so much, that I...

586
00:35:51.884 --> 00:35:53.924
did something I should not have done.

587
00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:56.554
I must've lost my mind.

588
00:36:01.835 --> 00:36:03.094
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

589
00:36:03.864 --> 00:36:07.435
the defendant confessed to his crime...

590
00:36:07.674 --> 00:36:09.435
as you can see,

591
00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:11.944
and deeply repents what he did.

592
00:36:12.004 --> 00:36:15.245
Seriously. I can't bear to listen any longer.

593
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.284
Pardon?

594
00:36:17.784 --> 00:36:19.984
What did you just say?

595
00:36:20.284 --> 00:36:22.214
Drop the act already.

596
00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:25.784
It's confusing who's the victim and assailant.

597
00:36:25.884 --> 00:36:27.295
Watch yourself.

598
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:32.665
Your Honor. Ms. Ma Yi Deum seems to have much to say.

599
00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:34.895
I'd like to call her to the stand.

600
00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:39.234
As the prosecutor on Song Ga Young's case,

601
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.705
you submitted the video into evidence. Correct?

602
00:36:43.205 --> 00:36:46.004
- Yes. - But for some reason,

603
00:36:46.174 --> 00:36:48.674
it was excluded from evidence. Why is that?

604
00:36:49.245 --> 00:36:50.315
Because...

605
00:36:51.284 --> 00:36:52.784
the attorney right here...

606
00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.415
complained about something minor.

607
00:36:55.614 --> 00:36:56.984
Something minor?

608
00:36:57.654 --> 00:37:00.694
Is illegally obtaining evidence...

609
00:37:01.094 --> 00:37:02.355
what you call "minor"?

610
00:37:04.424 --> 00:37:07.395
Your Honor. This is irrelevant to the case.

611
00:37:08.395 --> 00:37:10.304
Get to your point, counsel.

612
00:37:11.234 --> 00:37:12.404
Yes, Your Honor.

613
00:37:16.034 --> 00:37:19.745
This witness was a prosecutor who did...

614
00:37:19.944 --> 00:37:23.015
anything in order to win her cases.

615
00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:27.484
Why did such a witness not submit...

616
00:37:27.484 --> 00:37:30.085
the most conclusive evidence for her trial,

617
00:37:30.525 --> 00:37:32.254
the actual video?

618
00:37:33.355 --> 00:37:36.395
Is there a special circumstance...

619
00:37:36.424 --> 00:37:39.295
surrounding why you can't submit it?

620
00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:42.835
A special circumstance?

621
00:37:43.765 --> 00:37:47.304
Like there was no video, or...

622
00:37:48.335 --> 00:37:52.105
the video is useless as evidence.

623
00:37:59.915 --> 00:38:01.784
I have an app on the tablet...

624
00:38:01.784 --> 00:38:04.054
that deletes the videos after a set time.

625
00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:05.784
Prosecution.

626
00:38:06.824 --> 00:38:08.924
Didn't you say you'd submit...

627
00:38:09.054 --> 00:38:11.065
the video into evidence?

628
00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:13.424
Yes.

629
00:38:16.864 --> 00:38:18.134
But...

630
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.734
Maybe there really isn't a video.

631
00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:24.275
- No way. - There's no video?

632
00:38:27.444 --> 00:38:31.015
You're acting like a video exists...

633
00:38:31.284 --> 00:38:33.855
when it does not, to corner the accused.

634
00:38:34.384 --> 00:38:36.714
Please answer my question.

635
00:38:52.034 --> 00:38:53.165
Your Honor.

636
00:38:53.674 --> 00:38:56.105
We submit into evidence the video...

637
00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.074
of the victim.

638
00:39:18.765 --> 00:39:20.835
- Finally. I found it. - Give it back.

639
00:39:20.935 --> 00:39:22.395
Do you think I will?

640
00:39:26.404 --> 00:39:27.534
Look.

641
00:39:28.034 --> 00:39:30.944
I had my reasons for hiding it.

642
00:39:31.004 --> 00:39:33.745
- You call that an excuse? - Seriously.

643
00:39:33.915 --> 00:39:35.475
Explain then.

644
00:39:36.614 --> 00:39:39.484
Do you know what app Kim Sang Gyoon installed?

645
00:39:40.554 --> 00:39:42.455
A video deletion app.

646
00:39:43.154 --> 00:39:46.154
Like systems that delete files after some time.

647
00:39:47.654 --> 00:39:50.424
The video's gone? Is that why you didn't submit it?

648
00:39:53.525 --> 00:39:54.594
Beep beep.

649
00:39:59.335 --> 00:40:02.475
I thought about Song Ga Young's case,

650
00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:05.145
and he's a pro at eliminating evidence.

651
00:40:05.205 --> 00:40:07.674
He wouldn't have saved my video nicely.

652
00:40:09.714 --> 00:40:12.145
So I saved it after checking the video,

653
00:40:12.284 --> 00:40:14.254
and the next day, it had been deleted.

654
00:40:14.384 --> 00:40:16.714
- Why didn't you tell... - We should use it.

655
00:40:17.054 --> 00:40:19.384
Let them think we don't have the evidence,

656
00:40:19.384 --> 00:40:20.795
and then at the trial, I'll blow it up.

657
00:40:21.924 --> 00:40:24.995
Like the Zodiac Killer with his mail bombs.

658
00:40:25.295 --> 00:40:26.464
That's why.

659
00:40:27.495 --> 00:40:30.165
Mail bombs were the Unabomber.

660
00:40:32.404 --> 00:40:34.904
Regardless, I'm saying I had big things in mind.

661
00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:22.355
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

662
00:41:28.525 --> 00:41:30.995
I am a prosecutor.

663
00:41:33.464 --> 00:41:36.165
I've prosecuted numerous cases,

664
00:41:37.634 --> 00:41:40.634
and thought only about how to prove the crime,

665
00:41:40.775 --> 00:41:44.504
and how to maximize the punishment.

666
00:41:46.245 --> 00:41:47.344
At times,

667
00:41:48.875 --> 00:41:50.915
I didn't consider...

668
00:41:52.515 --> 00:41:54.355
the victim's pain.

669
00:41:57.185 --> 00:42:00.995
Now that I'm here as a victim myself,

670
00:42:03.694 --> 00:42:04.765
I think...

671
00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:09.464
I can understand the pain for the first time.

672
00:42:12.804 --> 00:42:14.605
I showed the video, which may follow me...

673
00:42:15.875 --> 00:42:18.404
and humiliate me for the rest of my life,

674
00:42:19.844 --> 00:42:21.114
as a penance...

675
00:42:21.844 --> 00:42:24.784
to the victims who may have been hurt...

676
00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:27.384
by the person...

677
00:42:30.015 --> 00:42:32.324
I used to be and what I did in the past.

678
00:42:36.054 --> 00:42:37.964
Thus Your Honor,

679
00:42:39.194 --> 00:42:41.895
please severely punish that defendant...

680
00:42:42.395 --> 00:42:44.205
who still doesn't repent.

681
00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:54.714
Did you mean what you said?

682
00:42:56.174 --> 00:42:58.585
- What? - That you did it...

683
00:42:58.585 --> 00:43:00.754
as a means to apologize to victims you hurt.

684
00:43:04.225 --> 00:43:06.054
Weren't you a psychiatrist?

685
00:43:07.654 --> 00:43:08.725
I was.

686
00:43:08.824 --> 00:43:10.364
Do people change?

687
00:43:14.435 --> 00:43:16.495
- No. - Exactly.

688
00:43:26.574 --> 00:43:29.074
What's with that gross smile?

689
00:43:36.154 --> 00:43:39.784
Chairman Ahn is whining, demanding a lawyer.

690
00:43:39.855 --> 00:43:42.594
Bring me that female prosecutor...

691
00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:43.964
once her trial ends.

692
00:43:48.234 --> 00:43:49.265
Hello?

693
00:43:52.435 --> 00:43:54.674
I see. Okay.

694
00:43:55.205 --> 00:43:56.574
The verdict's out?

695
00:43:57.275 --> 00:43:58.344
Let's go in.

696
00:44:23.904 --> 00:44:27.034
(Yeo Jin Wook)

697
00:44:30.705 --> 00:44:31.745
Excuse me.

698
00:44:32.344 --> 00:44:34.245
Please find out where this woman lives.

699
00:44:45.284 --> 00:44:49.594
Defendant has committed the same crime repeatedly,

700
00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:53.495
destroyed evidence and obstructed justice,

701
00:44:53.495 --> 00:44:54.765
and...

702
00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:58.065
considering this is his first offense,

703
00:44:58.404 --> 00:44:59.835
the verdict is as follows.

704
00:45:00.234 --> 00:45:01.304
Defendant...

705
00:45:01.734 --> 00:45:04.804
is sentenced to three years in prison.

706
00:45:34.674 --> 00:45:36.634
Great work, everyone.

707
00:45:37.004 --> 00:45:40.045
Especially you, Ma. You did great.

708
00:45:41.315 --> 00:45:42.915
Shouldn't we go out...

709
00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:44.815
to celebrate on a day like this?

710
00:45:44.815 --> 00:45:46.085
- Really? - Really?

711
00:45:46.714 --> 00:45:48.654
I feel like drinking alone.

712
00:45:51.154 --> 00:45:52.625
Maybe next time.

713
00:45:54.225 --> 00:45:57.194
As expected. She's so consistent.

714
00:46:04.634 --> 00:46:06.265
Then maybe we should...

715
00:46:06.265 --> 00:46:07.804
I'm tired too.

716
00:46:07.804 --> 00:46:09.074
Let's go home.

717
00:46:09.074 --> 00:46:10.745
- Yes, ma'am. - Good night.

718
00:46:13.745 --> 00:46:15.545
You two are in, right?

719
00:46:16.074 --> 00:46:18.114
I'll find a good place.

720
00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:24.025
Which do you prefer, soju or beer?

721
00:47:05.094 --> 00:47:06.094
What's this?

722
00:47:21.174 --> 00:47:22.714
Seriously.

723
00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:55.045
I've lost my mind.

724
00:48:12.565 --> 00:48:13.895
I can't do this.

725
00:48:46.495 --> 00:48:48.065
Banks charge 12 percent,

726
00:48:48.065 --> 00:48:51.534
but we charge as little as 3.7 percent interest.

727
00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:53.065
Why don't you...

728
00:48:53.065 --> 00:48:56.504
switch over and lock in the low interest rate?

729
00:48:56.504 --> 00:48:57.875
Thank you.

730
00:48:57.875 --> 00:48:59.944
Because you see,

731
00:48:59.944 --> 00:49:05.145
I was very... Very lonely today.

732
00:49:05.214 --> 00:49:08.455
Do you know how hard it was? I drank...

733
00:49:09.185 --> 00:49:11.384
eight cans of beer.

734
00:49:12.284 --> 00:49:13.795
But it's stuck here...

735
00:49:13.795 --> 00:49:15.594
and won't go down.

736
00:49:18.424 --> 00:49:19.625
There it goes.

737
00:49:19.924 --> 00:49:21.364
Hello?

738
00:49:21.634 --> 00:49:22.665
Hello?

739
00:49:25.364 --> 00:49:27.404
I didn't say you could sit.

740
00:49:27.634 --> 00:49:29.435
You said you were lonely and had a tough day.

741
00:49:30.205 --> 00:49:31.344
When did he...

742
00:49:33.714 --> 00:49:35.645
Did you bug this place?

743
00:49:36.775 --> 00:49:40.214
There's just so much drunkenness I can take.

744
00:49:40.515 --> 00:49:43.085
Come on. Sit down.

745
00:49:43.585 --> 00:49:45.324
I have patience for everything,

746
00:49:45.324 --> 00:49:47.455
but not drunken stupidity.

747
00:49:47.455 --> 00:49:50.125
I said to sit down.

748
00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:54.094
I'll give you a good mental training today.

749
00:49:54.094 --> 00:49:56.435
Want to sleep at my place tonight?

750
00:49:56.895 --> 00:49:57.904
What?

751
00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:00.674
Sleep with you?

752
00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:07.745
Ms. Ma.

753
00:50:08.214 --> 00:50:10.515
I'll say it once, so try to understand.

754
00:50:10.884 --> 00:50:12.714
If you don't want to sleep where there were cameras,

755
00:50:12.714 --> 00:50:14.214
you can crash at my place for the night.

756
00:50:14.214 --> 00:50:15.855
There's no need to misunderstand.

757
00:50:16.855 --> 00:50:18.225
Consider it...

758
00:50:18.225 --> 00:50:20.594
the prosecutor providing damage support.

759
00:50:21.424 --> 00:50:25.165
Yeo, you little punk.

760
00:50:26.324 --> 00:50:28.265
You liked me.

761
00:50:30.835 --> 00:50:33.004
Sure. I'll go now.

762
00:50:33.004 --> 00:50:34.705
Sit down.

763
00:50:35.375 --> 00:50:36.804
Just kidding.

764
00:50:37.045 --> 00:50:39.275
Don't get so angry. It's humiliating.

765
00:50:49.815 --> 00:50:50.884
Oh my gosh.

766
00:50:52.225 --> 00:50:53.355
Awesome.

767
00:50:53.694 --> 00:50:55.795
This place is so clean.

768
00:50:56.125 --> 00:50:59.895
Wow. Look at the lighting. Gosh.

769
00:51:01.995 --> 00:51:03.565
Nice. Metal.

770
00:51:05.864 --> 00:51:08.935
A recliner. Nice.

771
00:51:11.904 --> 00:51:14.515
You must come from a rich family.

772
00:51:15.645 --> 00:51:18.045
I put on fresh sheets and pillowcases,

773
00:51:18.585 --> 00:51:20.484
so sleep here tonight.

774
00:51:20.484 --> 00:51:21.714
I'll sleep...

775
00:51:21.714 --> 00:51:23.754
at your place and go to work from...

776
00:51:34.065 --> 00:51:35.134
Gosh.

777
00:52:02.654 --> 00:52:03.924
They're like...

778
00:52:04.364 --> 00:52:06.995
newborns who can't control when and where...

779
00:52:06.995 --> 00:52:08.265
they poop.

780
00:52:10.134 --> 00:52:11.134
Was this...

781
00:52:11.734 --> 00:52:13.504
Min Ji Sook's work?

782
00:52:14.574 --> 00:52:15.674
I'll look into it.

783
00:52:17.475 --> 00:52:18.574
Forget it.

784
00:52:20.074 --> 00:52:21.614
What about that prosecutor?

785
00:52:25.315 --> 00:52:26.884
I looked into her,

786
00:52:27.114 --> 00:52:28.284
and Ma Yi Deum...

787
00:52:28.455 --> 00:52:29.955
is Kwak Young Shil's daughter.

788
00:52:34.324 --> 00:52:35.395
What?

789
00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:42.665
Kwak Young Shil's daughter...

790
00:52:43.495 --> 00:52:45.904
became a prosecutor, is that it?

791
00:52:50.174 --> 00:52:52.074
How interesting.

792
00:52:52.545 --> 00:52:53.815
That isn't all.

793
00:52:54.275 --> 00:52:56.145
The male prosecutor in the department...

794
00:52:57.015 --> 00:52:58.145
is the son...

795
00:52:58.815 --> 00:52:59.884
of Ko Jae Sook.

796
00:53:01.714 --> 00:53:03.054
Ko Jae Sook?

797
00:53:29.174 --> 00:53:30.344
How the...

798
00:53:36.415 --> 00:53:38.054
How can I sleep here?

799
00:53:39.355 --> 00:53:40.995
I've lost my mind.

800
00:53:50.904 --> 00:53:53.265
(Mom)

801
00:53:55.234 --> 00:53:56.234
Darn it.

802
00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:03.114
Here.

803
00:54:03.475 --> 00:54:05.045
- Thank you. - Thank you.

804
00:54:05.045 --> 00:54:06.444
Thank you.

805
00:54:08.315 --> 00:54:09.355
Son.

806
00:54:10.114 --> 00:54:11.725
You're not home. Where are you?

807
00:54:11.725 --> 00:54:12.784
Hi.

808
00:54:13.225 --> 00:54:14.295
I...

809
00:54:14.895 --> 00:54:17.625
I'm at a friend's place.

810
00:54:18.025 --> 00:54:19.324
That's suspicious.

811
00:54:19.665 --> 00:54:20.964
A girlfriend's place?

812
00:54:21.895 --> 00:54:23.295
What do you mean?

813
00:54:23.295 --> 00:54:24.904
I don't have a girlfriend.

814
00:54:24.964 --> 00:54:26.705
What is it? I'm tired.

815
00:54:27.605 --> 00:54:28.674
Brat.

816
00:54:29.074 --> 00:54:32.004
I sent my housekeeper to your place earlier,

817
00:54:32.004 --> 00:54:34.844
and she said she forgot to plug the fridge in.

818
00:54:35.844 --> 00:54:36.844
But...

819
00:54:37.315 --> 00:54:40.315
Why did she do that?

820
00:55:02.875 --> 00:55:03.975
Mom.

821
00:55:05.275 --> 00:55:07.245
Why were you sleeping so much?

822
00:55:07.574 --> 00:55:09.574
You'll sleep all you want once you die.

823
00:55:13.754 --> 00:55:15.085
It's been a while since you came.

824
00:55:15.415 --> 00:55:18.324
Okay. Come here and taste this.

825
00:55:18.324 --> 00:55:20.154
No, stay still.

826
00:55:20.424 --> 00:55:22.295
This way, I can see you for longer.

827
00:55:22.795 --> 00:55:24.025
What do you mean?

828
00:55:32.004 --> 00:55:34.034
You came because it's my birthday.

829
00:55:34.574 --> 00:55:36.034
Of course.

830
00:55:36.904 --> 00:55:39.275
Who else would celebrate the birthday...

831
00:55:39.344 --> 00:55:41.174
of someone so mean?

832
00:55:42.415 --> 00:55:45.315
I thought of you a lot today.

833
00:56:01.734 --> 00:56:02.835
Mom.

834
00:56:08.975 --> 00:56:10.134
Mom.

835
00:56:16.444 --> 00:56:18.415
Eat up. I have to go to the market.

836
00:56:18.784 --> 00:56:20.955
Mom. Stay a little longer.

837
00:56:20.955 --> 00:56:23.085
I have to buy anchovies for the broth...

838
00:56:23.085 --> 00:56:24.585
- and we're out of radish. - Mom.

839
00:56:24.855 --> 00:56:26.284
Stay a little longer.

840
00:56:50.384 --> 00:56:51.844
Are you sick,

841
00:56:53.085 --> 00:56:54.415
my stupid girl?

842
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:01.754
Mom.

843
00:57:15.134 --> 00:57:16.574
Mom.

844
00:57:26.145 --> 00:57:27.484
Mom.

845
00:57:34.955 --> 00:57:36.625
Mom.

846
00:57:38.525 --> 00:57:40.734
Mom.

847
00:58:56.404 --> 00:58:59.074
(Witch's Court)

848
00:58:59.205 --> 00:59:00.745
I guess elections really are scary.

00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:04.245
It's up to you to decide whether or not to accept.

850
00:59:04.585 --> 00:59:06.484
He said there was a woman that he loved...

851
00:59:06.484 --> 00:59:08.154
and that her mother was very against it.

852
00:59:08.284 --> 00:59:09.585
I'll take this case.

853
00:59:09.884 --> 00:59:11.725
- Why are you here? - Sir.

854
00:59:11.725 --> 00:59:14.525
The adults did the wrong, but the kid pays for it.

855
00:59:14.525 --> 00:59:18.094
If your family is a child molester, you must resign!

856
00:59:18.094 --> 00:59:19.665
Your son won't find out, will he?

857
00:59:19.665 --> 00:59:21.594
Nothing happened 14 years ago.

858
00:59:21.634 --> 00:59:23.665
Please help me.
