Let's go and collect money.

9
00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:51.471
I heard this cafe serves delicious coffee.

10
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:52.639
Hey, hey.

11
00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:55.909

You can't run a cafe without us.

15
00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:05.051
Where is the owner? Hey, where is the owner?

16
00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:06.986
(She is the owner of the cafe who agreed to the shoot.)

17
00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:08.121
Are you the owner?

18

The owner of this cafe looks feisty.

(Maybe we should stop, So Min.)

21
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.632
She looks aggressive.

22
00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:22.702
The owner of the cafe seems to be older than us.

23
00:01:22.702 --> 00:01:24.304
(The owner of the cafe bursts out laughing.)

- Talk to her. - Okay.

28

I didn't bring money.

All right, President Kim.

36
00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:50.263
- I didn't bring money. - That's not how you should work.

37

- He is a man who looks out for us. - I see. A detective on our side.

49
00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.074
I told you to lay low.

50

- You did. - Why won't you listen?

51

Why are you creating so much noise?

52

Say something.

58

- Did you pop a pimple? - Yes.

64

Do you have folliculitis? Do you have face mites?

65
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.235
- I couldn't pop it all the way. - Really?

66

- You didn't watch it. - No, I didn't.

73
00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:18.084
You should have watched it.

74

- Who do you think you are? - Hello.

75

All right.

77

Pay for the coffee.

79

May I pay with my watch?

80
00:03:27.293 --> 00:03:28.294
Pay with your watch.

81
00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:30.797
- Pay with your watch. - She didn't watch the movie.

82
00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:32.098
- Take off your watch. - She didn't watch the movie.

83

Let's wait for the coffee.

84

Why are you so intimidated? Say something.

85
00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:37.136
- Ha Ro Ro. - Hey.

86
00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:39.806
I am sorry, but bring us the coffee when it comes out.

87

Bring us coffee when it comes out.

88

How dare you order me around?

89

- She didn't watch the movie. - You folliculitis!

90
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:47.380
She didn't watch "The Outlaws".

91
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.615
How dare you order me around?

92
00:03:48.615 --> 00:03:50.850
I don't have to act according to my character, right?

93

(He pulls out his gun in a childish way.)

94
00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:54.988
- Come on, Ha Ro Ro. - You didn't watch the movie.

95
00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:58.358
- Shoot me! - Don't be ridiculous.

96
00:03:58.358 --> 00:03:59.559
This is getting out of hand.

97
00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.561
You can't treat her like this. Shoot me instead.

98
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:03.396
This is upsetting. We gave you so much money.

99
00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:04.697
- I understand that but... - Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:05.765
- You are doing well. - This is upsetting.

101
00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:07.166
- You are doing well. - This is "The Outlaws".

102
00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:08.301
- You can't treat her like this. - Come on.

103
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:09.869
Don't confuse it with another movie.

104
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:13.540
- You are doing well. - Impressive!

105
00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:15.542
- For goodness' sake. - This is "The Outlaws".

106
00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:16.576
Impressive!

107
00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:18.044
- You are confusing the movie. - We are not in Busan.

108
00:04:18.044 --> 00:04:20.046
This isn't "Nameless Gangster: Rules of Time".

109
00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:22.048
We are in Yanbian. Get it right.

110
00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:24.551
I doubt the production crew will use more of this bit.

111
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.952
- Bring us coffee. - Bring us coffee.

112
00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:27.820
Folliculitis!

113
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.988
"Folliculitis"?

114
00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:30.623
(A bigger crisis heads their way.)

115
00:04:31.558 --> 00:04:32.625
That's right.

116
00:04:32.692 --> 00:04:34.260
For goodness' sake.

117
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:35.562
(It looks like...)

118
00:04:35.562 --> 00:04:36.629
This is nice.

119
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.064
It seems like they will make a grand entrance.

120
00:04:38.064 --> 00:04:39.132
(Where are the remaining three?)

121
00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.367
Where are they?

122

(Where are the weaklings?)

123
00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:44.237
What? What?

124
00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:46.372
Who is that?

125
00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:48.241
- What? What? - It's exactly like the movie.

126
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:49.309
(They back away.)

127
00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:55.315
What are you filming?

128
00:04:55.615 --> 00:04:58.818
(The representative gang for the unlucky, Yuchen Gang)

129
00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:01.554
Did you come alone?

130
00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:04.490
(Head of Yuchen Gang, Yu Chen)

131
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:05.758
All right.

(Yuchen Gang's Underboss, Wi Kwang Rak)

133

(Just another member of Yuchen Gang, Nose Tae)

134
00:05:14.634 --> 00:05:18.237
(Are you watching this, the police and Mungdol Gang?)

135
00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:20.873
Did you come alone?

136
00:05:20.873 --> 00:05:22.008
(Kwon Ryul)

137
00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:23.076
Do you have company?

138
00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:25.311
- Did you eat? - Not yet.

139
00:05:25.378 --> 00:05:26.946
Then why are you so fat?

140
00:05:28.114 --> 00:05:30.683
(They are known to attack with facts.)

141
00:05:31.317 --> 00:05:32.385
Did you come alone?

142
00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:33.419
It's exactly like the movie.

143
00:05:34.187 --> 00:05:35.321
No way.

144
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:36.322
(Their costumes are high-quality.)

145
00:05:36.322 --> 00:05:38.324
- They look really scary. - Did you come alone?

146
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:39.692
It must have been hard to get made up.

147
00:05:40.193 --> 00:05:41.761
Isn't he Hwang Jung Min?

148
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:44.430
- This is "The Wailing". - "The Wailing".

149
00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:45.999
This is "The Wailing".

150
00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.800
Please act like Young Gu.

151
00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:49.435
(He looks like Young Gu.)

152
00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:50.670
I am sorry,

153
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.372
but he is Lim Ha Ryong.

154
00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.675
He looks like Lim Ha Ryong.

155
00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:56.676
- He looks like Lim Ha Ryong. - He does.

156
00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:57.810
- He looks like Lim Ha Ryong. - Seriously.

157

"I am too old for this."

158
00:05:59.512 --> 00:06:01.381
- "I am too old for this." - My goodness.

159
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:03.683
Kwang Soo looks exactly like the character in the movie.

160
00:06:03.683 --> 00:06:06.252
Kwang Soo's makeup took forever.

161
00:06:06.552 --> 00:06:08.187
It must have been hard to get that makeup done.

162
00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:10.056
Let's not make any comment on it.

163
00:06:10.256 --> 00:06:11.858
- Why not? - "Why not?"

164
00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:14.360
- Make fun of me. - Let's leave him be.

165
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.561
It took an hour and a half.

166
00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:17.630
He is Krillin.

167
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.134
- Do you think it's summer? - What?

168
00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:23.369
Are you a physical education teacher?

169
00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:24.504
Let's give a powerful performance.

170
00:06:24.504 --> 00:06:26.072
- Do you know who we are? - What?

171
00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:27.507
Do you know who we are?

172
00:06:27.507 --> 00:06:28.574
Who are you?

173
00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:30.076
The fight is on.

174
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.511
What did you say?

175
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:33.312
- Who are you? - He looks strong.

176
00:06:33.446 --> 00:06:34.881
For goodness' sake.

177
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.115
Who are you?

178
00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:37.383
(Pushing)

179
00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:40.453
(He falls backwards.)

180
00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:42.121
What do you think you are doing?

181
00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:43.322
Nose Tae.

182
00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:44.490
A staff member shouldn't interfere.

183
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.925
Go away.

184
00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:46.926
Come on.

185
00:06:46.926 --> 00:06:47.994
(Young Gu doesn't understand the situation.)

186
00:06:48.194 --> 00:06:49.696
- He looks exactly like Young Gu. - Don't touch him.

187
00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:53.266
What is this?

188
00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:54.500
Do you want to get slapped?

189
00:06:55.568 --> 00:06:56.703
- Please stop. - Seok Jin,

190
00:06:56.703 --> 00:06:58.871
- your performance is too much. - Please stop.

191
00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:00.707
You have never been in a comedy skit, right?

192
00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:02.375
He has never been in a comedy skit.

193
00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:04.877
I haven't been in a lot of them.

194
00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:08.381
What kind of a dialect is that?

195
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:09.615
For goodness' sake.

196
00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:11.184
- What kind of a dialect is that? - He just sounds cute.

197
00:07:11.184 --> 00:07:13.453
- Do you know who I am? - I haven't been in a lot of them.

198
00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:16.622
The race, City of Crime,

199
00:07:16.989 --> 00:07:20.760
is not about getting a penalty, but about winning prize money.

200
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.764
(City of Crime)

201
00:07:24.764 --> 00:07:26.499
It's in a long time.

202
00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:28.134
- It's about prize money? - I see.

203
00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:30.436
The winning gang in each mission...

204
00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:34.307
will be given working capital to their digital moneybox.

205
00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:38.611
Only one member of the gang with the most amount of capital...

206
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:42.181
will engross the money in the end.

207
00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:44.383
- Only one? - So only one will take the money.

208
00:07:44.383 --> 00:07:46.319
- It's an individual game. - That's right.

209
00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.121
Each gang will have a boss as well.

210
00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:53.359
Your bosses will be among the three guests who will join us later.

211
00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:54.694
- We have guests? - We have guests.

212
00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:55.695
- Three guests. - Is that right?

213
00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:56.796
I didn't know.

214
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.366
I hope we don't have any female guests today.

215
00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:01.367
Please.

216
00:08:01.868 --> 00:08:02.935
- Please. - I hope.

217
00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:04.237
- I hope they're male guests. - Who are they?

218
00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:06.239
- What? - This song's from "The Godfather".

219
00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:07.874
- "The Godfather". - Maybe it's Lim Ha Ryong.

220
00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:09.008
- Really? - "The Godfather".

221
00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:11.878
(Who's the first guest to come out along with this music?)

222
00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:14.447
- Gosh. - Noh Sa Yeon.

223
00:08:14.881 --> 00:08:16.115
Sa Yeon.

224
00:08:16.549 --> 00:08:18.618
- Sa Yeon. - Hi.

225
00:08:18.618 --> 00:08:20.319
- Are you here alone? - Yes.

226
00:08:20.953 --> 00:08:22.121
- Gosh. - Hi, Sa Yeon.

227
00:08:22.755 --> 00:08:24.190
- Hello. - Hi.

228
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.324
Sa Yeon.

229
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:27.126
(The godmother intimidates the members as soon as she joins.)

230
00:08:27.126 --> 00:08:29.061
- Hello. - Ms. Tuna.

231
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:30.062
(Oh, right.)

232
00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:33.432
She had a bad experience during her last appearance.

233
00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:36.803
(Sa Yeon came out on the Princess Special in July 15, 2012.)

234
00:08:36.803 --> 00:08:40.072
(Her butler, Kwang Soo, was too weak to serve her right.)

235
00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:42.809
It looks like you're fishing her out of a net.

236
00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:44.911
(She was as energetic as a tuna.)

237
00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:46.979
You think she's a tuna or something?

238
00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:48.447
(And so became her nickname, Ms. Tuna.)

239
00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:50.983
- Your outfit today... - Mackerel.

240
00:08:50.983 --> 00:08:52.051
reminds me of a mackerel.

241
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:53.719
It's blue like a mackerel.

242
00:08:53.786 --> 00:08:56.155
- Let's call her Ms. Mackerel today. - Goodness.

243
00:08:56.189 --> 00:08:57.657
- Blue mackerel. - Mackerel.

244
00:08:57.657 --> 00:08:59.926
- She's our guest for today. - It goes perfect for the special.

245
00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:02.395
- Sa Yeon, you're... - Kwang Soo?

246
00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:04.297
- Well... - She burst out laughing.

247
00:09:04.297 --> 00:09:06.666
- I'm losing my confidence. - Enjoy.

248
00:09:06.732 --> 00:09:08.935
- Feel free to laugh at him. - I feel so timid and shy.

249
00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:13.840
Sa Yeon is here with us as our first boss today.

250
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.775
- Welcome, Sa Yeon. - Thank you.

251
00:09:15.775 --> 00:09:17.443
- Let's bring in our next boss. - Okay.

252
00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:19.545
(Who's the second boss?)

253
00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:21.347
- What's this? - Is this "Wonder Woman"?

254
00:09:21.347 --> 00:09:22.448
It's "Superman".

255
00:09:22.448 --> 00:09:24.684
(The next boss comes out with the song from "The Smurfs".)

256
00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:27.787
Goodness, it's Ha Yeon Soo.

257
00:09:27.787 --> 00:09:29.288
(She's the smile captain, Ha Yeon Soo.)

258
00:09:29.822 --> 00:09:31.190
- Hello. - Goodness.

259
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.925
- It's you, Yeon Soo. - Hello.

260
00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:35.127
- Hello. - Long time no see.

261
00:09:35.127 --> 00:09:37.296
- Hello. - It's so good to see you.

262
00:09:37.296 --> 00:09:38.931
- Hello. - Hi.

263
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:40.433
(He's flustered to see Yeon Soo.)

264
00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:41.801
- She's like a doll. - How...

265
00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:44.437
- She hasn't changed a bit. - Kwang Soo...

266
00:09:44.437 --> 00:09:46.572
What should he do?

267
00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:50.176
How have you been, Yeon Soo?

268
00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:51.210
(Stepping away)

269
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.179
- Goodness. - How have you been?

270
00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:54.647
(I've changed a lot, haven't I?)

271
00:09:54.647 --> 00:09:56.549
- Kwang Soo. - My goodness.

272
00:09:56.816 --> 00:09:58.784
- I missed you. - Wear this.

273
00:09:58.784 --> 00:10:00.353
That'll make it weirder.

274
00:10:00.353 --> 00:10:02.788
- Wear this. - What should he do?

275
00:10:02.822 --> 00:10:04.390
Her face is so small.

276
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.925
- It's so small. - It's unbelievable.

277
00:10:05.925 --> 00:10:08.794
If you want to get along with me, you better stand 1m ahead.

278
00:10:08.794 --> 00:10:10.796
Okay.

279
00:10:10.796 --> 00:10:12.164
Now, they look the same size.

280
00:10:12.164 --> 00:10:14.467
- Let me see. - Does it seem all right?

281
00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:15.902
Your face is still a bit bigger.

282
00:10:15.902 --> 00:10:17.069
(Sa Yeon's face is still bigger.)

283
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:18.437
- What? - Step back a little more.

284
00:10:18.437 --> 00:10:20.139
- There you go. - It's done.

285
00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.141
- It's done. - This will do it.

286
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:23.676
- Good. - Goodness.

287
00:10:23.676 --> 00:10:26.045
Yeon Soo's so cruel. She really stands in the front.

288
00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:29.949
I'm so glad to have her with us.

289
00:10:30.349 --> 00:10:33.552
All right. Let's see who's our third boss.

290
00:10:33.552 --> 00:10:35.688
- We have one more? - Kwang Soo...

291
00:10:35.688 --> 00:10:37.323
Please come on out.

292
00:10:37.323 --> 00:10:40.326
(Who's their third boss?)

293
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.962
- What? - What?

294
00:10:42.962 --> 00:10:44.196
Is it Kang Daniel?

295
00:10:45.097 --> 00:10:46.098
It must be Wanna One.

296
00:10:46.098 --> 00:10:47.700
(Wanna One's "Pick Me" gets played.)

297
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.437
(They mentioned his name many times, but he hasn't come out yet.)

298
00:10:51.437 --> 00:10:54.440
(Is it the trendy idol group Wanna One's Kang Daniel?)

299
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.342
(You've waited for so long.)

300
00:10:58.911 --> 00:11:00.846
What's this?

301
00:11:00.846 --> 00:11:03.316
(They had false hope.)

302
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.185
Why are you here again?

303
00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:07.853
(Call him Cho Daniel.)

304
00:11:07.853 --> 00:11:09.789
He should've at least changed the opening song.

305
00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:11.791
He comes out too often.

306
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:13.559
(Sae Ho, you aren't the one we've waited for.)

307
00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:14.560
Goodbye.

308
00:11:15.928 --> 00:11:18.798
- Goodness, Sae Ho. - Do I get in the car?

309
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:21.300
- Yes. - In this car?

310
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.102
I'm sorry, but this isn't my car.

311
00:11:23.102 --> 00:11:25.571
Really? Don't worry. He'll give you a ride.

312
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:26.939
Please go home.

313
00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:28.274
- Bye. - Sorry.

314
00:11:28.274 --> 00:11:30.443
- I won't see you off. - You've gotten a makeover.

315
00:11:30.443 --> 00:11:31.811
- Yes. - Bye.

316
00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:33.679
- Good job for today. - He got the wrong schedule.

317
00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:35.348
- Bye. - He gave us a big impact though.

318
00:11:35.348 --> 00:11:37.950
- That was short but thick. - I'd just go home if I were him.

319
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.186
- It's not good for him either. - Good job.

320
00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:42.088
It hasn't been long since he last appeared.

321
00:11:42.088 --> 00:11:44.924
- And the song was the same. - We're fed up with it.

322
00:11:44.924 --> 00:11:45.925
Right.

323
00:11:45.925 --> 00:11:48.194
(It should be okay to go again now.)

324
00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:49.562
- He comes too often. - I know.

325
00:11:49.562 --> 00:11:51.564
- He's here again. - He came out not long ago.

326
00:11:51.664 --> 00:11:53.566
The driver... What?

327
00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:54.567
Try it.

328
00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:56.769
(The crew members give him another chance to dance.)

329
00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:58.037
There he goes again.

330
00:11:58.537 --> 00:11:59.705
Sae Ho's dance is always entertaining.

331
00:11:59.705 --> 00:12:00.706
(Let me show you how I dance.)

332
00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:06.178
(Let's dance together, Sae Ho.)

333
00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:08.647
Let's dance together.

334
00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:10.783
I'm doing this for your sake.

335
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.419
- Please welcome, Sae Ho. - Hello.

336
00:12:14.153 --> 00:12:15.221
- Sae Ho never lets us down. - Come this way.

337
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:16.389
- He never lets us down. - Hello.

338
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:20.526
Sae Ho is with us as our guest for today.

339
00:12:21.327 --> 00:12:24.163
- He's not talking. - Is he a streetlamp or what?

340
00:12:24.463 --> 00:12:26.298
- Goodness. - He's so reserved today.

341
00:12:26.298 --> 00:12:30.770
- Kwang Soo. - You know, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

342
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.271
- What are you talking about? - Abdul-Jabbar.

343
00:12:32.271 --> 00:12:34.140
- He looks like him. - Goodness.

344
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.675
No, he looks like Squidward from "Spongebob Squarepants".

345
00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:37.843
What do you mean?

346
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.645
(Kwang Soo just looks funny.)

347
00:12:39.645 --> 00:12:42.314
All right, let's bring in...

348
00:12:42.548 --> 00:12:44.683
- our next guest. - We have another guest?

349
00:12:44.683 --> 00:12:46.185
- What? - There's one more?

350
00:12:46.352 --> 00:12:47.353
Please come out.

351
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:50.689
What?

352
00:12:50.689 --> 00:12:52.091
Will it be Nam Chang Hee?

353
00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:53.659
Nam Chang Hee?

354
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.295
Right, it's about time he joined us.

355
00:12:57.063 --> 00:12:58.197
Who is it?

356
00:12:58.197 --> 00:12:59.698
Right, it's about time he joined us.

357
00:13:01.934 --> 00:13:03.669
(Their eyes open wide.)

358
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.906
(Who's the fourth guest?)

359
00:13:08.541 --> 00:13:11.677
(He's Wanna One's Kang Daniel.)

360
00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:14.280
(Daniel is really here!)

361
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.182
- Really? - Goodness.

362
00:13:16.182 --> 00:13:17.850
- He's here. - Goodness.

363
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.351
- Daniel! - Goodness.

364
00:13:19.351 --> 00:13:20.820
- Daniel. - Hi.

365
00:13:20.853 --> 00:13:22.088
Daniel.

366
00:13:23.022 --> 00:13:25.524
(The trendy star is finally on Running Man.)

367
00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:28.194
- Hello. - It's really Kang Daniel.

368
00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:29.428
(He's the real star among the ladies.)

369
00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:30.563
Daniel.

370
00:13:32.098 --> 00:13:33.933
- Daniel. - He's so handsome.

371
00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:35.968
- He's cute. - Goodness.

372
00:13:35.968 --> 00:13:37.703
- Daniel. - Gosh.

373
00:13:37.703 --> 00:13:39.972
- Gosh. - Come to the middle.

374
00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:42.141
- I'm sorry, - Daniel.

375
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.577
- but why are you blushing? - I was so surprised.

376
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:47.546
So many people are gathered here.

377
00:13:47.813 --> 00:13:50.349
- They aren't usually like this. - They're hurting my feelings.

378
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:54.353
This is upsetting. I mean, we're well aware that they like Daniel.

379
00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:56.655
- It's all right. - Of course.

380
00:13:56.655 --> 00:13:59.458
But when we do our opening, they usually...

381
00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:01.527
- I know, they pick their noses. - You're right.

382
00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:04.396
Some of them look very unfamiliar.

383
00:14:04.697 --> 00:14:06.732
Daniel is here with us.

384
00:14:06.732 --> 00:14:08.567
- Daniel! - They're going crazy here.

385
00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:10.302
- They usually don't say much. - Right.

386
00:14:10.302 --> 00:14:11.637
Daniel!

387
00:14:11.637 --> 00:14:12.638
(All of a sudden)

388
00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:14.673
It's over.

389
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:16.909
She has her eyes on him, so you have no chance.

390
00:14:16.909 --> 00:14:18.711
- Give in. - Goodness.

391
00:14:18.711 --> 00:14:20.045
You can't go near him.

392
00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:22.715
Anyway, I should mention this.

393
00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:26.152
This year is Sa Yeon's 40th-year anniversary since her debut.

394
00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:28.287
- Really? - 40th-year anniversary.

395
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:30.422
She debuted when I was two years old.

396
00:14:30.823 --> 00:14:34.927
I'm planning to hold a dinner show at the end of this year...

397
00:14:34.927 --> 00:14:38.164
to celebrate my debut anniversary.

398
00:14:39.098 --> 00:14:41.100
- Congratulations. - Dinner show.

399
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.402
Does that mean you'll cook dinner yourself?

400
00:14:43.402 --> 00:14:45.171
Yes, I'll cook myself.

401
00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:46.405
- That's new. - Goodness.

402
00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:48.807
- I bet the dishes will be amazing. - This is...

403
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:51.677
You'll eat, and the audience will give a round of applause for that.

404
00:14:51.977 --> 00:14:53.412
- Goodness. - That's not it.

405
00:14:53.946 --> 00:14:54.947
The show will be about eating.

406
00:14:55.047 --> 00:14:57.049
"You can do it! Finish one more bowl."

407
00:14:57.049 --> 00:14:58.551
Goodness.

408
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.287
That's not it. She's planning to hold her own talk show.

409
00:15:01.287 --> 00:15:02.888
- To celebrate her anniversary. - Congratulations.

410
00:15:02.888 --> 00:15:05.057
She's our big senior in this field. She's admirable.

411
00:15:05.057 --> 00:15:06.559
- Right. - I hope...

412
00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:08.060
- Hold on. - What?

413
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.595
Will you keep being like this today, Kwang Soo?

414
00:15:10.196 --> 00:15:11.530
Will you keep being like this today, Kwang Soo?

415
00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:14.300
- Just wear this. - He doesn't talk at all.

416
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.802
- He should regain his confidence. - That makeover's too much.

417
00:15:16.802 --> 00:15:19.572
He lost a lot of confidence ever since Yeon Soo came out.

418
00:15:19.572 --> 00:15:22.074
- You should've told me before. - Goodness.

419
00:15:22.074 --> 00:15:24.043
- Kwang Soo... - I didn't know.

420
00:15:24.043 --> 00:15:25.177
Be confident.

421
00:15:25.177 --> 00:15:26.946
He lost confidence because of Yeon Soo.

422
00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:28.447
- I really didn't know. - He'd be like that all day long.

423
00:15:28.447 --> 00:15:30.416
Yeon Soo is his type.

424
00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:32.451
- She is. - Someone cute and small.

425
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:35.654
Yeon Soo gave me this look as if she was looking at an insect.

426
00:15:36.188 --> 00:15:39.925
Kwang Soo likes girls who are like Yeon Soo.

427
00:15:40.192 --> 00:15:42.695
I remember when Yeon Soo came out last time, she played...

428
00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:45.097
- that game with Jong Kook. - I remember it too.

429
00:15:45.097 --> 00:15:46.232
The kiss.

430
00:15:46.232 --> 00:15:48.467
The video clip is still on the internet.

431
00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:51.170
That video is still all over the internet.

432
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.238
So many people watched it too.

433
00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:54.340
What? Oh, that's the one.

434
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.408
- Gosh, this. - I mean...

435
00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:59.445
- Check this out. - Stop it.

436
00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:01.280
- When she came out... - It was the first time.

437
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.349
Look at Jong Kook's gums.

438
00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:06.552
- It's disgusting. - I tried not to touch her lips.

439
00:16:06.552 --> 00:16:09.321
Look. Let me clarify things for you.

440
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:11.090
This is when he played the game with Yeon Soo.

441
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.659
This is when he played the game with Sa Yeon.

442
00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:15.794
Goodness.

443
00:16:16.562 --> 00:16:19.098
- I knew it. - Goodness.

444
00:16:19.098 --> 00:16:21.033
- Why you little... - Calm down.

445
00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:22.701
- You're mistaken. - You're unbelievable.

446
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.670
He really didn't want to touch her lips.

447
00:16:24.937 --> 00:16:27.406
What scares me the most is not Jong Kook...

448
00:16:27.406 --> 00:16:28.707
but that Sa Yeon's smiling there.

449
00:16:28.707 --> 00:16:30.276
(Sa Yeon's smiling in this picture.)

450
00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:32.077
Goodness. I'm serious.

451
00:16:32.578 --> 00:16:35.147
(Haha indeed has amazing observation skills.)

452
00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:38.317
(Sa Yeon's experienced enough to keep her smile in any situation.)

453
00:16:40.085 --> 00:16:43.722
All right, let's talk briefly about you, Sae Ho.

454
00:16:43.722 --> 00:16:45.391
There's one question for you.

455
00:16:45.391 --> 00:16:48.294
"You join us once every month, so why is that?"

456
00:16:48.394 --> 00:16:50.462
(Why do you keep coming out?)

457
00:16:50.462 --> 00:16:51.830
- It's a question. - Oh, is that right?

458
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.465
- It says in the script here. - It's real.

459
00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:56.802
- It's real. - I'm telling you.

460
00:16:56.802 --> 00:16:58.570
- It's really written on the script. - Why?

461
00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:59.772
- Why would I lie? - Gosh.

462
00:16:59.772 --> 00:17:01.674
- I don't make up stories. - Okay.

463
00:17:01.674 --> 00:17:03.809
Let me tell you this again.

464
00:17:03.942 --> 00:17:06.945
The crew members did ask me to come out.

465
00:17:06.945 --> 00:17:10.182
I asked you the other time as well, but who cast you?

466
00:17:10.182 --> 00:17:12.518
The scriptwriter named Eun Kyung. There she is.

467
00:17:12.518 --> 00:17:13.786
- Eun Kyung? - Yes.

468
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.288
- That's how it happened. - Eun Kyung gave me a call.

469
00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:18.290
She said, "You're available on Monday, right?"

470
00:17:18.924 --> 00:17:20.726
- She was certain. - She wasn't asking.

471
00:17:20.893 --> 00:17:21.960
- Wait. - She knew.

472
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.096
- She didn't ask if you were free? - No, she didn't.

473
00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:25.731
She said as if she was certain I was free on Monday.

474
00:17:25.864 --> 00:17:29.201
- "Wait." - When I was about to check,

475
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:30.903
she said, "Tanhyeon by 10:40am," and hung up.

476
00:17:31.503 --> 00:17:33.272
- "Tanhyeon by 10:40am." - She said that because...

477
00:17:33.672 --> 00:17:35.841
- she had a gut feeling that he was. - Right. So...

478
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:37.910
I told her that I might not...

479
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.278
- Here's the next question. - Okay.

480
00:17:39.912 --> 00:17:41.347
- Here's the next question. - Okay.

481
00:17:42.448 --> 00:17:44.583
"What is the reason the crew invites you often?"

482
00:17:45.984 --> 00:17:47.453
- This is your next question. - I wasn't finished.

483
00:17:47.453 --> 00:17:48.520
We don't have time.

484
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.257
- We're moving on to Daniel. - We need to interview Daniel.

485
00:17:52.257 --> 00:17:54.927
(Sae Ho gives up his air time for viewers who are waiting for Daniel.)

486
00:17:54.927 --> 00:17:55.994
We all know that.

487
00:17:55.994 --> 00:17:58.864
- We are moving on. - Okay. We're moving like a train.

488
00:17:58.864 --> 00:18:01.367
- Answer questions on your website. - Should we move on or not?

489
00:18:01.367 --> 00:18:04.403
- All right. I will. - Say what you want to say there.

490
00:18:04.403 --> 00:18:05.704
All right. Here's our next guest,

491
00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:07.506
Kang Daniel!

492
00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:10.209
(This is the interview everyone has been waiting for.)

493
00:18:11.043 --> 00:18:12.678
This is Korea, Daniel's motherland!

494
00:18:13.746 --> 00:18:16.181
All right. Daniel...

495
00:18:16.181 --> 00:18:18.517
- is the most sought-after star. - Indeed.

496
00:18:18.684 --> 00:18:22.955
Don't you feel the popularity you have garnered these days?

497
00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:26.925
- They support me for my effort. - Exactly.

498
00:18:27.192 --> 00:18:31.130
Jong Kook, as a former idol singer who has been in the industry...

499
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.965
- longer than he has... - Right. I was once an idol.

500
00:18:32.965 --> 00:18:35.567
- He's a living history. - Must he be careful of anything?

501
00:18:35.567 --> 00:18:37.436
- He must be careful of women. - Jong Kook.

502
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.104
- Right. - That's so true.

503
00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:40.606
- How could you say that? - He must be careful of them now.

504
00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:42.007
- I mean it. - Goodness.

505
00:18:42.007 --> 00:18:44.343
Sa Yeon, what do you think? You've been a singer for a long time too.

506
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.146
Moo Song wasn't careful of women, so he ended up with her.

507
00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:49.381
(He makes a remark out of the blue.)

508
00:18:50.582 --> 00:18:53.185
(Unintentionally, she becomes the living sermon of his advice.)

509
00:18:53.685 --> 00:18:55.187
- I said it because we're close. - Hey.

510
00:18:55.454 --> 00:18:57.623
- Moo Song really wants to see you. - No, no.

511
00:18:57.623 --> 00:18:58.891
He said he would like to treat you to a meal.

512
00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:00.726
My apologies.

513
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.462
- At Daniel's age... - We are close friends.

514
00:19:03.462 --> 00:19:05.164
- We really are close friends. - He...

515
00:19:05.164 --> 00:19:06.765
- They really are. - Right now, he's so innocent.

516
00:19:06.765 --> 00:19:09.334
Just like we talked about earlier,

517
00:19:09.334 --> 00:19:11.637
- Daniel is incredibly popular. - I agree.

518
00:19:11.637 --> 00:19:13.539
- He's on commercials and shows. - Thank you.

519
00:19:13.672 --> 00:19:15.707
I bet you don't get to sleep a lot these days.

520
00:19:15.707 --> 00:19:18.177
- He's the 1st choice for everyone. - I sleep about 2 or 3 hours.

521
00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:19.678
- You only sleep that little? - Yes.

522
00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:20.946
- Poor you. - How many hours did you sleep?

523
00:19:20.946 --> 00:19:22.781
- I slept for about 12 hours. - 12 hours?

524
00:19:23.081 --> 00:19:25.017
- That's a bit alarming. - I did sleep for 12 hours.

525
00:19:25.384 --> 00:19:27.186
- That's not healthy. - Seok Jin.

526
00:19:27.186 --> 00:19:28.687
People might think you're sleeping forever.

527
00:19:28.687 --> 00:19:30.622
I took a nap yesterday and woke up today.

528
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.425
Then that can't be considered napping.

529
00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:35.394
- You slept too much. - Seok Jin.

530
00:19:35.394 --> 00:19:37.696
- You should visit the clinic. - That's enough.

531
00:19:37.863 --> 00:19:40.332
- I took a nap, but it was morning. - That happens to people.

532
00:19:40.332 --> 00:19:43.135
- But it's too much. Go to a clinic. - Some do sleep that much.

533
00:19:43.135 --> 00:19:45.838
- Get yourself checked out. - Well,

534
00:19:45.938 --> 00:19:48.006
- I should save up when I can. - Hey, let's listen to Daniel.

535
00:19:48.006 --> 00:19:50.542
(Everyone, be quiet!)

536
00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:51.844
(Every viewer wanted to say the same.)

537
00:19:51.844 --> 00:19:53.512
- Anyway, his smile is so pretty. - Right.

538
00:19:53.512 --> 00:19:55.180
- It is very pretty. - All right, Daniel.

539
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.849
- I want to see him dance. - Dance?

540
00:19:56.849 --> 00:19:58.317
- Daniel's dancing? - The move with the thigh.

541
00:19:58.317 --> 00:20:01.153
- I really want to see it. - Daniel, please do the dance.

542
00:20:01.153 --> 00:20:02.721
(Daniel dances for the show.)

543
00:20:02.721 --> 00:20:04.189
- He's an excellent dancer. - This is great.

544
00:20:05.891 --> 00:20:07.860
(He was acting shy, but his attitude suddenly changes.)

545
00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:11.864
(His dance moves are fancy as he's the center of Wanna One.)

546
00:20:11.997 --> 00:20:14.099
(Jaw-dropping)

547
00:20:14.466 --> 00:20:16.702
(Everyone including the crew pays him the utmost attention.)

548
00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.807
(You pierce into my heart like my destiny)

549
00:20:22.341 --> 00:20:24.977
(Open your heart to me)

550
00:20:26.478 --> 00:20:28.981
(The body wave opens the hearts of the female viewers.)

551
00:20:29.114 --> 00:20:31.483
(Their hearts are racing.)

552
00:20:31.483 --> 00:20:33.986
- Do the move with the thigh! - Do the thigh move!

553
00:20:34.219 --> 00:20:37.155
(Stroking)

554
00:20:39.191 --> 00:20:42.227
(Daniel, do whatever you want to do!)

555
00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:44.663
Stop it. Don't!

556
00:20:44.663 --> 00:20:46.398
Hey, the kids are watching. Stop.

557
00:20:46.532 --> 00:20:48.033
- Why are you so red? - Stop it.

558
00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:50.168
- Leave me alone. - No, don't do it!

559
00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:51.737
- Come on, Se Chan. - Stop it.

560
00:20:52.437 --> 00:20:54.740
- Stop scratching your thigh. - Gosh, it's so frustrating.

561
00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.742
- You stopped me from dancing. - He was great.

562
00:20:56.742 --> 00:20:57.943
Thank you.

563
00:20:58.176 --> 00:21:00.012
Hey, we...

564
00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:02.114
When it got hectic,

565
00:21:02.347 --> 00:21:05.651
- Sa Yeon came quietly and hugged... - She hugged him?

566
00:21:06.652 --> 00:21:08.387
(Approaching)

567
00:21:08.387 --> 00:21:11.990
(Sa Yeon abruptly approached and hugged him.)

568
00:21:12.291 --> 00:21:14.960
(Goodness, did you see that?)

569
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.194
I saw it.

570
00:21:16.662 --> 00:21:18.030
She is very affectionate towards her junior singers.

571
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.133
- I'm his entertainment senior. - I understand.

572
00:21:21.133 --> 00:21:22.267
- He's so cute. He just started. - That's right.

573
00:21:22.401 --> 00:21:24.636
- I wanted him to be a good singer. - Thank you.

574
00:21:24.937 --> 00:21:27.539
(Ji Hyo, look at me.)

575
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.776
So Min keeps imitating Daniel's dance.

576
00:21:30.776 --> 00:21:32.678
- What did she do? - Come here, and show them.

577
00:21:32.678 --> 00:21:34.613
- So Min, do your thing. - What is it?

578
00:21:34.613 --> 00:21:37.282
So Min, why don't you dance to the song?

579
00:21:37.449 --> 00:21:39.685
- You should give that a try. - Right. Give it a go.

580
00:21:40.285 --> 00:21:41.420
- This is nice. - I didn't mean to.

581
00:21:41.787 --> 00:21:44.856
(This is So Min's cover dance as Daniel demonstrates for her.)

582
00:21:49.127 --> 00:21:51.630
(What a surprise! She can pull off a decent body wave.)

583
00:21:55.334 --> 00:21:56.435
Come on!

584
00:21:56.635 --> 00:21:57.703
- Give us a break! - So Min.

585
00:21:57.903 --> 00:21:59.471
Hey, you didn't have to go that far!

586
00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:01.707
- She always causes trouble. - So Min.

587
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.242
- So Min. - I...

588
00:22:04.242 --> 00:22:06.945
- I'll keep her with me. - Yes, please.

589
00:22:06.979 --> 00:22:09.948
- Jae Seok. Kwang Soo is ready too. - Really? That's awesome.

590
00:22:09.948 --> 00:22:11.116
- Kwang Soo, you should try. - Kwang Soo.

591
00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:12.718
Since you're wearing the jacket, you can pull it off.

592
00:22:12.918 --> 00:22:14.953
- He'd look cool with the dance. - Try it.

593
00:22:14.987 --> 00:22:17.255
Kwang Soo has the longest thighs than anyone here.

594
00:22:17.255 --> 00:22:19.124
- I'll take this seriously then. - Kwang Soo, go all out for it.

595
00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:21.293
- When will you ride the spaceship? - The spaceship?

596
00:22:21.426 --> 00:22:23.729
He looks like the skinny version of Don Spike.

597
00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:26.264
He truly does.

598
00:22:26.264 --> 00:22:28.600
With the sunglasses, he does look like Don Spike.

599
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.036
- His thighs are not muscular. - It will take long as they're long.

600
00:22:31.637 --> 00:22:32.671
Here it comes.

601
00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:33.739
(Kwang Soo begins dancing.)

602
00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:35.007
Kwang Daniel!

603
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.376
Kwang Daniel!

604
00:22:39.478 --> 00:22:40.679
(Yeon Soo, you're watching, right?)

605
00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:41.947
That's disgusting.

606
00:22:42.114 --> 00:22:44.449
- I told you they were long. - They are long.

607
00:22:44.683 --> 00:22:45.751
His legs are so long.

608
00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:47.152
(A bad output of long legs)

609
00:22:49.955 --> 00:22:52.658
(Open it)

610
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:54.593
Jae Seok, what are you doing?

611
00:22:55.527 --> 00:22:58.997
(Hwang Jung Min of "The Wailing" drives evil spirits of his dance.)

612
00:22:59.898 --> 00:23:01.033
(This is the purgatory of dance.)

613
00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:02.868
I can't stand this.

614
00:23:03.602 --> 00:23:04.770
Goodness, that's it.

615
00:23:06.538 --> 00:23:07.839
I'm so honored.

616
00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:11.343
(Their initiations are over. Which guest will take over the gangs?)

617
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.946
- There are three gangs right now. - Okay.

618
00:23:15.047 --> 00:23:18.650
We will start Fight to Become the Boss, My Boss is in First Place now.

619
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.686
(Fight to Become the Boss, My Boss is in First Place)

620
00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.057
You will hear the keywords of the boss candidates' best weapon.

621
00:23:25.257 --> 00:23:28.427
If you think you can beat the candidates, you can challenge them.

622
00:23:28.727 --> 00:23:31.496
Through the matches, whoever wins the last match will become the boss.

623
00:23:31.496 --> 00:23:32.898
(Whoever wins the match will become the boss.)

624
00:23:32.898 --> 00:23:36.435
Sae Ho will reveal his best weapon.

625
00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:38.603
- What is yours? - He's good at many things.

626
00:23:38.637 --> 00:23:39.671
Will he be dancing?

627
00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:41.807
- Dance? - It's dancing.

628
00:23:41.807 --> 00:23:42.941
He's so shameless.

629
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:44.376
He's the best dancer when Daniel is here?

630
00:23:44.609 --> 00:23:47.913
- He can't win with dancing. - There's a hole.

631
00:23:47.913 --> 00:23:49.681
Even the tags are problematic like the owner.

632
00:23:50.415 --> 00:23:52.884
- Why is that? - He's taking up too much time.

633
00:23:52.884 --> 00:23:54.419
- Sae Ho, just forget it. - Hold this.

634
00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:55.987
- "The Best Dancer". - "The Best Dancer".

635
00:23:56.488 --> 00:23:59.057
- Will you be okay with this? - This is a stupid move.

636
00:23:59.057 --> 00:24:00.258
You can't follow through.

637
00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:01.426
Daniel joined her today.

638
00:24:01.426 --> 00:24:03.462
- No, Sae Ho isn't a good dancer. - I...

639
00:24:03.462 --> 00:24:05.530
I don't know which song they will play for me.

640
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.101
He's 1 of the 5 best dancers among comedians.

641
00:24:09.101 --> 00:24:11.269
- That's true. He's a good dancer. - I didn't expect that.

642
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:12.971
- I'm 1 of the 5 best dancers? - Yes.

643
00:24:13.438 --> 00:24:14.906
- He didn't know. - Shall I start now?

644
00:24:15.006 --> 00:24:16.708
- He's 1 of the 5 dancers. - He didn't know.

645
00:24:16.708 --> 00:24:18.276
Since he said we could play any song,

646
00:24:18.276 --> 00:24:20.178
- we prepared random songs. - Sure.

647
00:24:20.178 --> 00:24:21.747
All right. Let's watch his dance.

648
00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:23.248
Sae Ho, you can do it.

649
00:24:24.116 --> 00:24:25.584
I wonder what kind of music they will play.

650
00:24:26.017 --> 00:24:26.985
Goodness.

651
00:24:27.419 --> 00:24:30.188
(Oh, gosh. What is this?)

652
00:24:34.226 --> 00:24:36.394
- See? He can dance to every song. - He wasn't flustered.

653
00:24:36.528 --> 00:24:37.662
He can practically dance to every song.

654
00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:39.364
That was a nice turn.

655
00:24:39.364 --> 00:24:40.532
- Goodness. - That was great.

656
00:24:40.532 --> 00:24:41.933
- That suits him. - He's adorable!

657
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.870
- The dance suits him. - He's so cute.

658
00:24:46.738 --> 00:24:49.641
(Unbelievable. He can actually pull this off.)

659
00:24:53.145 --> 00:24:54.913
(He imitates a monkey.)

660
00:24:54.913 --> 00:24:56.414
That's it. You must come back.

661
00:24:56.414 --> 00:24:57.883
- There you go. - What is that elephant move?

662
00:24:58.383 --> 00:24:59.584
(Dancing like an elephant)

663
00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:01.486
(Tooting)

664
00:25:01.486 --> 00:25:03.288
You all saw that, right?

665
00:25:03.421 --> 00:25:05.257
- You saw what he did, didn't you? - He really is a good dancer.

666
00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:07.025
- That was so cool. - Goodness.

667
00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:09.127
- The song surprised me. - That was groovy.

668
00:25:09.227 --> 00:25:11.696
- Who's next? Yeon Soo? - Yeon Soo should go next.

669
00:25:11.696 --> 00:25:13.431
- Yeon Soo. - I can't.

670
00:25:13.498 --> 00:25:15.267
- Yeon Soo might be an underdog. - That's right.

671
00:25:15.267 --> 00:25:16.902
- I'm so curious. - That suits you well.

672
00:25:16.902 --> 00:25:18.737
- You can win with your cuteness. - Yes, I'm a bit hot.

673
00:25:18.937 --> 00:25:20.005
- Play the song. - What should I do?

674
00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:22.741
- Here it is! - Let's go!

675
00:25:26.478 --> 00:25:28.747
(Her eyes undergo a sudden change.)

676
00:25:30.782 --> 00:25:34.653
(A monkey climbs up the tree)

677
00:25:34.653 --> 00:25:36.188
- That's great. - Great.

678
00:25:36.188 --> 00:25:37.222
(Tossing her hair)

679
00:25:37.956 --> 00:25:39.591
(She's engrossed in dancing.)

680
00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:40.759
Nice!

681
00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:43.228
(Yes! This is my chance.)

682
00:25:43.228 --> 00:25:48.133
(A giant octopus appeals his charms to her.)

683
00:25:50.969 --> 00:25:52.237
(Doing her best)

684
00:25:52.237 --> 00:25:54.739
Monkey, monkey magic, monkey magic

685
00:25:54.739 --> 00:25:57.375
(She doesn't lose focus despite the distraction.)

686
00:25:57.375 --> 00:25:59.110
All right. Both of you...

687
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:00.946
- You were so good. - That was excellent.

688
00:26:01.012 --> 00:26:02.247
She lost herself in her dance.

689
00:26:02.247 --> 00:26:03.849
- That was great. - I liked that.

690
00:26:03.882 --> 00:26:06.318
- Really? You did? - Yes, I did like it.

691
00:26:06.318 --> 00:26:07.619
- You did well. - All right.

692
00:26:07.752 --> 00:26:09.988
The rest of you will decide who the winner is.

693
00:26:09.988 --> 00:26:12.691
- Next up is... - Yes, go, Ma Jong Kook!

694
00:26:12.691 --> 00:26:13.758
It's not that...

695
00:26:13.758 --> 00:26:15.227
- Jong Kook. - Goodness.

696
00:26:15.227 --> 00:26:16.595
He's warming up.

697
00:26:16.595 --> 00:26:18.730
(Feeling shy)

698
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.699
It's the shark song.

699
00:26:21.933 --> 00:26:23.468
It's the shark song.

700
00:26:23.468 --> 00:26:26.438
(His muscles do the wave.)

701
00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:32.677
(Feeling narcissistic)

702
00:26:34.746 --> 00:26:36.181
Please switch the song.

703
00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:38.216
- My kid loves this song. - Let's change the song.

704
00:26:38.316 --> 00:26:39.384
(The theme song of "National Singing Contest")

705
00:26:39.384 --> 00:26:40.919
- What is this? - It's "National Singing Contest".

706
00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:42.087
Hey, this is...

707
00:26:44.155 --> 00:26:47.659
(He wriggles his body again.)

708
00:26:49.761 --> 00:26:52.097
Do a cute dance move.

709
00:26:52.097 --> 00:26:53.465
(Officer, you can't do that here.)

710
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.701
- But... - Why am I feeling hot?

711
00:26:56.701 --> 00:26:58.703
don't you think he has guns all over his body?

712
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.105
I have a gun here.

713
00:27:00.205 --> 00:27:02.741
- He does. - He has guns in his biceps.

714
00:27:02.908 --> 00:27:04.175
I'm going to take out my guns.

715
00:27:04.476 --> 00:27:06.111
All right, everyone.

716
00:27:06.344 --> 00:27:08.680
- Let's see Daniel's moves. - Let's go, Daniel.

717
00:27:09.481 --> 00:27:11.950
He's one of the strongest boss candidates.

718
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.151
(Daniel enters the stage.)

719
00:27:16.288 --> 00:27:17.289
Here we go.

720
00:27:24.896 --> 00:27:27.032
(Oh, my.)

721
00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:29.134
(Are you watching?)

722
00:27:29.134 --> 00:27:30.702
He's so well prepared.

723
00:27:30.702 --> 00:27:32.537
Amazing.

724
00:27:32.537 --> 00:27:33.605
(His sense of rhythm is incredible.)

725
00:27:36.441 --> 00:27:38.176
Please change the music.

726
00:27:38.176 --> 00:27:41.346
(He finishes off relaxedly.)

727
00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:43.682
(Second song)

728
00:27:46.451 --> 00:27:47.452
You can do this.

729
00:27:47.953 --> 00:27:49.721
(He's getting into the rhythm.)

730
00:27:50.522 --> 00:27:51.690
(This is not good.)

731
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.591
- He is really good. - He's so cute.

732
00:27:53.758 --> 00:27:54.926
How can you do this?

733
00:27:54.926 --> 00:27:55.927
(I'm the king of dance.)

734
00:27:55.927 --> 00:27:57.329
He's amazing.

735
00:27:57.362 --> 00:27:58.630
Oh, my.

736
00:27:58.997 --> 00:28:00.932
- This is embarrassing. - You did an amazing job.

737
00:28:00.932 --> 00:28:02.834
Even his freestyle dance is amazing.

738
00:28:03.401 --> 00:28:04.536
This is embarrassing.

739
00:28:04.903 --> 00:28:06.972
- His freestyle dance is so nice. - I'm so embarrassed.

740
00:28:06.972 --> 00:28:08.707
- It was fantastic. - You're cruel.

741
00:28:08.707 --> 00:28:10.275
- No. - Amazing job.

742
00:28:10.275 --> 00:28:12.844
Daniel wins.

743
00:28:13.178 --> 00:28:14.212
Thank you.

744
00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:15.947
I accept the result.

745
00:28:15.947 --> 00:28:17.482
- I respect the result. - Then...

746
00:28:17.482 --> 00:28:20.652
Daniel can choose which team he wants to join.

747
00:28:20.652 --> 00:28:22.187
We're...

748
00:28:22.187 --> 00:28:23.221
- Are you here alone? - Okay.

749
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.391
You'll have to dress similarly to the other team members.

750
00:28:26.391 --> 00:28:28.193
- Really? - You have to.

751
00:28:28.193 --> 00:28:29.227
Okay.

752
00:28:29.227 --> 00:28:31.262
Daniel can have my hairstyle.

753
00:28:31.663 --> 00:28:33.732
- My wig... - Daniel can wear my wig.

754
00:28:33.932 --> 00:28:36.768
- This jacket is too warm. - It's so hot.

755
00:28:36.768 --> 00:28:37.769
(I'll donate my jacket.)

756
00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:39.237
This is much better.

757
00:28:39.738 --> 00:28:41.473
I didn't know what the weather would be like in Korea.

758
00:28:41.539 --> 00:28:44.642
(Nose Tae thought it'd be hot in Korea.)

759
00:28:44.976 --> 00:28:45.977
He's good.

760
00:28:46.011 --> 00:28:47.345
(What is he doing?)

761
00:28:47.645 --> 00:28:49.280
He's good.

762
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.949
It's not hot in Yanbian.

763
00:28:52.917 --> 00:28:54.586
- That's a Gangwon dialect. - That's a Gyeongsang dialect.

764
00:28:54.586 --> 00:28:55.987
Where are you from?

765
00:28:55.987 --> 00:28:57.622
Due to global warming...

766
00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.158
Global warming is getting serious.

767
00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:01.926
- Daniel. - Yes.

768
00:29:01.926 --> 00:29:03.661
- Please choose a team. - You can dress like a detective.

769
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:05.096
- It'll look cool. - We're Mungdol Gang.

770
00:29:05.096 --> 00:29:06.131
Mungdol Gang.

771
00:29:06.131 --> 00:29:07.132
- Mungdol Gang. - You're?

772
00:29:07.132 --> 00:29:08.233
Team Police.

773
00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:10.402
(A real man should join Team Police.)

774
00:29:10.402 --> 00:29:11.870
- Which team do you choose? - Well...

775
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:20.345
(All teams want Daniel. Where will he go?)

776
00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:21.446
Mungdol Gang.

777
00:29:21.446 --> 00:29:22.747
Really?

778
00:29:23.081 --> 00:29:25.150
(Daniel chooses Mungdol Gang.)

779
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.185
- That's clever. - All right.

780
00:29:27.185 --> 00:29:28.686
Whose turn is it now?

781
00:29:28.686 --> 00:29:30.455
- It's Yeon Soo's turn. - Yeon Soo.

782
00:29:30.455 --> 00:29:31.456
(It's Yeon Soo's turn.)

783
00:29:31.456 --> 00:29:33.391
- Let's take a look. - What is she good at?

784
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:34.859
Being cute?

785
00:29:35.527 --> 00:29:36.928
- Smile? - Smile?

786
00:29:36.928 --> 00:29:38.430
I have a nice smile.

787
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.901
(Best Smiler)

788
00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:44.769
Among us,

789
00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:46.438
the only ones who have a chance are...

790
00:29:46.438 --> 00:29:47.872
So Min and Ji Hyo.

791
00:29:47.872 --> 00:29:49.741
- I have a nice smile too. - Show us.

792
00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:51.009
(I have a nice smile.)

793
00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:52.077
(His smile could...)

794
00:29:52.077 --> 00:29:54.179
(literally kill a person.)

795
00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:56.548
- You see... - Oh, I recognize that smile.

796
00:29:56.548 --> 00:29:58.183
He does this all the time.

797
00:29:58.616 --> 00:30:00.085
When did I do that?

798
00:30:00.085 --> 00:30:01.252
- Like this. - I never do that.

799
00:30:01.252 --> 00:30:03.021
You do this.

800
00:30:04.923 --> 00:30:07.892
(He looks the same in every picture.)

801
00:30:07.926 --> 00:30:09.227
I don't do that.

802
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:10.495
It doesn't look like that.

803
00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:12.163
No, no.

804
00:30:12.163 --> 00:30:13.765
It'd be hard to decide...

805
00:30:13.765 --> 00:30:16.201
which smile looks the best.

806
00:30:16.201 --> 00:30:17.402
How are you going to judge?

807
00:30:17.402 --> 00:30:20.038
You'll be flicked in the forehead while smiling.

808
00:30:20.038 --> 00:30:22.440
(They'll be flicked in the forehead.)

809
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.775
After the flick,

810
00:30:23.775 --> 00:30:26.678
you have to keep a smile for five seconds.

811
00:30:26.945 --> 00:30:28.346
We can't flick Yeon Soo in the forehead.

812
00:30:28.346 --> 00:30:29.414
(They have to keep a smile for 5 seconds.)

813
00:30:29.747 --> 00:30:33.218
- Kwang Soo doesn't care. - No.

814
00:30:33.218 --> 00:30:34.285
- He's fair to everyone. - It's just a game.

815
00:30:34.285 --> 00:30:35.687
Of course.

816
00:30:35.687 --> 00:30:37.255
It's going to hurt.

817
00:30:37.255 --> 00:30:38.456
Definitely.

818
00:30:38.623 --> 00:30:40.158
- I'll start. - Keep a smile.

819
00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:42.026
That's going to hurt.

820
00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:43.428
You have to keep this smile.

821
00:30:43.428 --> 00:30:44.829
- Yeon Soo. - I'm scared.

822
00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:46.498
You're already frowning.

823
00:30:46.498 --> 00:30:48.199
(You're already moving.)

824
00:30:48.199 --> 00:30:50.401
His hand is so big. It's scary.

825
00:30:51.836 --> 00:30:52.837
Then you'll fail.

826
00:30:52.837 --> 00:30:54.005
- Yeon Soo. - Yes?

827
00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:56.374
- Are you ready? - Can't I just give up?

828
00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.611
(I suddenly want to give up.)

829
00:30:59.611 --> 00:31:01.646
- You can't. - It was your idea.

830
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.715
Wait.

831
00:31:03.715 --> 00:31:04.949
(He's having a hard time managing his anger.)

832
00:31:04.949 --> 00:31:05.950
Why are you so angry?

833
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.452
- What are you doing? - Why are you angry?

834
00:31:07.452 --> 00:31:08.686
Why are you so angry?

835
00:31:08.686 --> 00:31:10.155
Are you drunk?

836
00:31:10.155 --> 00:31:11.189
What's with you?

837
00:31:11.189 --> 00:31:12.357
It was your idea.

838
00:31:12.357 --> 00:31:13.725
Please smile.

839
00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:16.127
(Take a deep breath...)

840
00:31:16.127 --> 00:31:19.497
(and smile.)

841
00:31:20.031 --> 00:31:21.966
(She's so pretty.)

842
00:31:24.035 --> 00:31:25.103
I'll start.

843
00:31:25.103 --> 00:31:26.204
(Kwang Soo gets ready.)

844
00:31:27.972 --> 00:31:29.440
(Flicking)

845
00:31:30.842 --> 00:31:33.978
(I have to keep a smile.)

846
00:31:33.978 --> 00:31:35.446
Isn't this just how she usually looks?

847
00:31:36.748 --> 00:31:38.816
- This is just how her face looks. - She looks like this all the time.

848
00:31:39.017 --> 00:31:40.685
(Poker face)

849
00:31:40.685 --> 00:31:41.719
She's good.

850
00:31:41.986 --> 00:31:43.488
- It hurts. - Does it hurt?

851
00:31:43.488 --> 00:31:44.622
Yes.

852
00:31:44.622 --> 00:31:46.491
(She kept a smile for 5 seconds.)

853
00:31:48.026 --> 00:31:49.894
- So Min. - She'll pull it off.

854
00:31:49.894 --> 00:31:50.929
(The first contestant is So Min.)

855
00:31:50.929 --> 00:31:51.996
Seriously.

856
00:31:52.497 --> 00:31:53.865
Put on a smile.

857
00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:54.999
Show us.

858
00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:56.000
Cameras, please...

859
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.202
Yeon Soo, can you come over here?

860
00:31:57.202 --> 00:31:59.771
- Please smile. - Keep it for five seconds.

861
00:31:59.904 --> 00:32:01.539
- Yeon Soo. - Please come here.

862
00:32:01.539 --> 00:32:02.640
You're in the way.

863
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.175
I thought she was a viewer.

864
00:32:04.275 --> 00:32:05.977
- Please stand here. - She wants to see.

865
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:08.446
Show us your smile.

866
00:32:08.913 --> 00:32:09.981
- Like this? - Like this?

867
00:32:09.981 --> 00:32:11.149
You look pretty.

868
00:32:11.216 --> 00:32:13.451
That looks nice.

869
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:14.686
You're doing great.

870
00:32:14.686 --> 00:32:16.020
With your hands covering your face.

871
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.021
(She decides on her smile.)

872
00:32:17.855 --> 00:32:20.191
(Flicking)

873
00:32:22.927 --> 00:32:23.962
(Her smile is gone.)

874
00:32:23.962 --> 00:32:26.664
Wait.

875
00:32:26.798 --> 00:32:28.399
Hold on.

876
00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:29.567
That fast?

877
00:32:30.935 --> 00:32:32.237
You fail.

878
00:32:32.437 --> 00:32:35.039
- So Min failed. - I was smiling.

879
00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:36.174
So Min failed.

880
00:32:36.441 --> 00:32:38.176
- So Min. - You should try too.

881
00:32:38.176 --> 00:32:40.445
- So Min failed. - You should try too.

882
00:32:40.445 --> 00:32:42.180
You should try.

883
00:32:42.747 --> 00:32:44.115
- You should. - Try, Kwang Soo.

884
00:32:44.115 --> 00:32:45.450
(Kwang Soo gives it a try.)

885
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.584
Please smile.

886
00:32:46.584 --> 00:32:47.852
That looks good.

887
00:32:47.852 --> 00:32:48.987
There you go.

888
00:32:49.287 --> 00:32:50.355
That disgusting smile again.

889
00:32:50.355 --> 00:32:51.389
(Prince of Asia's smile)

890
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:53.591
- Please face the camera. - It won't hurt.

891
00:32:53.591 --> 00:32:54.692
(So Min will flick him in the forehead.)

892
00:32:56.527 --> 00:32:57.528
It won't hurt.

893
00:32:57.528 --> 00:32:59.030
(Punching)

894
00:33:02.467 --> 00:33:04.669
(You come here.)

895
00:33:05.236 --> 00:33:07.739
(An eye for an eye.)

896
00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:09.741
- You're crazy. - So Min.

897
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:11.142
Kwang Soo failed.

898
00:33:11.142 --> 00:33:13.144
He failed.

899
00:33:13.144 --> 00:33:14.679
She punched me.

900
00:33:14.912 --> 00:33:16.247
His forehead is red.

901
00:33:16.247 --> 00:33:17.382
(He was punched.)

902
00:33:17.382 --> 00:33:18.449
It's red.

903
00:33:18.449 --> 00:33:19.517
(Kwang Soo fails.)

904
00:33:19.517 --> 00:33:21.986
- No one has done this before. - Kwang Soo failed.

905
00:33:21.986 --> 00:33:23.955
(He's no longer the Prince of Asia.)

906
00:33:24.088 --> 00:33:26.658
Now...

907
00:33:26.658 --> 00:33:27.859
(The next contestant is...)

908
00:33:27.859 --> 00:33:29.661
(Is it me?)

909
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:32.930
It's not your turn yet. You don't have to get ready.

910
00:33:34.332 --> 00:33:35.400
(It isn't?)

911
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.035
He wants a close-up shot.

912
00:33:38.436 --> 00:33:39.637
He wants a close-up shot.

913
00:33:39.637 --> 00:33:40.705
It's not my turn yet?

914
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.676
He's been...

915
00:33:44.676 --> 00:33:48.680
(He's been getting ready for a close-up shot.)

916
00:33:49.914 --> 00:33:51.482
- Then... - Why doesn't Sae Ho try?

917
00:33:51.482 --> 00:33:54.986
- I'm okay. - Give it a try.

918
00:33:54.986 --> 00:33:56.187
Well...

919
00:33:56.487 --> 00:33:58.022
Can't I choose not to?

920
00:33:58.022 --> 00:34:00.658
Eun Kyung and your manager have agreed on this.

921
00:34:00.658 --> 00:34:01.893
They have?

922
00:34:01.893 --> 00:34:03.528
Se Chan will flick him in the forehead.

923
00:34:03.528 --> 00:34:04.996
All right.

924
00:34:04.996 --> 00:34:06.030
- Are you ready? - Yes.

925
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.165
Please put on a smile.

926
00:34:07.532 --> 00:34:09.767
- Like this? - Yes.

927
00:34:09.767 --> 00:34:10.835
(Se Chan is the strongest one.)

928
00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:13.271
Here we go.

929
00:34:14.505 --> 00:34:15.640
(Flicking)

930
00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:21.179
(He gets teary-eyed.)

931
00:34:23.848 --> 00:34:26.417
(His eyes are crying.)

932
00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:27.452
What is this?

933
00:34:27.885 --> 00:34:29.520
He looks a bit different.

934
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.657
(Sae Ho fails.)

935
00:34:32.657 --> 00:34:33.658
He failed.

936
00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:37.462
Daniel should try.

937
00:34:37.462 --> 00:34:39.097
- Okay. - Daniel should try.

938
00:34:39.097 --> 00:34:40.098
Okay.

939
00:34:40.098 --> 00:34:41.766
Se Chan should flick him.

940
00:34:41.766 --> 00:34:43.501
- Se Chan is strong. - Will you be okay?

941
00:34:43.501 --> 00:34:45.203
- I'll try. - Are you sure?

942
00:34:45.203 --> 00:34:46.504
- Will I be okay? - I'll try.

943
00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:49.640
- Will I be okay? - Don't worry. It's just a game.

944
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.309
- Are you sure? - Of course.

945
00:34:51.309 --> 00:34:53.211
- Of course. - You're a professional.

946
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:54.846
- Sure. - Daniel,

947
00:34:54.979 --> 00:34:56.414
please show us your smile.

948
00:34:56.414 --> 00:34:57.949
- Show us a few. - Show us your favorite ones.

949
00:34:57.949 --> 00:34:59.717
1, 2, 3.

950
00:35:00.251 --> 00:35:01.953
(Cute)

951
00:35:02.587 --> 00:35:04.255
- He's so cute. - He's so cute.

952
00:35:04.255 --> 00:35:05.890
(Their hearts flutter.)

953
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.325
A bigger smile, please.

954
00:35:08.726 --> 00:35:10.228
(Winking)

955
00:35:10.328 --> 00:35:12.063
That looks great. Please keep that one.

956
00:35:12.063 --> 00:35:13.564
Wink. I love that.

957
00:35:13.564 --> 00:35:14.599
(Everyone is in love.)

958
00:35:15.366 --> 00:35:16.367
Here we go.

959
00:35:18.102 --> 00:35:19.270
Se Chan is strong.

960
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.438
(Flick)

961
00:35:21.539 --> 00:35:22.807
Hey.

962
00:35:24.142 --> 00:35:25.209
(Crying)

963
00:35:25.209 --> 00:35:26.477
You're...

964
00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:29.914
I'm sorry. It was just a game!

965
00:35:30.148 --> 00:35:31.516
It was just a game!

966
00:35:32.016 --> 00:35:34.018
It's just a game!

967
00:35:34.018 --> 00:35:36.788
Attack him!

968
00:35:37.622 --> 00:35:38.956
It's just a game!

969
00:35:38.956 --> 00:35:41.025
(Daniel fails.)

970
00:35:41.025 --> 00:35:44.162
- You're the star of the night - No!

971
00:35:46.431 --> 00:35:50.001
(He closed both eyes.)

972
00:35:51.202 --> 00:35:52.937
(Are you okay?)

973
00:35:53.805 --> 00:35:57.909
Yeon Soo kept a smile.

974
00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:00.411
She's the boss.

975
00:36:00.411 --> 00:36:02.046
(Yeon Soo becomes a boss.)

976
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.015
Please choose a team.

977
00:36:04.015 --> 00:36:06.317
(She has to choose a team.)

978
00:36:06.317 --> 00:36:07.685
Are you here alone?

979
00:36:07.685 --> 00:36:09.854
(She has to dress like the other team members.)

980
00:36:09.854 --> 00:36:11.656
Will I have to dress like that?

981
00:36:11.656 --> 00:36:13.825
- Yes. - It's embarrassing at first,

982
00:36:13.825 --> 00:36:15.726
but you get used to it. It's quite comfortable.

983
00:36:15.726 --> 00:36:20.097
I saw the other wig back there. It's a Chinese queue.

984
00:36:20.832 --> 00:36:22.266
- No. - What?

985
00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:23.601
It isn't.

986
00:36:23.601 --> 00:36:24.869
- It isn't. - What are you talking about?

987
00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:26.771
You wear it the other way around.

988
00:36:27.505 --> 00:36:28.606
It's a Chinese queue.

989
00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.208
Are you choosing us?

990
00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:31.676
- Are you? - Yes!

991
00:36:31.676 --> 00:36:33.077
(Yeon Soo chooses Team Police.)

992
00:36:34.812 --> 00:36:37.815
- Is it Sa Yeon's turn now? - Yes.

993
00:36:37.815 --> 00:36:39.984
Sa Yeon's specialty is...

994
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:42.286
- Strength? - Her specialty is strength.

995
00:36:42.487 --> 00:36:44.021
She's really strong.

996
00:36:44.021 --> 00:36:45.957
She's incredible.

997
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.460
She suppressed Seok Jin with force earlier today.

998
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.795
I touched her arms,

999
00:36:50.795 --> 00:36:52.597
and they were hard like Jong Kook's.

1000
00:36:52.897 --> 00:36:54.565
(Her arms were hard like Jong Kook's.)

1001
00:36:54.765 --> 00:36:56.200
- She's really strong. - She is.

1002
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.368
(Sa Yeon has extraordinary arm strength.)

1003
00:36:58.102 --> 00:37:02.406
(No one can beat her in Wrist Wrestling.)

1004
00:37:03.007 --> 00:37:06.377
We'll play Wrist Wrestling.

1005
00:37:06.377 --> 00:37:07.411
(Wrist Wrestling is her specialty.)

1006
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:08.446
Wrist Wrestling.

1007
00:37:08.446 --> 00:37:09.480
(Bring it on.)

1008
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.016
If your feet get off the ground,

1009
00:37:12.016 --> 00:37:13.751
you'll lose.

1010
00:37:13.985 --> 00:37:19.757
If Sa Yeon defeats all female members, she remains first place.

1011
00:37:19.757 --> 00:37:22.326
(She remains 1st place if she defeats the females.)

1012
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.930
(Round 1 is Sa Yeon versus So Min.)

1013
00:37:26.497 --> 00:37:27.999
- Push her to the side. - To the side.

1014
00:37:27.999 --> 00:37:29.867
Do I push her to the side?

1015
00:37:29.867 --> 00:37:32.436
You can't throw her around back and forth.

1016
00:37:32.436 --> 00:37:34.539
(Be gentle with her.)

1017
00:37:34.805 --> 00:37:37.041
- I'll try to win. - Okay.

1018
00:37:37.041 --> 00:37:38.042
Get ready.

1019
00:37:38.809 --> 00:37:40.144
Start.

1020
00:37:40.144 --> 00:37:41.979
(Sa Yeon and So Min start.)

1021
00:37:41.979 --> 00:37:43.247
Sa Yeon doesn't budge at all.

1022
00:37:43.548 --> 00:37:46.350
(She attacks her with all her might.)

1023
00:37:46.851 --> 00:37:48.185
Sa Yeon doesn't budge at all.

1024
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.522
(She stands firmly.)

1025
00:37:51.522 --> 00:37:52.523
She's so strong.

1026
00:37:53.257 --> 00:37:54.225
Goodness.

1027
00:37:54.225 --> 00:37:58.162
(She easily pushes So Min off to the side.)

1028
00:37:58.162 --> 00:37:59.730
Hold on.

1029
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.766
People don't usually fly off.

1030
00:38:01.766 --> 00:38:04.635
They don't usually fly off while playing Wrist Wrestling.

1031
00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:07.271
She seems like a 100-year-old zelkova tree.

1032
00:38:07.271 --> 00:38:10.141
(She's not human.)

1033
00:38:11.275 --> 00:38:14.045
How can you say that she's 100 years old?

1034
00:38:14.211 --> 00:38:15.813
She has strong roots.

1035
00:38:15.813 --> 00:38:17.748
Regular wrestling is better.

1036
00:38:17.748 --> 00:38:21.185
She's described as a 100-year-old zelkova tree.

1037
00:38:21.185 --> 00:38:22.520
She's deeply rooted.

1038
00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.754
Next up is Yeon Soo.

1039
00:38:23.754 --> 00:38:25.189
- You can do it. - Let's go.

1040
00:38:25.289 --> 00:38:26.557
(Round 2 is Sa Yeon versus Yeon Soo.)

1041
00:38:26.557 --> 00:38:27.658
Let's go.

1042
00:38:27.658 --> 00:38:28.926
(Round 2 is Sa Yeon versus Yeon Soo.)

1043
00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.463
What if I lose within one second?

1044
00:38:32.463 --> 00:38:34.065
You never know.

1045
00:38:34.065 --> 00:38:35.700
It's hard to tell.

1046
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.768
All you need is technique.

1047
00:38:37.768 --> 00:38:39.437
- She's very determined. - Start.

1048
00:38:39.437 --> 00:38:40.905
(Sa Yeon and Yeon Soo start.)

1049
00:38:40.905 --> 00:38:42.006
That's good.

1050
00:38:42.306 --> 00:38:43.307
Start.

1051
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:45.710
- How is she not budging? - She puts weight on one side.

1052
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.078
That's right.

1053
00:38:47.178 --> 00:38:48.579
- She puts weight on one side. - Right.

1054
00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:49.747
She knows how to play it.

1055
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:51.415
Yeon Soo knows how to play it.

1056
00:38:52.116 --> 00:38:53.351
She knows how to play it.

1057
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:56.253
(Does she know how to play it? I don't think so.)

1058
00:38:56.253 --> 00:38:57.254
Goodness.

1059
00:38:57.254 --> 00:39:00.558
(She falls flat on the floor.)

1060
00:39:01.459 --> 00:39:02.460
Yeon Soo.

1061
00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.062
Are your feet nailed to the ground?

1062
00:39:05.062 --> 00:39:07.365
(Could that be her secret?)

1063
00:39:07.365 --> 00:39:09.500
She doesn't move at all.

1064
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.869
- I know. - You're invincible.

1065
00:39:11.936 --> 00:39:13.037
She doesn't budge.

1066
00:39:13.137 --> 00:39:16.140
She's like a 100-year-old zelkova tree.

1067
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.410
(Her weight is impressive.)

1068
00:39:20.711 --> 00:39:21.946
Next is Ji Hyo.

1069
00:39:21.946 --> 00:39:23.547
Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1070
00:39:23.547 --> 00:39:26.250
- By the way... - It's hard to defeat Sa Yeon.

1071
00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.252
Ji Hyo is strong and tough.

1072
00:39:28.252 --> 00:39:30.688
Once, she grabbed my arm.

1073
00:39:30.755 --> 00:39:33.557
My knees went weak. I apologized to her.

1074
00:39:34.291 --> 00:39:38.229
Sa Yeon is able to play with her ring on.

1075
00:39:38.229 --> 00:39:40.231
(She even has her ring on.)

1076
00:39:41.565 --> 00:39:42.733
She has her ring on.

1077
00:39:42.733 --> 00:39:44.602
(It represents how confident she is.)

1078
00:39:44.635 --> 00:39:46.270
- You should take it off. - Most people...

1079
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.707
take off their diamond rings before playing.

1080
00:39:49.874 --> 00:39:51.475
Sa Yeon is different.

1081
00:39:51.475 --> 00:39:52.877
It's rare to see diamonds on variety shows.

1082
00:39:52.877 --> 00:39:54.478
Get ready, set, go.

1083
00:39:55.479 --> 00:39:57.982
- Isn't Ji Hyo different? - Isn't she?

1084
00:39:58.349 --> 00:40:01.619
- Isn't it different this time? - What's going on?

1085
00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:04.355
(Once she defeats Ji Hyo, Sa Yeon will be in 1st place.)

1086
00:40:05.056 --> 00:40:09.627
(It won't be so easy, Sa Yeon.)

1087
00:40:10.327 --> 00:40:14.999
(As expected, Ji Hyo falls on the mat.)

1088
00:40:16.767 --> 00:40:18.002
I really respect you.

1089
00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:20.604
- Respect, respect. - Goodness.

1090
00:40:21.038 --> 00:40:24.308
She pushed everyone as far as 30cm.

1091
00:40:24.308 --> 00:40:25.476
(Seok Jin steps in.)

1092
00:40:25.976 --> 00:40:26.977
Seriously.

1093
00:40:26.977 --> 00:40:28.479
(Are you that strong, Sa Yeon?)

1094
00:40:28.479 --> 00:40:29.547
They fell over here.

1095
00:40:30.648 --> 00:40:33.451
(Nose Tae is curious about Sa Yeon's strength.)

1096
00:40:33.451 --> 00:40:35.019
- What's going on? - Come here.

1097
00:40:35.453 --> 00:40:36.887
Come here.

1098
00:40:36.887 --> 00:40:38.889
- Jong Kook, why don't you... - Yes?

1099
00:40:38.889 --> 00:40:40.558
- play against Seok Jin? - Come here.

1100
00:40:40.558 --> 00:40:42.126
(Come here, Seok Jin.)

1101
00:40:42.393 --> 00:40:44.929
- That won't work. - Come over here.

1102
00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:47.832
(He has no business with Jong Kook.)

1103
00:40:48.265 --> 00:40:50.334
Come on, Seok Jin.

1104
00:40:50.768 --> 00:40:52.703
You're already here, so let's play.

1105
00:40:53.003 --> 00:40:54.371
I can't play against him.

1106
00:40:55.139 --> 00:40:57.374
- All right. - Wait, come this way.

1107
00:40:57.374 --> 00:40:58.909
- Okay. - We should start here.

1108
00:40:58.909 --> 00:41:00.211
Seok Jin is serious.

1109
00:41:00.211 --> 00:41:02.046
(Why is he so serious?)

1110
00:41:02.046 --> 00:41:03.047
Start.

1111
00:41:03.047 --> 00:41:04.081
(Jong Kook and Nose Tae start.)

1112
00:41:04.081 --> 00:41:08.252
(As soon as they start, Seok Jin loses.)

1113
00:41:08.252 --> 00:41:09.253
You go.

1114
00:41:11.455 --> 00:41:14.725
- Kwang Soo, you're up next. - No.

1115
00:41:14.725 --> 00:41:17.228
Nose Tae, step out. Kwang Soo, it's your turn.

1116
00:41:18.229 --> 00:41:21.332
- Play. - Take revenge, Kwang Soo.

1117
00:41:22.066 --> 00:41:23.200
Kwang Soo is strong.

1118
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.735
Start.

1119
00:41:25.002 --> 00:41:26.771
Pull him inward. Gosh.

1120
00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:28.506
Darn it.

1121
00:41:28.506 --> 00:41:30.508
(He falls as soon as they start.)

1122
00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:33.711
- He fell. Come out. - Bring it on.

1123
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:34.912
Jae Seok.

1124
00:41:34.912 --> 00:41:36.347
(Please take revenge on him.)

1125
00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:38.215
- Are you alone? - Jae Seok.

1126
00:41:38.983 --> 00:41:41.886
- What's your name? - You're strong, aren't you?

1127
00:41:42.019 --> 00:41:43.687
Start.

1128
00:41:44.622 --> 00:41:45.756
(Jong Kook thrusts him.)

1129
00:41:45.756 --> 00:41:46.757
How did you fall that way?

1130
00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:48.459
(Jong Kook thrusts him.)

1131
00:41:48.459 --> 00:41:50.060
(How did he end up on the opposite side?)

1132
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.962
- Gosh. - How can you fall to that side?

1133
00:41:51.962 --> 00:41:54.565
- That was pathetic. - Jae Seok is embarrassed.

1134
00:41:54.565 --> 00:41:56.367
He practically flew off.

1135
00:41:56.367 --> 00:41:59.103
Jong Kook, this is impossible.

1136
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.437
Okay.

1137
00:42:00.504 --> 00:42:03.007
- All right. - You lost already.

1138
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.575
You lost already.

1139
00:42:04.575 --> 00:42:06.644
- That won't be aired. - You fell here.

1140
00:42:06.644 --> 00:42:08.846
- You lost already. - It won't be aired.

1141
00:42:08.913 --> 00:42:10.047
(We don't remove interesting bits.)

1142
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.616
- Start with taking off the jacket. - Don't start again.

1143
00:42:12.616 --> 00:42:14.018
- I was... - Here I am.

1144
00:42:14.018 --> 00:42:16.120
(Shall we start again?)

1145
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.122
- This is impossible. - Right.

1146
00:42:18.122 --> 00:42:19.957
- This is good. - Are you alone?

1147
00:42:20.457 --> 00:42:21.625
What's your name?

1148
00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:24.061
Gosh, you're strong.

1149
00:42:24.061 --> 00:42:25.329
(He will show the strength of his gang.)

1150
00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:28.232
- You're strong. - Be careful, Jae Seok.

1151
00:42:28.833 --> 00:42:30.935
He'll fall forward. See?

1152
00:42:30.935 --> 00:42:32.770
- Come here. - Didn't it happen before?

1153
00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.638
I'm sorry. I started too early.

1154
00:42:34.638 --> 00:42:36.373
(He goes back.)

1155
00:42:36.874 --> 00:42:38.642
Seriously.

1156
00:42:38.642 --> 00:42:39.643
(He pretends like nothing happened.)

1157
00:42:39.643 --> 00:42:40.811
Hey.

1158
00:42:41.745 --> 00:42:43.647
- "Are you alone?" - Are you alone?

1159
00:42:43.647 --> 00:42:45.850
- Yes. - What's your name?

1160
00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:47.618
Is he Doctor Strange?

1161
00:42:48.118 --> 00:42:49.286
Doctor Strange?

1162
00:42:49.286 --> 00:42:54.024
(Jae Seok keeps turning back the time for Wrist Wrestling.)

1163
00:42:54.158 --> 00:42:56.327
- Here. - It repeats infinitely.

1164
00:42:56.327 --> 00:42:58.662
- Stop it. - Wait.

1165
00:42:58.662 --> 00:43:01.098
If you don't stop, you will die, Jae Seok.

1166
00:43:01.665 --> 00:43:03.567
He reminds me of my great-aunt.

1167
00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:05.636
(He looks like his great-aunt from the back.)

1168
00:43:05.636 --> 00:43:07.238
He looks very similar to my great-aunt.

1169
00:43:07.538 --> 00:43:09.807
I feel so bad. Please stop, Jae Seok.

1170
00:43:10.307 --> 00:43:11.475
His great-aunt?

1171
00:43:11.976 --> 00:43:14.144
- Please stop, Jae Seok. - That was great.

1172
00:43:14.144 --> 00:43:15.346
(He fails to take revenge.)

1173
00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:16.347
It doesn't work.

1174
00:43:17.848 --> 00:43:18.949
(Sae Ho volunteers.)

1175
00:43:18.949 --> 00:43:19.984
Sae Ho.

1176
00:43:20.517 --> 00:43:23.954
Sae Ho is going next. Let me tell you beforehand.

1177
00:43:24.521 --> 00:43:27.658
He comes from a family of strong men.

1178
00:43:27.658 --> 00:43:29.727
(Everyone probably didn't know.)

1179
00:43:29.727 --> 00:43:30.828
What?

1180
00:43:30.828 --> 00:43:33.597
Sae Ho's family became rich because...

1181
00:43:33.664 --> 00:43:35.733
they won oxen from wrestling.

1182
00:43:35.733 --> 00:43:37.835
(His family won oxen.)

1183
00:43:37.835 --> 00:43:39.937
- Is that so? - They won oxen from wrestling.

1184
00:43:40.204 --> 00:43:41.639
He comes from a family of strong men.

1185
00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:43.140
- I see. - Yes.

1186
00:43:43.607 --> 00:43:44.642
- Yes. - My family?

1187
00:43:44.642 --> 00:43:45.709
- Yes. - Really?

1188
00:43:45.976 --> 00:43:48.479
- Listen, Sae Ho. - If you bring up oxen,

1189
00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:49.847
my father will get flustered.

1190
00:43:49.847 --> 00:43:51.949
(The topic of oxen makes his father flustered.)

1191
00:43:51.949 --> 00:43:54.251
My father was very flustered after watching Running Man.

1192
00:43:54.518 --> 00:43:56.787
He said, "Are we a family of strong men?"

1193
00:43:57.254 --> 00:43:59.790
- "What do you say to other people?" - Stop it.

1194
00:44:02.459 --> 00:44:04.728
- Go to the center. - He has a good sense of balance.

1195
00:44:04.728 --> 00:44:08.165
This game isn't about strength.

1196
00:44:08.165 --> 00:44:09.466
- It requires technique. - Right.

1197
00:44:09.466 --> 00:44:13.270
(He's determined to change the reputation of his family.)

1198
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.305
Sae Ho will do well.

1199
00:44:14.305 --> 00:44:15.806
(He's determined to change the reputation of his family.)

1200
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.709
- Get ready, set, go. - Let's go.

1201
00:44:18.709 --> 00:44:21.145
(Will he defeat Jong Kook?)

1202
00:44:21.145 --> 00:44:23.047
(They're neck and neck.)

1203
00:44:24.348 --> 00:44:25.349
He's hanging on.

1204
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:29.086
(Sae Ho holds out quite well.)

1205
00:44:29.086 --> 00:44:31.689
(I'll show you the strength of my family.)

1206
00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:34.458
(He falls.)

1207
00:44:34.458 --> 00:44:35.926
What's the point of having a strong family?

1208
00:44:35.926 --> 00:44:37.962
(He fails to prove the strength of his family.)

1209
00:44:37.962 --> 00:44:39.296
He's incredible.

1210
00:44:39.396 --> 00:44:41.332
Daniel, give it a try.

1211
00:44:41.332 --> 00:44:44.268
- Right, Daniel is strong. - He looks great.

1212
00:44:44.268 --> 00:44:46.737
- Daniel, try it. - It's an experience.

1213
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:49.540
(He decides to try Wrist Wrestling.)

1214
00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.209
I can't do this to Daniel.

1215
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:53.811
Jong Kook.

1216
00:44:53.811 --> 00:44:55.145
(You should be gentle with him.)

1217
00:44:56.146 --> 00:44:57.147
Start.

1218
00:44:57.147 --> 00:44:58.115
(He plays gentle.)

1219
00:44:58.115 --> 00:44:59.116
Goodness.

1220
00:45:00.117 --> 00:45:02.619
(He fails to control his strength.)

1221
00:45:02.886 --> 00:45:04.355
- Are you okay? - Try it again.

1222
00:45:04.355 --> 00:45:05.889
- Attack him. - Are you okay, Daniel?

1223
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.425
- Are you okay? - Try it again.

1224
00:45:08.892 --> 00:45:10.427
I can't do it.

1225
00:45:10.461 --> 00:45:12.563
You should let him resist for five seconds.

1226
00:45:12.563 --> 00:45:13.731
That's interesting.

1227
00:45:14.331 --> 00:45:17.101
(I'm sorry. Please understand me.)

1228
00:45:17.868 --> 00:45:21.405
As a result, Sa Yeon is first place.

1229
00:45:21.405 --> 00:45:22.906
(She gets to choose her gang.)

1230
00:45:22.906 --> 00:45:25.876
- I'm sorry, but that's my jacket. - Is that so?

1231
00:45:25.876 --> 00:45:28.579
I need a jacket too.

1232
00:45:29.246 --> 00:45:30.347
I can't wear it. It's too hot.

1233
00:45:30.347 --> 00:45:32.082
It's incredibly thick.

1234
00:45:32.082 --> 00:45:34.518
(What kind of jacket is this?)

1235
00:45:34.518 --> 00:45:37.021
It keeps in a lot of heat.

1236
00:45:37.855 --> 00:45:39.289
(It must be very hot.)

1237
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.658
There are buttons...

1238
00:45:42.226 --> 00:45:43.660
- in the front. - Be careful.

1239
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.728
(Bosses and their teams)

1240
00:45:44.828 --> 00:45:47.398
Teams are determined now.

1241
00:45:47.664 --> 00:45:51.769
Daniel brought three types of weapons.

1242
00:45:52.369 --> 00:45:53.437
He has three?

1243
00:45:54.338 --> 00:45:56.040
The team to win...

1244
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.542
the most weapons will receive 200 dollars.

1245
00:45:58.542 --> 00:45:59.910
- 200 dollars? - That's great.

1246
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:00.978
Yes.

1247
00:46:01.645 --> 00:46:03.414
What did you bring, Daniel?

1248
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.750
As a new member, I worked hard to prepare them.

1249
00:46:07.451 --> 00:46:10.287
- It's Sweet Words in a Dialect. - Sae Ho can play Spinning in Place.

1250
00:46:10.287 --> 00:46:13.057
- What's Four Leg Run? - This is difficult.

1251
00:46:13.057 --> 00:46:14.124
It's hard.

1252
00:46:14.124 --> 00:46:15.959
How do we play Sweet Words in a Dialect?

1253
00:46:16.527 --> 00:46:19.096
You say sweet words while speaking...

1254
00:46:19.096 --> 00:46:20.330
in a dialect.

1255
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.599
- Women like them. - We must come up with words.

1256
00:46:22.599 --> 00:46:24.435
- Okay. - How about this?

1257
00:46:24.735 --> 00:46:27.004
Starting with Sae Ho, let's play 1 by 1.

1258
00:46:27.004 --> 00:46:29.039
- Okay. - Say them to Yeon Soo.

1259
00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:30.040
I'll say them to Yeon Soo.

1260
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.409
Without any bias,

1261
00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:35.212
- speak whatever is on your mind. - Okay.

1262
00:46:35.245 --> 00:46:36.246
Start.

1263
00:46:36.847 --> 00:46:41.251
(A man in a leather jacket walks with a macho gait.)

1264
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:46.623
(What sweet words will he say to Yeon Soo?)

1265
00:46:46.623 --> 00:46:50.727
(He fails already.)

1266
00:46:51.462 --> 00:46:53.397
You should walk slowly.

1267
00:46:54.098 --> 00:46:56.266
- Walk slowly. - The way you walked...

1268
00:46:56.266 --> 00:46:57.434
The way you walked...

1269
00:46:57.868 --> 00:47:00.037
I'm about to speak in Gyeongsang dialect.

1270
00:47:00.037 --> 00:47:02.106
However, when you walk...

1271
00:47:02.106 --> 00:47:03.607
- you should be gentler. - I'm from Gumi.

1272
00:47:03.607 --> 00:47:05.576
(He fails again.)

1273
00:47:05.976 --> 00:47:08.412
That's the wrong way to say it.

1274
00:47:08.445 --> 00:47:10.047
- That's not it. - Okay.

1275
00:47:10.747 --> 00:47:12.749
- Try it, Se Chan. To Yeon Soo. - To Yeon Soo?

1276
00:47:12.749 --> 00:47:14.351
- Can I do it with Yeon Soo? - Sure.

1277
00:47:14.785 --> 00:47:18.288
I'll play a sharp guy.

1278
00:47:18.956 --> 00:47:21.291
- I'll play a sharp guy. - All right.

1279
00:47:21.291 --> 00:47:22.626
(I'll steal Yeon Soo's heart.)

1280
00:47:23.227 --> 00:47:24.294
Hey.

1281
00:47:24.294 --> 00:47:26.730
(Hey)

1282
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.099
(He starts off with "Hey.")

1283
00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:33.504
(Will it win Yeon Soo's heart?)

1284
00:47:33.504 --> 00:47:35.038
What a pretty face.

1285
00:47:35.038 --> 00:47:36.140
Hey.

1286
00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.875
(What a pretty face.)

1287
00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:39.209
What?

1288
00:47:39.209 --> 00:47:40.410
What's wrong?

1289
00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.980
I mean...

1290
00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.015
- What's wrong? - That doesn't work.

1291
00:47:45.182 --> 00:47:46.817
Why?

1292
00:47:46.817 --> 00:47:48.018
You failed.

1293
00:47:48.385 --> 00:47:51.121
It was rude of you.

1294
00:47:51.455 --> 00:47:52.556
Next up is...

1295
00:47:52.956 --> 00:47:54.391
I lived...

1296
00:47:54.391 --> 00:47:56.793
in Changwon for a while.

1297
00:47:56.827 --> 00:47:57.828
Haha.

1298
00:47:57.828 --> 00:47:59.563
- I'll say it to Ji Hyo. - Okay.

1299
00:47:59.563 --> 00:48:00.898
Will you be okay?

1300
00:48:01.098 --> 00:48:02.266
Yes.

1301
00:48:02.599 --> 00:48:03.767
Cue.

1302
00:48:04.835 --> 00:48:05.836
Ji Hyo.

1303
00:48:07.037 --> 00:48:08.038
Eat this.

1304
00:48:08.639 --> 00:48:09.907
I picked it up on the street.

1305
00:48:09.907 --> 00:48:12.142
(Eat this. I picked it up on the street.)

1306
00:48:12.142 --> 00:48:13.477
You can react, Ji Hyo.

1307
00:48:13.477 --> 00:48:14.978
- Is it for me? - Yes.

1308
00:48:15.746 --> 00:48:17.548
Eat it. I picked it up on the street.

1309
00:48:17.581 --> 00:48:19.716
(Have it. I picked it up on the street.)

1310
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:21.251
You jerk, did you really pick it up?

1311
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:25.455
(You jerk, did you really pick it up?)

1312
00:48:25.455 --> 00:48:26.557
(How did you know?)

1313
00:48:26.557 --> 00:48:28.559
- You picked the wrong one. - You picked the wrong one.

1314
00:48:30.394 --> 00:48:31.562
You picked the wrong one.

1315
00:48:31.562 --> 00:48:33.297
You really picked it up on the street?

1316
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:34.831
- What did you throw at him? - What was it?

1317
00:48:34.831 --> 00:48:36.266
- What did you throw? - Did you see that?

1318
00:48:36.767 --> 00:48:38.001
I'm sorry.

1319
00:48:38.735 --> 00:48:42.039
He gave her something he really picked up on the street.

1320
00:48:42.439 --> 00:48:45.776
- Next up is Kwang Soo. - Yes.

1321
00:48:45.776 --> 00:48:47.077
- To whom? - Yeon Soo?

1322
00:48:47.477 --> 00:48:48.946
He should do it with So Min.

1323
00:48:48.946 --> 00:48:50.581
That sounds good.

1324
00:48:50.581 --> 00:48:53.016
It might be hard to escape her.

1325
00:48:53.584 --> 00:48:55.786
She won't let you go.

1326
00:48:56.353 --> 00:48:59.456
Kwang Soo, take off your jacket. Look cool.

1327
00:48:59.523 --> 00:49:01.458
- You look much better now. - Right?

1328
00:49:01.725 --> 00:49:03.961
He looks different.

1329
00:49:03.961 --> 00:49:05.095
Nice.

1330
00:49:05.095 --> 00:49:06.330
That shirt is so distracting.

1331
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.598
You look great.

1332
00:49:07.598 --> 00:49:09.600
Let's do this. Cue.

1333
00:49:10.367 --> 00:49:12.035
(Striding)

1334
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:17.107
(What will he say?)

1335
00:49:17.107 --> 00:49:18.208
You're cute.

1336
00:49:18.208 --> 00:49:23.580
(You're cute, So Min.)

1337
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:24.748
What's with you?

1338
00:49:24.848 --> 00:49:26.717
You know, I'm...

1339
00:49:26.717 --> 00:49:29.019
You know?

1340
00:49:29.019 --> 00:49:30.187
Say something.

1341
00:49:30.187 --> 00:49:31.622
What are you doing?

1342
00:49:31.622 --> 00:49:33.390
Were we strangers?

1343
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.458
(Puzzled)

1344
00:49:35.125 --> 00:49:40.297
(It's a line from the movie, "Nameless Gangster".)

1345
00:49:40.297 --> 00:49:44.268
(So Min even copied the gestures.)

1346
00:49:44.835 --> 00:49:46.937
"I went to the sauna with him."

1347
00:49:46.937 --> 00:49:48.705
You know?

1348
00:49:48.705 --> 00:49:51.541
Your... I mean...

1349
00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:53.277
Did I do something wrong?

1350
00:49:53.677 --> 00:49:55.345
I just said she was cute.

1351
00:49:55.912 --> 00:49:57.714
What's with her?

1352
00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:02.019
You did a great job.

1353
00:50:02.019 --> 00:50:03.387
Next up is Jong Kook.

1354
00:50:03.387 --> 00:50:04.521
- Okay. - To whom?

1355
00:50:04.521 --> 00:50:06.957
- Yeon Soo? - He's from Hapcheon.

1356
00:50:06.957 --> 00:50:08.458
He's good at speaking dialects.

1357
00:50:08.458 --> 00:50:10.027
Really?

1358
00:50:10.127 --> 00:50:12.596
Let's say we're watching TV at home.

1359
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.998
You're a couple, and you're at home?

1360
00:50:14.998 --> 00:50:16.366
- Are you married? - Are you married?

1361
00:50:16.566 --> 00:50:18.602
- They're newly-weds. - They're married.

1362
00:50:19.503 --> 00:50:21.038
They almost kissed during that Yellow Radish Game.

1363
00:50:21.772 --> 00:50:22.806
Cue.

1364
00:50:24.708 --> 00:50:26.310
Watch anything you like.

1365
00:50:26.877 --> 00:50:28.445
Okay. What should we watch?

1366
00:50:29.746 --> 00:50:33.116
(What sweet words will Jong Kook say?)

1367
00:50:33.116 --> 00:50:34.351
I'll just watch you.

1368
00:50:34.351 --> 00:50:38.388
(Cheesy)

1369
00:50:39.156 --> 00:50:43.126
(Everyone is revolting.)

1370
00:50:43.126 --> 00:50:44.628
Jong Kook.

1371
00:50:44.728 --> 00:50:46.096
That was nice.

1372
00:50:46.096 --> 00:50:47.497
(So Min likes it.)

1373
00:50:47.597 --> 00:50:48.865
What?

1374
00:50:48.965 --> 00:50:50.367
What's wrong?

1375
00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:52.002
Jong Kook is disgusting.

1376
00:50:52.002 --> 00:50:54.104
- Gosh. - You're disgusting.

1377
00:50:54.371 --> 00:50:56.640
- You've changed a lot. - What?

1378
00:50:56.707 --> 00:50:58.408
Gosh, please stop.

1379
00:50:58.575 --> 00:50:59.910
That's enough.

1380
00:51:00.377 --> 00:51:03.847
Daniel, please show us.

1381
00:51:03.847 --> 00:51:05.849
- I have an idea. - You do?

1382
00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:07.250
- Improvise. - I'll do it with Sa Yeon.

1383
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:10.087
(I'll do it with Sa Yeon.)

1384
00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:12.656
Daniel and I?

1385
00:51:12.656 --> 00:51:14.257
(Thrilled)

1386
00:51:14.958 --> 00:51:16.059
Okay.

1387
00:51:16.059 --> 00:51:17.060
Here we go.

1388
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.229
- Ms. Noh. - Yes?

1389
00:51:19.329 --> 00:51:21.765
(Ms. Noh.)

1390
00:51:21.965 --> 00:51:27.437
(What will the variety show novice say?)

1391
00:51:27.437 --> 00:51:29.005
Can I call you Sa Yeon for today?

1392
00:51:29.005 --> 00:51:34.077
(Can I call you Sa Yeon?)

1393
00:51:34.811 --> 00:51:40.117
(Daniel's dialect makes their hearts skip a beat.)

1394
00:51:40.117 --> 00:51:43.019
- That's... - Good job.

1395
00:51:43.019 --> 00:51:44.888
Why are you guys so excited?

1396
00:51:45.255 --> 00:51:47.124
It's...

1397
00:51:47.124 --> 00:51:48.959
- my lucky day! - Sa Yeon.

1398
00:51:49.326 --> 00:51:51.128
Can I call you Mom from now on?

1399
00:51:51.128 --> 00:51:54.598
(Can I call you Mom?)

1400
00:51:54.598 --> 00:51:56.066
Why would you do that?

1401
00:51:56.066 --> 00:51:58.268
You already have a mom.

1402
00:51:58.268 --> 00:52:00.937
(Sa Yeon suddenly has another son.)

1403
00:52:00.937 --> 00:52:02.139
Mom.

1404
00:52:02.139 --> 00:52:03.707
Buy me some winter clothes.

1405
00:52:04.141 --> 00:52:05.909
How long do I have to wear this jacket?

1406
00:52:06.276 --> 00:52:08.578
I don't have a son like you.

1407
00:52:08.578 --> 00:52:11.848
(I don't have a son like you.)

1408
00:52:11.848 --> 00:52:14.084
- What dialect is that? - What dialect is that?

1409
00:52:14.184 --> 00:52:15.752
- What's that? - What's that?

1410
00:52:15.752 --> 00:52:17.788
(What dialect is that?)

1411
00:52:17.788 --> 00:52:18.855
What's that?

1412
00:52:19.156 --> 00:52:20.657
I loved what you said.

1413
00:52:20.657 --> 00:52:22.159
Daniel is...

1414
00:52:22.159 --> 00:52:24.561
Can't I give it a try?

1415
00:52:24.561 --> 00:52:27.063
- Yeon Soo. - I want to try role-play.

1416
00:52:27.063 --> 00:52:28.231
Sure.

1417
00:52:28.432 --> 00:52:30.267
- With Jong Kook. - With me?

1418
00:52:30.867 --> 00:52:35.005
(What's going on between these two?)

1419
00:52:35.005 --> 00:52:36.139
Today...

1420
00:52:36.139 --> 00:52:38.041
Look at Jong Kook's clothes.

1421
00:52:38.041 --> 00:52:40.677
- Look how he's dressed. - Goodness.

1422
00:52:40.677 --> 00:52:42.245
I've been watching.

1423
00:52:42.245 --> 00:52:44.414
Why do you two keep doing things together?

1424
00:52:44.548 --> 00:52:46.583
In reality, Kwang Soo is more interested in her.

1425
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.020
You don't know what will happen once I take off this wig.

1426
00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.388
(You don't know what will happen.)

1427
00:52:51.388 --> 00:52:52.656
Please say, "Yeon Soo, I'll get going."

1428
00:52:52.656 --> 00:52:53.657
Yeon Soo, I'll get going.

1429
00:52:53.657 --> 00:52:55.125
(The second role-play starts.)

1430
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:56.226
- Right now? - Yes.

1431
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.661
Yeon Soo, I'll get going.

1432
00:52:57.661 --> 00:52:59.396
- Okay. Bye. - Bye.

1433
00:53:00.697 --> 00:53:01.932
Jong Kook!

1434
00:53:01.932 --> 00:53:05.202
(Jong Kook!)

1435
00:53:05.202 --> 00:53:10.207
(Yeon Soo runs to Jong Kook. What's going to happen?)

1436
00:53:10.207 --> 00:53:11.541
(Hugging)

1437
00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:13.043
What are they doing?

1438
00:53:13.043 --> 00:53:14.711
(She hugs him from the back.)

1439
00:53:14.711 --> 00:53:16.213
What are they doing?

1440
00:53:16.213 --> 00:53:18.081
- What are you doing? - Yeon Soo is...

1441
00:53:18.715 --> 00:53:20.217
What are you doing?

1442
00:53:20.817 --> 00:53:22.519
Seriously, what is this?

1443
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.756
I love this game.

1444
00:53:26.756 --> 00:53:28.725
This is great. She wins.

1445
00:53:28.725 --> 00:53:30.060
- I win. - She wins.

1446
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.328
She wins.

1447
00:53:31.328 --> 00:53:32.829
- What are you talking about? - She wins.

1448
00:53:32.996 --> 00:53:34.197
Jong Kook.

1449
00:53:34.197 --> 00:53:35.866
(Let me try.)

1450
00:53:35.866 --> 00:53:38.001
- Let me try too. Jong Kook. - What are you doing?

1451
00:53:38.001 --> 00:53:39.836
- Jong Kook. - Stop it.

1452
00:53:39.836 --> 00:53:41.638
- Jong Kook. - What's with you?

1453
00:53:42.405 --> 00:53:43.540
(They look like they're having fun.)

1454
00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.709
- What's with you? - Go away!

1455
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.478
Oh, my. Are you angry?

1456
00:53:48.678 --> 00:53:50.247
Mom, buy me jeans.

1457
00:53:50.247 --> 00:53:52.983
(He's here again.)

1458
00:53:54.184 --> 00:53:56.786
- Mom. - Buy me clothes.

1459
00:53:56.887 --> 00:54:00.190
Mom, I want matching clothes like yours.

1460
00:54:00.557 --> 00:54:01.725
Matching clothes.

1461
00:54:02.025 --> 00:54:03.460
He's a childish son.

1462
00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.728
(Every family has one.)

1463
00:54:04.828 --> 00:54:06.496
I want to take English classes.

1464
00:54:07.063 --> 00:54:08.231
Oh, my.

1465
00:54:08.231 --> 00:54:11.201
Seok Jin is very unhappy right now.

1466
00:54:11.201 --> 00:54:14.638
- Yeon Soo doesn't even look at him. - I mean...

1467
00:54:14.638 --> 00:54:17.774
- I can try with Seok Jin. - Sure.

1468
00:54:17.774 --> 00:54:19.709
(I can try with Seok Jin.)

1469
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:23.146
Seok Jin is happy.

1470
00:54:23.213 --> 00:54:24.681
I guess she hates me.

1471
00:54:24.681 --> 00:54:27.250
(He thinks Yeon Soo hates him.)

1472
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:28.285
Okay.

1473
00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:30.453
How many have you prepared?

1474
00:54:30.687 --> 00:54:31.755
Here we go.

1475
00:54:31.755 --> 00:54:34.057
(You don't know what will happen when I take off this wig.)

1476
00:54:34.057 --> 00:54:35.959
We're at an aquarium.

1477
00:54:36.059 --> 00:54:39.062
- We're looking at tropical fish. - Tropical fish?

1478
00:54:39.162 --> 00:54:41.197
There's an octopus.

1479
00:54:41.197 --> 00:54:44.000
(There's an octopus at the aquarium.)

1480
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.201
Be quiet.

1481
00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:48.271
It's my turn soon. Be quiet.

1482
00:54:48.271 --> 00:54:49.372
It's a blowfish.

1483
00:54:49.439 --> 00:54:50.607
(You're an octopus.)

1484
00:54:50.607 --> 00:54:51.641
An octopus?

1485
00:54:51.975 --> 00:54:53.910
(He starts to swim around.)

1486
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.478
What is this?

1487
00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.181
What did I do wrong?

1488
00:55:02.018 --> 00:55:05.055
Seok Jin, are you happy to be with me here?

1489
00:55:05.055 --> 00:55:06.289
(The role-play starts.)

1490
00:55:06.289 --> 00:55:07.357
Of course.

1491
00:55:07.457 --> 00:55:08.558
Give me a kiss.

1492
00:55:08.558 --> 00:55:13.163
(Give me a kiss.)

1493
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:16.199
(A kiss?)

1494
00:55:16.199 --> 00:55:20.437
(This is too much.)

1495
00:55:20.437 --> 00:55:21.938
Those idiots are going overboard.

1496
00:55:21.938 --> 00:55:25.809
(The octopus passing by is at a loss for words.)

1497
00:55:26.076 --> 00:55:28.178
(The octopus said the correct answer.)

1498
00:55:28.178 --> 00:55:29.946
- Good job. - Did you hear me?

1499
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.248
I was in the aquarium. How could you hear me?

1500
00:55:33.583 --> 00:55:36.286
(The octopus wrapped it up nicely.)

1501
00:55:36.286 --> 00:55:39.289
That was very nice. Kwang Soo.

1502
00:55:39.889 --> 00:55:41.891
So Min, do you want to try?

1503
00:55:42.058 --> 00:55:43.159
Which one?

1504
00:55:43.159 --> 00:55:45.228
- The kiss? - What?

1505
00:55:45.228 --> 00:55:46.796
I mean...

1506
00:55:47.197 --> 00:55:49.099
What kiss?

1507
00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:51.267
- I mean the role-play. - Role-play?

1508
00:55:51.267 --> 00:55:52.936
- No kissing? - No.

1509
00:55:53.036 --> 00:55:54.504
Sae Ho, do you want to try?

1510
00:55:54.504 --> 00:55:55.705
- Okay. - Okay.

1511
00:55:56.006 --> 00:55:58.808
Just improvise. You never know what So Min will say.

1512
00:55:59.476 --> 00:56:02.245
Why do you keep showing up?

1513
00:56:02.245 --> 00:56:03.913
- Sae Ho. - Get off of me.

1514
00:56:03.913 --> 00:56:05.448
What's with you?

1515
00:56:05.582 --> 00:56:07.017
- Stop it. - Sae Ho.

1516
00:56:07.017 --> 00:56:09.119
Why are you taking off my clothes?

1517
00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:10.286
Wait.

1518
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.355
- What is going on? - Why are you taking off my clothes?

1519
00:56:12.856 --> 00:56:14.658
What is going on?

1520
00:56:14.658 --> 00:56:16.893
What is she doing?

1521
00:56:17.127 --> 00:56:18.995
What's happening?

1522
00:56:19.095 --> 00:56:21.231
What are you doing?

1523
00:56:21.231 --> 00:56:22.732
He came home.

1524
00:56:22.732 --> 00:56:24.234
- What's happening? - There's a scene...

1525
00:56:24.234 --> 00:56:26.603
like this in "The Outlaws", but can she do that?

1526
00:56:27.771 --> 00:56:30.040
There's a scene like this in "The Outlaws".

1527
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.441
(It's not that scene.)

1528
00:56:31.608 --> 00:56:33.410
My husband came home.

1529
00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.578
- I'm your husband? - Yes.

1530
00:56:35.645 --> 00:56:37.047
You should have told me.

1531
00:56:37.047 --> 00:56:39.482
I thought you just randomly showed up.

1532
00:56:39.749 --> 00:56:42.385
What are you doing, So Min?

1533
00:56:43.253 --> 00:56:44.521
(I'll open the door first.)

1534
00:56:44.521 --> 00:56:45.955
It's over.

1535
00:56:46.456 --> 00:56:48.058
(The role-play is over.)

1536
00:56:48.058 --> 00:56:50.060
- It's over? - What were you doing?

1537
00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.995
I was opening the door.

1538
00:56:51.995 --> 00:56:53.229
- It's over. - Okay.

1539
00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:55.498
(I wanted to start over.)

1540
00:56:56.166 --> 00:56:57.434
This is awkward.

1541
00:56:57.434 --> 00:57:00.370
(After So Min took his jacket off, he feels awkward.)

1542
00:57:01.638 --> 00:57:02.639
She took off your clothes.

1543
00:57:02.639 --> 00:57:05.175
(The game ends in a tie.)

1544
00:57:05.475 --> 00:57:06.810
The next game is Spinning in Place.

1545
00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.445
- It's... - Sae Ho is good at it.

1546
00:57:08.445 --> 00:57:09.979
No one can beat him.

1547
00:57:09.979 --> 00:57:11.481
(Sae Ho is invincible when it comes to Spinning in Place.)

1548
00:57:11.481 --> 00:57:15.018
(During the Family Outing Special last July,)

1549
00:57:15.085 --> 00:57:18.755
(Sae Ho showed unrivaled talent during Spinning in Place.)

1550
00:57:18.855 --> 00:57:23.660
(He touched Jae Seok's nose after spinning 20 times in place.)

1551
00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.497
(He's the king of Spinning in Place.)

1552
00:57:27.797 --> 00:57:28.765
It makes you very dizzy.

1553
00:57:29.265 --> 00:57:30.366
- Right? - Yes.

1554
00:57:30.366 --> 00:57:31.935
- Have you spun 20 times? - Start.

1555
00:57:32.535 --> 00:57:34.604
(Spinning)

1556
00:57:34.771 --> 00:57:36.773
(He spins extremely fast.)

1557
00:57:36.773 --> 00:57:38.641
- 4, 5. - He wins if he does it.

1558
00:57:38.708 --> 00:57:40.477
(He's much faster than Sae Ho.)

1559
00:57:40.477 --> 00:57:42.445
He's the winner if he wins this game.

1560
00:57:42.445 --> 00:57:44.647
- He's faster than Sae Ho. - 6, 7, 8.

1561
00:57:45.448 --> 00:57:47.250
- Can he do it? - He spins well.

1562
00:57:47.617 --> 00:57:49.452
- He's so fast. - He's young after all.

1563
00:57:49.452 --> 00:57:50.754
He deserves an applause after spinning.

1564
00:57:50.754 --> 00:57:52.155
It's enough to make you dizzy.

1565
00:57:52.889 --> 00:57:55.125
18, 19, 20.

1566
00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:56.126
Here he goes.

1567
00:57:56.126 --> 00:57:57.293
(He spins 20 times very quickly.)

1568
00:57:58.027 --> 00:58:03.500
(He succeeds if he walks straight to Kwang Soo's nose.)

1569
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.436
(He stumbles.)

1570
00:58:06.703 --> 00:58:09.372
(This is the wrong direction.)

1571
00:58:09.372 --> 00:58:10.440
He's flustered.

1572
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.541
What's wrong?

1573
00:58:12.075 --> 00:58:13.076
I'm over here.

1574
00:58:13.076 --> 00:58:14.711
- Why did you grab me? - I'm here.

1575
00:58:15.478 --> 00:58:18.314
- Daniel is just like us. - I was surprised.

1576
00:58:18.314 --> 00:58:20.316
(Why is this his strongest weapon?)

1577
00:58:20.316 --> 00:58:21.618
- He's human. - Are you okay?

1578
00:58:21.618 --> 00:58:24.988
- Are you okay? - I wanted to show you something.

1579
00:58:26.289 --> 00:58:28.024
It's good to see him work hard.

1580
00:58:28.024 --> 00:58:29.292
(It's okay even if he's clumsy.)

1581
00:58:29.292 --> 00:58:31.561
The last one is Four Leg Run.

1582
00:58:31.995 --> 00:58:33.997
Three members will volunteer and play.

1583
00:58:33.997 --> 00:58:35.565
One from each team should volunteer.

1584
00:58:35.565 --> 00:58:37.667
(Including Daniel, one member from each team plays.)

1585
00:58:38.635 --> 00:58:41.271
- Let's go, Daniel. - Let's go.

1586
00:58:41.805 --> 00:58:42.872
Let's go, Se Chan.

1587
00:58:42.872 --> 00:58:43.907
(Daniel, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan play.)

1588
00:58:43.907 --> 00:58:44.974
All right.

1589
00:58:45.008 --> 00:58:46.309
(Kang Daniel, Lee Kwang Soo, Yang Se Chan)

1590
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:48.077
Now...

1591
00:58:48.444 --> 00:58:50.680
- Look at Kwang Soo. - Do you know the type?

1592
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.182
Gosh, look at him.

1593
00:58:52.348 --> 00:58:53.716
He looks scary.

1594
00:58:54.517 --> 00:58:57.687
Daniel, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan will play.

1595
00:58:58.087 --> 00:59:00.557
I'm nervous after...

1596
00:59:00.957 --> 00:59:03.459
watching Daniel play Spinning in Place.

1597
00:59:03.726 --> 00:59:06.963
He isn't good at it.

1598
00:59:06.963 --> 00:59:08.765
- He doesn't seem good. - I know.

1599
00:59:09.265 --> 00:59:11.201
He seems athletic though.

1600
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:13.002
He's ambitious.

1601
00:59:13.002 --> 00:59:15.038
Be careful, Daniel.

1602
00:59:16.206 --> 00:59:17.774
If you're hurt, I'm hurt too.

1603
00:59:17.774 --> 00:59:18.808
(I'll do better this time.)

1604
00:59:18.908 --> 00:59:20.210
Get ready.

1605
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:22.846
(Will ambitious Daniel win this time?)

1606
00:59:22.846 --> 00:59:23.980
Set.

1607
00:59:25.215 --> 00:59:26.249
(Four Leg Run starts.)

1608
00:59:26.249 --> 00:59:27.350
Here they come.

1609
00:59:27.584 --> 00:59:30.119
Why is there a ribbon?

1610
00:59:30.119 --> 00:59:31.254
(Kwang Soo charges forward.)

1611
00:59:31.688 --> 00:59:33.156
(He trips.)

1612
00:59:33.623 --> 00:59:34.657
What's this?

1613
00:59:34.657 --> 00:59:35.725
(While Kwang Soo falls,)

1614
00:59:35.725 --> 00:59:38.661
(Se Chan moves forward.)

1615
00:59:39.429 --> 00:59:42.832
(Much faster than Se Chan, Daniel takes the lead.)

1616
00:59:42.832 --> 00:59:44.234
Daniel is good.

1617
00:59:46.536 --> 00:59:49.105
(Where is he headed?)

1618
00:59:49.105 --> 00:59:52.575
Daniel isn't doing well. What is he doing?

1619
00:59:52.976 --> 00:59:54.777
(He moves forward without looking.)

1620
00:59:54.777 --> 00:59:55.979
What is he doing?

1621
00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.748
Daniel, watch out.

1622
00:59:59.115 --> 01:00:01.084
- I'm sorry. - What's wrong with him?

1623
01:00:01.084 --> 01:00:02.118
(He crashes with the cameras.)

1624
01:00:02.118 --> 01:00:03.186
I couldn't see the front.

1625
01:00:03.186 --> 01:00:04.287
(He's flustered.)

1626
01:00:04.287 --> 01:00:05.555
- You came in first. - I'm sorry.

1627
01:00:05.555 --> 01:00:07.523
Where did you go?

1628
01:00:07.523 --> 01:00:09.325
I couldn't see ahead.

1629
01:00:09.325 --> 01:00:10.326
(Daniel's clumsiness is confirmed.)

1630
01:00:10.326 --> 01:00:12.729
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, Daniel.

1631
01:00:13.963 --> 01:00:19.535
(He had to stop due to a crash.)

1632
01:00:19.602 --> 01:00:24.274
(Daniel is accepted as the winner as he arrived first.)

1633
01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:26.910
I think Daniel determined...

1634
01:00:27.076 --> 01:00:28.912
his personality on variety shows.

1635
01:00:28.912 --> 01:00:31.047
- I didn't expect it. - This is great.

1636
01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.682
I thought he was a rhinoceros.

1637
01:00:32.715 --> 01:00:34.350
(Daniel kept moving forward.)

1638
01:00:35.018 --> 01:00:36.519
- That's not it. - Why did you drag it?

1639
01:00:36.519 --> 01:00:37.520
I tripped.

1640
01:00:37.954 --> 01:00:40.857
I pulled up my pants to run faster.

1641
01:00:40.857 --> 01:00:43.326
Running Man took away all the hair on my body.

1642
01:00:43.426 --> 01:00:46.329
(He realizes the truth.)

1643
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:48.698
(He recalls being waxed.)

1644
01:00:48.698 --> 01:00:50.166
I didn't realize it for two days.

1645
01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:51.434
(It was a painful experience.)

1646
01:00:53.102 --> 01:00:54.137
I'd forgotten about it.

1647
01:00:54.137 --> 01:00:56.773
(Thanks to Running Man, he's smooth all over.)

1648
01:00:56.773 --> 01:00:59.042
We aren't quite sure,

1649
01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:02.211
but Daniel places first anyway.

1650
01:01:02.478 --> 01:01:03.546
Thank you.

1651
01:01:03.546 --> 01:01:04.847
(Daniel wins Four Leg Run.)

1652
01:01:05.081 --> 01:01:08.618
Mungdol Gang, the winner of Four Leg Run,

1653
01:01:08.618 --> 01:01:10.887
will receive 200 dollars.

1654
01:01:10.887 --> 01:01:11.955
(Mungdol Gang wins 200 dollars.)

1655
01:01:11.955 --> 01:01:14.457
After you change into the outfits that your bosses have chosen,

1656
01:01:14.457 --> 01:01:16.826
we'll start the race.

1657
01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:20.296
(After they get changed, the race officially starts.)

1658
01:01:21.497 --> 01:01:24.701
As you might be hungry, we'll go to a restaurant.

1659
01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:26.436
- That's great. - We're going to eat.

1660
01:01:26.769 --> 01:01:30.306
The bosses will receive...

1661
01:01:30.306 --> 01:01:32.208
1,000 dollars.

1662
01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:33.309
I see.

1663
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:36.713
(1,000 dollars is given to the boss of each gang.)

1664
01:01:36.713 --> 01:01:37.814
Aren't you our boss?

1665
01:01:37.814 --> 01:01:38.815
- Boss. - 1,000 dollars?

1666
01:01:38.815 --> 01:01:40.516
As I told you before,

1667
01:01:40.516 --> 01:01:43.086
1,000 dollars will be given as a prize.

1668
01:01:43.086 --> 01:01:45.088
It will be given to one member in reality.

1669
01:01:45.088 --> 01:01:46.889
- In reality? - Yes.

1670
01:01:46.889 --> 01:01:47.957
Really?

1671
01:01:48.257 --> 01:01:52.161
Mungdol Gang has earned 200 dollars as of now.

1672
01:01:52.595 --> 01:01:54.831
- It's a total of 1,200 dollars. - That's a lot.

1673
01:01:55.365 --> 01:01:59.268
- Sae Ho. - Awesome.

1674
01:01:59.268 --> 01:02:01.504
Are you the chauffeur...

1675
01:02:01.504 --> 01:02:03.539
for the man and the two ladies?

1676
01:02:04.707 --> 01:02:06.376
I haven't determined my character yet.

1677
01:02:06.376 --> 01:02:07.577
Is that so?

1678
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:11.547
Are you Piggy Mom?

1679
01:02:11.547 --> 01:02:14.417
I can play any type of character.

1680
01:02:14.417 --> 01:02:15.952
(Look for Piggy Mom at the entrance.)

1681
01:02:15.952 --> 01:02:19.122
Each gang has a boss.

1682
01:02:19.122 --> 01:02:21.157
The boss has the authority...

1683
01:02:21.157 --> 01:02:24.227
to distribute the capital to the gang members.

1684
01:02:24.227 --> 01:02:25.495
That's awesome.

1685
01:02:25.595 --> 01:02:28.164
Does the boss distribute it however he wants?

1686
01:02:28.398 --> 01:02:31.200
Let me tell you about...

1687
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:33.236
Boss' Unfair Deal.

1688
01:02:33.603 --> 01:02:35.805
The boss may equally distribute...

1689
01:02:35.805 --> 01:02:38.641
the capital of 1,000 dollars to the gang members.

1690
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:42.178
He may distribute 250 dollars each.

1691
01:02:42.178 --> 01:02:43.479
- Or? - Or...

1692
01:02:43.479 --> 01:02:46.015
he may distribute it unfairly...

1693
01:02:46.015 --> 01:02:48.017
however he likes.

1694
01:02:48.684 --> 01:02:52.522
Gang members can't find out how much capital is distributed.

1695
01:02:52.522 --> 01:02:54.957
- However, the gang members... - We can't find out.

1696
01:02:54.957 --> 01:02:57.326
get one chance to revolt and find out...

1697
01:02:57.326 --> 01:03:02.999
how much capital they're given before the final race.

1698
01:03:03.332 --> 01:03:04.500
Revolt?

1699
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.536
If you suspect the boss to be unfair,

1700
01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:08.404
you may use the Revolution Card.

1701
01:03:08.404 --> 01:03:10.306
You may find out how much you received.

1702
01:03:10.306 --> 01:03:11.808
It's better to distribute fairly.

1703
01:03:11.808 --> 01:03:14.710
If you find out that the boss distributed fairly,

1704
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.080
then it was wrong to revolt.

1705
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.081
I see.

1706
01:03:18.081 --> 01:03:21.184
All distributed capital will return to the boss.

1707
01:03:21.184 --> 01:03:25.455
(All distributed capital returns to the boss.)

1708
01:03:25.455 --> 01:03:27.256
That's great.

1709
01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.726
If the boss distributed unfairly, the revolt is successful.

1710
01:03:30.726 --> 01:03:33.596
The boss' capital is divided equally to the members.

1711
01:03:33.596 --> 01:03:34.664
After a while...

1712
01:03:34.664 --> 01:03:37.100
- The boss can act suspiciously. - Right.

1713
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.768
There are many who love to revolt.

1714
01:03:38.768 --> 01:03:41.337
I'll use it now.

1715
01:03:42.038 --> 01:03:43.106
Can we use it now?

1716
01:03:43.106 --> 01:03:44.540
You have to do it in secret.

1717
01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.210
(He revolts instinctively.)

1718
01:03:48.311 --> 01:03:49.479
(How will the bosses distribute?)

1719
01:03:49.479 --> 01:03:51.481
In your standing order,

1720
01:03:51.481 --> 01:03:53.416
Yeon Soo will decide first.

1721
01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:56.385
(Yeon Soo starts to distribute.)

1722
01:03:56.385 --> 01:04:00.289
(The boss gets everything if someone revolts when distributed fairly.)

1723
01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:01.357
Let's see.

1724
01:04:01.357 --> 01:04:03.559
(Members get the capital when distributed unfairly.)

1725
01:04:03.559 --> 01:04:04.827
To Kwang Soo...

1726
01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:07.296
To Seok Jin...

1727
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:11.467
(How did the bosses distribute the capital?)

1728
01:04:11.767 --> 01:04:13.369
- Let's go. - Here we go.

1729
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:15.004
Let's go.

1730
01:04:15.004 --> 01:04:16.038
(They head to the restaurant.)

1731
01:04:16.639 --> 01:04:19.709
- Our boss is competitive, right? - Yes, she's strong.

1732
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:21.377
She's also ambitious.

1733
01:04:21.911 --> 01:04:24.680
She's not the type to do something ordinary.

1734
01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.815
- That's right. - Never.

1735
01:04:25.815 --> 01:04:28.518
I bet she didn't give herself 250 dollars.

1736
01:04:28.518 --> 01:04:29.986
That's possible.

1737
01:04:29.986 --> 01:04:31.687
It doesn't matter.

1738
01:04:31.687 --> 01:04:34.157
You can be suspicious and use the Revolution Card.

1739
01:04:34.157 --> 01:04:35.224
(If you're confident...)

1740
01:04:35.224 --> 01:04:36.325
- Do you want all the money? - I'm okay.

1741
01:04:36.325 --> 01:04:39.162
Yes, I'll take all.

1742
01:04:39.595 --> 01:04:41.797
- Please use the card. - We won't suspect you.

1743
01:04:43.099 --> 01:04:44.867
Let's be friends.

1744
01:04:44.867 --> 01:04:46.235
We're so great.

1745
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:48.404
- We trust Yeon Soo. - Seriously.

1746
01:04:48.404 --> 01:04:49.405
We trust you completely.

1747
01:04:49.705 --> 01:04:50.706
We turn right.

1748
01:04:50.706 --> 01:04:52.208
(On the other hand...)

1749
01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:53.543
That's good.

1750
01:04:54.076 --> 01:04:55.178
We're turning right.

1751
01:04:55.178 --> 01:04:56.946
(Piggy Mom is driving.)

1752
01:04:57.213 --> 01:04:59.482
It may be too early to bring it up,

1753
01:04:59.482 --> 01:05:02.251
but did you distribute the capital evenly?

1754
01:05:02.251 --> 01:05:04.187
- 300 dollars each. - Right?

1755
01:05:04.187 --> 01:05:06.255
- Can we trust you? - Yes.

1756
01:05:06.255 --> 01:05:07.256
I distributed 300 dollars each.

1757
01:05:08.357 --> 01:05:10.393
Did you give 250 dollars each?

1758
01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.795
- For gangs, - That's right.

1759
01:05:12.795 --> 01:05:14.497
loyalty and trust are important.

1760
01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:15.565
Of course.

1761
01:05:15.565 --> 01:05:16.566
(Are they telling the truth?)

1762
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.502
There's a lake.

1763
01:05:19.735 --> 01:05:20.836
It's bulgogi.

1764
01:05:20.836 --> 01:05:21.904
(They arrive at the restaurant.)

1765
01:05:21.904 --> 01:05:23.706
There's seasoned raw beef and pajeon.

1766
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.908
Please sit with your team.

1767
01:05:26.475 --> 01:05:28.211
(Yuchen Gang sit down quickly.)

1768
01:05:28.211 --> 01:05:31.847
He's the manager of the restaurant.

1769
01:05:31.847 --> 01:05:33.015
- Is that so? - Yes.

1770
01:05:33.115 --> 01:05:34.817
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

1771
01:05:34.817 --> 01:05:36.886
- Hello. - Over here.

1772
01:05:36.886 --> 01:05:38.854
Bring some more meat.

1773
01:05:39.956 --> 01:05:41.257
- Please sit down. - Thank you.

1774
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:42.325
He fits perfectly.

1775
01:05:43.159 --> 01:05:44.827
(He works hard to keep the customers satisfied.)

1776
01:05:46.395 --> 01:05:50.099
(It's time to enjoy the food.)

1777
01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:53.769
We should eat well.

1778
01:05:53.769 --> 01:05:55.605
- Give me your plate, Seok Jin. - Okay.

1779
01:05:55.605 --> 01:05:56.806
(Sa Yeon takes care of the younger members.)

1780
01:05:56.806 --> 01:05:58.274
Thank you. That's a lot of meat.

1781
01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.810
If you only look at these four,

1782
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:04.313
Sa Yeon seems like a charity worker.

1783
01:06:05.948 --> 01:06:07.950
She's someone who helps...

1784
01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:10.186
the poor.

1785
01:06:10.353 --> 01:06:11.854
She's full of love.

1786
01:06:12.455 --> 01:06:14.056
She washes and feeds them.

1787
01:06:14.056 --> 01:06:15.258
(She shares food with love and kindness.)

1788
01:06:15.258 --> 01:06:16.826
I agree.

1789
01:06:16.826 --> 01:06:17.960
- She serves us too. - I can't help but agree.

1790
01:06:18.327 --> 01:06:20.396
I agree as well.

1791
01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:21.831
(She raised them with love.)

1792
01:06:22.865 --> 01:06:24.267
Did you enjoy the meal?

1793
01:06:24.267 --> 01:06:25.334
- Yes. - Yes.

1794
01:06:25.835 --> 01:06:28.871
Before we move on to the next round,

1795
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:32.208
does anyone want to use the Revolution Card?

1796
01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:36.579
(Does anyone want to use the Revolution Card?)

1797
01:06:36.579 --> 01:06:39.115
We trust each other, right?

1798
01:06:39.248 --> 01:06:41.851
Our boss tells us we should never do that.

1799
01:06:41.984 --> 01:06:43.352
Why would you revolt?

1800
01:06:43.352 --> 01:06:45.154
We have no reason to.

1801
01:06:45.354 --> 01:06:46.555
- So... - Trust us.

1802
01:06:46.555 --> 01:06:47.556
we will...

1803
01:06:48.824 --> 01:06:51.460
(Sa Yeon is a kind boss.)

1804
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.597
(Considering her character...)

1805
01:06:55.298 --> 01:06:56.699
We will use the Revolution Card.

1806
01:06:56.699 --> 01:06:59.869
- You are unbelievable. - We will use the Revolution Card.

1807
01:06:59.869 --> 01:07:01.203
- Why would you use it? - I have my reasons.

1808
01:07:01.203 --> 01:07:02.305
- Who wants to use it? - Listen.

1809
01:07:02.305 --> 01:07:04.206
- I have my reasons. - You are unbelievable.

1810
01:07:04.206 --> 01:07:05.207
Already?

1811
01:07:05.308 --> 01:07:08.644
She fed you, tucked you in, and bathed you. Have you no shame?

1812
01:07:09.578 --> 01:07:11.547
(It's fun to witness betrayal.)

1813
01:07:12.181 --> 01:07:13.749
Do you want to check how much I gave you?

1814
01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:16.619
Then you have to pay me back.

1815
01:07:16.619 --> 01:07:19.055
(Then you have to pay me back.)

1816
01:07:19.055 --> 01:07:20.156
Really?

1817
01:07:20.156 --> 01:07:22.625
- Then you won't have any money. - That's right.

1818
01:07:22.792 --> 01:07:24.060
Are you really going to use it, Kwang Soo?

1819
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.329
- Do you want to check? - Let's discuss once more.

1820
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:28.097
In 1, 2, 3.

1821
01:07:28.097 --> 01:07:30.499
- We will use it. - We will use it.

1822
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.768
(They are ungrateful.)

1823
01:07:32.768 --> 01:07:37.039
I will announce how the capital of Yuchen Gang was distributed.

1824
01:07:37.707 --> 01:07:41.277
Out of 1,000 dollars, Sa Yeon has...

1825
01:07:41.277 --> 01:07:46.816
(How much money does she have out of 1,000 dollars?)

1826
01:07:46.816 --> 01:07:48.984
- 940 dollars. - Okay!

1827
01:07:48.984 --> 01:07:50.119
(Sa Yeon took 940 dollars.)

1828
01:07:50.119 --> 01:07:51.787
(She gets caught on her unfair distribution.)

1829
01:07:51.787 --> 01:07:53.055
- I knew it. - Did we receive 20 dollars each?

1830
01:07:53.556 --> 01:07:57.126
(Distributing capital before leaving for the restaurant)

1831
01:08:01.097 --> 01:08:03.499
(30 dollars for Kwang Soo)

1832
01:08:03.499 --> 01:08:05.134
(20 dollars for Seok Jin)

1833
01:08:05.134 --> 01:08:07.503
(10 dollars for Jae Seok)

1834
01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:12.475
- Did you give us 20 dollars each? - 20 dollars?

1835
01:08:12.475 --> 01:08:13.876
(She gave herself 940 dollars.)

1836
01:08:13.876 --> 01:08:15.978
(I am the best at spotting betrayal.)

1837
01:08:16.412 --> 01:08:18.314
- Did you give us 20 dollars each? - 20 dollars?

1838
01:08:18.314 --> 01:08:20.349
- 20 dollars. - 20 out of 1,000 dollars?

1839
01:08:21.016 --> 01:08:23.085
Rich people are worse.

1840
01:08:23.085 --> 01:08:24.420
I didn't know you would be like this.

1841
01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.288
Don't say that. I didn't know you would be like this.

1842
01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:28.958
- Why do you say that? - Why is she upset at us?

1843
01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:31.694
- I knew it. - She acted all nice before.

1844
01:08:31.694 --> 01:08:33.496
- My goodness. - Now, I will have...

1845
01:08:33.963 --> 01:08:36.065
- 920 dollars. - I will have 920 dollars.

1846
01:08:36.065 --> 01:08:37.066
320 dollars.

1847
01:08:37.299 --> 01:08:38.501
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1848
01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:40.236
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1849
01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:42.171
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1850
01:08:42.738 --> 01:08:44.106
(Seok Jin wins.)

1851
01:08:44.106 --> 01:08:46.075
- I won. - Step back.

1852
01:08:46.075 --> 01:08:47.343
I will have 910 dollars.

1853
01:08:47.343 --> 01:08:48.411
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1854
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:50.413
(Kwang Soo wins this time.)

1855
01:08:50.579 --> 01:08:52.948
Then I get the money, right?

1856
01:08:53.115 --> 01:08:54.650
Is that how it works?

1857
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:55.684
(Doesn't the winner get the money?)

1858
01:08:55.684 --> 01:08:56.685
Didn't I win?

1859
01:08:56.685 --> 01:08:58.120
He won.

1860
01:08:58.487 --> 01:08:59.955
Seok Jin got eliminated because he won.

1861
01:09:00.156 --> 01:09:02.024
- Between you and me, who won? - I did.

1862
01:09:02.024 --> 01:09:03.092
Then you are eliminated.

1863
01:09:03.526 --> 01:09:05.394
- I won. - Why was I eliminated?

1864
01:09:05.394 --> 01:09:07.163
- Wait a minute. - I won, didn't I?

1865
01:09:07.396 --> 01:09:09.198
You are so stupid, Kwang Soo.

1866
01:09:11.167 --> 01:09:12.468
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1867
01:09:12.568 --> 01:09:13.569
Rock-paper-scissors

1868
01:09:14.003 --> 01:09:15.204
- I won. - Okay.

1869
01:09:15.204 --> 01:09:16.338
Rock-paper-scissors

1870
01:09:17.206 --> 01:09:18.307
I won.

1871
01:09:18.307 --> 01:09:20.276
(Yu Chen is the winner.)

1872
01:09:20.676 --> 01:09:23.412
I can't believe they agreed to play another round.

1873
01:09:23.579 --> 01:09:25.247
How could they accept that?

1874
01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:27.082
How were they persuaded?

1875
01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:29.118
What is wrong with them? Is it the effect of makeup?

1876
01:09:29.118 --> 01:09:30.453
Did the makeup make them that way?

1877
01:09:30.453 --> 01:09:33.589
Let's move on to the next game.

1878
01:09:33.722 --> 01:09:34.957
All right.

1879
01:09:35.458 --> 01:09:39.528
With this mission, you can win the prize money of 400 dollars.

1880
01:09:40.329 --> 01:09:42.631
(You can win the prize money of 400 dollars.)

1881
01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:44.400
- Okay! - Let's do this.

1882
01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.001
We need to get the prize money.

1883
01:09:46.001 --> 01:09:48.804
This is the psychological quiz, I Heard It Through the Grapevine.

1884
01:09:48.804 --> 01:09:50.906
(I Heard It Through the Grapevine)

1885
01:09:50.906 --> 01:09:52.041
- I Heard It Through the Grapevine. - I Heard It Through the Grapevine.

1886
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:53.075
How does it work?

1887
01:09:53.075 --> 01:09:57.146
The two people in the front row will participate from each team.

1888
01:09:57.413 --> 01:10:00.449
One team will be the offensive team and present a problem.

1889
01:10:00.549 --> 01:10:03.185
The other two teams will solve it as the defensive teams.

1890
01:10:03.886 --> 01:10:07.656
The offensive team will pick someone who is likely to answer incorrectly.

1891
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:11.694
If that person answers incorrectly, he or she will be eliminated...

1892
01:10:11.694 --> 01:10:13.195
and replaced with another member of the team.

1893
01:10:13.496 --> 01:10:14.797
If both members are likely to answer correctly,

1894
01:10:14.797 --> 01:10:16.866
shout out, "You all know, right?"

1895
01:10:16.866 --> 01:10:20.569
(Shout out, "You all know, right?")

1896
01:10:20.569 --> 01:10:22.505
It involves guessing.

1897
01:10:22.505 --> 01:10:23.806
We need to guess whether the others answered correctly or not.

1898
01:10:23.806 --> 01:10:25.608
You can either write down the correct answer...

1899
01:10:25.608 --> 01:10:28.110
or write down the incorrect answer on purpose.

1900
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:31.013
When the two members are eliminated,

1901
01:10:31.013 --> 01:10:33.115
- that team is out. - Okay.

1902
01:10:33.115 --> 01:10:35.885
(When the 2 members are eliminated, that team is out.)

1903
01:10:37.319 --> 01:10:39.355
(Team Police carefully chooses 1 out of 8 problems.)

1904
01:10:39.355 --> 01:10:40.356
Okay.

1905
01:10:41.156 --> 01:10:42.958
I didn't like the other one. Let's take a look.

1906
01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:46.395
This is a long problem. It's a long one.

1907
01:10:46.395 --> 01:10:48.030
- It's really difficult. - Okay!

1908
01:10:48.297 --> 01:10:50.366
You chose well.

1909
01:10:50.366 --> 01:10:51.800
Good job.

1910
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.702
No one will know the answer.

1911
01:10:53.702 --> 01:10:55.404
- Shall I read it out loud? - Yes.

1912
01:10:55.404 --> 01:10:57.540
- It's very difficult. - I will read the problem out loud.

1913
01:10:57.606 --> 01:11:01.210
"During the Joseon Dynasty, men gave women..."

1914
01:11:01.277 --> 01:11:05.881
"a part of his body as a symbol of love."

1915
01:11:06.248 --> 01:11:07.249
They gave something?

1916
01:11:07.249 --> 01:11:08.417
(What could it be?)

1917
01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:10.619
"In a satirical novel, 'Baebijang-Jeon',"

1918
01:11:10.686 --> 01:11:13.355
"Jeong Bi Jang gives this to a kisaeng named A Rang."

1919
01:11:13.355 --> 01:11:15.457
- "What is this?" - They gave something?

1920
01:11:15.457 --> 01:11:17.793
(Do they know the answer?)

1921
01:11:17.793 --> 01:11:19.495
(Do they plan to write down the incorrect answer?)

1922
01:11:19.495 --> 01:11:21.330
(Thinking)

1923
01:11:21.864 --> 01:11:23.999
- Ji Hyo, you don't know, right? - Ji Hyo, you don't know, right?

1924
01:11:23.999 --> 01:11:26.569
(Ji Hyo, you don't know, right?)

1925
01:11:26.569 --> 01:11:27.570
(Surprised)

1926
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.038
She was thinking so hard.

1927
01:11:29.204 --> 01:11:30.306
I am 100-percent sure.

1928
01:11:30.306 --> 01:11:31.807
- I know the answer. - Okay.

1929
01:11:32.207 --> 01:11:34.777
Ji Hyo is acting. My goodness.

1930
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:36.245
I am serious.

1931
01:11:36.245 --> 01:11:37.446
- Okay. - I am serious.

1932
01:11:37.446 --> 01:11:39.148
We can pick Ji Hyo.

1933
01:11:39.248 --> 01:11:41.116
Look at Kwang Soo.

1934
01:11:41.884 --> 01:11:42.885
Could you read the question again?

1935
01:11:43.052 --> 01:11:44.887
Daniel doesn't know the answer.

1936
01:11:45.054 --> 01:11:49.792
He keeps looking around.

1937
01:11:49.792 --> 01:11:51.327
Did you write down the answer?

1938
01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.128
- It has to be right. - Did you write down the answer?

1939
01:11:53.128 --> 01:11:55.965
Kwang Soo, my goodness.

1940
01:11:56.198 --> 01:11:57.633
(Does Kwang Soo have the correct answer?)

1941
01:11:57.633 --> 01:11:59.034
You are impressive.

1942
01:11:59.034 --> 01:12:00.569
- You don't disappoint. - There weren't a lot of options.

1943
01:12:00.569 --> 01:12:02.471
- You don't disappoint. - Seok Jin.

1944
01:12:03.339 --> 01:12:04.740
- Did you finish? - Yes.

1945
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:05.841
You can't change the answer now.

1946
01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:07.776
Let's see the answer.

1947
01:12:07.776 --> 01:12:08.777
In 1, 2, 3.

1948
01:12:08.777 --> 01:12:10.646
(Tooth)

1949
01:12:10.646 --> 01:12:12.081
- My goodness. - Tooth?

1950
01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:13.082
Why?

1951
01:12:13.515 --> 01:12:14.617
Jae Seok.

1952
01:12:14.617 --> 01:12:15.751
Did men give women their teeth?

1953
01:12:17.252 --> 01:12:19.488
- Didn't Ji Hyo write for a while? - Yes, she did.

1954
01:12:19.788 --> 01:12:21.624
(They remember that she wrote for a while.)

1955
01:12:22.091 --> 01:12:24.226
- Neither one of them knew. - They didn't know the answer.

1956
01:12:24.226 --> 01:12:25.594
(It seems like neither one of them knew.)

1957
01:12:25.594 --> 01:12:28.964
- I saw how Daniel acted. - I...

1958
01:12:28.964 --> 01:12:30.866
(He is similar to Ji Hyo.)

1959
01:12:30.866 --> 01:12:33.135
I read the book.

1960
01:12:33.135 --> 01:12:34.570
- I read the book. - What's the title of the book?

1961
01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:36.038
A satirical novel, "Jaebijang-Jeon".

1962
01:12:36.038 --> 01:12:38.107
- You didn't know the answer, right? - Of course, I did.

1963
01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.775
Let's ask Seok Jin.

1964
01:12:39.775 --> 01:12:43.245
I came to know about it thanks to my wife.

1965
01:12:43.245 --> 01:12:44.580
What about your wife?

1966
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.082
- She told me... - He came up with a story.

1967
01:12:47.082 --> 01:12:49.251
I am telling you the truth.

1968
01:12:49.251 --> 01:12:53.222
When my child lost a tooth,

1969
01:12:53.355 --> 01:12:56.158
- she told me to give it to her. - Really?

1970
01:12:56.158 --> 01:13:02.164
Then she told me about a custom... Why are you laughing?

1971
01:13:02.164 --> 01:13:03.165
(They can't help but burst out laughing.)

1972
01:13:03.165 --> 01:13:07.803
My stomach hurts from laughing. Did she want to keep the tooth?

1973
01:13:07.803 --> 01:13:10.005
- I mean... - How childish!

1974
01:13:10.005 --> 01:13:12.408
- You are too much. - How childish!

1975
01:13:12.408 --> 01:13:14.977
Let's go. Let's pick one of them.

1976
01:13:14.977 --> 01:13:16.912
- Okay. - Pick between these two.

1977
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.415
Why don't you shoot us?

1978
01:13:20.215 --> 01:13:21.950
I am serious. Go to them.

1979
01:13:22.718 --> 01:13:25.287
Whom shall we pick? Ji Hyo or Daniel?

1980
01:13:25.287 --> 01:13:26.288
(They need to decide on the target.)

1981
01:13:26.922 --> 01:13:28.357
Spare Daniel.

1982
01:13:29.958 --> 01:13:31.460
(Daniel, you don't know, right?)

1983
01:13:32.094 --> 01:13:33.328
Daniel, you don't know, right?

1984
01:13:34.596 --> 01:13:36.265
Should I show my answer?

1985
01:13:36.265 --> 01:13:37.299
Maybe he got it right.

1986
01:13:37.299 --> 01:13:38.434
(If his answer is right, Team Police loses.)

1987
01:13:38.434 --> 01:13:40.536
- I would be amazed if he did. - Maybe he got it right.

1988
01:13:40.536 --> 01:13:41.737
I'd be amazed.

1989
01:13:43.605 --> 01:13:45.507
(What is Daniel's answer?)

1990
01:13:45.507 --> 01:13:47.509
(Hair)

1991
01:13:47.509 --> 01:13:50.279
(Incorrect)

1992
01:13:51.714 --> 01:13:52.715
Hair.

1993
01:13:53.415 --> 01:13:54.616
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1994
01:13:54.917 --> 01:13:56.919
- Hair. - It hurts.

1995
01:13:56.919 --> 01:13:58.220
Why did you hit me?

1996
01:13:59.188 --> 01:14:00.923
So Min, why did you hit Sae Ho?

1997
01:14:00.923 --> 01:14:02.157
I was in pain.

1998
01:14:02.825 --> 01:14:06.328
You should have endured it. Why did you take it out on me?

1999
01:14:06.829 --> 01:14:08.030
I am sorry.

2000
01:14:09.364 --> 01:14:12.634
Kwang Soo wrote down something different.

2001
01:14:12.634 --> 01:14:13.936
- I thought... - Toenail.

2002
01:14:15.404 --> 01:14:17.973
I thought hair was too obvious.

2003
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.575
Tyrannosaurus' claw.

2004
01:14:21.777 --> 01:14:23.245
Read the question.

2005
01:14:23.512 --> 01:14:24.747
This is easy.

2006
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.784
"Complete the titles of the three SBS dramas in order."

2007
01:14:28.784 --> 01:14:32.554
"Secret Blank, Wife's Blank, and My Girlfriend Is Blank."

2008
01:14:32.721 --> 01:14:35.924
- My goodness, this is hard. - Oh, my.

2009
01:14:36.158 --> 01:14:38.293
Everyone knows the answer,

2010
01:14:38.293 --> 01:14:39.962
but some of them will answer incorrectly on purpose.

2011
01:14:39.962 --> 01:14:42.197
It's a psychological warfare.

2012
01:14:42.197 --> 01:14:44.800
(Most of them know the answer.)

2013
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.868
(Shall I get it right or wrong?)

2014
01:14:46.235 --> 01:14:47.669
What is it?

2015
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:51.607
- Do you think it's hard? - So Min says it is.

2016
01:14:51.673 --> 01:14:52.908
I bet everyone knows the answer.

2017
01:14:53.075 --> 01:14:56.712
This is what Sa Yeon said to me.

2018
01:14:57.279 --> 01:14:59.615
"Is it 'My Girlfriend Is Sam Soon'?"

2019
01:14:59.615 --> 01:15:01.717
(Is it "My Girlfriend Is Sam Soon"?)

2020
01:15:02.317 --> 01:15:03.619
(You are confusing it with "My Lovely Sam Soon".)

2021
01:15:03.619 --> 01:15:05.988
That's "My Lovely Sam Soon".

2022
01:15:08.924 --> 01:15:09.958
Respect, respect.

2023
01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:12.694
Sa Yeon, what do you think the titles are?

2024
01:15:12.694 --> 01:15:15.631
"Secret Garden", "Wife's Outing",

2025
01:15:15.664 --> 01:15:17.499
"My Girlfriend Is Sam Soon".

2026
01:15:18.867 --> 01:15:21.570
(Please love SBS dramas.)

2027
01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:24.706
- Respect, respect. - Big respect, big respect.

2028
01:15:24.706 --> 01:15:26.875
- Superman! - You are the hero of variety shows.

2029
01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:28.210
Superman, Superman!

2030
01:15:28.443 --> 01:15:29.945
You finished writing down the answer, right?

2031
01:15:29.945 --> 01:15:31.446
Show us the answer.

2032
01:15:32.147 --> 01:15:34.383
- "Secret Garden". - It is a nine-tailed fox.

2033
01:15:34.383 --> 01:15:35.384
That's the hard one.

2034
01:15:35.384 --> 01:15:37.553
I bet people wrote down the wrong answer on purpose.

2035
01:15:37.553 --> 01:15:39.421
They are like that.

2036
01:15:39.421 --> 01:15:41.557
- Yeon Soo would know. - Yes.

2037
01:15:41.557 --> 01:15:42.958
She is in dramas.

2038
01:15:42.958 --> 01:15:44.526
She would be interested in dramas.

2039
01:15:44.526 --> 01:15:46.962
There is the possibility of her answering incorrectly on purpose.

2040
01:15:46.962 --> 01:15:47.963
- On purpose? - Yes.

2041
01:15:47.963 --> 01:15:50.999
Since she hadn't been on the show for a while,

2042
01:15:50.999 --> 01:15:52.768
she would have shown off her knowledge to look cool.

2043
01:15:53.535 --> 01:15:55.237
She would have shown off her knowledge to look cool.

2044
01:15:55.237 --> 01:15:56.538
(Laughing)

2045
01:15:56.538 --> 01:15:57.606
- Don't you agree? - My goodness.

2046
01:15:57.673 --> 01:16:00.275
- I bet she didn't know the answer. - I swear she wrote,

2047
01:16:00.909 --> 01:16:03.745
"My Girlfriend Is a Girl from Gumi".

2048
01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.747
"A Girl from Gumi".

2049
01:16:05.747 --> 01:16:08.317
(A slight change makes the title funny.)

2050
01:16:08.317 --> 01:16:10.085
She wrote, "My Girlfriend Is a Girl from Gumi".

2051
01:16:10.085 --> 01:16:13.055
I am sure of it. That's why I strongly recommend...

2052
01:16:13.055 --> 01:16:14.256
- that you choose Yeon Soo. - That's right.

2053
01:16:15.557 --> 01:16:18.994
I don't think she wrote down the answer.

2054
01:16:18.994 --> 01:16:20.095
Yeon Soo.

2055
01:16:20.095 --> 01:16:21.396
Pick Yeon Soo.

2056
01:16:21.396 --> 01:16:22.798
No, no.

2057
01:16:22.798 --> 01:16:25.634
Yeon Soo, when I say the first part, say the second part.

2058
01:16:25.634 --> 01:16:26.802
- "Temptation..." - "Of Wife".

2059
01:16:26.802 --> 01:16:27.803
- "Secret..." - "Garden".

2060
01:16:27.803 --> 01:16:28.804
- "My Girlfriend is..." - "A Gumiho".

2061
01:16:28.804 --> 01:16:29.905
- "Temptation..." - "Of Wife".

2062
01:16:29.905 --> 01:16:31.173
What are you doing?

2063
01:16:31.173 --> 01:16:32.541
(She already knows the answers.)

2064
01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:34.409
He just wanted to talk to her.

2065
01:16:35.077 --> 01:16:36.578
He just wanted to talk to her.

2066
01:16:37.246 --> 01:16:39.448
- You're good. - He wanted to make eye contact.

2067
01:16:40.449 --> 01:16:42.117
He wanted to talk to her.

2068
01:16:42.284 --> 01:16:44.553
Team Yeon Soo. We have to hit them.

2069
01:16:44.553 --> 01:16:45.687
- Okay. - Okay.

2070
01:16:46.421 --> 01:16:48.056
- Yeon Soo doesn't know? - Okay.

2071
01:16:48.056 --> 01:16:50.025
(Did Yeon Soo write down the wrong answer?)

2072
01:16:50.025 --> 01:16:51.760
She might have gotten it wrong on purpose.

2073
01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.961
She has to know.

2074
01:16:53.195 --> 01:16:54.897
In 1, 2, 3.

2075
01:16:54.897 --> 01:16:55.998
Oh Yeon Soo.

2076
01:16:57.366 --> 01:16:58.467
It's Ha Yeon Soo.

2077
01:16:58.567 --> 01:17:00.068
(Oh Yeon Soo)

2078
01:17:00.235 --> 01:17:01.370
What is wrong with you?

2079
01:17:01.803 --> 01:17:04.373
Oh Yeon Soo?

2080
01:17:04.373 --> 01:17:05.607
What's wrong with you?

2081
01:17:06.675 --> 01:17:08.076
Can somebody take his wig off?

2082
01:17:08.076 --> 01:17:09.544
Hold on.

2083
01:17:09.544 --> 01:17:11.446
Is he trying to get more camera time?

2084
01:17:11.914 --> 01:17:13.949
I'd be so disappointed.

2085
01:17:13.949 --> 01:17:15.751
I'm sorry.

2086
01:17:15.918 --> 01:17:17.052
My bad.

2087
01:17:18.253 --> 01:17:19.488
In 1, 2, 3.

2088
01:17:19.488 --> 01:17:21.657
- Yeon Soo, you don't know, right? - Yeon Soo, you don't know, right?

2089
01:17:21.657 --> 01:17:26.628
(Did Yeon Soo write down the wrong answer on purpose?)

2090
01:17:27.195 --> 01:17:28.997
(Cheering)

2091
01:17:28.997 --> 01:17:30.065
(Haha and Se Chan cheered. Did she write down the correct answer?)

2092
01:17:30.065 --> 01:17:31.199
I'm suspicious.

2093
01:17:31.566 --> 01:17:32.734
What is it?

2094
01:17:32.734 --> 01:17:36.505
(Garden, Temptation, Gumihong)

2095
01:17:36.505 --> 01:17:37.673
(She wrote "Gumihong" to get it wrong.)

2096
01:17:37.673 --> 01:17:40.008
- "Gumihong"? - "Garden", "Temptation"...

2097
01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:42.844
- "Gumihong". - "Gumihong".

2098
01:17:42.945 --> 01:17:46.815
- "Gumihong". - "Gumihong".

2099
01:17:47.082 --> 01:17:48.216
That hurts so much.

2100
01:17:48.216 --> 01:17:51.420
(Their head hurts, and they lost their chance to win 400 dollars.)

2101
01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.790
That was too easy, so I got it wrong on purpose.

2102
01:17:55.557 --> 01:17:57.092
Seok Jin, that was good.

2103
01:17:57.092 --> 01:17:58.994
- You did well. - Sa Yeon guessed it for us.

2104
01:17:59.027 --> 01:18:00.329
- Good job. - An alien?

2105
01:18:00.796 --> 01:18:01.797
You did it on purpose, right?

2106
01:18:01.797 --> 01:18:04.199
- We knew. - I got it wrong on purpose.

2107
01:18:04.199 --> 01:18:05.334
"Gardan"?

2108
01:18:05.701 --> 01:18:07.369
"Secret Gardan", "My Wife is Studying Abroad",

2109
01:18:07.869 --> 01:18:09.137
"My Girlfriend is an Alien".

2110
01:18:09.838 --> 01:18:11.907
I like "My Wife is Studying Abroad".

2111
01:18:13.108 --> 01:18:14.409
(He wants his wife to go somewhere.)

2112
01:18:14.409 --> 01:18:15.877
I like it.

2113
01:18:15.877 --> 01:18:17.746
- I really like that team. - He's crazy.

2114
01:18:17.746 --> 01:18:19.114
"My Wife is Studying Abroad".

2115
01:18:19.247 --> 01:18:20.882
I like that too.

2116
01:18:21.316 --> 01:18:23.752
Please go to South America.

2117
01:18:24.319 --> 01:18:27.155
(Please stay until you get a doctoral degree.)

2118
01:18:28.457 --> 01:18:30.359
This is too easy.

2119
01:18:30.459 --> 01:18:31.760
This is the same.

2120
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.395
(Is this question really easy too?)

2121
01:18:33.395 --> 01:18:34.496
It must be easy.

2122
01:18:36.264 --> 01:18:39.568
"Yeon Soo's nickname is Squirtle. What kind of animal is it?"

2123
01:18:40.736 --> 01:18:41.737
What?

2124
01:18:42.504 --> 01:18:43.605
Really?

2125
01:18:44.206 --> 01:18:45.674
You even have a picture of it.

2126
01:18:45.974 --> 01:18:47.409
That was so kind of you.

2127
01:18:47.476 --> 01:18:50.145
Would we say that's an octopus?

2128
01:18:50.645 --> 01:18:52.447
- You underestimated us. - Is that what you wrote?

2129
01:18:52.748 --> 01:18:53.815
I'm just saying.

2130
01:18:53.915 --> 01:18:56.051
We know.

2131
01:18:56.051 --> 01:18:57.285
(Is Yuchen Gang going with Plan 1?)

2132
01:18:57.285 --> 01:18:59.788
(Okay, they're ready.)

2133
01:19:01.923 --> 01:19:03.091
Are you ready?

2134
01:19:03.091 --> 01:19:06.595
Do you really don't know?

2135
01:19:09.865 --> 01:19:12.034
(Come on, Sa Yeon.)

2136
01:19:12.034 --> 01:19:13.301
What do you mean?

2137
01:19:13.502 --> 01:19:15.103
You can't say it.

2138
01:19:16.304 --> 01:19:18.707
(He wrote down the wrong answer.)

2139
01:19:19.307 --> 01:19:20.675
- This is our strategy. - It is?

2140
01:19:20.776 --> 01:19:22.944
- What are you doing, Sa Yeon? - It's out strategy?

2141
01:19:22.944 --> 01:19:25.347
- We'll go again. - We're sorry.

2142
01:19:25.947 --> 01:19:28.150
We have an internal enemy. I don't know what to do.

2143
01:19:31.186 --> 01:19:33.288
She doesn't say it,

2144
01:19:33.355 --> 01:19:34.656
but if you write the wrong thing...

2145
01:19:34.856 --> 01:19:36.358
(She's not satisfied.)

2146
01:19:36.725 --> 01:19:38.226
Please look elsewhere. I'm sorry.

2147
01:19:38.827 --> 01:19:40.762
- I'm sorry. - Her face it like...

2148
01:19:40.762 --> 01:19:41.863
My gosh.

2149
01:19:43.865 --> 01:19:46.535
Ji Hyo, let me tell you this.

2150
01:19:46.535 --> 01:19:47.869
We wrote down the correct answer,

2151
01:19:47.869 --> 01:19:49.104
so please don't bother us.

2152
01:19:49.304 --> 01:19:50.338
I'm serious.

2153
01:19:50.338 --> 01:19:52.007
We wrote down the correct answer too.

2154
01:19:52.574 --> 01:19:53.975
We did.

2155
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:56.078
There's no reason for us to get it wrong.

2156
01:19:56.178 --> 01:19:57.913
What did you write, Seok Jin?

2157
01:19:58.580 --> 01:19:59.815
Me?

2158
01:19:59.815 --> 01:20:01.783
I wrote "terrapin".

2159
01:20:02.117 --> 01:20:04.619
(What?)

2160
01:20:04.719 --> 01:20:06.188
Is that what you wrote?

2161
01:20:06.288 --> 01:20:07.656
That's what I wrote.

2162
01:20:07.656 --> 01:20:09.524
- You're not making sense. - Why not?

2163
01:20:09.658 --> 01:20:11.226
We said...

2164
01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:14.196
- we know the answer. - What are you going to do?

2165
01:20:14.329 --> 01:20:16.264
What's our plan? Share it with us.

2166
01:20:16.498 --> 01:20:18.467
What's our plan? Did we get it right or wrong?

2167
01:20:18.867 --> 01:20:21.036
(Either they didn't talk it out, or he thought it was a terrapin.)

2168
01:20:21.036 --> 01:20:23.472
Are we going to get it right or wrong?

2169
01:20:23.805 --> 01:20:25.407
- I... - What's our decision?

2170
01:20:25.407 --> 01:20:28.210
I actually don't remember what I wrote.

2171
01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:29.744
Kwang Soo, did you write the correct answer?

2172
01:20:31.079 --> 01:20:33.515
Did you write the wrong answer or the correct one?

2173
01:20:34.649 --> 01:20:37.119
You said you wrote the correct answer.

2174
01:20:37.119 --> 01:20:39.988
Choose one. You said you wrote the correct answer.

2175
01:20:39.988 --> 01:20:41.356
It's better to go back and forth.

2176
01:20:41.356 --> 01:20:42.958
Just do that.

2177
01:20:43.525 --> 01:20:46.261
- What did you write? - You can't ask now.

2178
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:48.029
You can't ask now.

2179
01:20:49.498 --> 01:20:51.500
You can't ask now.

2180
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.168
- He can, Sa Yeon. - He can?

2181
01:20:53.568 --> 01:20:56.338
(What's the whole point of this game then?)

2182
01:20:56.338 --> 01:20:58.206
- What did she say? - He can?

2183
01:20:58.206 --> 01:20:59.541
She's like,

2184
01:20:59.774 --> 01:21:01.543
"You can't ask now."

2185
01:21:01.776 --> 01:21:05.013
- This is the time to ask. - Is that it?

2186
01:21:06.748 --> 01:21:07.883
It is.

2187
01:21:07.883 --> 01:21:09.451
Let's get started. Let's go that way.

2188
01:21:09.584 --> 01:21:10.619
- Towards us? - Yes.

2189
01:21:10.986 --> 01:21:13.054
We'll do this. "You all know, right?"

2190
01:21:13.054 --> 01:21:15.257
(Yuchen Gang, You all know, right?)

2191
01:21:15.257 --> 01:21:16.625
"You all know, right?"

2192
01:21:16.625 --> 01:21:17.726
One...

2193
01:21:17.726 --> 01:21:19.227
(The answer is obviously "turtle". They can get it wrong on purpose.)

2194
01:21:19.227 --> 01:21:20.328
Two...

2195
01:21:20.328 --> 01:21:22.364
(They probably wrote the correct answer.)

2196
01:21:22.364 --> 01:21:23.398
Three.

2197
01:21:24.766 --> 01:21:25.867
Turtle?

2198
01:21:27.235 --> 01:21:29.971
(He wrote "frog".)

2199
01:21:34.075 --> 01:21:36.645
(Kwang Soo got it wrong, so they didn't know it.)

2200
01:21:36.645 --> 01:21:37.846
(Mungdol Gang is out since 2 people got eliminated.)

2201
01:21:37.846 --> 01:21:39.648
- What did you write? - That was so close.

2202
01:21:40.315 --> 01:21:41.550
It's between us now.

2203
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:45.487
(It's Yuchen Gang versus Police Department.)

2204
01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:48.723
"When people draw, they use 4B pencils".

2205
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:52.194
- "What does B stand for?" - Okay.

2206
01:21:54.896 --> 01:21:57.165
(Isn't this it?)

2207
01:21:59.467 --> 01:22:01.036
Don't look. They're looking.

2208
01:22:01.503 --> 01:22:03.405
So Min saw everything.

2209
01:22:03.405 --> 01:22:04.906
(She's flustered.)

2210
01:22:07.108 --> 01:22:08.910
They're out.

2211
01:22:09.477 --> 01:22:11.079
It doesn't matter?

2212
01:22:12.314 --> 01:22:13.415
Is this...

2213
01:22:13.815 --> 01:22:14.983
a dream?

2214
01:22:15.817 --> 01:22:17.619
(Thanks for making us laugh every round.)

2215
01:22:17.619 --> 01:22:18.787
I'll show you the answer.

2216
01:22:19.221 --> 01:22:20.722
(What does B stand for?)

2217
01:22:20.722 --> 01:22:22.624
(Black)

2218
01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:24.025
I got it right.

2219
01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:25.694
How did I get it right?

2220
01:22:25.961 --> 01:22:27.996
- He got it right. - He's amazing.

2221
01:22:27.996 --> 01:22:30.131
- He got it right. - How did I get this right?

2222
01:22:30.131 --> 01:22:31.866
(As soon as he heard the question...)

2223
01:22:31.866 --> 01:22:33.468
Is it black?

2224
01:22:34.035 --> 01:22:35.170
Hold on.

2225
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:38.173
- He got it right. - He said it was black,

2226
01:22:38.607 --> 01:22:40.909
but Ji Hyo was like, "That doesn't make sense."

2227
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:44.145
(It does make sense.)

2228
01:22:44.145 --> 01:22:46.448
I told him that. "Does that even make sense?"

2229
01:22:47.048 --> 01:22:49.284
Jae Seok, did you know the answer?

2230
01:22:49.284 --> 01:22:50.585
(Did Jae Seok know the answer?)

2231
01:22:50.585 --> 01:22:51.653
- Me? - Yes.

2232
01:22:52.287 --> 01:22:53.421
I did.

2233
01:22:53.922 --> 01:22:55.457
Did you used to draw?

2234
01:22:55.557 --> 01:22:57.092
I didn't but this is basic knowledge.

2235
01:22:57.292 --> 01:22:59.294
Is this basic knowledge?

2236
01:22:59.294 --> 01:23:00.662
Of course.

2237
01:23:00.662 --> 01:23:02.631
Does Ji Hyo have no basic knowledge?

2238
01:23:03.999 --> 01:23:06.635
No, to me I mean.

2239
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:07.869
Kwang Soo, you didn't know, right?

2240
01:23:08.503 --> 01:23:09.904
I thought it was...

2241
01:23:10.038 --> 01:23:11.306
- What did you think it was? - You didn't know.

2242
01:23:12.207 --> 01:23:14.542
- You were writing down something. - You were very busy.

2243
01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:16.911
(You were scribbling something down.)

2244
01:23:17.412 --> 01:23:18.913
I wrote down "belly hair".

2245
01:23:19.214 --> 01:23:20.315
I'm being honest.

2246
01:23:20.749 --> 01:23:22.717
- That's what I wrote. - You did?

2247
01:23:22.817 --> 01:23:25.420
But I was going to go to an art school.

2248
01:23:25.987 --> 01:23:28.790
He was planning to go to an art school.

2249
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:30.458
Did you really write "belly hair"?

2250
01:23:30.825 --> 01:23:33.695
- No, I knew. - He did write that though.

2251
01:23:33.695 --> 01:23:35.897
- I did really write it. - He was joking.

2252
01:23:36.097 --> 01:23:37.165
- After he saw it... - I knew it, but...

2253
01:23:37.165 --> 01:23:39.067
- Why are you getting scolded? - I mean...

2254
01:23:39.434 --> 01:23:40.802
He wrote the wrong answer.

2255
01:23:40.802 --> 01:23:42.103
This is a movie.

2256
01:23:42.103 --> 01:23:44.205
- This is a scene from a movie. - Right. Detective, sir.

2257
01:23:44.339 --> 01:23:45.840
- Hold on. - Hold on.

2258
01:23:46.041 --> 01:23:48.209
We're just trying to figure it out.

2259
01:23:48.209 --> 01:23:50.745
We're sorry. He thought he was a detective.

2260
01:23:50.945 --> 01:23:53.715
We're not filming "The Outlaws".

2261
01:23:54.582 --> 01:23:55.617
Boss,

2262
01:23:55.784 --> 01:23:57.285
let's do the Room of Truth.

2263
01:24:00.422 --> 01:24:01.456
(By that, do you mean...)

2264
01:24:01.456 --> 01:24:02.857
Shall we?

2265
01:24:03.058 --> 01:24:04.459
- Byung Sik. - Yes, sir.

2266
01:24:04.993 --> 01:24:06.194
Let's go to the Room of Truth.

2267
01:24:07.896 --> 01:24:11.966
(Once you're in it, you have to tell the truth.)

2268
01:24:11.966 --> 01:24:14.135
(This is it.)

2269
01:24:15.603 --> 01:24:17.105
- Should we? - Hey.

2270
01:24:17.472 --> 01:24:18.573
Let's go to the Room of Truth.

2271
01:24:18.573 --> 01:24:19.908
- Who? Me? - The Room of Truth.

2272
01:24:20.342 --> 01:24:22.177
Did you write down "belly hair" or not?

2273
01:24:22.177 --> 01:24:23.178
(He's speechless.)

2274
01:24:23.178 --> 01:24:24.379
- It fits you well. - Come on.

2275
01:24:24.379 --> 01:24:25.880
- Did you write it or not? - What?

2276
01:24:26.314 --> 01:24:28.817
Did you write down "black",

2277
01:24:29.117 --> 01:24:30.552
or did you not change it?

2278
01:24:30.552 --> 01:24:31.786
- I don't remember. - Okay.

2279
01:24:31.986 --> 01:24:33.588
(Tell us the truth.)

2280
01:24:36.725 --> 01:24:39.127
(I remember now.)

2281
01:24:39.127 --> 01:24:40.962
Do you remember?

2282
01:24:41.196 --> 01:24:43.832
- Wait. - What are you doing?

2283
01:24:44.466 --> 01:24:46.301
It split in half.

2284
01:24:46.634 --> 01:24:49.237
- What was that? - The Room of Truth.

2285
01:24:49.304 --> 01:24:50.872
What was that?

2286
01:24:50.872 --> 01:24:53.274
- How's this the Room of Truth? - Didn't you watch the movie?

2287
01:24:54.008 --> 01:24:55.377
The Room of Truth.

2288
01:24:55.877 --> 01:24:57.145
We'll announce it now.

2289
01:24:57.145 --> 01:24:58.513
- Let's go. - Go, Haha.

2290
01:24:59.514 --> 01:25:01.082
- Do we get hit? - Yes.

2291
01:25:01.082 --> 01:25:03.985
(They decide to attack Yuchen Gang.)

2292
01:25:06.554 --> 01:25:09.624
(He said this is basic knowledge.)

2293
01:25:09.624 --> 01:25:12.660
(If he wanted to go into arts, this is a piece of cake.)

2294
01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.995
- In 1, 2, 3. - I'm not scared.

2295
01:25:13.995 --> 01:25:15.964
- Kwang Soo, you don't know, right? - Kwang Soo, you don't know, right?

2296
01:25:17.565 --> 01:25:20.001
(If he wrote "black", Yuchen Gang wings.)

2297
01:25:20.001 --> 01:25:21.035
- Should I show it? - Yes.

2298
01:25:21.503 --> 01:25:24.105
(He was so confident. Did he write "black"?)

2299
01:25:25.039 --> 01:25:27.475
(He wrote "bright".)

2300
01:25:27.475 --> 01:25:28.943
"Bright"? What?

2301
01:25:28.943 --> 01:25:30.712
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

2302
01:25:30.712 --> 01:25:32.414
(Police Department is tied with Yuchen Gang.)

2303
01:25:33.314 --> 01:25:34.916
That was so strong.

2304
01:25:34.916 --> 01:25:36.017
I wrote "bright" too.

2305
01:25:36.017 --> 01:25:38.486
- He told me to write his. - Yes, "bright".

2306
01:25:38.486 --> 01:25:40.288
He said it was the correct answer.

2307
01:25:42.457 --> 01:25:44.426
This is the last question.

2308
01:25:44.426 --> 01:25:45.794
This will be the last question.

2309
01:25:45.827 --> 01:25:47.028
These two teams are tied.

2310
01:25:47.028 --> 01:25:48.029
(It's the final round between these two teams.)

2311
01:25:48.196 --> 01:25:49.664
- Do we attack? - Yes.

2312
01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:52.300
- Please come forward. - Last one.

2313
01:25:54.302 --> 01:25:55.937
We picked a good question.

2314
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:57.472
"In Estonia, when you raise cattle,"

2315
01:25:57.472 --> 01:25:59.307
"you must pay a certain tax".

2316
01:25:59.307 --> 01:26:00.375
"What is this?"

2317
01:26:03.344 --> 01:26:08.783
(Estonia? Cattle? Tax?)

2318
01:26:10.885 --> 01:26:14.355
(They look clueless. What could be the answer?)

2319
01:26:14.789 --> 01:26:16.057
Just say anything.

2320
01:26:16.057 --> 01:26:18.026
(We're done already.)

2321
01:26:18.526 --> 01:26:19.627
Foot smell tax?

2322
01:26:21.963 --> 01:26:23.965
Sae Ho said it was Lee Moon Sae.

2323
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.502
- I'll always stay with - I know the answer.

2324
01:26:27.502 --> 01:26:29.237
Yuchen Gang

2325
01:26:29.237 --> 01:26:30.338
He's so funny.

2326
01:26:30.338 --> 01:26:32.407
I won't leave you

2327
01:26:32.407 --> 01:26:33.475
(They love this question.)

2328
01:26:33.475 --> 01:26:34.476
Good job.

2329
01:26:34.476 --> 01:26:35.543
(Daniel is cute.)

2330
01:26:35.577 --> 01:26:37.545
- It's so fun watching this. - Right?

2331
01:26:37.846 --> 01:26:39.914
(They're having a discussion.)

2332
01:26:39.914 --> 01:26:42.784
You need a lot of water to raise cattle.

2333
01:26:43.952 --> 01:26:46.855
They poop a lot,

2334
01:26:47.121 --> 01:26:49.958
- so it pollutes the environment. - Pollution tax.

2335
01:26:50.024 --> 01:26:52.327
Wait. Look. I think it's...

2336
01:26:52.327 --> 01:26:56.564
air pollution. Their gas...

2337
01:26:56.564 --> 01:26:58.500
- That's what I mean. - That's it. So...

2338
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.535
(Tax on cattle's gas? What is the correct answer?)

2339
01:27:00.535 --> 01:27:02.103
Here's the answer.

2340
01:27:02.103 --> 01:27:03.137
It's hard.

2341
01:27:03.137 --> 01:27:04.606
(What is the tax on raising cattle?)

2342
01:27:04.606 --> 01:27:06.674
(Flatulence tax)

2343
01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:08.510
- I was right. - "Flatulence tax"?

2344
01:27:08.643 --> 01:27:09.744
What?

2345
01:27:10.645 --> 01:27:11.646
(It looks like they got it right.)

2346
01:27:11.646 --> 01:27:12.714
What?

2347
01:27:13.715 --> 01:27:15.316
(They look suspicious.)

2348
01:27:15.316 --> 01:27:19.354
(There must be somebody who got it wrong.)

2349
01:27:19.354 --> 01:27:20.455
- Se Chan. - Yes.

2350
01:27:20.455 --> 01:27:21.489
Did you get it right?

2351
01:27:21.856 --> 01:27:23.291
Yes, I did.

2352
01:27:23.291 --> 01:27:24.359
- Did you write "flatulence tax"? - Yes.

2353
01:27:24.359 --> 01:27:25.760
Did you spell it correctly?

2354
01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.696
I'm bad in spelling, so I got it wrong.

2355
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:30.798
- Oh, we can ask like this. - We can.

2356
01:27:30.798 --> 01:27:31.833
You didn't know how to spell it?

2357
01:27:31.833 --> 01:27:34.235
We've been doing this for 1.5 hours.

2358
01:27:34.502 --> 01:27:35.670
- We're done now. - We are?

2359
01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:36.838
- Yes. - This is the last question.

2360
01:27:37.238 --> 01:27:38.506
You should ask Jong Kook.

2361
01:27:38.506 --> 01:27:39.507
(She finally understands the rules and participates.)

2362
01:27:39.507 --> 01:27:42.277
Jong Kook, did you spell it right?

2363
01:27:42.777 --> 01:27:45.079
- I wrote something else. - See?

2364
01:27:45.213 --> 01:27:47.615
(I wrote something else.)

2365
01:27:47.815 --> 01:27:49.684
- He's so honest. - Jong Kook...

2366
01:27:50.251 --> 01:27:51.986
(What game are you playing, Sa Yeon?)

2367
01:27:51.986 --> 01:27:54.122
- He might be lying. - Right.

2368
01:27:54.289 --> 01:27:56.357
- Really? - He might be lying.

2369
01:27:56.925 --> 01:27:58.459
(Jong Kook looks truthful.)

2370
01:27:58.459 --> 01:28:00.395
He looks truthful.

2371
01:28:00.695 --> 01:28:02.597
- I'm sure about Se Chan. - He got it wrong?

2372
01:28:02.597 --> 01:28:04.966
I'm pretty certain about Se Chan.

2373
01:28:05.266 --> 01:28:08.069
He couldn't smile properly.

2374
01:28:08.069 --> 01:28:09.370
(What did Se Chan write?)

2375
01:28:09.437 --> 01:28:11.806
Se Chan. In 1, 2, 3.

2376
01:28:11.806 --> 01:28:12.840
- You don't know, right? - You don't know, right?

2377
01:28:13.908 --> 01:28:16.711
(What did Se Chan write?)

2378
01:28:16.711 --> 01:28:18.446
If we win, we get 400 dollars, right?

2379
01:28:18.446 --> 01:28:23.918
(This is the last round. Who will take 400 dollars?)

2380
01:28:23.985 --> 01:28:25.753
- Se Chan, you don't know, right? - You don't know, right?

2381
01:28:28.756 --> 01:28:30.291
(Pollution tax)

2382
01:28:30.291 --> 01:28:32.226
(He's wrong.)

2383
01:28:33.194 --> 01:28:34.195
(Police Department is out.)

2384
01:28:34.195 --> 01:28:35.463
Pollution tax?

2385
01:28:36.397 --> 01:28:38.433
- What did you write? - That was difficult.

2386
01:28:38.433 --> 01:28:39.667
- Pollution tax. - Pollution tax?

2387
01:28:39.767 --> 01:28:41.736
So the winning team is...

2388
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:44.172
Sa Yeon's team.

2389
01:28:44.172 --> 01:28:45.907
(Yuchen Gang wins.)

2390
01:28:45.907 --> 01:28:47.875
- Our team is the best. - Good job.

2391
01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:50.411
Flatulence?

2392
01:28:50.411 --> 01:28:52.880
The winning team's boss is Sa Yeon,

2393
01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.716
so she'll take the money.

2394
01:28:54.716 --> 01:28:56.784
You can divide it up in any way you like.

2395
01:28:56.784 --> 01:28:59.153
You have already used the Revolution Card.

2396
01:29:01.255 --> 01:29:02.323
(That means...)

2397
01:29:02.323 --> 01:29:03.725
She can keep it all.

2398
01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:05.960
That's good. I'll keep it all.

2399
01:29:06.828 --> 01:29:07.829
You can.

2400
01:29:07.829 --> 01:29:10.832
(Yuchen Gang's day was filled with betrayals.)

2401
01:29:11.199 --> 01:29:13.735
This is your last chance to use the Revolution Card.

2402
01:29:13.735 --> 01:29:16.437
- What is Daniel's team going to do? - I got the answer.

2403
01:29:16.437 --> 01:29:18.206
How much time can you give us?

2404
01:29:18.239 --> 01:29:20.041
- I'll give you 10 seconds. - What?

2405
01:29:20.775 --> 01:29:23.578
- 10 seconds? - That's a lot of time.

2406
01:29:23.945 --> 01:29:26.414
Hasn't it passed already? Hold on. What do we do?

2407
01:29:26.414 --> 01:29:27.448
(They're confused. They only have one chance.)

2408
01:29:27.448 --> 01:29:29.283
This is too cruel.

2409
01:29:29.283 --> 01:29:30.985
- No. - Try it.

2410
01:29:31.552 --> 01:29:32.987
Use it, Sae Ho.

2411
01:29:33.287 --> 01:29:34.355
- Sae Ho. - Sae Ho, use it.

2412
01:29:34.355 --> 01:29:35.423
Just go for it.

2413
01:29:36.557 --> 01:29:37.625
- Please decide. - Sae Ho,

2414
01:29:37.759 --> 01:29:39.027
I can...

2415
01:29:39.027 --> 01:29:42.597
This is the last chance. I'm scared of this card. Take it.

2416
01:29:42.897 --> 01:29:44.198
You can...

2417
01:29:44.365 --> 01:29:46.567
either take it out or zip it up.

2418
01:29:47.135 --> 01:29:48.136
- It's up to me? - Yes.

2419
01:29:48.136 --> 01:29:49.203
I'll use it.

2420
01:29:49.203 --> 01:29:50.738
(It's up to me? I'll use it.)

2421
01:29:51.806 --> 01:29:52.807
I'll use it.

2422
01:29:52.807 --> 01:29:54.275
(She uses the Revolution Card without hesitating.)

2423
01:29:54.275 --> 01:29:56.077
She doesn't hesitate like a tiger moth.

2424
01:29:57.578 --> 01:29:58.646
It's a revolt.

2425
01:29:59.414 --> 01:30:00.948
You used the Revolution Card.

2426
01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:04.485
I'll tell you the amount in Daniel's digital moneybox.

2427
01:30:04.485 --> 01:30:05.486
Out of 1,200 dollars...

2428
01:30:06.788 --> 01:30:08.956
(Everyone trusted Boss Kang.)

2429
01:30:08.956 --> 01:30:11.025
I don't think our boss will lie.

2430
01:30:11.459 --> 01:30:13.828
I trust Boss Kang.

2431
01:30:13.828 --> 01:30:17.198
I think he'll be clean and fair.

2432
01:30:17.398 --> 01:30:18.499
I'll be fair.

2433
01:30:20.802 --> 01:30:23.037
The amount Daniel has...

2434
01:30:23.037 --> 01:30:24.706
(Did Boss Kang...)

2435
01:30:24.706 --> 01:30:26.674
(divide 1,200 dollars...)

2436
01:30:26.674 --> 01:30:29.977
(equally amongst his team members?)

2437
01:30:30.178 --> 01:30:31.579
(Next week)

2438
01:30:32.447 --> 01:30:35.283
(There's no mercy.)

2439
01:30:35.283 --> 01:30:40.221
(The real war begins now.)

2440
01:30:41.122 --> 01:30:42.356
Are you by yourself?

2441
01:30:42.356 --> 01:30:43.725
- Hold on. - I think we are first place.

2442
01:30:43.725 --> 01:30:45.393
(What would be the result of this battle...)

2443
01:30:45.393 --> 01:30:49.330
(of becoming number 1?)

2444
01:30:50.198 --> 01:30:51.699
This is brutal.

2445
01:30:54.035 --> 01:30:55.803
(That was scary.)

2446
01:30:56.738 --> 01:30:57.872
(And)

2447
01:30:58.806 --> 01:31:04.245
(Fall reminds them of the old times.)

2448
01:31:04.278 --> 01:31:05.546
(So Min's diary)

2449
01:31:05.546 --> 01:31:06.748
(From Jeon So Min)

2450
01:31:08.116 --> 01:31:10.985
(This is my friend, Dan Bi.)

2451
01:31:10.985 --> 01:31:12.920
(Dan Bi...)

2452
01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.656
(is a hostage?)

2453
01:31:15.823 --> 01:31:17.592
(He got his memory stolen.)

2454
01:31:18.392 --> 01:31:22.463
(This is not your memory.)

2455
01:31:23.297 --> 01:31:26.334
(If you don't find the memory thief, somebody's memory is in danger.)

2456
01:31:26.334 --> 01:31:29.637
(The culprit is one of them.)

2457
01:31:29.637 --> 01:31:33.207
(They look for the despicable memory thief.)

2458
01:31:34.275 --> 01:31:36.277
(Mysterious Autumn Trip)
