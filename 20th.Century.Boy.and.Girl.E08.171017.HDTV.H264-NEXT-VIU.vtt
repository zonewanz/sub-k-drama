1
00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:13.905
Oh, right here.

2
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.522
(Episode 8)

3
00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:18.633
President Jang, what brings you here?

4
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.063
I wanted to give you some pictures of our new actors...

5
00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.462
and to see if you had any great scripts.

6
00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:26.933
After what happened, I'm sure Jin Jin...

7
00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.543
- isn't doing so well. - No way.

8
00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:32.313
It's her second prime time.

9
00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:35.612
She got an offer for a sports drink ad that she shot 15 years ago.

10
00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:37.553
This is a daily drama.

11
00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:41.722
It's a story about an old single woman from a rich family...

12
00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:44.493
going through all kinds of trouble after meeting the male lead.

13
00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:47.892
We have 160 episodes. Do you think Jin Jin will take it?

14
00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:50.763
- Sounds great. - You only say that.

15
00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:53.233
Goodness, look who this is.

16
00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:54.633
Hello.

17
00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:57.432
- Hello. - Oh, hey.

18
00:00:57.902 --> 00:00:59.502
Is today a special day?

19
00:00:59.502 --> 00:01:01.703
Why do I see so many high-ranking managers?

20
00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:03.642
I was here for a lunch appointment.

21
00:01:03.673 --> 00:01:06.543
There was a good restaurant that serves nice yellow corvina.

22
00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:08.813
The place at the crossroads? They're famous.

23
00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:11.483
When I went last week, they said Shin Chul, the movie director, came.

24
00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:12.752
He's a regular.

25
00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:15.323
I was there with Director Shin.

26
00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:18.293
So Eun, one of our actresses, was cast in his new project.

27
00:01:18.293 --> 00:01:20.623
- The one with Eom Hong Shik? - Yes.

28
00:01:21.563 --> 00:01:25.132
Does that mean So Eun will be going to Cannes?

29
00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:28.563
Only if the movie's a hit.

30
00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:37.813
Director Shin's a scumbag.

31
00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.112
How dare he test the waters?

32
00:01:40.343 --> 00:01:41.912
I won't leave him alone.

33
00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:43.813
So what if he's a director?

34
00:01:44.483 --> 00:01:46.513
I've known him since he was a nobody.

35
00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:49.752
Is this how he repays me?

36
00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:54.123
Let it go.

37
00:01:54.123 --> 00:01:56.793
- I'm on my way to wring his neck. - Don't.

38
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.763
Will I starve if I don't do that movie?

39
00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:04.573
Cool down, okay? Bye.

40
00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:30.622
(Producer Bong)

41
00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:34.763
Hello, I'm Producer Bong from "We Got Married".

42
00:02:35.402 --> 00:02:37.533
We're shooting a fifth season.

43
00:02:37.932 --> 00:02:40.332
There's only one spot left.

44
00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:43.003
Mr. Producer.

45
00:02:43.503 --> 00:02:46.612
Like I told you before,

46
00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.013
we aren't yet prepared.

47
00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:51.652
You don't need to prepare anything.

48
00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:53.383
We'll prepare everything.

49
00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:55.182
I'm really sorry.

50
00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:59.522
Don't you want to turn Jin Jin into Korea's favorite dating actress?

51
00:03:00.092 --> 00:03:01.763
If she does our show,

52
00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:03.392
she can revamp her image.

53
00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:05.233
Now is the chance.

54
00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.562
- I'm really sorry. - Wait.

55
00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:12.733
I'm Jang Ki Bong, president of Chamjin Entertainment.

56
00:03:13.603 --> 00:03:14.772
Where are you?

57
00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:24.413
We really want Sa Jin Jin on our show.

58
00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:25.983
Just say yes,

59
00:03:26.182 --> 00:03:28.552
and we'll revamp her image for you.

60
00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:31.723
Why are you keeping her under wraps?

61
00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:33.992
Mystery pays, but still.

62
00:03:35.022 --> 00:03:37.832
Jin Jin gained a lot of female fans since...

63
00:03:37.832 --> 00:03:40.862
they found out she's never dated, which is great,

64
00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:43.763
but it's also true that her image took a hit.

65
00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:48.173
I heard you're having problems getting casted for her next project.

66
00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:51.943
Producer Bong, we have only one condition.

67
00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:55.682
Her partner. The guy.

68
00:03:57.913 --> 00:04:00.612
Jin Jin? I have some great news.

69
00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:04.353
Producer Bong's new project is just amazing.

70
00:04:04.753 --> 00:04:07.022
A secret but captivating love story of the century.

71
00:04:07.022 --> 00:04:10.293
A gut-wrenching melodrama of a 20-year-old fantasy that came true.

72
00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:12.862
- It's perfect for you. - Is it?

73
00:04:13.392 --> 00:04:16.302
I'm serious. It's Producer Bong's new project.

74
00:04:16.963 --> 00:04:18.473
There's no need to hesitate.

75
00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:21.302
Let's meet the director right away.

76
00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:23.702
Are you free tomorrow?

77
00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:25.612
What's the rush?

78
00:04:26.143 --> 00:04:27.643
Do you want to keep doing nothing?

79
00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:53.072
Ji Won isn't in.

80
00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:55.372
I was hoping he could eat it while it's hot.

81
00:04:57.242 --> 00:04:58.273
Mi Kyung.

82
00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:01.312
- Check today's date. - What?

83
00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.723
Silly me. I completely forgot about it.

84
00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:25.733
- Ji Won, my third concern. - Okay.

85
00:05:27.103 --> 00:05:30.202
What should I do when I'm craving a beer?

86
00:05:30.742 --> 00:05:32.312
Not today.

87
00:05:33.372 --> 00:05:35.182
- Are you going somewhere? - Yes.

88
00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:37.312
- On a date? - Yes.

89
00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:39.252
Wait. With whom?

90
00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:42.052
- Jin Jin? - No.

91
00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:44.523
My dad.

92
00:05:46.622 --> 00:05:48.163
Are you on your way?

93
00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:51.062
I have to buy something. I'll be a bit late.

94
00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:54.603
Okay. I'll tell the others.

95
00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:15.983
Honey, please wake up.

96
00:06:16.153 --> 00:06:18.223
Wake up, honey. Oh, no.

97
00:06:19.752 --> 00:06:21.223
What should we do?

98
00:06:21.723 --> 00:06:23.122
- Be careful. - Okay.

99
00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:27.632
He'll be okay. Don't worry about Ji Won.

100
00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:30.062
Take this. Now get in there. Go.

101
00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.932
- I'll go too. - Take care.

102
00:06:44.213 --> 00:06:47.283
(Emergency Rescue)

103
00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:54.492
It's gotten worse than when you were here two months ago.

104
00:06:55.923 --> 00:06:57.463
It's in your veins and lungs.

105
00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:01.362
Let's stop with the treatment.

106
00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:03.262
It's pointless now.

107
00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:07.773
Doctor. I want to...

108
00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:11.872
see my son start school.

109
00:07:13.012 --> 00:07:15.983
- How old is he? - He's seven.

110
00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:19.612
You did well so far.

111
00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:22.682
Don't spend the rest of your days in the hospital.

112
00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:27.093
I think it's best you stay with your family and prepare yourselves.

113
00:07:31.093 --> 00:07:32.932
What should I do now?

114
00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:42.643
What should I do?

115
00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:57.752
What a lovely sight. I'll take a photo now.

116
00:07:57.752 --> 00:07:59.353
Look straight at the camera.

117
00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:01.963
Now smile, 1, 2.

118
00:08:24.682 --> 00:08:27.052
Ji Won has a new family.

119
00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:30.793
It's been almost 20 years,

120
00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:32.753
so it's odd to say "new".

121
00:08:36.263 --> 00:08:38.993
Don't think she betrayed your friend.

122
00:08:39.692 --> 00:08:42.832
Her husband even hosts Ji Won's dad's memorial service.

123
00:08:51.972 --> 00:08:53.173
How could you?

124
00:08:53.712 --> 00:08:56.942
Kwang Hee, you're so heartless.

125
00:08:56.942 --> 00:08:59.082
Why didn't you tell us before?

126
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:01.852
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:05.393
Because of my Ho Sung...

128
00:09:08.163 --> 00:09:12.133
So how have you been?

129
00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:13.763
How was life? Did you live okay?

130
00:09:14.602 --> 00:09:15.633
Mi Kyung,

131
00:09:16.702 --> 00:09:18.232
actually, I...

132
00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:26.643
(In 2000)

133
00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:29.143
Eat all you want.

134
00:09:33.712 --> 00:09:36.682
Your name is Ji Won?

135
00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.493
Yes.

136
00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:42.592
You need to transfer to a new school,

137
00:09:42.993 --> 00:09:44.863
so things will be tough for a bit.

138
00:09:50.732 --> 00:09:53.533
I have a son too.

139
00:09:55.302 --> 00:09:56.873
He's older than you.

140
00:10:02.613 --> 00:10:04.653
I hope you two get along.

141
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:20.092
Why isn't he here?

142
00:10:20.163 --> 00:10:22.163
He'll come. He must be busy.

143
00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:37.113
Actually, I got pregnant...

144
00:10:38.613 --> 00:10:39.852
with a daughter.

145
00:10:40.352 --> 00:10:41.383
Mom.

146
00:10:48.123 --> 00:10:49.493
Where's my Chul Min?

147
00:10:49.863 --> 00:10:51.493
He's always late.

148
00:10:54.932 --> 00:10:58.302
I told him to be on time, and he's late again.

149
00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:02.972
He said he'd be late. We can wait.

150
00:11:08.482 --> 00:11:09.743
Sorry.

151
00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:12.613
Sorry.

152
00:11:15.952 --> 00:11:17.182
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:30.403 --> 00:11:31.633
I'm sorry I'm late.

154
00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:34.643
I bought his favorite cake.

155
00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:57.899
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E08 20th Century Boy & Girl "Xmas in August"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

156
00:12:14.842 --> 00:12:16.143
You gained weight.

157
00:12:16.743 --> 00:12:18.913
- Have I? - It's your age.

158
00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:21.623
Your belly will start to get pudgy next. You better watch it.

159
00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:24.253
You should watch it.

160
00:12:28.192 --> 00:12:29.962
Ji Won, where's my present?

161
00:12:30.293 --> 00:12:32.062
That's right. It's in my car.

162
00:12:32.462 --> 00:12:33.932
Shall we eat first?

163
00:12:36.702 --> 00:12:39.432
- Go and get him. - What?

164
00:12:46.273 --> 00:12:47.312
Who?

165
00:12:48.113 --> 00:12:49.482
Tell Dad dinner's ready.

166
00:12:52.082 --> 00:12:53.413
Dad.

167
00:13:11.003 --> 00:13:13.432
Mom, aren't you glad to see Ji Won?

168
00:13:14.472 --> 00:13:16.173
Kind of.

169
00:13:19.273 --> 00:13:23.082
Chul Min, I want you to find someone special.

170
00:13:24.082 --> 00:13:25.413
I'm not interested yet.

171
00:13:25.613 --> 00:13:28.582
Don't. If you want to get married, you need my permission.

172
00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:31.253
- Ji Won, you too. - What?

173
00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:34.462
You should know your place.

174
00:13:36.123 --> 00:13:38.732
Have some of this.

175
00:13:38.732 --> 00:13:40.432
It's your favorite.

176
00:13:41.503 --> 00:13:43.432
She cooked it today for you.

177
00:13:44.302 --> 00:13:47.232
While preparing for the memorial service?

178
00:13:47.232 --> 00:13:48.243
You shouldn't have.

179
00:13:48.243 --> 00:13:50.273
Take some with you.

180
00:13:50.273 --> 00:13:52.613
- Keep it in the fridge. - Okay.

181
00:14:05.452 --> 00:14:06.552
Eat up.

182
00:14:14.602 --> 00:14:16.533
Pork cutlet?

183
00:14:16.962 --> 00:14:19.802
Why is that your favorite?

184
00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:21.972
Finish that, okay?

185
00:14:22.173 --> 00:14:23.243
Okay.

186
00:14:27.812 --> 00:14:29.212
Come on, eat up.

187
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:48.302
No, there's too much on my mind.

188
00:14:49.462 --> 00:14:51.773
I need a change. Hey.

189
00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:54.472
Jin Jin did a magazine interview.

190
00:14:54.472 --> 00:14:56.342
("Universal Emotions")

191
00:14:56.373 --> 00:14:59.842
She gave them a photo with us in it.

192
00:15:00.143 --> 00:15:01.442
What? Which one?

193
00:15:01.513 --> 00:15:03.582
The one we took on our first day of school.

194
00:15:07.523 --> 00:15:10.123
She's the only one who looks pretty in it.

195
00:15:10.123 --> 00:15:12.592
She's never ugly in any of our photos.

196
00:15:13.123 --> 00:15:14.222
That's true.

197
00:15:15.393 --> 00:15:18.493
Hang on. What's today's date?

198
00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:20.832
Today? It's the 25th.

199
00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:24.472
- Christmas in August. - Christmas in August.

200
00:15:25.572 --> 00:15:27.403
- Where are you? - Where are you?

201
00:15:29.342 --> 00:15:31.842
Don't forget our meeting with Producer Bong.

202
00:15:32.143 --> 00:15:35.383
- Remember Bangbae Intersection? - Of course.

203
00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:37.883
It's where your old office used to be. I'll never forget.

204
00:15:37.883 --> 00:15:39.182
Don't mention that.

205
00:15:39.182 --> 00:15:41.222
There's a Japanese restaurant nearby.

206
00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:44.592
Meet me in the area at 6pm, and we can go together.

207
00:15:45.052 --> 00:15:46.493
Hong Hee will pick you up.

208
00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.493
Put some makeup on and dress up. Look pretty.

209
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:54.702
- You said that already. - What are you doing?

210
00:15:55.462 --> 00:15:57.873
- I have to go somewhere. - Where?

211
00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:00.673
Somewhere close to home.

214
00:16:27.863 --> 00:16:33.472
Sa Jin Jin, let's play.

215
00:16:35.243 --> 00:16:40.673
Sa Jin Jin, let's play.

216
00:16:50.923 --> 00:16:53.293
Come here. Come at me.

217
00:16:53.293 --> 00:16:55.663
- Stay away. - Why are you running away?

218
00:16:55.663 --> 00:16:57.633
- Come here. - Don't move.

219
00:16:57.633 --> 00:16:58.763
You're late.

220
00:16:58.763 --> 00:17:00.932
- Tell me why. - Leave me alone.

221
00:17:00.932 --> 00:17:03.133
Come here. Come with me.

222
00:17:03.133 --> 00:17:04.833
Come with us.

223
00:17:07.542 --> 00:17:09.643
Sa Jin Jin!

224
00:17:09.643 --> 00:17:11.613
Stop, I'm exhausted.

225
00:17:14.843 --> 00:17:17.113
What? He's...

226
00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:20.182
It can't be...

227
00:17:20.682 --> 00:17:21.782
Possibly.

228
00:17:22.522 --> 00:17:23.653
Definitely.

229
00:17:24.553 --> 00:17:26.722
- Gong Ji Won! - Gong Ji Won!

230
00:17:26.722 --> 00:17:29.262
- Gong Ji Won! Gong Ji Won! - Gong Ji Won! Gong Ji Won!

231
00:17:30.792 --> 00:17:33.032
- Come here! - Unbelievable.

232
00:17:35.032 --> 00:17:36.232
Hello.

233
00:17:55.823 --> 00:17:58.752
(First day of school)

234
00:18:08.502 --> 00:18:11.173
Why? Don't you want to go?

235
00:18:19.573 --> 00:18:22.482
Our first day of school was a bit special.

236
00:18:24.712 --> 00:18:26.883
(School Motto: Study hard)

238
00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.553
It wasn't a spring day.

239
00:18:31.553 --> 00:18:33.792
Four children started school...

240
00:18:33.853 --> 00:18:36.492
on a very hot day in August.

241
00:18:39.732 --> 00:18:41.262
There you go.

242
00:18:43.702 --> 00:18:46.002
Hurry up. Run.

243
00:18:46.532 --> 00:18:49.042
It's your family's turn to take a photo.

244
00:18:49.103 --> 00:18:51.173
- Here he is. - Thank you.

245
00:18:56.143 --> 00:18:59.012

246
00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:07.363
Mom told me this.

(Shinhanyang Elementary School)

248
00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:14.962
That Santa Claus had decided to grant Ji Won's dad a wish...

249
00:19:14.962 --> 00:19:18.432
and set up something special before he had to leave us.

250
00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:24.843
- Paper, paper, scissors. - Rock, rock, rock.

251
00:19:26.212 --> 00:19:29.383
- Let's take a photo. - It was like Christmas in August.

252
00:19:30.012 --> 00:19:33.353
Look at me and smile. You all look great.

253
00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:37.083
The sky was clear blue as summer gave way to autumn.

254
00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:45.333
Okay.

255
00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:47.833
- Shall we do it now Ji Won's here? - Are you ready?

256
00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:49.833
- Come on. - Get ready.

257
00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:51.633
We're loyal friends.

258
00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:54.343
Ji Won, the pork cutlets are on you next time.

259
00:19:54.343 --> 00:19:55.843
- Did you press it? - Okay, okay.

260
00:19:55.843 --> 00:19:56.873
Don't just say yes.

261
00:19:56.873 --> 00:19:59.042
I promise.

262
00:19:59.042 --> 00:20:01.343
- Hey. - Get back.

263
00:20:02.212 --> 00:20:04.883
The kids who remember the sun air, and...

264
00:20:04.883 --> 00:20:07.423
wind of that day have gathered again.

00:20:07.423 --> 00:20:08.853
- Cheese. - Cheese.

266
00:20:09.153 --> 00:20:10.792
We're 35 now.

267
00:20:11.553 --> 00:20:14.893
On Christmas in August of 2017.

268
00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:24.972
Hello, Producer Bong.

269
00:20:25.873 --> 00:20:29.442
Remember the only condition I gave? I called to check on that.

270
00:20:30.873 --> 00:20:32.843
We're all prepared.

271
00:20:34.843 --> 00:20:36.413
Jin Jin has no idea.

272
00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.222
- Hong Hee. - Yes?

273
00:20:45.222 --> 00:20:46.923
- Isn't it odd? - What?

274
00:20:46.923 --> 00:20:49.492
What do you mean?

275
00:20:49.823 --> 00:20:51.063
Am I overdressed?

276
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:57.032
Stop it.

277
00:20:57.032 --> 00:20:58.732
You looked preoccupied,

278
00:20:58.732 --> 00:21:00.843
so I dressed you up to cheer you up.

279
00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:02.373
Take it off if you don't like it.

280
00:21:02.373 --> 00:21:04.573
No, I'm just saying.

281
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:08.042
Jin Jin, President Jang will be a little late.

282
00:21:08.343 --> 00:21:10.143
He told us to go somewhere first.

283
00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:11.252
I'll stay in the car.

284
00:21:11.252 --> 00:21:13.553
Jin Jin, look over there. What do you think?

285
00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:16.182
Looks great.

286
00:21:28.962 --> 00:21:30.563
This is where you took the picture in the magazine, right?

287
00:21:31.173 --> 00:21:32.673
It definitely is.

288
00:21:32.702 --> 00:21:35.272
Jin Jin, do you want some coffee?

289
00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:46.553
Hello?

290
00:21:48.053 --> 00:21:49.323
Yes, give me a moment.

291
00:21:57.462 --> 00:21:59.962
My phone! I must have left it in the car.

292
00:21:59.962 --> 00:22:01.462
I'll be back soon.

293
00:22:19.813 --> 00:22:20.923
Ji Won.

294
00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:25.452
This is bad.

295
00:22:26.593 --> 00:22:28.992
You should stay with us for a while.

296
00:22:29.962 --> 00:22:31.462
- Pardon? - The thing is...

297
00:22:31.962 --> 00:22:34.863
I came by to give you some more side dishes,

298
00:22:35.432 --> 00:22:37.573
and it turns out our boiler exploded.

299
00:23:07.663 --> 00:23:09.803
I'm so sorry.

300
00:23:09.803 --> 00:23:12.133
You should stay with us for a while.

301
00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:14.303
Oh, it's all right. I can stay at a hotel.

302
00:23:14.303 --> 00:23:16.843
My goodness, you have a place you can stay.

303
00:23:16.843 --> 00:23:18.212
I'm fine.

304
00:23:18.212 --> 00:23:20.313
Don't say it's fine.

305
00:23:20.313 --> 00:23:22.742
Your mom will be really angry at me. You have to stay with us.

306
00:23:24.482 --> 00:23:27.623
- It's okay, leave it here. - I can't.

307
00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:31.053
Just stay until the walls dry and you have new wallpapers.

308
00:23:31.053 --> 00:23:32.452
It'll only take a few days.

309
00:23:32.792 --> 00:23:35.123
I feel bad, that's why.

310
00:23:47.972 --> 00:23:52.073
I clean this room every day, so it's not too bad.

311
00:23:52.073 --> 00:23:53.573
It's not the best place, but for a few days...

312
00:23:54.482 --> 00:23:57.353
Jin Jin lives on the 15th floor,

313
00:23:57.353 --> 00:23:58.913
so you won't be bothered.

314
00:24:00.282 --> 00:24:01.383
It's okay, right?

315
00:24:02.323 --> 00:24:03.353
Yes.

316
00:24:03.353 --> 00:24:05.992
You used to hang out so much in this room as a kid.

317
00:24:06.053 --> 00:24:08.893
You threw a fit saying you'll marry Jin Jin and not go home.

318
00:24:09.262 --> 00:24:12.163
Goodness, what am I saying?

319
00:24:12.932 --> 00:24:14.103
Don't worry about it.

320
00:24:14.633 --> 00:24:17.063
And give me any laundry or anything to iron.

321
00:24:17.063 --> 00:24:18.532
Don't be embarrassed, okay?

322
00:24:19.173 --> 00:24:20.873
- Yes, ma'am. - Good.

323
00:24:22.702 --> 00:24:25.073
Oh, right, and this.

324
00:24:27.012 --> 00:24:28.883
My gosh, do you still use keys?

325
00:24:29.012 --> 00:24:30.442
I should change your lock for you.

326
00:24:31.252 --> 00:24:34.153
It's all right. Don't mind it.

329
00:26:04.942 --> 00:26:07.583
- That way, you'll be more popular. - No, Anthony is much more popular.

330
00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:08.942
He's a member of Boys Be Ambitious.

331

What if you had to choose among us?

332
00:26:10.613 --> 00:26:11.653
Jin Jin.

333
00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:13.113
Why did we break up?

334
00:26:13.452 --> 00:26:15.452
Do you live here? My brother lives here too.

335
00:26:15.452 --> 00:26:18.153
I met this person, and I have to be really close with him.

336
00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:19.623
What kind of smell do men like?

337
00:26:19.623 --> 00:26:22.022
Why didn't you tell me you were on "We Got Married"?

338
00:26:22.022 --> 00:26:24.532
Who on earth is my sister-in-law?

339
00:26:24.532 --> 00:26:26.192
What I'm saying is this. Tell your wife...

340
00:26:26.492 --> 00:26:28.032
I'm not married.

341
00:26:28.032 --> 00:26:30.002
Stop spreading false rumors.
