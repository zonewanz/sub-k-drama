00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.438
(All characters, organizations, locations,)

2
00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:08.839
(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.949
The planner who gave 3.4 million dollars,

4
00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:14.978
Lee Mi Ran.

5
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.749
Is she really dead?

6
00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.859
She's alive.

7
00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:39.168
Where is she?

8
00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.068
Where is she right now?

9
00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.808
Tell me!

10
00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:00.528
Eun Joo.

11
00:01:03.558 --> 00:01:05.598
Do you remember calling me...

12
00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:08.269
two years ago?

13
00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:10.898
Two years ago?

14
00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:13.068
I threw away everything...

15
00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:14.838
that belonged to Bum Joon that day.

16
00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:20.309
(November 22, 2015)

17
00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:28.758
A guy who crashed a plane carrying 190 passengers...

18
00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.329
only left a few boxes of things...

19
00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:35.398
over 35 years of his life.

20
00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.398
And...

21
00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.838
Are you Kim Bum Joon's brother?

22
00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:55.249
Why? What is it?

23
00:01:55.618 --> 00:01:58.088
I'm a close friend of Bum Joon.

24
00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:02.059
I called because I wanted to pay him my respect.

25
00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:07.928
Could you tell me where he is resting?

26
00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:13.929
You were the first and the last person...

27
00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.798
who wanted to pay him respect.

28
00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.179
So did you go pay him respect?

29
00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.048
That's why I thought it was weird.

30
00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:35.888
You even paid respect for a horrible criminal,

31
00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.189
but when Mi Ran, your dear friend killed herself,

32
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:42.999
you never visited her at the ossuary.

33
00:02:46.828 --> 00:02:50.739
Why didn't you go visit her at the ossuary?

34
00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.578
That's because Lee Mi Ran is not dead.

35
00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:00.679
How did you do this?

36
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.818
Did you kill someone else in her place or something?

37
00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.489
I didn't do anything.

38
00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:10.258
All I said was that body was Mi Ran.

39
00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.959
All I did was to say that the deceased...

40
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.798
is Mi Ran. That's all.

41
00:03:19.168 --> 00:03:22.239
Are you saying you said someone else is her?

42
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.409
Are you two crazy?

43
00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.679
Was Bum Joon someone like you two?

44
00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:31.749
Was he also a murderer?

45
00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:35.978
Tell me. I'm sure you know him better than me.

46
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.478
I don't know anything.

47
00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:41.219
And Mi Ran said she doesn't know either.

48
00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:45.858
Min Joon, I beg you.

49
00:03:47.388 --> 00:03:48.999
Please don't look for Mi Ran.

50
00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:52.499
Do you know who Choi Kang Woo is?

51
00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.598
A family of the deceased from the flight 801.

52
00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.869
On the flight that Bum Joon crashed,

53
00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:06.478
his wife and his son were on board.

54
00:04:08.818 --> 00:04:12.318
I got someone like him involved in this.

55
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.189
That's how I'm like.

56
00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:18.189
Do you think I'll give up now?

57
00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.129
Where's Lee Mi Ran?

58
00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:26.398
- Tell me now! - I don't know.

59
00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.739
I really don't know.

60
00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.838
I met her for the 1st time in 6 years.

61
00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.179
She called me on a public phone.

62
00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:36.508
To whose phone?

63
00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:38.549
Yours?

64
00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:43.119
Han Mi Sook.

65
00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:54.499
Choi Ju Won.

66
00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:59.099
Are you happy that you're alive,

67
00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:02.398
Ms. Lee Mi Ran?

68
00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:29.898
The number you have called cannot receive calls.

69
00:06:02.658 --> 00:06:04.198
Ms. Kang Eun Joo is awake now.

70
00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:05.929
I just got to the hospital.

71
00:06:06.768 --> 00:06:08.398
Ask her where Lee Mi Ran is.

72
00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:13.008
She's dead.

73
00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:16.109
She killed herself two years ago.

74
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.008
She's alive. Lee Mi Ran is alive.

75
00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:20.879
What?

76
00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:56.278
Eun Joo.

77
00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.218
(Call Nurse)

78
00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:17.138
Can you hear me?

79
00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:19.508
Can you look at me?

80
00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:22.979
Ms. Jang, you can't be in here.

81
00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:24.749
Ms. Oh, I have to meet that patient now.

82
00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:25.849
Ms. Jang.

83
00:07:26.148 --> 00:07:27.979
Can't you see how the patient is doing?

84
00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:45.328
It's a program just for our VIPs...

85
00:07:45.328 --> 00:07:47.268
She was alive.

86
00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:51.638
This is a program which will reduce the cost...

87
00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.109
by going online.

88
00:07:55.109 --> 00:07:58.749
Next, I'll present our mobile business.

89
00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:03.148
In Korea, there are many references...

90
00:08:10.518 --> 00:08:12.958
Is something going on?

91
00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:15.028
Nothing's special.

92
00:08:16.198 --> 00:08:19.068
I'll never disclose confidential information.

93
00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:21.198
Please forgive me.

94
00:08:21.499 --> 00:08:22.939
Why not?

95
00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:25.309
Of course, for the sake of the company...

96
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:27.109
The company isn't that important.

97
00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.708
What's important to you is what's really important.

98
00:08:32.249 --> 00:08:34.749
Isn't your old affection more important to you?

99
00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:36.979
No, Chairman Cha.

100
00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:38.819
If he gets in your way, can you abandon him?

101
00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:43.558
Can you get rid of Kang Woo?

102
00:08:45.888 --> 00:08:46.989
Dad.

103
00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:54.028
The dog that you raised became your master now.

104
00:08:57.908 --> 00:08:59.768
You'll leak it again.

105
00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:11.749
How did that old man know?

106
00:09:14.089 --> 00:09:16.859
The dead should be dead. Why is she still alive?

107
00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:22.528
Did you do this?

108
00:09:22.898 --> 00:09:24.569
What are you talking about?

109
00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:26.829
She is...

110
00:09:27.229 --> 00:09:30.438
the planner that committed fraud with you,

111
00:09:30.798 --> 00:09:32.109
isn't she?

112
00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:34.739
You two were accomplices.

113
00:09:36.178 --> 00:09:37.278
Jin Chul.

114
00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:45.018
I don't remember.

115
00:09:47.388 --> 00:09:50.158
You know me. Since high school,

116
00:09:50.418 --> 00:09:52.229
I kept forgetting things.

117
00:09:57.528 --> 00:10:01.699
Let's keep it that way until the end.

118
00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:10.138
(Call history)

119
00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:19.148
How is she alive?

120
00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:23.119
It was on the news that she was dead.

121
00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:25.859
I think there might be an accomplice.

122
00:10:26.229 --> 00:10:28.859
There was only one insurance planner...

123
00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.658
that dealt with Ko Jin Chul.

124
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:34.168
She won the best planner a few years ago.

125
00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.239
It's Lee Mi Ran.

126
00:10:37.768 --> 00:10:38.839
Ko Jin Chul

127
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.548
How is Kang Eun Joo?

128
00:10:48.048 --> 00:10:50.619
She keeps having seizures,

129
00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:52.418
so they're giving her injections.

130
00:10:53.288 --> 00:10:55.158
It'll be difficult to visit her for a while.

131
00:10:56.888 --> 00:10:58.558
Sir, are you okay?

132
00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:05.028
Thank goodness Lee Mi Ran is alive.

133
00:11:07.528 --> 00:11:08.798
We can catch her now.

134
00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:12.469
Let's get Lee Mi Ran.

135
00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:13.869
How?

136
00:11:16.278 --> 00:11:17.609
How will you...

137
00:11:18.609 --> 00:11:20.249
catch a dead person?

138
00:11:21.319 --> 00:11:22.479
Is she really dead?

139
00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:26.148
Why didn't you tell us she was alive?

140
00:11:26.349 --> 00:11:28.319
Why did you beat around the bush?

141
00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:30.418
Why should I have told you?

142
00:11:31.688 --> 00:11:34.129
You don't tell me anything.

143
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:37.298
How can we trust a scammer like you?

144
00:11:38.369 --> 00:11:41.638
Then why should I trust you people?

145
00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:45.109
Because you aren't scammers?

146
00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:47.408
Or because you're...

147
00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:49.239
the victims'...

148
00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:57.349
Jang Ha Ri.

149
00:11:58.048 --> 00:11:59.388
You're trying hard.

150
00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:01.459
But you know nothing, don't you?

151
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:04.688
That's why you're here picking a fight.

152
00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.599
Stop bluffing...

153
00:12:12.268 --> 00:12:13.329
and get lost.

154
00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:30.449
What?

155
00:12:31.349 --> 00:12:32.749
Do you think I'll run away?

156
00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:34.048
Do you have anywhere to go?

157
00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:37.489
Come visit me when you're bored.

158
00:12:50.268 --> 00:12:51.668
Gosh.

159
00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:03.219
I'm hungry.

160
00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.499
I'll locate the phone booth Lee Mi Ran...

161
00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:21.199
made the last call. Wait a second.

162
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:28.079
It's Danyang, North Chungcheong Province,

163
00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.609
roadside of route 59.

164
00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:33.109
Find the other locations as well.

165
00:13:33.609 --> 00:13:35.918
Visit Kang Eun Joo when it's possible.

166
00:13:35.918 --> 00:13:37.148
Yes, sir.

167
00:13:46.928 --> 00:13:49.158
Are you worried about me?

168
00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:52.069
You keep looking at me like that.

169
00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:54.638
It's because your driving makes me nervous.

170
00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:56.569
What?

171
00:13:57.268 --> 00:13:59.069
I'm a better driver.

172
00:13:59.369 --> 00:14:00.938
Why did you have to take the wheel?

173
00:14:00.938 --> 00:14:02.079
You make me nervous.

174
00:14:05.008 --> 00:14:08.148
Hey, you need some sleep. Take a nap.

175
00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:16.888
We're starting now, aren't we?

176
00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:22.729
Then we should get to the bottom of it.

177
00:14:23.758 --> 00:14:25.298
Let's go to the end.

178
00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:43.849
There's only one surveillance camera,

179
00:14:44.548 --> 00:14:46.449
and this is a blind spot.

180
00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:49.119
Are you happy that you're alive,

181
00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:50.918
Ms. Lee Mi Ran?

182
00:15:04.268 --> 00:15:05.668
She was flustered.

183
00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:08.739
You make mistakes when you're flustered.

184
00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:22.558
I brought the surveillance kit.

185
00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:51.788
Mr. Choi.

186
00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.089
Let's go.

187
00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.599
Son, the sun's too bright.

188
00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:47.069
Thanks, Son.

189
00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.719
(No visitors allowed)

190
00:16:55.719 --> 00:16:57.278
Mr. Park Soon Jung.

191
00:16:57.548 --> 00:16:58.989
Can't you see the sign?

192
00:16:58.989 --> 00:17:00.188
Take your hands off from there.

193
00:17:00.349 --> 00:17:02.219
Okay. Hello.

194
00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.559
Your team isn't allowed in this hospital...

195
00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:08.728
until that patient is released.

196
00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:10.428
Ma'am.

197
00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:12.928
Please help me.

198
00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:13.968
Should I call security?

199
00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:15.668
Please don't do this.

200
00:17:16.198 --> 00:17:17.198
I'm disappointed.

201
00:17:17.198 --> 00:17:18.438
Disappointed?

202
00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:19.938
Can't you see I'm desperate?

203
00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.339
You know...

204
00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.438
a dead person came back to... I mean...

205
00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:26.408
Anyway,

206
00:17:26.408 --> 00:17:28.148
there's a person I must find.

207
00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:30.079
Is that why you want to visit someone...

208
00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:31.488
who isn't allowed any visitors?

209
00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:32.549
Mr. Park.

210
00:17:33.448 --> 00:17:35.918
You know her condition better than anyone.

211
00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:40.029
I thought you were doing what you do...

212
00:17:40.289 --> 00:17:42.958
because you cared about people.

213
00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.129
But I guess you don't.

214
00:17:46.668 --> 00:17:47.968
Ms. Kang Eun Joo...

215
00:17:48.238 --> 00:17:51.099
had the seizure after that young man visited.

216
00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:54.978
Make sure he never sets foot...

217
00:17:54.978 --> 00:17:56.478
in this hospital again.

218
00:17:57.138 --> 00:17:58.648
If he comes back,

219
00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.379
I'll kill him.

220
00:18:05.988 --> 00:18:07.488
Kim Min Joon, that punk.

221
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:10.289
(Park Moo Shin, Claims Examination Team Manager)

222
00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:12.388
He wanted a consultation.

223
00:18:14.158 --> 00:18:15.259
Regarding what case?

224
00:18:15.259 --> 00:18:17.428
All the cases Mad Dog brought me.

225
00:18:20.629 --> 00:18:23.269
So do you want me to be a spy?

226
00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:25.109
Don't put it that way.

227
00:18:25.468 --> 00:18:27.039
You know very well...

228
00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.908
that Kang Woo isn't in his right mind.

229
00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:31.809
He's acting crazy. He changed too much.

230
00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.408
I want to stop him as a friend, Professor.

231
00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:35.879
These days...

232
00:18:35.879 --> 00:18:38.089
I make coffee, go dancing,

233
00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:40.148
and go playing ping pong.

234
00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.519
But I used to...

235
00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:44.829
work in forensics for a little while.

236
00:18:46.188 --> 00:18:47.488
What do you mean?

237
00:18:47.998 --> 00:18:50.198
You were a big figure in forensics for 40 years.

238
00:18:50.198 --> 00:18:51.829
A big figure?

239
00:18:52.569 --> 00:18:55.039
Manager Park, do you know...

240
00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.668
what forensics is about?

241
00:18:56.668 --> 00:18:57.809
Isn't it about doing an autopsy...

242
00:18:57.809 --> 00:18:59.468
to find the cause of death?

243
00:18:59.468 --> 00:19:01.309
Everyone thinks like that.

244
00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:03.839
But it's actually about...

245
00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:06.309
finding people their final rights.

246
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.379
When I first met Kang Woo,

247
00:19:09.379 --> 00:19:11.079
he was a constable.

248
00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:14.148
He came to me every day because of someone...

249
00:19:14.148 --> 00:19:16.119
that died of a chronic illness.

250
00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:19.388
His wife and son...

251
00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:21.998
has the right to know at least the cause...

252
00:19:21.998 --> 00:19:24.099
of their family member's death.

253
00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:26.468
They said that was the last right of the dead.

254
00:19:26.829 --> 00:19:29.198
So I did an autopsy.

255
00:19:30.468 --> 00:19:31.708
It turned out he was poisoned to death.

256
00:19:32.668 --> 00:19:34.609
His younger brother was his business partner.

257
00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:35.938
And the brother fed him with bleach for a month...

258
00:19:35.938 --> 00:19:37.708
to own the business by himself.

259
00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.809
If it hadn't been for Kang Woo,

260
00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:42.648
they would've treated him like a family member...

261
00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:45.819
without knowing that he was the murderer.

262
00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:48.958
Mr. Park.

263
00:19:50.218 --> 00:19:52.688
Kang Woo has been that kind of guy.

264
00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:54.928
He hasn't changed a bit.

265
00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:56.799
He just wants to know...

266
00:19:57.698 --> 00:20:00.198
how his family died and why.

267
00:20:00.269 --> 00:20:02.438
You already know it was the suicide crash...

268
00:20:02.438 --> 00:20:03.938
of the assistant pilot.

269
00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:05.539
It doesn't matter whether I know it or not.

270
00:20:06.009 --> 00:20:08.208
The family of the deceased isn't sure about that.

271
00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:11.009
Then I should let him know in any possible ways.

272
00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:12.478
As his friend?

273
00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:14.978
Yes, as his friend.

274
00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:17.379
As my friend?

275
00:20:21.158 --> 00:20:22.289
Kang Woo.

276
00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:24.728
What happened?

277
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:28.158
Lee Mi Ran is alive.

278
00:20:28.658 --> 00:20:32.069
The insurance planner from two years ago?

279
00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:34.869
Yes.

280
00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:36.968
Are you okay?

281
00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:38.369
I'm not.

282
00:20:43.478 --> 00:20:44.748
No, I'm all right.

283
00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:47.049
I'm just...

284
00:20:49.418 --> 00:20:50.579
a bit scared.

285
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:54.148
I thought it was an accident.

286
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:57.059
I thought it was done by some lunatic.

287
00:20:58.188 --> 00:21:00.888
So I wanted to kill...

288
00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:04.898
that man, Kim Bum Joon.

289
00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:08.369
But he died.

290
00:21:09.998 --> 00:21:11.309
It was over.

291
00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:14.138
That's what I believed for two years.

292
00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.349
If that's not true...

293
00:21:19.849 --> 00:21:21.218
Then what should I...

294
00:21:37.398 --> 00:21:38.668
I found fingerprints.

295
00:21:40.069 --> 00:21:42.238
I'm not sure if they're Lee Mi Ran's,

296
00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.708
but please analyze them for me.

297
00:21:45.468 --> 00:21:48.408
Okay, I'll ask someone to do it.

(Park Moo Shin, Claims Examination Team Manager)

299
00:22:06.589 --> 00:22:08.158
(Mid-November, 2015)

300
00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:11.869
Let's go.

301
00:22:12.869 --> 00:22:14.428
I'll be in trouble if they find out...

302
00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:16.468
that I brought you here.

303
00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:29.079
He made me believe that Mi Ran died.

304
00:22:33.388 --> 00:22:36.059
Kim Bum Joon's brother is working with him?

305
00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:37.888
Seeing how they're after Lee Mi Ran, I think...

306
00:22:38.329 --> 00:22:40.589
they're reinvestigating on the flight 801 incident.

307
00:22:40.728 --> 00:22:42.299
We need to stop them.

308
00:22:44.498 --> 00:22:46.069
Why should we?

309
00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.638
The case is closed, but if people find out...

310
00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:50.468
that the families of the victims and assailant...

311
00:22:50.468 --> 00:22:51.869
are reinvestigating the case...

312
00:22:51.869 --> 00:22:54.269
Of course, it's not good.

313
00:22:55.178 --> 00:22:56.738
By the way, Mr. Park.

314
00:22:59.648 --> 00:23:03.279
I weeded the garden, but they're grown again.

315
00:23:03.879 --> 00:23:05.648
Let me...

316
00:23:05.648 --> 00:23:06.789
Leave them be.

317
00:23:07.289 --> 00:23:09.259
They can grow on barren land...

318
00:23:09.718 --> 00:23:12.329
or even on asphalt ground.

319
00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:16.599
You mustn't weed them out to remove them completely.

320
00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:21.498
You just need to burn them when they're fully grown.

321
00:23:26.869 --> 00:23:28.609
Gosh, you startled me.

322
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.039
You can't come in here freely like this.

323
00:23:31.248 --> 00:23:32.908
You think it's still your office?

324
00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:34.879
Why would you be startled?

325
00:23:35.218 --> 00:23:37.478
Hey, do you love me?

326
00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:41.158
Why do you keep following me around?

327
00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:42.789
I never did that.

328
00:23:43.718 --> 00:23:45.388
When will you stop what you're doing?

329
00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:48.599
I can't let go of your illegal deeds forever.

330
00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:51.269
You stress so much about keeping the laws.

331
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:54.228
But why did you take me to the ossuary two years ago?

332
00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:55.839
What?

333
00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:58.109
Leaking the assailant's info to the victim...

334
00:23:58.109 --> 00:23:59.468
is illegal.

335
00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:02.738
It was for your sake.

336
00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:04.478
I wanted you to get over it quickly.

337
00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:08.349
Why are you digging into it again? You're...

338
00:24:08.349 --> 00:24:10.448
- Mr. Park. - Yes, sir.

339
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:12.549
Don't let Kang Woo know.

340
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:13.589
Pardon?

341
00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:18.029
Don't show that we know about Bum Joon's brother.

342
00:24:18.428 --> 00:24:21.398
- Go on. - You're making a ruckus.

343
00:24:21.498 --> 00:24:24.458
Why'd you dig in the case and look for a dead woman?

344
00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:26.769
A dead woman... Is that right?

345
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:28.769
Look at your eyes.

346
00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:30.738
Come to your senses.

347
00:24:31.938 --> 00:24:33.238
Okay, I will.

348
00:24:33.968 --> 00:24:35.579
Let me ask you one question.

349
00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:40.579
Are we friends?

350
00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:43.748
I heard you said that.

351
00:24:44.379 --> 00:24:45.948
"As his friend."

352
00:24:47.918 --> 00:24:49.119
Are we friends?

353
00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:52.428
We aren't?

354
00:24:53.188 --> 00:24:56.559
Have we ever been friends?

355
00:24:56.859 --> 00:24:59.069
I'm not a friend of a criminal like you.

356
00:25:04.938 --> 00:25:06.738
Min Joon is gone, Mr. Choi.

357
00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:11.379
What? You seem like you lost your dog.

358
00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:12.779
It's none of your business.

359
00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:16.049
Think of a way to bring up your company record.

360
00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:18.218
What do you mean he's gone?

361
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:20.988
Okay, I'll go right now.

362
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:22.158
Kang Woo.

363
00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:25.559
Yes, Hong Joo?

364
00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.928
What brings you to Mr. Park's office?

365
00:25:28.928 --> 00:25:31.269
I'm a bit busy now. If you aren't getting in...

366
00:25:39.869 --> 00:25:43.938
Won't you tell me why you took Lee Mi Ran's case?

367
00:25:48.918 --> 00:25:50.948
Am I that unreliable?

368
00:25:50.948 --> 00:25:52.589
More unreliable than Mr. Park?

369
00:25:52.948 --> 00:25:55.589
Do you think I'm still a newbie doing stakeouts...

370
00:25:55.589 --> 00:25:57.089
whom you scolded so much?

371
00:25:57.688 --> 00:25:58.859
That's not it.

372
00:26:00.688 --> 00:26:02.658
I'm just not sure of anything.

373
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:04.928
What are you not sure of?

374
00:26:05.428 --> 00:26:06.569
Everything.

375
00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:12.408
I know you're sure of everything.

376
00:26:12.638 --> 00:26:14.109
There isn't a thing you don't know.

377
00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:17.638
Apparently, there is.

378
00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:22.049
I'll get going.

379
00:26:22.379 --> 00:26:24.319
- The doors are closing. - Kang Woo.

380
00:27:03.958 --> 00:27:06.059
I guess he changed the USIM chip of his phone.

381
00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:07.658
I can't track him down.

382
00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:09.799
His car is in the garage,

383
00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:11.498
so I thought he was in the office.

384
00:27:12.069 --> 00:27:15.099
Is there any leakage of Eun Joo and Mi Ran's data?

385
00:27:15.168 --> 00:27:18.668
From my computer? No way.

386
00:27:19.908 --> 00:27:21.879
I only sent Eun Joo's phone call history...

387
00:27:21.879 --> 00:27:23.738
to you, Cheetah,

388
00:27:23.738 --> 00:27:26.678
and Ha Ri's phones. That's all.

389
00:27:27.349 --> 00:27:30.119
You sent it to me too? Gosh, this punk.

390
00:27:31.418 --> 00:27:32.918
Oh, to my smartphone?

391
00:27:34.349 --> 00:27:36.089
Where is my...

392
00:27:38.488 --> 00:27:39.529
What?

393
00:27:41.228 --> 00:27:42.259
What?

394
00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:44.728
It's missing.

395
00:27:46.728 --> 00:27:48.769
Then why should I trust you people?

396
00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:52.468
Because you aren't scammers?

397
00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:54.678
Or because you're...

398
00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.238

399
00:28:04.379 --> 00:28:05.519
Why that...

(Kang Woo)

401
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:31.448
- Hello? - Hey, Min Joon.

402
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:33.279
So you steal things too.

403
00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.448
Don't say that.

404
00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:36.849
I only picked it.

405
00:28:36.849 --> 00:28:38.049
What are you going to do with it?

406
00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:42.388
You want to bet on who finds Mi Ran first?

407
00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:46.589
There you go again.

408
00:28:46.688 --> 00:28:48.029
Shall I not?

409
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:51.998
Then again, it's boring to do a winning bet.

410
00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:53.829
Mad Dog is nothing.

411
00:28:54.069 --> 00:28:55.769
You're only dogs without teeth.

412
00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:58.238
You're nothing more or less than that.

413
00:28:58.238 --> 00:29:00.638
You want to get bitten to death?

414
00:29:01.069 --> 00:29:04.408
Kim Min Joon. If you make it obvious...

415
00:29:04.779 --> 00:29:07.509
and cause Mi Ran to disappear, I'll kill you.

416
00:29:11.688 --> 00:29:13.948
We'll catch Mi Ran faster than that punk.

417
00:29:14.688 --> 00:29:15.688
Okay?

418
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:17.259
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

419
00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:18.289
Yes, sir.

Director Cha, what brings you here?

423
00:29:46.418 --> 00:29:48.918
It seemed like you were very busy lately.

424
00:29:48.918 --> 00:29:50.418
So I won't beat around the bush.

425

My dad, Kang Woo, you,

and Lee Mi Ran.

427

What's going on here?

428
00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:00.728
I'm sorry.

429
00:30:00.998 --> 00:30:02.738
You should hear it from the chairman.

430
00:30:03.099 --> 00:30:06.009
Your immediate superior is...

431
00:30:06.369 --> 00:30:07.509
me.

432
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:08.809
I apologize, Director Cha.

What are you doing?

437
00:30:45.849 --> 00:30:46.948
Are you throwing a fit?

438
00:30:46.948 --> 00:30:48.319
I'm not.

439
00:30:48.579 --> 00:30:50.119
I made a rational decision.

440
00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.448
Things continuously happen...

441
00:30:51.448 --> 00:30:53.648
within Taeyang Insurance that I do not know about.

442
00:30:54.248 --> 00:30:55.988
I don't think I need to stick around.

443
00:30:58.789 --> 00:31:00.089
Then was there not a thing...

444
00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:02.498
that I did not know of within the company?

445
00:31:02.498 --> 00:31:04.198
Ask me directly without sounding me out.

446
00:31:04.198 --> 00:31:07.698
I do not have any questions. You may leave.

447
00:31:07.698 --> 00:31:09.498
But I do.

448
00:31:09.998 --> 00:31:11.539
You can either tell me,

449
00:31:12.168 --> 00:31:13.369
or throw me out.

450
00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:16.009
That's your problem.

451
00:31:16.478 --> 00:31:18.309
You do not know your place.

452
00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:21.579
Even if I tell you, you won't be able to take it.

453
00:31:22.218 --> 00:31:23.678
You're someone who disclosed...

454
00:31:23.678 --> 00:31:25.918
confidential information out of old affection.

455
00:31:26.388 --> 00:31:28.158
You shouldn't trust people.

456
00:31:28.158 --> 00:31:30.188
People are nothing but black-haired beasts.

457
00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:33.829
It's must be because I'm your daughter.

What?

459
00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:37.398
You're helping Joo Hyun Ki...

A black-haired beast.

466
00:31:51.448 --> 00:31:53.408
Let me remind you once again...

467
00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:55.579
that I'm your daughter.

468
00:31:56.049 --> 00:31:58.519
I have enough connections to find out this much.

469
00:31:59.089 --> 00:32:01.759
You tried so hard to make him the chief.

470
00:32:03.089 --> 00:32:05.289
You should pay him a little more attention.

471
00:32:20.109 --> 00:32:21.839
Where's On Joo Sik right now?

472

Find him immediately.

I'm sorry, Chief Prosecutor On.

474

Hey, Prosecutor Kim.

475
00:32:35.359 --> 00:32:38.059
Why did you only get stew for the chief prosecutor?

476
00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:42.859
Why? This is great.

477
00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:46.829
Congratulations on your appointment, sir.

478
00:32:46.829 --> 00:32:48.539
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

479
00:32:58.408 --> 00:32:59.879
It's an honor for me to work with you.

480
00:33:00.009 --> 00:33:01.849
I'll take you somewhere great for the next round.

481
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:07.549
Let's just grab a drink and go home early.

482
00:33:13.829 --> 00:33:15.498
I will be waiting.

483
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:19.529
- Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye, sir.

484
00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:27.978
What was that? What's with him today?

485
00:33:28.478 --> 00:33:30.539
Haven't you heard his inaugural address?

486
00:33:31.478 --> 00:33:34.178
"I accept the demand for a change, and I will..."

487
00:33:34.448 --> 00:33:36.448
"turn the prosecution into an honest place."

488
00:33:38.718 --> 00:33:39.819
Does he want to butter people up...

489
00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:41.658
to survive after his term of five years?

490
00:33:42.218 --> 00:33:44.218
He's putting on too much of a show though.

491
00:33:44.829 --> 00:33:46.988
He even turned down my offer to take him home.

492
00:33:47.329 --> 00:33:48.759
Someone must be here for him.

493
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.408
You must've been in quite a rush.

494
00:34:04.379 --> 00:34:06.079
You sent me a car.

495
00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:10.578
I heard Juhan Air will undergo an investigation.

496
00:34:10.978 --> 00:34:12.949
But you haven't mentioned anything to me.

497
00:34:14.418 --> 00:34:17.788
Did this old man disappoint you in any way?

498
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.058
The prosecutor in charge was...

499
00:34:20.788 --> 00:34:23.598
confident that he sealed everyone's mouth.

500
00:34:24.768 --> 00:34:26.998
Chairman Cha, you really are amazing.

501
00:34:32.768 --> 00:34:35.208
I can stop the process for a moment.

502
00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.109
But not for long.

503
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:38.808
The world has changed.

504
00:34:40.009 --> 00:34:42.618
Do not cause any trouble that people will talk of.

505
00:34:42.618 --> 00:34:44.748
Wrap up the process of the succession...

00:34:45.748 --> 00:34:47.049
of management rights within Juhan Air.

507
00:34:50.319 --> 00:34:51.889
Gosh, what a day.

508
00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:57.728
Chief Prosecutor On.

509
00:34:59.029 --> 00:35:00.828
We'll wrap up everything very soon.

510
00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.969
Please delay the process until I'm...

511
00:35:04.538 --> 00:35:05.708
Goodbye.

512
00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:13.509
You should thank Chairman Cha.

513
00:35:18.389 --> 00:35:19.719
You should go too.

514
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:22.288
Do you think you're training your dog?

515
00:35:22.288 --> 00:35:23.518
What is this?

516
00:35:24.728 --> 00:35:27.629
Even dogs know how to feed themselves.

517
00:35:28.598 --> 00:35:30.098
You had no idea...

518
00:35:30.098 --> 00:35:32.098
that you were going to get in trouble.

519
00:35:32.828 --> 00:35:34.268
You should thank Hong Joo.

520
00:35:34.268 --> 00:35:35.768
Why are you bringing Hong Joo into this?

521
00:35:35.768 --> 00:35:37.469
Hong Joo found out about this.

522
00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:41.308
I'm so glad she's my daughter.

523
00:35:41.938 --> 00:35:44.279
I'm not sure if Hong Joo feels the same.

524
00:35:46.509 --> 00:35:48.179
Is that all you have to say?

525
00:35:54.558 --> 00:35:56.918
I am truly grateful, Chairman Cha.

526
00:35:58.188 --> 00:35:59.859
And you have to earn your keep too.

527
00:36:00.328 --> 00:36:01.799
A small fry is clinging to us.

528
00:36:01.799 --> 00:36:03.199
Take him down too.

529
00:36:04.768 --> 00:36:07.228
A small fry? What kind of a small fry?

530
00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:11.208
Goodness, that old man.

531
00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:13.268
I was asking him a question.

532
00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:16.208
He has no manners.

533
00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:26.819
What's this?

(Are You Happy to Be Alive?)

535
00:36:51.379 --> 00:36:52.609
Any security cameras?

536
00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:56.978
There's one, but it's broken.

537
00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:13.668
Cheetah, I found the cellphone.

538
00:37:13.668 --> 00:37:14.768
What?

539
00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:20.409
Did you say this was where you found...

540
00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:21.639
the last signal from Min Joon's phone, right?

541
00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:23.509
Yes, why?

542
00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:50.598
That place has no security cameras too?

543
00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:53.208
No cameras, and not many people are around.

544
00:37:54.308 --> 00:37:55.409
It's the same here.

545

No cameras, and not many people are around.

546

(Haedori Village)

548
00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:03.949
It's definitely not a place to walk.

549
00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.518
Right?

550
00:38:06.788 --> 00:38:08.759
I only see cars drive by.

551
00:38:08.759 --> 00:38:10.759
That means she moved by a car.

552
00:38:11.629 --> 00:38:14.129
Noo Ri, mark the public phones on the map...

553
00:38:14.129 --> 00:38:15.299
and send it to me.

556
00:38:26.808 --> 00:38:28.938
She didn't go anywhere below Chungju?

557
00:38:29.208 --> 00:38:30.779
Why? She's traveling by a car.

558
00:38:30.779 --> 00:38:32.509
It's either that she couldn't go,

559
00:38:32.509 --> 00:38:34.148
or that she was not supposed to.

560
00:38:34.618 --> 00:38:37.078
Or she may have had to stay there.

561
00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:42.759
She couldn't leave the area.

562
00:38:45.259 --> 00:38:47.058
She had a place to return to.

Why isn't there a match yet?

00:39:08.648 --> 00:39:10.219
Would this cause any problem, Professor Byeon?

567
00:39:10.219 --> 00:39:13.089
- I'm telling you, no. - I see.

She's a dead person.

572

She really is alive.

573
00:39:27.768 --> 00:39:30.299
Professor Byeon. What are you doing here?

574
00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:37.239
What do you mean Lee Mi Ran is alive?

575
00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:40.779
You just saw the dactyloscopy result.

576

- Yes, Professor Byeon. - The result is out.

You were right. She's alive.

I don't know.

596

I've never seen her.

This is from two years ago.

623
00:42:10.558 --> 00:42:12.529
She might look different now.

"I can tell right away"?

634

Hello.

I'd like to see some houses.

638
00:42:47.168 --> 00:42:48.998
What kind of house do you want?

639
00:42:48.998 --> 00:42:51.808
I don't want a house with blocked views.

640
00:42:52.368 --> 00:42:54.168
I want one side to have a big window.

641

I knew it. Younger people want great views.

A young man who came by a few days ago...

643
00:42:59.208 --> 00:43:00.208
wanted the same.

644
00:43:00.509 --> 00:43:01.719
Is that right?

645
00:43:02.148 --> 00:43:03.319
Where is that house?

646
00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:40.248
There is no trace of Kim Min Joon.

647

Yes, sir.

Kim Min Joon is here.

650
00:43:54.569 --> 00:43:58.339
He wasn't observing, but he was being observed.

651
00:44:01.308 --> 00:44:04.279
Rewind it, and play it again slowly.

Who is that? He's a pro.

659
00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:29.759
Do we have his face?

660
00:45:30.259 --> 00:45:32.529
Wait. Go right before when he gets in the car.

661
00:45:32.898 --> 00:45:33.929
Okay.

Ko Jin Chul. Jae Soo died.

668
00:46:17.438 --> 00:46:18.679
So you should die too.

669
00:46:19.279 --> 00:46:20.808
Die!

Why was Ko Jin Chul observing Kim Min Joon?

673
00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:26.879
So Kim Min Joon is after Lee Mi Ran,

674
00:47:26.879 --> 00:47:30.648
and Ko Jin Chul is after Kim Min Joon. What's this?

675
00:47:30.719 --> 00:47:33.389
Does Dr. Kim know Ko Jin Chul is after him?

676
00:47:33.518 --> 00:47:34.989
In the video,

677
00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:37.489
Dr. Kim isn't moving. at all.

678
00:47:37.489 --> 00:47:39.458
He must've really wanted to get Mi Ran.

679
00:47:40.188 --> 00:47:42.098
He won't know he's being followed.

680
00:47:42.498 --> 00:47:44.828
Didn't Ko Jin Chul kill five people?

681
00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.268
Isn't Dr. Kim in danger right now?

682
00:47:47.629 --> 00:47:50.339
He's quick-witted. Don't mind him.

683
00:47:50.339 --> 00:47:52.339
Killing five people makes Jin Chul a serial killer.

684
00:47:52.768 --> 00:47:54.938
Even prisoners are scared of serial killers.

685
00:47:56.239 --> 00:47:57.279
Ms. Jang.

686
00:47:58.308 --> 00:48:00.308
Are you okay with Kim Min Joon getting hurt?

687
00:48:00.308 --> 00:48:01.549
I don't care if he gets hurt.

688
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:03.049
That's none of my business.

689
00:48:13.029 --> 00:48:14.498
Sir, I found the location.

690
00:48:14.498 --> 00:48:15.598
It's in Daegong-ri, Dongjang-myeon...

691
00:48:15.598 --> 00:48:16.828
of Chungju, North Chungcheong Province.

692
00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:18.529
That's in North Chungcheong Province.

693
00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:19.529
Okay.

694
00:48:28.379 --> 00:48:29.978
What are you doing in Chungju?

695
00:48:30.078 --> 00:48:31.848
Three cars were parked in front of...

696
00:48:31.848 --> 00:48:33.409
Daegong Elementary School...

697
00:48:33.409 --> 00:48:36.819
from 3:42pm to 3:46pm. Check the surveillance...

698
00:48:36.819 --> 00:48:38.688
and please run the plates.

699
00:48:39.618 --> 00:48:41.118
You're crazy.

700
00:48:41.259 --> 00:48:42.688
The third car is Ko Jin Chul's.

701
00:48:42.688 --> 00:48:44.788
- Who? - Ko Jin Chul.

702
00:48:45.288 --> 00:48:47.659
The scammer who killed Jae Soo and ran away.

703
00:48:48.529 --> 00:48:49.728
He's a serial killer.

704
00:48:50.058 --> 00:48:51.368
What are you saying this time?

705
00:48:51.668 --> 00:48:53.328
Earlier, you said Lee Mi Ran was alive.

706
00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:09.618
(Gohang Farm)

707
00:49:26.429 --> 00:49:28.038
(Gohang Farm)

708
00:49:49.618 --> 00:49:54.259
(Gohang Farm)

709
00:50:00.629 --> 00:50:02.339
- Get your bag. - Okay.

710
00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:11.009
(Gohang Farm)

711
00:50:29.728 --> 00:50:30.958
- Mom. - Yes?

712
00:50:30.958 --> 00:50:32.498
I'll go feed the goats.

713
00:50:32.498 --> 00:50:34.199
Don't feed them too much at once.

714
00:50:34.199 --> 00:50:35.239
Okay.

715
00:50:41.279 --> 00:50:42.509
Ha Seong, what's wrong?

716
00:50:52.089 --> 00:50:53.348
Mr. Choi.

717
00:50:53.618 --> 00:50:55.589
The phone signal of the first car owner...

718
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:58.029
is caught about 25km away from you.

719
00:50:58.029 --> 00:50:59.958
But the phone signal of the third car owner...

720
00:50:59.958 --> 00:51:01.958
I mean, the burn phone assumed to be...

721
00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.958
Ko Jin Chul's is nearby as well.

722
00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:06.098
What's around that area?

723
00:51:06.098 --> 00:51:07.839
There's a farm according to the map.

724
00:51:07.969 --> 00:51:09.168
It's called Gohang Farm.

725
00:51:09.469 --> 00:51:10.898
Gohang Farm?

726
00:51:10.898 --> 00:51:12.268
(Chungju, North Chungcheong Province)

727
00:51:49.409 --> 00:51:51.648
I saw there's a pension behind your house.

728
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.748
How about you go there for a second...

729
00:51:54.748 --> 00:51:56.549
while I talk with your mom?

730
00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:59.949
Mom.

731
00:51:59.949 --> 00:52:01.259
It's okay.

732
00:52:01.759 --> 00:52:03.259
He's my friend.

733
00:52:03.259 --> 00:52:04.389
Go ahead.

734
00:52:04.659 --> 00:52:05.828
Tell your aunt...

735
00:52:05.828 --> 00:52:07.688
that I'll be there soon.

736
00:52:33.219 --> 00:52:34.918
You must not know who I am.

737
00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:35.958
I do.

738
00:52:37.319 --> 00:52:39.188
You're Bum Joon's brother.

739
00:52:40.328 --> 00:52:43.328
We've met before briefly.

740
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:46.469
On the day of Bum Joon's accident.

741
00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:48.998
Mi Ran.

742
00:52:49.469 --> 00:52:50.538
Hi, Bum Joon.

743
00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:53.768
You came all the way here for that?

744
00:52:54.009 --> 00:52:55.409
You really didn't have to.

745
00:52:55.409 --> 00:52:57.578
I changed the beneficiary's name.

746
00:52:57.578 --> 00:53:00.009
Your brother's name is Kim Min Joon, right?

747
00:53:00.779 --> 00:53:02.248
Take a look at it yourself.

748
00:53:02.478 --> 00:53:03.949
You keep it.

749
00:53:03.949 --> 00:53:06.248
- I can't keep it at home. - Why not?

750
00:53:06.248 --> 00:53:08.319
It's because he'll be mad if he finds out.

751
00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:13.929
Wait here.

752
00:53:13.929 --> 00:53:15.029
I'm on my way to the airport now.

753
00:53:15.029 --> 00:53:16.398
I'll drop you off at your company.

754
00:53:27.368 --> 00:53:28.938
Seeing you up close,

755
00:53:29.679 --> 00:53:30.938
you look more like him.

756
00:53:33.509 --> 00:53:35.049
How did you find me?

757
00:53:36.219 --> 00:53:37.449
Eun Joo...

758
00:53:38.489 --> 00:53:39.819
is a bit sick now.

759
00:53:40.389 --> 00:53:41.859
I think I played a part too.

760
00:53:41.859 --> 00:53:42.859
What have you done?

761
00:53:42.859 --> 00:53:45.629
What about you? What have you done?

762
00:53:46.929 --> 00:53:48.058
What have you done...

763
00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:51.268
that you live in hiding as a dead person?

764
00:53:51.898 --> 00:53:53.799
Are you happy to live this way?

765
00:53:55.139 --> 00:53:56.239
You know...

766
00:53:56.998 --> 00:53:59.208
how Bum Joon died, right?

767
00:54:00.569 --> 00:54:02.978
I do. He killed himself.

768
00:54:02.978 --> 00:54:04.648
Isn't it strange though?

769
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:08.049
The one who consulted...

770
00:54:08.049 --> 00:54:09.478
3.4 million-dollar insurance...

771
00:54:09.478 --> 00:54:11.078
stole someone else's identity and lives here.

772
00:54:12.219 --> 00:54:14.049
Who is the dead person?

773
00:54:15.558 --> 00:54:17.359
Did you kill her?

774
00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:19.328
It has nothing to do with you.

775
00:54:19.328 --> 00:54:21.699
Why do you want to live by doing that much?

776
00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:23.598
What are you trying to hide?

777
00:54:24.799 --> 00:54:25.998
Bum Joon...

778
00:54:27.129 --> 00:54:28.668
didn't kill himself, did he?

779
00:54:28.668 --> 00:54:29.768
It was...

780
00:54:31.239 --> 00:54:32.969
the day before the accident...

781
00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:34.578
when he changed the beneficiary to you.

782
00:54:35.308 --> 00:54:36.938
He called me at night urgently...

783
00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:38.909
and wanted to give all the money to you.

784
00:54:40.748 --> 00:54:43.449
He must've killed himself because he wanted to...

785
00:54:43.449 --> 00:54:45.018
give you the 3.4 million dollars.

786
00:54:45.688 --> 00:54:47.219
That's what I thought.

787
00:54:47.748 --> 00:54:49.159
You took the money, right?

788
00:54:50.259 --> 00:54:51.629
Are you using them all right?

789
00:54:54.828 --> 00:54:56.699
It's strange.

790
00:54:57.029 --> 00:54:59.469
Why do I feel like you're lying?

791
00:55:01.098 --> 00:55:03.069
To me, it seems like...

792
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:05.808
you're living this way for your son.

793
00:55:08.239 --> 00:55:10.639
You're worried your son might be put in danger...

794
00:55:10.909 --> 00:55:12.808
because of the truth that you know.

795
00:55:16.148 --> 00:55:17.618
I'll go if you tell me.

796
00:55:17.949 --> 00:55:19.688
You can simply run away again.

797
00:55:20.018 --> 00:55:21.118
I'll help you.

798
00:55:32.199 --> 00:55:33.629
Long time no see, Mi ran.

799
00:55:35.898 --> 00:55:36.998
Jin Chul.

800
00:55:38.208 --> 00:55:40.139
We promised not to see each other again.

801
00:55:40.839 --> 00:55:41.909
Sorry,

802
00:55:43.078 --> 00:55:44.679
but it's because I need money.

803
00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:45.978
I'll give you money.

804
00:55:46.379 --> 00:55:49.118
How much did I get paid for making you...

805
00:55:49.118 --> 00:55:50.518
a dead person two years ago?

806
00:55:52.018 --> 00:55:53.049
Was it 100,000 dollars?

807
00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:55.518
I'll give that much again.

808
00:55:56.518 --> 00:55:58.558
You know how much your life is worth now?

809
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:02.259
They offered a million dollars.

810
00:56:11.098 --> 00:56:12.168
Mr. Choi.

811
00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.808
Ko Jin Chul's burn phone is moving.

812
00:56:15.179 --> 00:56:17.978
It's moving in a different direction from us.

813
00:56:17.978 --> 00:56:19.348
Send me the location.

814
00:56:19.348 --> 00:56:21.219
Ha Ri and Soon Jung. Keep going to the farm.

815
00:56:21.219 --> 00:56:22.379
- Mr. Choi. - Mr. Choi.

816
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:24.648
Mi Ran must be still there.

817
00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:27.549
If Ko Jin Chul causes trouble again...

818
00:56:28.018 --> 00:56:29.389
You must be careful.

819
00:56:30.458 --> 00:56:32.188
If you aren't careful,

820
00:56:33.188 --> 00:56:34.699
I won't forgive you.

821
00:56:35.398 --> 00:56:37.699
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

822
00:57:45.098 --> 00:57:46.728
It's cold in the mountain here.

823

837

Wait, do you trust him?

838
01:00:27.558 --> 01:00:30.228
I have no idea what I should trust.

839
01:00:30.998 --> 01:00:32.398
Will you get up already?

840
01:00:32.668 --> 01:00:33.969
Do you know him?

841
01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:36.639
He's the guy who found the body for Mi Ran.

842
01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:40.038
Kang Woo, have you gone that far?

843
01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:42.208
I need to see the originals...

844
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.909
of Bum Joon's insurance policies.

845
01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:46.049
What's your relationship with Ko Jin Chul?

846
01:00:46.049 --> 01:00:47.409
He's after you first.

847
01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:50.348
What should I do if I can't find her?

848
01:00:50.478 --> 01:00:52.089
You must make her come to you.

849
01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:54.589
What kind of a guy would forsake someone...

850
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:55.859
for a million dollars?

851
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:57.618
Say that again!
