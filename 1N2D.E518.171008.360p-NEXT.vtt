00:00:01.157 --> 00:00:02.726
(One Night Two Days)

2
00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:04.996
(Their journey began in Hongcheon.)

3
00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:06.396
(One Night Two Days meet "Invincible Youth".)

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.927
(They hope that this leads to romance.)

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.767
(He's not proposing.)

6
00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:11.396
(They were all forced to partner up.)

7
00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.807
(Joon Young and Chae Yeon too.)

8
00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:16.606
(The tearful reunion at Yuchi-ri)

9
00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:19.976
(It all starts now.)

10
00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:24.417
(They were here almost everyday 7 years ago.)

11
00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:26.187
(The hot place, village hall)

12
00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:27.717
Is this the village hall?

13
00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:29.456
Yes, it is.

14
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.349
Ha Ra, go ahead and say hello.

15
00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.319
You know these people.

16
00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:36.690
(Shin Young enters first.)

17
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.789
Hello, everyone. Wang Gu!

18
00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:46.130
(They hug each other in a tight embrace.)

19
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.770
- Wang Gu. - My gosh.

20
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.669
Goodness. How have you been?

21
00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:52.940
(They're all happy to see each other.)

22
00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.770
It's been so long.

23
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.080
- Hello. - Hi!

24
00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:00.109
(They reunite.)

25
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.749
Goodness.

26
00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:02.879
(Members of G6...)

27
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.219
(and the elders are all happy to see each other.)

28
00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:06.950
- Hello. - Hi.

29
00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:08.760
- Hello! - It's nice to meet you.

30
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.919
- Hello. - Hi.

31
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.760
Do you recognize them?

32
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.329
It's Narsha and...

33
00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.760
- All right. - Attention, everyone.

34
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999
- Bow. - Bow to the elders!

35
00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.900
- Hello. - Hi.

36
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.240
(It's nice to meet you all.)

37
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.100
It's an honor to be here at Korea's Hollywood.

38
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.010
That's right. We're here at the village hall.

39
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.639
Let me introduce you to...

40
00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.779
the celebrities Driver Lee...

41
00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:35.579
- Driver Lee. - And Wang Gu.

42
00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.579
(The town can't function without Driver Lee.)

43
00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:39.090
- Wang Gu? - Yes, Wang Gu.

44
00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:44.189
He's the one who verified that it snowed in May.

45
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.590
He was the village headman seven years ago.

46
00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.129
Now the job is for someone else.

47
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.430
He's the current village headman.

48
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.600
There was one before him.

49
00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:55.700
- Here. - Oh, I get it.

50
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.840
We have two former village headman's here.

51
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.240
The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd village headman.

52
00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.439
Sir, what's your name?

53
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.840
It's Shin Hyeon Hak.

54
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.279
- Mr. Shin Hyeon Hak. - Right.

55
00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:09.449
He'll say a few welcoming words then.

56
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.249
We thank the teams of One Night Two Days...

57
00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.189
and "Invincible Youth" for being here.

58
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.259
A lot of other celebrities...

59
00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.300
including Shin Young who is here now...

60
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.400
visited us many years ago.

61
00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.469
I thank you again for coming back to see us.

62
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.939
- Thank you. - Thank you.

63
00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:30.969
(Thank you for letting us stay.)

64
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.539
Back in the day, we used to...

65
00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:40.710
entertain everyone at the village hall.

66
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.949
Just like old times, the members of...

67
00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:48.390
One Night Two Days and "Invincible Youth" will...

68
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.759
put on a fun talent show...

69
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.789
for you to enjoy.

70
00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.629
In the meantime, enjoy your beverages.

71
00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.670
In a short while, we'll put on a nice show.

72
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.969
- Okay. - That's right.

73
00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.770
A talent show with a karaoke machine.

74
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.999
- We used to sing. - That we did.

75
00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.569
- We sang for them. - Of course.

76
00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.379
(They even rapped in front of the elderly.)

77
00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:16.879
(To entertain the people of Yuchi-ri,)

78
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.249
(both teams will put on a performance.)

79
00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.890
We'll get ready for a fun talent show,

80
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.360
so dance and sing with us if you want to.

81
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.599
Anyway, we'll be back shortly.

82
00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.199
We won't clap if it isn't any fun.

83
00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.670
Of course. We only want your honest opinion.

84
00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.199
Let's do this. We'll do our best.

85
00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.740
(We'll prepare an exciting show.)

86
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.170
- What should we sing? - "Oh My".

87
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.110
Where's my partner?

88
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.779
- "Oh My"? - It's a popular song.

89
00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:47.279
What else is there?

90
00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:49.879
There are a lot of trot songs.

91
00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.249
Why can't you show some more passion?

92
00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.689
- You keep being this way. - Like how?

93
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.990
(Jong Min and Ha Ra are off to a good start.)

94
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.590
Rhythm dancing? Thanks for the idea.

95
00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.300
Defconn, go away.

96
00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:04.960
What is that?

97
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.830
- The elderly love it. - Yes, they do.

98
00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.039
What is it?

99
00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.699
Don't move too much.

100
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.269
- Is that it? - Yes, now I turn.

101
00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.639
- What is that? - Rhythm dancing.

102
00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.810
- Like this? - Yes.

103
00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.149
It's great.

104
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.420
- So... - Just bounce softly.

105
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.420
Really?

106
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.689
I didn't know about this.

107
00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.490
(What about this then?)

108
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.860
This is better.

109
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:32.160
Right?

110
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.129
(One team is passionate,)

111
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.399
(while the others are clueless.)

112
00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:36.699
We should keep it simple.

113
00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.199
(Yu Ra's just watching them.)

114
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.030
You did this on "Invincible Youth".

115
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.870
- Of course. - You're familiar with it,

116
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.470
so we should go with rapping.

117
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.139
- That's right. - Right?

118
00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.839
They're all leaning towards trot songs.

119
00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:49.839
Right.

120
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.280
Do you know "Angry Woman" by Kim Hye Yeoun?

121
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.379
What?

122
00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.480
- "Angry Woman". - "Angry Woman"?

123
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.420
I guess it's just me then.

124
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.420
(A trot song that only Gyeong Ree knows.)

125
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.720
- Let's see. - Do you know it?

126
00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.490
Do you?

127
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.790
- Well... - You love me

128
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.860
(She starts singing.)

129
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.959
(She has a nasal voice...)

130
00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:10.030
(that is charming in a teasing way.)

131
00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.269
(They can't help but bounce to the beat.)

132
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.740
(Tae Hyun listens to the song.)

133
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.899
You're awesome.

134
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.009
Gosh, you're really good at this.

135
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.009
(This isn't bad!)

136
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.509
What should we do?

137
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.749
It's best to do silly dance moves.

138
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:28.949
- Do they like that? - Of course.

139
00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.050
The leg shake?

140
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.420
Of course. Dancing to a fast-paced song...

141
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.149
will have them on their feet.

142
00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:35.759
(The elderly respond to silly dancing.)

143
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.490
(Like this!)

144
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.490
Like this.

145
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.189
(What is that?)

146
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:42.300
- How do I look? - That's great.

147
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.860
- Isn't it good? - Cover your ears.

148
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.069
- Sorry? - Cover your ears.

149
00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.899
I'm not listening to it. I can't.

150
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.800
What do you think?

151
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.870
What about another song?

152
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.970
It's not bad,

153
00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.870
but this is what other teams will do.

154
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.149
(They honestly don't have any ideas.)

155
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.780
(These two teams haven't decided on anything.)

156
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.879
Is there "Baby Shark" on the karaoke machine?

157
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.220
It's the children's song.

158
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.790
- No. - No?

159
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.790
Gosh, the song isn't on the machine.

160
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.819
What about "Battery of Love"?

161
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.129
It has some seriously high notes.

162
00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.660
(Let's try this!)

163
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.499
(Battery of love)

164
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.569
(Wailing)

165
00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.199
It's okay. I'll help you through it.

166
00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.470
Let's sing this and dance the twist.

167
00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.310
- "Battery of Love". - Do you know this song?

168
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.879
(Are they going to dance?)

169
00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:29.939
Just dance like this.

170
00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.050
(It's fun!)

171
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.050
- Right? - Right.

172
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.350
We're off to hair and makeup.

173
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.680
- Do we have one? - Who's that?

174
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.389
(Of course we do!)

175
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.519
- Ha Ra? - Ha Ra.

176
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.790
- Like this? - Yes.

177
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.030
(How are Joon Ho and Narsha doing?)

178
00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:48.959
(A martial arts show?)

179
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.759
Your behind is quite chubby.

180
00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.300
I can't seem to do it.

181
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.899
It's kind of stuck.

182
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.939
- Joon Ho. - Did I do it?

183
00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.339
No, the rope should be up the center.

184
00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:04.379
- Really? - Yes, like that.

185
00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:05.379
In 1, 2, 3.

186
00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:06.410
(They badly want to win.)

187
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.149
- It won't work. - How is this done?

188
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.649
(Dong Gu and Yu Ra are now in the mood.)

189
00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:14.050
I want red hair.

190
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:16.490
- I'll put on gloves. - Good.

191
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.259
(He puts on a red wig.)

192
00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:21.259
It suits you!

193
00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:22.399
(Really?)

194
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.899
It's all about covering the face.

195
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.699
Yes, I get what you mean.

196
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.839
Let's do it like so.

197
00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:31.740
(Until the very last second,)

198
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.269
(they practice to achieve perfection.)

199
00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:36.639
(Who will be the best entertainer?)

200
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.980
- Hello, everyone. - Hi.

201
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.350
Welcome.

202
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.249
Both teams of One Night Two Days and...

203
00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:49.990
"Invincible Youth" will put on a show for you.

204
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:51.860
Would you like that?

205
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.230
- Yes. - Sure!

206
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.530
I can't hear those in the far back.

207
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.899
Would you like that?

208
00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:59.870
- Yes. - Yes!

209
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.269
Thank you so much. Now...

210
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.410
the winner today won't receive any prizes.

211
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.639
(There isn't a prize.)

212
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:08.209
Meanwhile, there will be jobs.

213
00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:09.240
- Jobs? - Jobs?

214
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240
(What?)

215
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.780
- Yes, jobs. - Jobs?

216
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.050
- Jobs! - Jobs!

217
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:14.879
Yes, exactly.

218
00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:18.649
If you find our performances...

219
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:20.649
boring and lousy,

220
00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:24.459
you can make us do chores.

221
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.959
Who here has a lot to do around the house...

222
00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:31.459
that needs some extra help?

223
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.400
- Me. - There you go.

224
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.369
(We have many jobs to go around.)

225
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.969
(No way!)

226
00:08:39.609 --> 00:08:41.540
- Driver Lee. - Yes?

227
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.339
What do you need help with?

228
00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.109
It's the rainy season,

229
00:08:45.109 --> 00:08:48.109
so we have eggplants that need to be harvested.

230
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.020
- Nice. - Packaging too.

231
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.750
Eggplant harvesting and packaging!

232
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.390
- Okay. - Okay!

233
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.520
- Me. - Sir, go ahead.

234
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.390
I've been so busy managing the village...

235
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.890
that I haven't planted any napa cabbage.

236
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.430
What did he just say?

237
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.800
Napa cabbage?

238
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.099
Planting napa cabbage?

239
00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:08.739
Okay, you got it!

240
00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:11.469
- I need help with chives. - Chives?

241
00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:14.839
He needs help harvesting chives.

242
00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:17.079
- Chives! - Yes, chives!

243
00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:18.880
- Okay. - Put your hands up.

244
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.410
Put your hands up, put your hands up.

245
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.709
All right.

246
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.579
(Job Requests)

247
00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:26.349
(Eggplants, napa cabbage, and chives)

248
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.050
Watch the performances...

249
00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:32.030
and think to yourself who should go out there...

250
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.589
to do chores today.

251
00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:34.589
- Okay. - Sure.

252
00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:37.229
Will two teams get to rest then?

253
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.099
Exactly.

254
00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:41.869
The winner and runner-up will get to rest.

255
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.170
- Okay? - Okay!

256
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.540
- Okay. - Okay.

257
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.540
So let me call out the first team to perform.

258
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.609
Who will go first?

259
00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:50.609
(Going first is always a burden.)

260
00:09:50.609 --> 00:09:53.410
- Can we volunteer? - Yes, it's up to you.

261
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:55.250
(Yu Ra wants to go first.)

262
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.680
- Yu Ra stood up. - Should I have not?

263
00:09:58.079 --> 00:10:00.050
- Yu Ra. - Good for you.

264
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.189
Choose Yu Ra for the chives job.

265
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.520
Chives!

266
00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:06.760
Hello.

267
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.930
(Cheering)

268
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.560
I'm Yu Ra.

269
00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:14.569
- Chives, chives... - Chives, chives...

270
00:10:14.569 --> 00:10:15.599
(How well will she do?)

271
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:17.469
- Chives, chives. - Eggplants, eggplants!

272
00:10:17.469 --> 00:10:19.469
Eggplants, eggplants...

273
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.939
Let's see you perform.

274
00:10:23.609 --> 00:10:26.780
(What did Dong Gu and Yu Ra prepare?)

275
00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:30.579
(The melody seems familiar.)

276
00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:31.880
All right.

277
00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:34.589
(She lifts the mood with her snake dance.)

278
00:10:36.189 --> 00:10:38.689
("Battery of Love" by Hong Jin Young)

279
00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:43.260
(Yu Ra heads forward as she starts to sing.)

280
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.630
(She plays the ace up her sleeve.)

281
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.630
(Driver Lee, dance with me!)

282
00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:51.969
(It's now a night club.)

283
00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:54.609
My battery is dead

284
00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:59.510
(Dong Gu dances with his partner too.)

285
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.349
(Nice!)

286
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.219
(She's adorable.)

287
00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:08.819
(Tae Hyun's having fun too.)

288
00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:13.189
(The elderly love to sing and dance together.)

289
00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:14.530
Yes!

290
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.199

291
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.670
(She's good.)

292
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.239
Thank you.

293
00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:23.839
(The others stir at the performance.)

294
00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:25.670
- My gosh. - Thank you.

295
00:11:26.109 --> 00:11:29.239
So give it up for our first team.

296
00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:30.640
Thank you.

297
00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:33.780
Next up on stage...

298
00:11:34.609 --> 00:11:38.380
is me, your MC Shin Young.

299
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.449
(They clap to Shin Young's beat.)

300
00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:44.790
(They're in unison even though...)

301
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.329
(she's doing this on the spot.)

302
00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:49.260
(It proves just how good Shin Young is.)

303
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.329
This is great.

304
00:11:50.729 --> 00:11:51.959
(They're super excited.)

305
00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:54.229
Can you hear the train passing by?

306
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.939
- You're unbelievable. - There you go.

307
00:11:59.239 --> 00:12:01.839
Everyone, it's time for our main act.

308
00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.010
Give him a round of applause!

309
00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:05.880
(Shin Young and Defconn's main act)

310
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.209
(Defconn dressed himself to look cute.)

311
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:11.619
(Visually shocking)

312
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.520
(They're supposed to be adorable grandchildren.)

313
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.989
Everyone, clap.

314
00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:20.130
Did you see that?

315
00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:22.459
- Oh no. - Forget...

316
00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.859
(They're busy taking pictures.)

317
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.400

(The choreography is designed to their liking.)

325
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.969
We'll now walk over.

326
00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:01.469
(The lyrics and choreography...)

327
00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:03.369

328
00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:05.170
Sing with us!

(Defconn and Shin Young's captivating performance)

332
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.089
In 1, 2, 3.

333
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.290
- Eolssu. - Eolssu.

334
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.560
Thank you.

335
00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:24.560
"Battery of Love"!

336
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.890
Imagine how good they'll be working in the fields.

337
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.290
Don't they look that way?

338
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.800
- Next to perform is... - Who's next?

339
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.369
- It's Tae Hyun. - And Gyeong Ree.

340
00:13:34.369 --> 00:13:36.040
(Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree will perform next.)

341
00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:40.810
I have an event I have to be at,

342
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.739
so I'll come back as soon as it's over.

343
00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:45.239
- Bye. - I'm sorry.

344
00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:46.250
(Hurry on back!)

345
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.780
- Hello, everyone. - Hello.

346
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.880
(What will Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree sing?)

347
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:54.150
We'll sing "Angry Woman" by Kim Hye Yeoun.

348
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.890
Please clap along.

349
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.829
(They lift up the mood...)

350
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:02.630
(with the typical trot beat.)

351
00:14:03.699 --> 00:14:05.829
(Tae Hyun is unfamiliar with the song,)

352
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:07.930
(but everyone else knows it.)

353
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:12.140
(The melody makes you bounce your shoulders.)

354
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.540
(The teasing sound of Gyeong Ree's voice)

355
00:14:19.449 --> 00:14:21.010
(Tae Hyun makes it up by dancing.)

356
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.579
(This is fun!)

357
00:14:25.619 --> 00:14:27.489
(He chimes in perfectly...)

358
00:14:27.489 --> 00:14:29.319
(even though he doesn't know the song.)

359
00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:31.859
(Nice!)

360
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.300
(The audience loved their performance.)

361
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.099
Thank you.

362
00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:43.400
Just so you know, we're lousy workers.

363
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.310
It's no use making us work at your field.

364
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.709
Tae Hyun, Tae Hyun. Why weren't you singing?

365
00:14:51.709 --> 00:14:52.750
- Hold on. - Well...

366
00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:55.010
Ladies and gentlemen.

367
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.250
Ladies and gentlemen.

368
00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.020
Tae Hyun would love to harvest chives today.

369
00:15:00.589 --> 00:15:02.359
Everyone's wearing a wig.

370
00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:05.560
(They need to be unique to be remembered.)

371
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.229
(We have no chance at this rate.)

372
00:15:08.229 --> 00:15:10.359
So let's see who's next.

373
00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:12.000
It's Joon Young and Chae Yeon.

374
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.900
(Next up are Joon Young and Chae Yeon.)

375
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.969
Hello, everyone.

376
00:15:15.969 --> 00:15:18.040
I'm Joon Young, the youngest.

377
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.709
Hello, I'm Chae Yeon.

378
00:15:19.709 --> 00:15:22.439
- Isn't she adorable? - Let's go!

379
00:15:23.939 --> 00:15:25.410
(Wiggling)

380
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.319
(They start to get their moves on.)

381
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.619
Dance with us!

382
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.319
In 1, 2, 3...

383
00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:34.420
(Dance with them!)

384
00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:36.089
(Their elaborate dancing)

385
00:15:36.089 --> 00:15:37.290
This is nice.

386
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.089
Goodness.

387
00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:40.430
(It's a dance of desperation.)

388
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.630
(We know how you feel.)

389
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:50.339
(Joon Young's voice is buttery and greasy.)

390
00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:56.040
(He puts everything into his dancing.)

391
00:15:56.979 --> 00:15:58.209
(He's not bad.)

392
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.719
(The village headman loves it...)

393
00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:05.020
(and so does the ladies.)

394
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.349
Let's do this together.

395
00:16:06.349 --> 00:16:07.420
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

396
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.760
(Everyone sings "Shanghai Twist".)

397
00:16:10.859 --> 00:16:14.459
(The two have captivated everyone in the room.)

398
00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.160
(They look adorable no matter what.)

399
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.199
In China!

400
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.739
Where?

401
00:16:24.739 --> 00:16:26.670
(What an unexpected result.)

402
00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:32.579
(We've never seen Joon Young...)

403
00:16:32.579 --> 00:16:35.920
(entertain people like this before.)

404
00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:41.250
Thank you!

405
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.819
(The song is over, but he's not done dancing.)

406
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:47.390
(Harvesting makes even Joon Young dance.)

407
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.760
Thank you.

408
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.599
I could tell how badly you didn't want to work.

409
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.569
Don't be absurd.

410
00:16:54.569 --> 00:16:56.770
Don't you think he'll do a good job on the fields?

411
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.839
- That's right. - He does.

412
00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:01.609
Choose him and he'll receive immunity.

413
00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:03.339
Please give us a round of applause.

414
00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:04.379
(They were surprisingly good.)

415
00:17:04.379 --> 00:17:07.480
Next up are Jong Min and Ha Ra.

416
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.079
We'll be singing "Unconditional" today.

417
00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.720
You'll harvest chives no matter what.

418
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.520
(Hey!)

419
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.119
Come on.

420
00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:19.659
(It's obvious that they'll put on a show.)

421
00:17:20.129 --> 00:17:21.190
Dance with us.

422
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.760
(She's already in sync with him.)

423
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.169
(Ha Ra has given up on trying to look pretty.)

424
00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:31.240
(Jong Min is prepared down to every last detail.)

425
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.179
(My goodness!)

426
00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:42.220
(To win and not be chosen to do the chores,)

427
00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:45.819
(Ha Ra gives it her very best.)

428
00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:49.720
(They're both talented singers.)

429
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.490
Come on.

430
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.030
(Drive Lee is mesmerized too.)

431
00:17:54.659 --> 00:17:57.730
(No one can take their eyes off them.)

432
00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:02.599
(This is the best show in town.)

433
00:18:08.369 --> 00:18:10.839
(A perfect and clean ending)

434
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.550
Thank you.

435
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.579
(Are they the front-runners?)

436
00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:15.720
Good job.

437
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.250
Great.

438
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.819
Last but not least, it's Joon Ho and Narsha.

439
00:18:21.819 --> 00:18:24.290
(They won't let their age hinder them.)

440
00:18:24.589 --> 00:18:26.990
Joon Ho. Joon Ho?

441
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.560
- What are they doing? - Narsha?

442
00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:32.069
Don't tell me he's naked.

443
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:38.399
They're doing a martial arts show.

444
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.940
Joon Ho.

445
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.740
- Gosh. - Narsha, come on in.

446
00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:48.280
They'll choose you to work if they like you too much.

447
00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:52.349
This is your chance to take Joon Ho home.

448
00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:54.190
(They're all busy taking pictures.)

449
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.520
We will put on a martial arts show.

450
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.659
(They'll be performing martial arts.)

451
00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:02.460
I've been doing this for so long...

452
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.829
that I've now become a master at it.

453
00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:08.169
I don't feel any pain. I really don't.

454
00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:09.470
All right.

455
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.339
Let me show you what he means.

456
00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:13.339
Hit him.

457
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.139
(Narsha slaps him across his chest.)

458
00:19:16.139 --> 00:19:18.109
Did you see that?

459
00:19:18.109 --> 00:19:20.450
- Come on. - Good.

460
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.220
Next. Let's move on.

461
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.980
Hold on a second.

462
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.720
- What are you doing? - You can't feel pain?

463
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.250
- No. - In 1, 2...

464
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.389
(Tae Hyun rips off the tape.)

465
00:19:29.389 --> 00:19:30.460
It doesn't hurt.

466
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.030
- Slap my back too. - Your back.

467
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.030
Yes, go for it.

468
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.859
I'm fine.

469
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.099
It hurts. My hand hurts.

470
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.470
Now let's get on with the show.

471
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:44.899
- So what I'll do is... - Hold on.

472
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.010
I have here boiling water.

473
00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.609
What?

474
00:19:49.609 --> 00:19:51.639
- Here you go. - No way.

475
00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:54.510
- Lift up your arm. - Hold on a second.

476
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.780
You're all just getting in the way.

477
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.819
(Joon Ho could die before he performs.)

478
00:19:57.819 --> 00:19:59.349
All right!

479
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.889
(The two finally start their show.)

480
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.990
(He's never been more serious before.)

481
00:20:07.329 --> 00:20:10.000
(An eye mask is needed this time.)

482
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.470
(He seems serious.)

483
00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:20.740
(I'll blow out the candle with my eyes closed.)

484
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.810
(They're all intrigued.)

485
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.409
(What's that?)

486
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.149
(There's a hole in the eye mask.)

487
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.020
(The audience doesn't know.)

488
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.560
(Joon Ho, the weasel)

489
00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:40.560
(He'll never let it end without a laugh.)

490
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.260
(Whatever!)

491
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.669
(Let's dance now.)

492
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.899
(They find it hilarious.)

493
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.609
All right!

494
00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:58.480
(He can't help but join them on stage.)

495
00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:01.679
- Let's party. - It's party time.

496
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:02.879
(They all join in.)

497
00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:08.990
(It's party time!)

498
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.260
Thank you.

499
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.429
(Joon Ho and Narsha end their performance.)

500
00:21:15.429 --> 00:21:17.659
- Good job. - You did great too.

501
00:21:18.629 --> 00:21:22.000
They prepared a lot including martial arts.

502
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.500
You did great.

503
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.770
Thank you all.

504
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.810
Give us a huge round of applause.

505
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.470
(The talent show is over.)

506
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.079
Now it's time...

507
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.720
for you to choose the team that'll do the chores.

508
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.780
(Who won over their hearts?)

509
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.919
Hello, I'm in charge of the chive field here.

510
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.720
- Hello. - Chives!

511
00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.359
- Chives. - It won't be easy.

512
00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:47.089
I'd like to ask the first team to join me.

513
00:21:47.089 --> 00:21:50.200
The first team? That's Dong Gu's team.

514
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.800
- Nice! - The second team?

515
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.300
- You meant the second. - That's right.

516
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.369
He said second.

517
00:21:55.369 --> 00:21:56.369
No, the first team.

518
00:21:56.369 --> 00:21:58.399
- I see. - It's you two.

519
00:21:58.399 --> 00:22:01.440
- He said the first team. - That's right.

520
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:03.940
I have a lot to do. Planting napa cabbage,

521
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.310
- radish, crown daisy. - Radish!

522
00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:08.050
- What? - And spring onions.

523
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.379
- All this time... - There's a lot of work.

524
00:22:10.379 --> 00:22:11.480
Kim Jong Min!

525
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.050
Choose who didn't entertain you enough.

526
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.290
Back when we filmed "Invincible Youth",

527
00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:18.760
I meant to give Narsha wild ginseng...

528
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760
- when she collapsed, - Goodness.

529
00:22:20.829 --> 00:22:22.030
but I didn't get the chance.

530
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.030
So I took it and made wine instead.

531
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.369
I was thinking about giving it to her today.

532
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:31.639
- No way... - So I'll have Ha Ra...

533
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.940
help me at the house.

534
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.210
- What? - Ha Ra?

535
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.010
I meant Narsha!

536
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.810
No, he said Ha Ra.

537
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.950
It's Narsha.

538
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.280
Sir, you said Ha Ra.

539
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.119
I remember you collapsing back then.

540
00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:44.220
Do you remember that she fainted?

541
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.919
- I do. - She might again today.

542
00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:46.950
That won't happen.

543
00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:48.760
- Did you hear that? - She's stronger now.

544
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.520
He wants to give Narsha his gift.

545
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.560
That's right.

546
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.560
So much for having the most hilarious act.

547
00:22:55.929 --> 00:22:57.260
Thank you so much.

548
00:22:57.399 --> 00:23:00.169
- Driver Lee. - I'm afraid the rain...

549
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:03.770
hurt the growth of my eggplants.

550
00:23:04.069 --> 00:23:07.940
You'll set them straight again,

551
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.010
harvest them, and take care of packaging.

552
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.349
- I see. - Packaging too?

553
00:23:13.349 --> 00:23:15.919
- That task... - Who will you choose?

554
00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.280
- Well... - What about them?

555
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.790
- They're the youngest. - Jong Min.

556
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.020
- Please, no. - He's made his choice.

557
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.060
(Driver Lee chooses Jong Min and Ha Ra.)

558
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.929
You can't!

559
00:23:26.929 --> 00:23:29.859
- Jong Min... - They'll be doing a lot.

560
00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:31.060
Thank you, sir.

561
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.470
- Thank you. - Good luck.

562
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.869
- Jong Min. - Yes?

563
00:23:36.869 --> 00:23:38.500
- Have fun. - Sure.

564
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.010
- I wish you well. - Do your best.

565
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.040
Sure thing.

566
00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:44.109
I'll make sure they do a lot of work.

567
00:23:45.179 --> 00:23:46.409
- Guys. - Yes?

568
00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:48.609
- You should follow him. - Of course.

569
00:23:48.609 --> 00:23:50.149
- Do your best. - Sure.

570
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:52.419
There's no dinner if you don't.

571
00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:55.250
Haven't you done a lot of this before?

572
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.260
I'm sure you've harvested and managed crops.

573
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.230
I'm the world's best slacker.

574
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.599
I can't believe our luck.

575
00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:07.399
You danced your heart out today.

576
00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:09.700
I know. I really didn't want to work.

577
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.470
I thought you were from Shanghai.

578
00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:13.409
From now on, you're Mr. Shanghai.

579
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.379
(That's funny.)

580
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:17.409
There won't be a "Dinner Game" today.

581
00:24:17.409 --> 00:24:19.950
"The teams going downtown will cook after..."

582
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.480
"shopping for groceries."

583
00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:23.720
However!

584
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.720
There's no way they'll just hand us money.

585
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.790
Right?

586
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.060
If you look over here,

587
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.629
a certain amount is written on the paper.

588
00:24:33.629 --> 00:24:34.760
These must be our targets.

589
00:24:35.089 --> 00:24:36.300
(That is correct!)

590
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.770
("Flying Bottle Cap", The same rules apply.)

591
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.700
(One at a time, they'll flick the cap.)

592
00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:47.540
(They'll receive money...)

593
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.980
(depending on where it lands.)

594
00:24:51.379 --> 00:24:54.310
We'll be set if any of us flicks the cap...

595
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.379
and win a blank check.

596
00:24:55.379 --> 00:24:57.280
We can order a hotel buffet.

597
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.990
- Okay. - What food do you like?

598
00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.419
- Beef. - Beef?

599
00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:03.460
There's a lot around here, so I'll buy some for you.

600
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.190
It's up to how well we flick the cap.

601
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.990
- And you, Gyeong Ree? - I like beef too.

602
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.800
Really? I guess we must have beef today.

603
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.970
- I love pork belly too. - We all worked hard.

604
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.470
Beef and pork belly.

605
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:16.740
- You should practice. - Go ahead.

606
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.800
(A half-hearted flick)

607
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:19.470
- That was bad. - Chae Yeon.

608
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.839
You better focus.

609
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.310
All right?

610
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.409
- The blank check. - Hey!

611
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.579
(She flicks it too far.)

612
00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:27.510
- Chae Yeon. - Look.

613
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.919
What do you think you're doing?

614
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.780
This isn't the time to laugh.

615
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.849
Gosh, I'm sorry.

616
00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:33.889
(Gyeong Ree's just as awful.)

617
00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:36.859
Watch it!

618
00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:38.389
You know...

619
00:25:39.429 --> 00:25:40.790
- Hey. - What's wrong with them?

620
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.060
- Look at her. - Unbelievable.

621
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.260
Watch out.

622
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.429
Gyeong Ree, please.

623
00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:46.369
- Slow and steady. - Watch it.

624
00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:49.440
(Defconn's busy picking them up.)

625
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.540
I'm rich all of a sudden.

626
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.800
Are you doing this on purpose?

627
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.270
- What's wrong with me? - Are you?

628
00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:55.740
- It's tricky. - You've almost got it.

629
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.339
No, not like that.

630
00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.579
Let's practice.

631
00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:01.750
(It's a total mess.)

632
00:26:02.579 --> 00:26:03.679
We're doomed.

633
00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:05.079
(Will we get enough money to shop?)

634
00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:06.990
Should I go first?

635
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.990
No, I will.

636
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.359
- I... - That way.

637
00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:11.819
What's your goal?

638
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.230
- The blank check? - The blank check.

639
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.260
You're a true man.

640
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.560
I believe in you.

641
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.129
I at least have to do this well.

642
00:26:17.129 --> 00:26:19.929
Exactly. I just hope you get this right.

643
00:26:20.129 --> 00:26:21.700
I received an earful from her.

644
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.369
- Let's see. - As a father.

645
00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:28.240
You're right to say that.

646
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.710
You're a father.

647
00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:31.379
A father's challenge.

648
00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:32.579
- He's a dad. - I'm ready.

649
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.379
(Dad, you can do it!)

650
00:26:36.379 --> 00:26:37.849
(We're here for you.)

651
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.819
(Good luck!)

652
00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:42.220
You're a father.

653
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.290
(How will the father do?)

654
00:26:44.319 --> 00:26:46.389
(Will he succeed?)

655
00:26:46.889 --> 00:26:47.929
You're a father.

656
00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:49.899
(Flying away)

657
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.560
(Shocked)

658
00:26:52.169 --> 00:26:53.169
(He thought he succeeded.)

659
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.230
You were able to get nothing.

660
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.740
- Nothing. - Next up is Chae Yeon.

661
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.139
- Okay. - Chae Yeon.

662
00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:00.310
Take your time with this.

663
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.179
Aim for the center instead of getting greedy.

664
00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:04.740
Do as well as the practice round.

665
00:27:05.349 --> 00:27:07.280
Your life depends on it.

666
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.319
DIA's destiny hangs in the balance.

667
00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:10.480
That's right.

668
00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:12.349
She didn't say she was ready.

669
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.520
(She didn't say it.)

670
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.020
- That's right. - You should've said it.

671
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.419
She didn't say she was ready.

672
00:27:16.419 --> 00:27:18.829
You did so good and now you're ready.

673
00:27:18.889 --> 00:27:20.129
I'm ready now.

674
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.329
We shouldn't be afraid of challenges.

675
00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:24.760
Take your time.

676
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.730
Okay, that's five dollars.

677
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.129
- Five dollars. - It's right on the line.

678
00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:29.369
(Fortunately, it landed on the line.)

679
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.399
Five dollars!

680
00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:32.510
(Chae Yeon raises 5 dollars.)

681
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.970
Good job. You did much better than I did.

682
00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:36.109
It's my turn now.

683
00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:37.379
(Next is Defconn.)

684
00:27:37.379 --> 00:27:39.280
- All right. - Don't get your hopes up.

685
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.149
Flick it with force, but not with too much force.

686
00:27:44.179 --> 00:27:45.250
50 dollars...

687
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.649
At least get something.

688
00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:51.819
(What a chicken.)

689
00:27:52.829 --> 00:27:56.060
(They're all thinking the same thing.)

690
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.530
(Defconn raises 0 dollars.)

691
00:27:58.629 --> 00:27:59.629
Joon Young's next.

692
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.099
I believe in you.

693
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.869
Oh no.

694
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.869
I'm ready.

695
00:28:05.869 --> 00:28:07.470
- He's ready. - Do you want beef?

696
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.079
Yes, beef.

697
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.079
(His partner likes beef.)

698
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.750
(He promised her to buy her all the beef.)

699
00:28:17.879 --> 00:28:23.020
(Will he be able to keep his promise?)

700
00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:26.859
- Darn it. - 10 dollars.

701
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.129
(Joon Young manages to raise 10 dollars.)

702
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.760
- Darn it! - You did great.

703
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.470
- I should've been bolder. - We have 15 dollars.

704
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.929
- Right. - We have 15 dollars.

705
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.899
- Right. - Next is Gyeong Ree.

706
00:28:35.899 --> 00:28:37.200
- Me? - I'm such a chicken.

707
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.240
Come on over.

708
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.940
- I think... - The blank check.

709
00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:42.780
She's meant to be the hero of today's episode.

710
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.310
Gyeong Ree.

711
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.310
(Tae Hyun is mesmerized by her.)

712
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.079
You're the hero today.

713
00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:48.550
Aim for the blank check.

714
00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.179
- Okay. - My goodness.

715
00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:52.419
You can be in charge of the team's financials.

716
00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:55.290
You can handle our costs.

717
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.319
(I'll be that for you today.)

718
00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.260
I'm ready.

719
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:59.790
All right.

720
00:29:01.659 --> 00:29:02.659
(Screaming)

721
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.700
(Surprised)

722
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.129
You got 5 dollars, so that's 20 in total.

723
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.800
(She flicked it with confidence.)

724
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:13.440
(She ended up raising 5 dollars.)

725
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.669
- Still... - Exactly.

726
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:15.879
That's 12 packs of ramyeon.

727
00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:17.609
(They raised 20 dollars in total.)

728
00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:20.879
My partner is absent at the moment.

729
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:23.149
See you later in the evening.

730
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:25.450
(She left for a while to cover her busy schedule.)

731
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.790
Could we try once more? It's our last chance.

732
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.990
At least you two got the chance to try.

733
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.260
Very good. Keep this pace.

734
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.399
Chae Yeon, let's do this.

735
00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:36.429
Try to reach the blank check.

736
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800
Good.

737
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:40.530
Very good.

738
00:29:41.169 --> 00:29:42.970
Try to reach a bit further.

739
00:29:43.639 --> 00:29:44.639
Let's do it.

740
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.270
- Let's do it. - Now is the time.

741
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.909
Now is the time. Go for it.

742
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440
I'm ready.

743
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280
(It falls off.)

744
00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.649
(Sad)

745
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.760
Give us one more chance. She's got the hang of it.

746
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.389
How much do we have now? 20 dollars?

747
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:07.389
Each of them won 10 dollars.

748
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.560
- We have 20 dollars. - Let's bet 5 dollars.

749
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.329
- Please. - Show them your cuteness.

750
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.470
- We'll bet 5 dollars. - Let's bet 5 dollars.

751
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.369
(They get 1 more chance, betting 5 dollars.)

752
00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:17.440
This is how people get addicted to gambling.

753
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.710
- Let's go for 10 dollars. - If we eat ramyeon,

754
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.379
there's no difference between 15 and 20 dollars.

755
00:30:23.139 --> 00:30:25.010
We can buy ramyeon with 10 dollars.

756
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.050
I'll get rid of it.

757
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.149
There you go.

758
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.849
- I'll go for it. - Already?

759
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.020
Are you sure?

760
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.649
I can do it.

761
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.589
Hey, you almost messed it up.

762
00:30:37.589 --> 00:30:39.760
I'll do one last practice and then go.

763
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.159
Let's not look at it. Let's look away.

764
00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:43.800
- Good. Now let's do it. - Now go for it.

765
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.629
- We'll be looking away. - I'll go for it.

766
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:47.129
I'll go for it.

767
00:30:47.129 --> 00:30:48.940
(Today's dinner...)

768
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.599
(depends on her hand.)

769
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.139
(The bottle cap starts sliding.)

770
00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.740
(Please)

771
00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:03.020
(Chae Yeon wins a blank check.)

772
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.950
(This is unbelievable.)

773
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.760
(Chae Yeon, you are the best.)

774
00:31:11.359 --> 00:31:12.929
(It was so perfect.)

775
00:31:12.929 --> 00:31:15.800
DIA! DIA!

776
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.560
- DIA! DIA! - DIA! DIA!

777
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.899
DIA is the best!

778
00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:21.929
Yes!

779
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.970
Let's call a catering service.

780
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040
A catering service.

781
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.040
(We love you.)

782
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.179
You are the best.

783
00:31:30.579 --> 00:31:32.050
Thank you.

784
00:31:32.379 --> 00:31:34.050
Seriously, this is amazing.

785
00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.349
She did a great job.

786
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.020
I've never seen something like this.

787
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.290
We haven't either.

788
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.750
This is amazing.

789
00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:43.659
Good job.

790
00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:45.389
(This is incredible.)

791
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:47.159
- Let's go eat now. - There was a reason...

792
00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:48.929
why we were left here.

793
00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:51.399
- We're actually lucky. - Right?

794
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.099
Give us the card first.

795
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.599
Give us the card.

796
00:31:56.639 --> 00:31:58.839
Let's start with rib eye.

797
00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:00.909
(Let's start our supper with rib eye.)

798
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.780
Gyeong Ree, you were here.

799
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.839
(The five of them head to the market.)

800
00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:06.810
- Where did you get it? - I bought it.

801
00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:08.280
(Gyeong Ree eats a chocolate bar.)

802
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.780
You're not supposed to eat that.

803
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.520
But I bought it with the money earlier.

804
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.319
I hate you. One Night Two Days.

805
00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:16.220
Gyeong Ree, I understand it's annoying.

806
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.859
Let's buy a lot of things.

807
00:32:17.859 --> 00:32:19.159
We have a blank check.

808
00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:20.560
Since we have a blank check,

809
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:21.859
let's spend hundreds of thousands of dollars.

810
00:32:23.829 --> 00:32:26.899
It's going smoothly today thanks to Gyeong Ree.

811
00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:27.899
- I know. - It is.

812
00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:28.940
Totally smoothly.

813
00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:31.069
What's wrong with the other guys?

814
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:32.940
Team 3G.

815
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.040
I feel bad for those three.

816
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:37.639
I had a feeling that the villagers would pick them.

817
00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:41.950
Old people tend to go with something familiar.

818
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:42.950
Right.

819
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.550
And the three of them asked the villagers...

820
00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:47.950
to dance with them.

821
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:52.859
They were so passionate about it.

822
00:32:54.329 --> 00:32:56.659
(They did their best...)

823
00:32:56.659 --> 00:33:00.329
(to impress the senior villagers.)

824
00:33:01.069 --> 00:33:03.899
I was wondering why Tae Hyun didn't do the same.

825
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.440
I did my best.

826
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:07.540
Since we've got a blank check,

827
00:33:08.139 --> 00:33:10.639
we can buy a lot of things, right?

828
00:33:10.639 --> 00:33:13.010
I feel like eating pork rinds.

829
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.849
- Should we buy that too? - Sounds good.

830
00:33:14.849 --> 00:33:16.349
I really want to eat pork rinds.

831
00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:17.550
Pork rinds are good indeed.

832
00:33:17.849 --> 00:33:19.250
I don't have a posh taste.

833
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:22.119
I feel like seaweed stems. Should we buy that too?

834
00:33:22.319 --> 00:33:23.659
That sounds good. With chojang, right?

835
00:33:23.659 --> 00:33:25.329
- Seaweed stems? - Chojang sounds good.

836
00:33:25.329 --> 00:33:26.329
Do they sell seaweed stems?

837
00:33:26.329 --> 00:33:28.460
- They do. - At a side dish store.

838
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.500
Let's go to a side dish store and buy everything.

839
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.929
- Mumalaengi is good too. - Buy all they have.

840
00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:36.639
- I like salted octopus. - Right.

841
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.540
Salted octopus?

842
00:33:38.639 --> 00:33:40.470
- What about seafood? - Seafood?

843
00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:41.770
Which seafood?

844
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.339
- What about raw fish? - Shrimps.

845
00:33:43.339 --> 00:33:45.240
Gyeong Ree. You remember everything, right?

846
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.510
- Yes. - It's our shopping list.

847
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.409
How about one whole croaker?

848
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:49.679
A big croaker that weighs 10kg.

849
00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.720
Come on.

850
00:33:52.589 --> 00:33:55.359
(They arrive at a traditional market.)

851
00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.589
Maybe we should start from here.

852
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.329
(Joon Young would like to go to the butcher's shop.)

853
00:34:01.329 --> 00:34:02.760
Beef.

854
00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:04.799
- It looks good. - Let's go in.

855
00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.730
I saw a place that has Korean beef.

856
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.739
- It's around that corner. - Let's go in.

857
00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.900
Hello, Sir. Do you have Korean beef?

858
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.409
- Korean beef? - Yes.

859
00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.270
- They don't? - They have pork belly.

860
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.480
- Pork belly. - Pork belly sounds good.

861
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.739
Sir, how much is the refrigerator?

862
00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:20.650
Defconn, do you know pork belly includes the rind?

863
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.150
- Yes, it does. - It has rind on it.

864
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.549
It's different from ordinary pork belly.

865
00:34:25.549 --> 00:34:27.549
- Let's go for it. - Let's get that.

866
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.590
This is on the house. Just take it.

867
00:34:30.759 --> 00:34:32.190
If you want, you can take it.

868
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:33.790
No, we're fine. We...

869
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.029
Let's buy some pork belly.

870
00:34:35.029 --> 00:34:37.560
We won the game and won a blank check.

871
00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:41.130
It seemed like you were always starving on TV.

872
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.670
We used to be, but today we have a blank check.

873
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.739
Give it to me. Goodness.

874
00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:47.270
Ma'am, look.

875
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.739
(I have a blank check today.)

876
00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:49.840
We won the game today.

877
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.679
We've got a blank check today.

878
00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:52.949
Let's buy a lot of meat.

879
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.250
Let's do that.

880
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.020
The meat looks nice.

881
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.420
It looks amazing.

882
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.020
Thank you.

883
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:01.690
- 1.6kg. - 1.6kg.

884
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.219
Which store has the best beef?

885
00:35:03.219 --> 00:35:04.860
Which butcher's shop?

886
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.759
- We're going there. - It's in the market.

887
00:35:06.759 --> 00:35:08.659
- In the market? - Thank you.

888
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.360
(They can have a meat party the whole night.)

889
00:35:10.659 --> 00:35:13.329
- What is it? - Jjolmyeon looks good.

890
00:35:13.369 --> 00:35:15.770
It's millet pancake.

891
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:18.040
- It looks tasty. - Look at this.

892
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.469
This one, Gyeong Ree?

893
00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:21.040
- Yes. - Come here.

894
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.840
Let's get these two.

895
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.340
- Buy them all. - Are these the last ones?

896
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.449
- Yes. - I'd like to buy them.

897
00:35:25.449 --> 00:35:27.949
- Gyeong Ree wants it. - Thank you.

898
00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:29.020
Thank you.

899
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.679
Sir, how much do 12 people need for a barbecue party?

900
00:35:31.779 --> 00:35:33.250
You need a whole box.

901
00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.250
Two bags would do.

902
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:36.619
That's a lot.

903
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.460
It's going to be a party.

904
00:35:39.529 --> 00:35:43.060
We'd like to buy some chili peppers too.

905
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.230
Garlic.

906
00:35:44.429 --> 00:35:46.070
- Garlic? - Can we grill garlic?

907
00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.230
- Yes, we can. - Good.

908
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.639
- This must be it. - This is the place.

909
00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:50.900
So this is the place.

910
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.840
The owner is in the shop.

911
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.139
(We have been looking for this place.)

912
00:35:54.139 --> 00:35:55.139
Look at the meat.

913
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.940
- My gosh. - It looks amazing.

914
00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.110
(The way meat is cut looks beautiful.)

915
00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.279
- It looks good. - Thank you.

916
00:36:00.279 --> 00:36:01.750
Look at the meat.

917
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:02.849
(The red meat looks beautiful.)

918
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.290
My goodness.

919
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.960
Even I have never bought so much meat.

920
00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.460
- Me neither. - This is incredible.

921
00:36:10.759 --> 00:36:12.560
(They ordered a sufficient amount of beef.)

922
00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.860
- It looks good. - They look pretty.

923
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.400
- 10 dollars for 5 apples. - 10 dollars for 5?

924
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.500
- There are grapes too. - Grapes!

925
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.130
- Grapes! - Grapes!

926
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.029
- How much are the grapes? - I want grapes.

927
00:36:21.029 --> 00:36:22.639
- Just buy grapes. - How much is it?

928
00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:24.469
- Let's get 2 bags. - 2 bags.

929
00:36:24.469 --> 00:36:25.869
Peaches are in season these days, right?

930
00:36:25.869 --> 00:36:27.739
- Yes. - This and this...

931
00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:28.739
Yes.

932
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.940
- Let me carry it. - Thank you.

933
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.940
Thank you.

934
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.509
Hey. Defconn.

935
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.949
Let's eat some sundae.

936
00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:37.949
Shall we?

937
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.989
- Pardon me? - Sundae.

938
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.989
It looks amazing.

939
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.560
Shall we take a seat here?

940
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.659
Let's get two portions.

941
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.690
Sounds good.

942
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.659
I have to eat sundae when I pass by.

943
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.099
You can eat this with sundae.

944
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.829
What is it?

945
00:36:54.469 --> 00:36:55.940
- She's so nice. - What is it?

946
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.639
- I have tried it before. - It looks good.

947
00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.909
- Thank you. - Can I try?

948
00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:02.009
- Is it lettuce? - Yes.

949
00:37:02.009 --> 00:37:03.110
I love this.

950
00:37:03.279 --> 00:37:04.540
Isn't it hot?

951
00:37:06.049 --> 00:37:08.150
- It's a bit bitter. - It's very bitter.

952
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.150
It's like medicine.

953
00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:11.750
You can eat it with sundae because it can be oily.

954
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.949
- Let's eat them together. - Thank you.

955
00:37:13.949 --> 00:37:15.520
Here we go.

956
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.159
(A plateful of sundae is served.)

957
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.759
- It's been a while. - Thank you, Chae Yeon.

958
00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:21.790
- You're welcome. - Thank you, Gyeong Ree.

959
00:37:22.429 --> 00:37:24.630
- It's all thanks to you. - It's all thanks to you.

960
00:37:25.529 --> 00:37:26.969
- It tastes good. - It's tasty.

961
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
(It's the best.)

962
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.139
She said it's homemade.

963
00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:32.210
It was a good idea to order it.

964
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.639
- It's so tasty. - Shall we drink alcohol?

965
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.210
My gosh.

966
00:37:36.909 --> 00:37:38.710
How about 1 glass each? Just 1 glass.

967
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.049
Do you have makgeolli?

968
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.619
- Yes. - Do they?

969
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.650
Yes, they do.

970
00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.679
(Unfortunately, they sell makgeolli too.)

971
00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:45.690
It was Gyeong Ree.

972
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.520
- Gyeong Ree ordered it. - Gyeong Ree said she'd...

973
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.360
like to have a glass of makgeolli.

974
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.230
One bottle of makgeolli, please.

975
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.329
Gyeong Ree, should we shake the bottle?

976
00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.829
From what I've seen on television,

977
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.369
they hit the bottle like this.

978
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.040
(That is...)

979
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.469
- Why do you hit it? - Thank you.

980
00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:09.480
You like soju, don't you?

981
00:38:09.779 --> 00:38:10.940
She seems to like soju.

982
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.509
- Cheers. - Cheers.

983
00:38:12.509 --> 00:38:14.650
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

984
00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:16.349
- Please come often. - Sure.

985
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:18.650
(The winners enjoy makgeolli.)

986
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.650
Tough girls are popular these days.

987
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:21.849
It's the trend these days.

988
00:38:21.849 --> 00:38:23.560
They've got good makgeolli too.

989
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.060
- This tastes the best. - It tastes good.

990
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.860
- I can have some more. - It was really good.

991
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.060
(They finished the dish in an instant.)

992
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.060
It clears my nose.

993
00:38:32.369 --> 00:38:34.029
- Can we write too? - What's your wish?

994
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.540
What did you write?

995
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.000
Let's go.

996
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.909
Let's go put them.

997
00:38:39.909 --> 00:38:41.940
- Let's go. - She has a wish.

998
00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.639
She wants to meet Highlight.

999
00:38:43.639 --> 00:38:46.049
Highlight? Your wish will come true.

1000
00:38:46.049 --> 00:38:49.079
Say what you want to say to Highlight.

1001
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.679
Guys, I've been a fan of yours since you debuted.

1002
00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:53.650
I want to meet you. I love you.

1003
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.619
Your wish will come true.

1004
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.659
(Jong Min and Ha Ra arrive at the farm.)

1005
00:38:58.659 --> 00:39:01.730
Since we're here, we need to work hard.

1006
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.560
Work is work.

1007
00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:05.599
You're professional.

1008
00:39:05.799 --> 00:39:09.000
I'm a very hard worker.

1009
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.840
You're a hard worker?

1010
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.040
This house is very well-built.

1011
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.210
I think so too.

1012
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:16.579
- That's why... - Is it your real name?

1013
00:39:16.579 --> 00:39:17.940
Yes, Koo Ha Ra.

1014
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.079
Your family name is Koo?

1015
00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:23.520
You didn't know that? He's so mean.

1016
00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.049
I'll show you how to do this.

1017
00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:29.790
Hold this and follow me.

1018
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:31.159
Okay. Let's go.

1019
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.829
(Would they be able to pick all the eggplants?)

1020
00:39:37.099 --> 00:39:40.299
You should pick an eggplant like this.

1021
00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.070
You should pick eggplants that are...

1022
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.739
- longer than a handspan. - Is it acceptable?

1023
00:39:44.739 --> 00:39:46.810
- Yes. - It's acceptable.

1024
00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:48.810
- Like this? - If you pick a small one,

1025
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:52.009
- we can't sell it. - Look.

1026
00:39:52.009 --> 00:39:53.579
- Okay. - It's a pass.

1027
00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:55.150
- Am I good? - Yes, you did a good job.

1028
00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:57.619
- That's how you do it. - Okay.

1029
00:39:57.619 --> 00:39:59.619
Should we pick them and put them in a box?

1030
00:39:59.619 --> 00:40:01.150
- Yes. - Only one box?

1031
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.829
What? You should do it until the sun sets.

1032
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:06.860
What?

1033
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.329
Drag the box like this.

1034
00:40:09.329 --> 00:40:11.329
If there's an eggplant to pick, stop right there.

1035
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:13.400
- You should pick this. - Can I pick this too?

1036
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.170
- It's a span long. - Right.

1037
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.139
I don't think we can do this until the sun sets.

1038
00:40:18.239 --> 00:40:20.469
We can do this. It's not hard.

1039
00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:22.110
- Gosh, this is big. - You should go that way.

1040
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.480
This is big.

1041
00:40:23.909 --> 00:40:26.349
- Pick them on both sides. - This is huge.

1042
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:27.349
On both sides.

1043
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:28.380
This one.

1044
00:40:28.949 --> 00:40:29.949
This is really big.

1045
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:32.920
- It's a good one. - Gosh.

1046
00:40:33.619 --> 00:40:36.460
This is a good one too. Look at this.

1047
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.090
- It's too small. - I'm sorry.

1048
00:40:39.989 --> 00:40:41.489
We'll work hard anyway.

1049
00:40:41.489 --> 00:40:42.560
(He found a big one again.)

1050
00:40:43.659 --> 00:40:46.630
Jong Min, you're good. You look like a farmer.

1051
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.000
- What about this one? - I just picked two.

1052
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.570
All right.

1053
00:40:51.099 --> 00:40:53.840
Jong Min should teach me.

1054
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:55.440
Stop it.

1055
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.940
(A compliment makes Jong Min dance.)

1056
00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.980
This is big.

1057
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.079
(This is the power of a compliment.)

1058
00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:01.079
And it's straight.

1059
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.420
I like fried eggplants.

1060
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.420
(He's motivated.)

1061
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.449
I want to eat it.

1062
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.989
You should pick them all today.

1063
00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:09.290
- Okay. - We'll try.

1064
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.130
- Once you're done... - We can't pick all.

1065
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.130
Okay.

1066
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:15.560
(Jong Min is not an easy prey.)

1067
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.000
If you do a good job, I'll pay you a lot.

1068
00:41:18.299 --> 00:41:20.570
Are you sure? You should keep your word.

1069
00:41:22.469 --> 00:41:23.599
We have a good harvest.

1070
00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:24.599
(Now all they have to do is work hard.)

1071
00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:26.270
This is big. Look.

1072
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.179
(When would they be able to finish it all?)

1073
00:41:30.179 --> 00:41:31.980
(She works hard without saying a word.)

1074
00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.009
This is twisted.

1075
00:41:34.009 --> 00:41:35.420
(Meanwhile, Jong Min is being very talkative.)

1076
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.480
It's twisted.

1077
00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:40.090
- Jong Min. - Yes?

1078
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.250
Are you working hard?

1079
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.590
- Are you? - Of course.

1080
00:41:44.389 --> 00:41:46.090
- Is it going well? - Yes.

1081
00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:47.130
(Driver Lee is watching.)

1082
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:48.759
- Jong Min. - Yes?

1083
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.299
Let's make an acrostic poem with eggplant.

1084
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.429
With eggplant?

1085
00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:53.500
Yes. First verse.

1086
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.940
Ha Ra is slender.

1087
00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:59.710
That's wrong. You chose a wrong word.

1088
00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.770
- Really? - Yes.

1089
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:01.969
It sounds about right though.

1090
00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:03.009
(Slender is right.)

1091
00:42:03.009 --> 00:42:05.139
Ha Ra is slender.

1092
00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:06.210
Second verse.

1093
00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:07.750
Do you have a boyfriend?

1094
00:42:08.849 --> 00:42:11.449
What's that? Are you confessing your love?

1095
00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:13.119
- What? - Are you confessing love?

1096
00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:14.849
No, I'm not.

1097
00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:16.389
- No? - I just asked a question.

1098
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.889
Just stop talking and get back to work.

1099
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.259
(Stop chatting away.)

1100
00:42:23.259 --> 00:42:25.670
We're just bored.

1101
00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.429
I met Ha Ra after a long time.

1102
00:42:28.429 --> 00:42:32.139
I'm sorry to let you work after such a long time,

1103
00:42:32.739 --> 00:42:33.810
but do it right.

1104
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:34.840
- Okay. - Yes, sir.

1105
00:42:35.409 --> 00:42:37.909
Will you release a new album or something?

1106
00:42:37.909 --> 00:42:40.279
I'm working on an album for the Japanese market.

1107
00:42:40.279 --> 00:42:42.279
Japan? A solo album?

1108
00:42:42.279 --> 00:42:43.449
- Yes. - I see.

1109
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.520
- Need a guest singer? - No.

1110
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.590
No? I see.

1111
00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.290
(Giggling)

1112
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.960
I wish I could promote my song in foreign countries.

1113
00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.659
I don't need a guest singer though.

1114
00:42:57.429 --> 00:42:58.969
Even if I do, I won't need you.

1115
00:42:59.299 --> 00:43:00.299
Really?

1116
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.170
- What about a bodyguard? - You as my bodyguard?

1117
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.940
(Jong Min just wants to do something for her.)

1118
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.509
You should be a porter.

1119
00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:12.150
I'm pretty good though.

1120
00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:14.409
I beat Defconn at arm wrestling.

1121
00:43:14.409 --> 00:43:15.750
- Arm wrestling? - Yes.

1122
00:43:17.279 --> 00:43:18.420
I see.

1123
00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:21.889
You don't seem interested in me at all.

1124
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.560
I can tell.

1125
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.429
Are you a fool or a genius?

1126
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:32.599
I'll tell you next time you see me.

1127
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.029
What? What did you say?

1128
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.099
- I'll tell you next time. - Next time I see you?

1129
00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:39.610
- Yes. - Where?

1130
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:41.340
Wherever.

1131
00:43:43.139 --> 00:43:44.679
You're being ridiculous.

1132
00:43:46.509 --> 00:43:48.719
- Ha Ra. - Yes?

1133
00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:51.150
Let's say there's someone you love.

1134
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.250
- Okay. - He's really good.

1135
00:43:53.989 --> 00:43:56.060
- You love him so much. - It's not you, is it?

1136
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.690
Right. It's not me.

1137
00:43:59.259 --> 00:44:01.929
When will you get married?

1138
00:44:02.259 --> 00:44:04.960
- I want to get married. - You do?

1139
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:08.529
- Meet a girl like me. - What? Why?

1140
00:44:08.529 --> 00:44:09.699
Why do you think so?

1141
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.139
I'm a good girl. You know that?

1142
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.810
Tell me why you think you're good.

1143
00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.980
First, I'm good at farm work like this.

1144
00:44:19.779 --> 00:44:22.549
I'm considerate of others.

1145
00:44:23.719 --> 00:44:25.849
I know how to liven up the mood.

1146
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.320
I'm well-informed in financial matters.

1147
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.290
- Wow. - And...

1148
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.820
I understand men well.

1149
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.929
And...

1150
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.730
- And... - You're quick-witted.

1151
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:38.099
Exactly. I am quick-witted.

1152
00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:40.900
I'm a little old though.

1153
00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:44.099
You're a little old.

1154
00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:45.139
(Ha Ra is in her mid-20s.)

1155
00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:46.739
You should meet a man like me.

1156
00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:48.840
Gosh.

1157
00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:51.779
What kind of man are you?

1158
00:44:52.179 --> 00:44:54.909
I need a caring person.

1159
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.719
I need someone who knows a lot about finance.

1160
00:44:57.849 --> 00:44:59.549
I require a great deal of care.

1161
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:03.389
You're so tiresome.

1162
00:45:04.489 --> 00:45:06.560
Right. That's what makes you shine.

1163
00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:08.489
You think?

1164
00:45:08.489 --> 00:45:09.960
(Jong Min makes his beloved one shine.)

1165
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.029
I guess I agree.

1166
00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:13.599
(Dong Gu and Yu Ra arrive at the chive field.)

1167
00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:15.469
- Are they all chives? - Yes.

1168
00:45:15.469 --> 00:45:17.670
- It looks beautiful. - It's all chives.

1169
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:19.869
- This one? - Yes.

1170
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.509
I'll show you what to do.

1171
00:45:23.509 --> 00:45:26.310
That's right. We're here to work.

1172
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:27.980
It's just so pretty.

1173
00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:29.679
Hold it and...

1174
00:45:29.679 --> 00:45:30.920
(Mow it with a sickle.)

1175
00:45:31.279 --> 00:45:32.790
Hold and mow it with a sickle.

1176
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:33.849
(It looks somewhat simple.)

1177
00:45:33.849 --> 00:45:34.989
He cut it at once.

1178
00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.130
It looks easy but it won't be as easy as it looks.

1179
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.130
I think so.

1180
00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.630
- I like the sound though. - I know.

1181
00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:48.630
(They get a cushion for the work.)

1182
00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:51.440
All right. We're ready.

1183
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.869
You should be careful, okay?

1184
00:45:52.869 --> 00:45:53.940
- Yes. - Be careful.

1185
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:57.239
Do you cook buchujeon with the chives...

1186
00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.509
- you just reaped? - Yes.

1187
00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.480
That'd be delicious.

1188
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.119
- Have you done that? - No.

1189
00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:04.380
I was hoping we could do that.

1190
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.150
It's really good.

1191
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.920
We've never tried it before.

1192
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.759
- Look. This feels good. - Really?

1193
00:46:12.429 --> 00:46:13.759
- I like the sound. - I know.

1194
00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.259
It sounds good.

1195
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:17.259
Is it fun?

1196
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.869
- Yes. - This feels pretty good.

1197
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.429
I like the sound.

1198
00:46:21.929 --> 00:46:24.440
And it smells really good.

1199
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.509
I like the smell.

1200
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.940
(She likes the smell.)

1201
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440
It's aromatic.

1202
00:46:29.139 --> 00:46:30.880
I want you to mow them all.

1203
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.179
- Okay. - Okay.

1204
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.009
- This is so aromatic. - Right.

1205
00:46:35.619 --> 00:46:37.779
- It smells like jeon. - I know.

1206
00:46:37.779 --> 00:46:38.820
Smell it.

1207
00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:41.489
That's because you make buchujeon with this.

1208
00:46:41.489 --> 00:46:43.460
It smells good as it's fresh.

1209
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.190
(They reaped quite a lot.)

1210
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.259
All right.

1211
00:46:47.259 --> 00:46:48.259
You're good.

1212
00:46:48.259 --> 00:46:49.529
(Yu Ra is good at using a sickle.)

1213
00:46:49.529 --> 00:46:50.560
I'm speeding up.

1214
00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.130
- She's really good. - I know.

1215
00:46:54.529 --> 00:46:56.699
She's even better than me.

1216
00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.969
Is there a reason you picked us?

1217
00:47:00.469 --> 00:47:05.310
You looked so energetic when you sang.

1218
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.349
Energetic? I know. That's who we are.

1219
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:11.079
- We're full of energy. - We look vigorous.

1220
00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.820
This is a lot.

1221
00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:17.860
We shouldn't have seen that.

1222
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:22.099
It turns out 330m² is very big.

1223
00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:23.159
I know.

1224
00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:26.029
(There will be an end if we work hard.)

1225
00:47:27.199 --> 00:47:28.900
(We can still do this.)

1226
00:47:30.369 --> 00:47:31.369
It's hot.

1227
00:47:31.369 --> 00:47:32.570
(It's hot in the vinyl greenhouse.)

1228
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.440
- I'm tired. - Me too.

1229
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.279
That's because we don't slack off like Joon Ho.

1230
00:47:39.679 --> 00:47:41.810
- Really? - He always goofs off.

1231
00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:44.650
I can imagine that.

1232
00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:45.719
(Would Dong Gu's prediction be true?)

1233
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.520
Hello.

1234
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.820
- Hello. - Hello.

1235
00:47:50.489 --> 00:47:52.790
We will go plant napa cabbage.

1236
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.429
This is the cabbage patch.

1237
00:47:54.429 --> 00:47:55.560
- Is this it? - Yes.

1238
00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.829
It looks well-organized though.

1239
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.029
What's that?

1240
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.500
We should spread the plastic which is heavy.

1241
00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:07.270
I'll show you how to do it.

1242
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.369
(Spread the plastic so weeds can't grow.)

1243
00:48:08.369 --> 00:48:09.639
I can do this alone.

1244
00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:12.579
It's like how you insert toilet paper.

1245
00:48:12.579 --> 00:48:14.579
We should cover it with dirt.

1246
00:48:14.579 --> 00:48:16.049
Cover it with dirt.

1247
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:18.889
Pull this in the front.

1248
00:48:18.889 --> 00:48:19.920
Do you want to do this?

1249
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:21.420
Hold this.

1250
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.389
Rock-paper-scissors?

1251
00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:25.989
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1252
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:27.190
(Paper and scissors)

1253
00:48:29.799 --> 00:48:30.929
All right.

1254
00:48:30.929 --> 00:48:32.969
- We didn't need that. - Pull it in the front.

1255
00:48:32.969 --> 00:48:34.029
Drag it.

1256
00:48:34.029 --> 00:48:35.230
Is this how it works?

1257
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.739
- Right. Stop. - It's so convenient.

1258
00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:39.969
Now cover it with dirt like this.

1259
00:48:39.969 --> 00:48:41.710
- Keep pulling it. - Okay.

1260
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:42.779
- I'll do it. - Keep pulling.

1261
00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:45.009
- About half a step apart. - Sparsely.

1262
00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.349
It turns out this is an easier job.

1263
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:50.719
(Chuckling)

1264
00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:53.420
- It's easier than others. - I didn't know that.

1265
00:48:53.989 --> 00:48:56.290
This isn't so bad though.

1266
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.889
- This is easy. - It's not that difficult.

1267
00:49:00.159 --> 00:49:01.759
We can do this by ourselves.

1268
00:49:01.759 --> 00:49:02.799
(He sounds confident.)

1269
00:49:03.529 --> 00:49:05.299
(That's how Joon Ho began to practice it.)

1270
00:49:05.299 --> 00:49:07.630
Just do it as you usually do.

1271
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.570
- Can I do that? - Yes. Joon Ho is good.

1272
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.040
Ready, set, go.

1273
00:49:14.969 --> 00:49:16.940
- You're being too slow. - You think?

1274
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.940
Yes.

1275
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.549
- Sir. - Let's do this quickly.

1276
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:20.650
Like this.

1277
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.710
Wait.

1278
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.250
You can't do it like that.

1279
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:24.949
Go slowly.

1280
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.590
- Sir, let's go slow. - Okay.

1281
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.690
There's no easy work.

1282
00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:31.989
Nothing comes easy.

1283
00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:33.659
("Screening Humanity")

1284
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:37.130
You're like an 80-year-old man.

1285
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:40.770
(A rookie farmer, Kim Joon Ho)

1286
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:42.969
(Sighing)

1287
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.409
Why did you pick me?

1288
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:49.139
You did the martial arts show.

1289
00:49:49.139 --> 00:49:50.409
So I thought you were strong.

1290
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.179
- You have experience. - That's right.

1291
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:55.250
I think you lied about not feeling pain.

1292
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:56.480
(Painlessness strikes back.)

1293
00:49:56.779 --> 00:49:58.549
- Well... - I'll do it.

1294
00:49:58.549 --> 00:50:02.119
- How did I fall? - I'll do it. Take a rest.

1295
00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.190
It's pretty.

1296
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.659
Doesn't it look like gimbap?

1297
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.400
It looks like tuna is sticking out.

1298
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.230
- Isn't it pretty? - Does it look pretty?

1299
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.270
Of course.

1300
00:50:13.699 --> 00:50:15.230
- It's nasty. - But we worked on it.

1301
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.869
It looks like gimbap.

1302
00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:18.099
- Does it? - Yes.

1303
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:21.139
("Screening Humanity")

1304
00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:23.480
(Husband and wife make gimbap on field.)

1305
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.920
We did well.

1306
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.279
Isn't it pretty? Look.

1307
00:50:31.279 --> 00:50:32.690
- We did a good job. - We did.

1308
00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:34.690
What do we do now?

1309
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.619
- In the middle. - Like this.

1310
00:50:36.989 --> 00:50:38.420
- We have to do it well. - Yes.

1311
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.159
You make holes carefully.

1312
00:50:40.159 --> 00:50:41.230
They have to be equally spaced.

1313
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:43.329
Who wants to try it?

1314
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.029
- I'll do it first. - Try it.

1315
00:50:45.029 --> 00:50:46.699
Come here.

1316
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.270
Be careful, Narsha.

1317
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:49.770
You hold this.

1318
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:52.409
Hold it in your hand and keep the same distance.

1319
00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:53.639
Touch it and remove it.

1320
00:50:54.409 --> 00:50:55.480
Good.

1321
00:50:57.139 --> 00:50:58.639
- Good job. - She's good.

1322
00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:00.909
(She's showing her skills from experience.)

1323
00:51:00.909 --> 00:51:01.980
Narsha.

1324
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:07.049
- This is easy. - Yes, that's easy.

1325
00:51:07.889 --> 00:51:09.989
(She finished two lines in no time.)

1326
00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:13.790
Where is he?

1327
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:15.900
Gosh, he's slacking off.

1328
00:51:17.759 --> 00:51:19.500
Don't hold it up too high.

1329
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.570
Does it make bigger holes?

1330
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.239
You have to do it very lightly.

1331
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.969
(His feet are faster than the eyes.)

1332
00:51:27.139 --> 00:51:29.179
Let's film the village.

1333
00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.679
Please film that.

1334
00:51:33.909 --> 00:51:34.949
All that.

1335
00:51:36.779 --> 00:51:37.920
Hello.

1336
00:51:39.219 --> 00:51:40.549
We said hi earlier.

1337
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:41.949
(He says hello cheerfully.)

1338
00:51:41.949 --> 00:51:42.960
Is there something to drink?

1339
00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:44.960
- Something to drink? - Yes.

1340
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.889
Let's see. What kind?

1341
00:51:47.889 --> 00:51:50.299
Sujeonggwa, sikhye, or anything.

1342
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.230
All right.

1343
00:51:55.369 --> 00:51:56.500
This is all I have.

1344
00:51:56.969 --> 00:51:58.139
What's that?

1345
00:51:58.139 --> 00:51:59.210
(It's nutritious tonic.)

1346
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.869
You don't like this?

1347
00:52:01.009 --> 00:52:02.380
This is too expensive.

1348
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:05.009
No, it's just a drink.

1349
00:52:05.009 --> 00:52:06.079
Just a drink?

1350
00:52:06.779 --> 00:52:08.949
But it has ox bezoar and deer antler.

1351
00:52:08.949 --> 00:52:10.020
It's okay.

1352
00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:11.279
Can I drink this?

1353
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.690
Goodness. It's okay.

1354
00:52:14.049 --> 00:52:15.420
I'll try it, ma'am.

1355
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.420
I'll film you.

1356
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.020
Don't do that.

1357
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.190
Just turn away from the camera.

1358
00:52:21.389 --> 00:52:22.860
- I'll drink it. - It's okay.

1359
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.829
(I'm filming you so you'd feel bad.)

1360
00:52:28.869 --> 00:52:30.440
Give them one too.

1361
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:32.310
No. We shouldn't.

1362
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.739
(Don't be like that.)

1363
00:52:34.239 --> 00:52:36.810
I have to help you. I can't take it for free.

1364
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.179
I don't farm, so I don't need any help.

1365
00:52:39.179 --> 00:52:41.509
- Do you want a massage? - No.

1366
00:52:41.509 --> 00:52:42.849
I have a certificate.

1367
00:52:42.949 --> 00:52:44.020
Stay still.

1368
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:45.849
You have a huge knot.

1369
00:52:45.849 --> 00:52:48.420
- It's because I work. - Right.

1370
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.190
Your bride is coming.

1371
00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:52.690
She's not my bride. She's Narsha.

1372
00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.400
(She looks furious.)

1373
00:52:56.259 --> 00:52:57.259
What are you doing here?

1374
00:52:57.259 --> 00:52:59.070
- I'm being a good son. - What?

1375
00:52:59.829 --> 00:53:00.869
She gave me soy milk.

1376
00:53:00.869 --> 00:53:03.239
Why? You gave us soy milk?

1377
00:53:03.239 --> 00:53:05.509
Is that why you're giving her a massage?

1378
00:53:06.239 --> 00:53:07.570
This is fair then.

1379
00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:08.779
Yes, it is.

1380
00:53:08.779 --> 00:53:10.009
It's like getting paid for work.

1381
00:53:10.009 --> 00:53:11.880
Of course. They shouldn't criticize us.

1382
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.279
- We should do 10 minutes. - That feels nice.

1383
00:53:15.279 --> 00:53:16.520
I have nothing to give you.

1384
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.849
This is more than enough.

1385
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:20.590
I already had one. You take one.

1386
00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:21.650
Be my accomplice.

1387
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:22.690
(He suggests for her to be his accomplice.)

1388
00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:23.690
Drink it.

1389
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:25.190
Deer antler isn't easy.

1390
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:26.230
(Her pupils are shaking.)

1391
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.029
- I opened it. - Give her one.

1392
00:53:28.029 --> 00:53:30.829
Isn't it okay if nobody reports us?

1393
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:32.730
They shouldn't report us.

1394
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.029
- We gave her a massage. - It's a self-defense.

1395
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.199
- They can't nag at us. - This is too much.

1396
00:53:37.199 --> 00:53:38.239
Thank you so much.

1397
00:53:38.239 --> 00:53:40.409
- We'll take two soy milk. - Drinking this will...

1398
00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:41.969
It's hard to earn a living.

1399
00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:43.040
(It's hard to earn a living.)

1400
00:53:43.509 --> 00:53:45.279
- That's delicious. - Goodness.

1401
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.250
- It's delicious. - It is.

1402
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.920
It has ox bezoar and deer antler.

1403
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.119
- Ox bezoar. - Ox bezoar.

1404
00:53:53.989 --> 00:53:55.219
Thank you, ma'am.

1405
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.889
This was great.

1406
00:53:58.159 --> 00:53:59.360
(Shy)

1407
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.429
We have to go. He's waiting for us.

1408
00:54:02.429 --> 00:54:04.460
- The sun will set soon. - Come on.

1409
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.130
(Yu Ra looks a bit tired.)

1410
00:54:08.199 --> 00:54:09.699
I'm sweating more and more.

1411
00:54:09.699 --> 00:54:12.070
I think I'll lose weight. A forced diet.

1412
00:54:12.239 --> 00:54:13.270
Exactly.

1413
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.340
But you regain the weight by eating.

1414
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.880
- So you gain weight. - That's right.

1415
00:54:20.949 --> 00:54:23.480
Tell Girl's Day members to be on One Night Two Days.

1416
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.989
Is there someone you want to see?

1417
00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.590
It's you, Yu Ra.

1418
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.489
Right? It was me, right?

1419
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.389
You're happy because I'm your partner, right?

1420
00:54:32.389 --> 00:54:33.560
- Of course. - Right?

1421
00:54:34.659 --> 00:54:36.199
(Good answer.)

1422
00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:39.570
(They feel awkward.)

1423
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.670
- Did I force that answer? - No.

1424
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:42.869
All right.

1425
00:54:45.199 --> 00:54:46.540
(Have some snack.)

1426
00:54:47.969 --> 00:54:49.380
(He's touched.)

1427
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.579
Thank you so much.

1428
00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:54.679
- I didn't think you'd... - Thank you.

1429
00:54:54.779 --> 00:54:56.250
- Goodness. - Awesome.

1430
00:54:57.079 --> 00:54:58.849
- Are these from here? - Yes.

1431
00:54:58.849 --> 00:55:00.219
I feel so happy all of a sudden.

1432
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.020
Thank you, sir.

1433
00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.719
- Won't you eat with us? - Okay.

1434
00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:06.389
- I'll give you some. - Wait.

1435
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:07.759
I'm so excited.

1436
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.599
This isn't alcohol, but cheers.

1437
00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:12.329
(Cheers!)

1438
00:55:12.329 --> 00:55:13.500
Cheers.

1439
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.869
- This is great. - Thank you.

1440
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.639
(Drinking)

1441
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:21.340
(They finish it at once.)

1442
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.380
It's so cool.

1443
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:25.040
- It's good. Is it barley? - It's cassia seed.

1444
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.310
- Cassia seed. - Cassia seed?

1445
00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:28.719
- Here. - It's okay.

1446
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.079
- Thank you. - Okay.

1447
00:55:30.079 --> 00:55:31.849
(Yu Ra gives him a piece first.)

1448
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.549
Try it.

1449
00:55:37.219 --> 00:55:38.259
It's warm.

1450
00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:40.590
(It's delicious.)

1451
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:42.829
It's so crispy.

1452
00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:45.529
It's so good.

1453
00:55:45.529 --> 00:55:46.599
(The chives are so fresh.)

1454
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.670
- I'm so happy. - It smells so good.

1455
00:55:50.699 --> 00:55:51.739
It's delicious.

1456
00:55:52.509 --> 00:55:53.810
- Would you like more? - No.

1457
00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:56.239
- I eat it every day. - I see.

1458
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.710
(She devours the pancake.)

1459
00:55:59.509 --> 00:56:01.279
I always have this as a snack.

1460
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.650
It's so good.

1461
00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:09.820
- I want makgeolli. - I know.

1462
00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:11.719
- Do you want it? - Yes!

1463
00:56:12.159 --> 00:56:13.659
Thank you!

1464
00:56:13.889 --> 00:56:15.529
I'll bring it.

1465
00:56:16.759 --> 00:56:18.230
Just one glass.

1466
00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:21.799
- Makgeolli is a must. - Yes.

1467
00:56:21.799 --> 00:56:23.540
One glass of drink is a cure-all.

1468
00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.509
Exactly. We wouldn't get drunk with one glass.

1469
00:56:26.509 --> 00:56:27.570
That's right.

1470
00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.610
(Happiness comes after a long wait.)

1471
00:56:31.239 --> 00:56:32.310
Let's go greet him.

1472
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:35.719
(Makgeolli and chive pancake)

1473
00:56:35.849 --> 00:56:36.980
- Thank you. - Goodness.

1474
00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:37.980
It's Hongcheon makgeolli.

1475
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:40.920
Yes, I brought Hongcheon makgeolli.

1476
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.949
(It's a cold makgeolli from the fridge.)

1477
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.560
Goodness.

1478
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.690
- We have so much. - We don't need dinner.

1479
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:48.329
If we eat a nice dinner, then it's the best.

1480
00:56:48.329 --> 00:56:50.900
You worked hard. So I'll pour you a glass.

1481
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:51.900
Thank you.

1482
00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:56.469
We complained because this was so difficult.

1483
00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.969
- We'll work hard. - The work is...

1484
00:56:59.869 --> 00:57:01.139
I'm so happy right now.

1485
00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:03.409
My endorphin level went up.

1486
00:57:03.409 --> 00:57:04.840
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1487
00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:09.420
(Careful)

1488
00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.520
Is it cool?

1489
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:16.690
(Happy)

1490
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.690
- It's good. - This is amazing.

1491
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:24.259
(She's saving every drop.)

1492
00:57:25.299 --> 00:57:26.869
This makgeolli is so good.

1493
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:31.639
Eating here makes me so happy.

1494
00:57:31.639 --> 00:57:32.770
I'm so happy.

1495
00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:36.079
I'm glad.

1496
00:57:36.079 --> 00:57:38.179
You have to finish before the sun sets.

1497
00:57:38.179 --> 00:57:39.250
- Please go back to work. - Okay.

1498
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.880
You've been waiting too long.

1499
00:57:41.049 --> 00:57:42.150
I'll just take one more.

1500
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.790
(They look brighter after the snack.)

1501
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:47.650
You're good at cutting this.

1502
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.360
Makgeolli gave me power.

1503
00:57:52.759 --> 00:57:56.199
(They cut without a break.)

1504
00:57:57.099 --> 00:57:58.630
I can see the end.

1505
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:01.770
- I have strength again. - Me too.

1506
00:58:02.969 --> 00:58:05.909
(After cutting after cutting...)

1507
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.840
It's done!

1508
00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:09.840
(They finish cutting the chives.)

1509
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:13.949
- Sir. - Yes?

1510
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:16.380
(Goodness)

1511
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.619
Didn't I pick them well?

1512
00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:19.690
- Yes, but... - What's wrong?

1513
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:22.960
the stem is a bit too long.

1514
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:25.690
- This is prettier. - I didn't know.

1515
00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.259
I forgot to teach you earlier.

1516
00:58:28.259 --> 00:58:30.199
Right. We can make it pretty now.

1517
00:58:30.199 --> 00:58:31.599
Okay. Make it pretty.

1518
00:58:31.759 --> 00:58:33.369
Cut it and make it pretty.

1519
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:35.000
You're doing well.

1520
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:38.469
- Sir. - Yes?

1521
00:58:38.469 --> 00:58:39.840
I cut this white one.

1522
00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:42.509
Goodness. That's bad.

1523
00:58:42.509 --> 00:58:43.880
They'll all fall down now.

1524
00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.909
Jong Min, why did you do that?

1525
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.619
This part got cut.

1526
00:58:50.279 --> 00:58:52.020
Pour them here. They're too heavy.

1527
00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.090
Pour them here?

1528
00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:54.849
I knew he'd do that.

1529
00:58:57.159 --> 00:58:59.860
(Eggplant picking continues.)

1530
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:03.360
(They concentrate and work hard.)

1531
00:59:04.699 --> 00:59:06.770
(The boxes get filled with eggplants.)

1532
00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.570
(He's quite serious.)

1533
00:59:10.599 --> 00:59:12.770
(They filled six boxes already.)

1534
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:14.070
Okay, I'll put it here.

1535
00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.340
(He goes back with an empty box.)

1536
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:19.049
Do you want to ask me anything?

1537
00:59:19.179 --> 00:59:20.279
No.

1538
00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:23.250
(That's a flat refusal.)

1539
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.449
You're just like Shin Ji.

1540
00:59:27.489 --> 00:59:28.489
How charming.

1541
00:59:28.489 --> 00:59:29.489
(He's blinded by love.)

1542
00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:33.730
(Time passes.)

1543
00:59:34.429 --> 00:59:35.630
I'm getting tired now.

1544
00:59:37.329 --> 00:59:38.400
He's bringing a carrier.

1545
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.799
(Driver Lee comes with a carrier.)

1546
00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:42.270
He's here. Let's go now.

1547
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.139
- Ha Ra. Let's go. - Yes?

1548
00:59:45.139 --> 00:59:46.940
Jong Min, let me finish up here.

1549
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.469
(He's proud of Ha Ra.)

1550
00:59:48.469 --> 00:59:51.840
Let's go now. We have other work to do.

1551
00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.380
I'm done.

1552
00:59:53.679 --> 00:59:55.420
I guess you have to see things to the end.

1553
00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.119
Jong Min, you've worked hard enough. Come on out.

1554
01:00:00.119 --> 01:00:03.590
Not at all. I should do everything I can to help.

1555
01:00:04.219 --> 01:00:05.829
It'll get dark soon.

1556
01:00:05.989 --> 01:00:07.829
It's okay.

1557
01:00:07.989 --> 01:00:11.329
I should help. You usually work alone.

1558
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.900
I'm stopping now only because you insist.

1559
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.909
(Those are all empty words.)

1560
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.480
- It's heavy. - Let him do the lifting.

1561
01:00:27.849 --> 01:00:29.520
I can lift it by myself.

1562
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
(Here we go.)

1563
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.820
- See? - You're a real man.

1564
01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.849
Of course.

1565
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.860
(Did you see that?)

1566
01:00:39.429 --> 01:00:40.429
(See what?)

1567
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:44.159
She does things I didn't even ask for.

1568
01:00:44.159 --> 01:00:45.299
(A worker by nature)

1569
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:47.099
You're a hard worker.

1570
01:00:47.099 --> 01:00:48.099
(Ha Ra is the best.)

1571
01:00:48.969 --> 01:00:50.739
- Which way are we going? - That way.

1572
01:00:50.739 --> 01:00:51.969
Down there?

1573
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.710
Jong Min, you should do this. Why am I doing it?

1574
01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.610
(They head to Driver Lee's house.)

1575
01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:01.949
(Great work.)

1576
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.520
(I worked so hard.)

1577
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.549
I'm hungry. We should eat some snacks.

1578
01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.090
Driver Lee. What do you want us to do now?

1579
01:01:14.529 --> 01:01:17.400
We've picked the eggplant, so we should process it.

1580
01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:19.130
- Put them in boxes. - In boxes?

1581
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.670
Let's do it.

1582
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:22.340
Shouldn't we eat some food?

1583
01:01:23.869 --> 01:01:25.170
- Like this? - Yes.

1584
01:01:25.509 --> 01:01:26.509
Put your hand in.

1585
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:30.710
She's good.

1586
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.009
Of course.

1587
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.579
She's thorough.

1588
01:01:33.579 --> 01:01:34.579
(Slacking off again)

1589
01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:36.579
You're doing great.

1590
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.449
Use the water pressure to clean it.

1591
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.690
- There you go. No. - Like this?

1592
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:43.489
Press it like this. That's right.

1593
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:46.730
Like this?

1594
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:48.929
(She punishes him.)

1595
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.860
You told me to press it like this.

1596
01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:52.869
Hey.

1597
01:01:53.369 --> 01:01:56.699
It's because you're not helping. Come and clean.

1598
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:58.670
How many should I put in?

1599
01:01:59.509 --> 01:02:01.610
- 50. - 50 in each box?

1600
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.880
(50 eggplants for each box)

1601
01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.980
(They make the last spurt.)

1602
01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.610
Since you've worked hard today,

1603
01:02:08.719 --> 01:02:10.650
I'll let you eat some grilled eggplant.

1604
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:12.690
Thank you. It sounds delicious.

1605
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:14.590
I've picked out some fresh ones.

1606
01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:15.590
(Nobody asked him to.)

1607
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:17.820
- Sir, I got the big ones. - Good.

1608
01:02:17.989 --> 01:02:19.630
- Come here. - Can we eat one each?

1609
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.630
(He moves fast for food.)

1610
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:22.560
They're so fresh.

1611
01:02:24.329 --> 01:02:26.070
(He pours sesame oil on the pan.)

1612
01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.540
Jong Min, slice them and grill them. I'll go...

1613
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.610
- and get the salt. - Okay.

1614
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:33.610
(He's exempted from work.)

1615
01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:34.670
How should I slice them?

1616
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.949
(Ha Ra has to work hard alone,)

1617
01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:41.610
(but she quietly keeps working.)

1618
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:44.279
Let's see. I saw people slicing it this way.

1619
01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:47.489
They slice it like this.

1620
01:02:48.989 --> 01:02:50.560
Oh, I can also slice it this way.

1621
01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.860
(It's a mess.)

1622
01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:54.590
- Should I grill it now? - Yes.

1623
01:02:56.699 --> 01:02:58.529
(Sizzling)

1624
01:02:59.299 --> 01:03:01.500
Ha Ra is working hard alone.

1625
01:03:01.799 --> 01:03:03.099
(A threatening look)

1626
01:03:03.799 --> 01:03:04.799
(Oh, boy.)

1627
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.670
My back aches a lot.

1628
01:03:08.679 --> 01:03:09.840
(You'll be fine.)

1629
01:03:10.739 --> 01:03:12.750
Gosh, my legs are sore.

1630
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:15.079
Mister. Could you move that here?

1631
01:03:15.079 --> 01:03:17.279
- Okay. - My back is aching.

1632
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.219
Come here if you're done. It's almost ready.

1633
01:03:20.219 --> 01:03:22.520
- We're not done yet. - We're not.

1634
01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:24.759
You can stop now. It won't be enough for a box.

1635
01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.630
- Really? - It's less than 50.

1636
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:28.630
Shall we grill them all then?

1637
01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:32.400
- Gosh, you did great. - Sure.

1638
01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:33.699
Ha Ra, let's taste it.

1639
01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.940
- What is this? - I'll give you one.

1640
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.610
- Dip it in the salt. - It'll be too hot.

1641
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.070
It's not hot. Probably not.

1642
01:03:41.409 --> 01:03:42.810
- Here. - Blow on it first.

1643
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:43.810
(She takes the eggplant.)

1644
01:03:45.079 --> 01:03:46.380
Is it still hot?

1645
01:03:47.579 --> 01:03:49.049
(She's worried, but she puts it in her mouth.)

1646
01:03:49.049 --> 01:03:50.119
Wait.

1647
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:51.579
(Goodness)

1648
01:03:51.779 --> 01:03:54.090
- I'll give you one too. - It's too hot.

1649
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:56.020
- Of course, it'd be hot. - It's too hot.

1650
01:03:56.159 --> 01:03:57.420
Really? Is it hot?

1651
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.420
Of course.

1652
01:03:58.489 --> 01:03:59.929
It's seriously hot.

1653
01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:03.000
(Eat it slowly.)

1654
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:05.529
(Ha Ra seems okay now.)

1655
01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:07.429
Gosh. I want this.

1656
01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.599
- What's that? - Beer.

1657
01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:13.310
(It's hot.)

1658
01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.310
- It burned. - Gosh, it's all burned.

1659
01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.810
(The hot eggplant makes his legs weak.)

1660
01:04:18.409 --> 01:04:20.549
You're good at eating hot food.

1661
01:04:21.009 --> 01:04:22.480
(It's crazy hot.)

1662
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.880
- It's really hot, right? - Yes.

1663
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880
(It's crazy hot.)

1664
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:28.790
Why did you eat it without cooling it down?

1665
01:04:32.759 --> 01:04:34.860
Is it okay to eat this by ourselves?

1666
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:36.130
It's okay.

1667
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.900
- Really? - Eat when you can.

1668
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.099
Joon Ho, I've done about half of it.

1669
01:04:45.099 --> 01:04:46.509
- Already? - It's only fair.

1670
01:04:46.509 --> 01:04:48.739
I left some work for you so you wouldn't get bored.

1671
01:04:48.739 --> 01:04:50.880
- You stopped working. - Go and do it.

1672
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.049
- Finish it up. - I see.

1673
01:04:52.049 --> 01:04:53.110
You saw me do it, right?

1674
01:04:53.909 --> 01:04:56.079
- Sir. - Where have you been?

1675
01:04:56.079 --> 01:04:57.579
Sir, please give him a good scolding.

1676
01:04:57.579 --> 01:04:59.190
- Where have you been? - I went to greet people.

1677
01:04:59.219 --> 01:05:01.190
Sir, he'll do the rest of the work.

1678
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:03.759
- I'll water them. - No, you'll plant them.

1679
01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.489
Press it hard with your both hands.

1680
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:08.659
Let's place them first...

1681
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:11.429
and plant them later.

1682
01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:13.929
Now that we're working together,

1683
01:05:13.929 --> 01:05:15.000
- Right. - it's faster.

1684
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.000
This is why people help out each other.

1685
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.500
You're right. We should help each other.

1686
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.810
There is one more over there.

1687
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.810
Okay.

1688
01:05:21.009 --> 01:05:22.380
We need to carefully plant it.

1689
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.750
We shouldn't ruin someone else's farm.

1690
01:05:26.049 --> 01:05:30.349
Every cabbage is equally precious.

1691
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:34.349
It's just like raising children.

1692
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.159
- Don't you think? - When will you catch up?

1693
01:05:37.219 --> 01:05:39.460
I'll catch up with you if it's meant to be.

1694
01:05:40.429 --> 01:05:41.590
I've come quite far.

1695
01:05:42.259 --> 01:05:43.699
(That's how life is.)

1696
01:05:44.159 --> 01:05:45.730
(Time goes by.)

1697
01:05:46.369 --> 01:05:49.099
It's getting dark now.

1698
01:05:49.099 --> 01:05:51.239
- Yes. - You can stop after that.

1699
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.310
Let's wrap it up for today.

1700
01:05:53.509 --> 01:05:54.909
- Really? - Yes.

1701
01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:55.940
I'd like to keep working.

1702
01:05:56.509 --> 01:05:58.079
- You can go on. - Shall we work all night?

1703
01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.909
- We can. - But it's getting dark.

1704
01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.310
It is.

1705
01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:03.020
Every one of them is precious.

1706
01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.619
Gosh, you did a great job.

1707
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:07.219
- Thank you. - They'll grow well.

1708
01:06:07.219 --> 01:06:08.549
Gosh, my back hurts.

1709
01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.790
I'll raise them well while thinking of you two.

1710
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:14.529
Thank you.

1711
01:06:14.529 --> 01:06:15.529
(Upset)

1712
01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:17.259
- Good work. - Thank you.

1713
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:19.829
- Let's go to my house. - Thank you.

1714
01:06:20.099 --> 01:06:22.500
I should give you a present.

1715
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.869
- A present? - Really?

1716
01:06:23.869 --> 01:06:25.040
- Should I put it here? - Go ahead.

1717
01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.409
- Let's go. - Okay.

1718
01:06:26.409 --> 01:06:28.840
- Where should I put this? - You can... Goodness.

1719
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.210
- Goodness. - Oh, gosh.

1720
01:06:30.579 --> 01:06:31.579
That was close.

1721
01:06:31.579 --> 01:06:32.909
Gosh, sir.

1722
01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.579
Why did you push me?

1723
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:35.880
I...

1724
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880
(Inner peace)

1725
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:38.150
Sir.

1726
01:06:38.849 --> 01:06:40.489
What are you doing? Sir.

1727
01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:41.989
I lost my grip.

1728
01:06:41.989 --> 01:06:43.989
I'll just put it away.

1729
01:06:43.989 --> 01:06:45.489
- I'll do it. - No, give it to me.

1730
01:06:45.489 --> 01:06:48.259
- I'll do it. - You've worked too hard.

1731
01:06:48.259 --> 01:06:50.630
- Let me do it. - I'll pour this on you.

1732
01:06:50.699 --> 01:06:52.630
- You won't do anything? - Let's go. I won't.

1733
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:54.570
She was on "Invincible Youth",

1734
01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:56.099
and she became a good worker.

1735
01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.869
- You're right. - This is nothing.

1736
01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:00.110
I was the most hardworking one back then.

1737
01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:01.110
That's right.

1738
01:07:02.179 --> 01:07:04.139
You have such a pretty house.

1739
01:07:04.139 --> 01:07:05.579
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1740
01:07:05.579 --> 01:07:07.679
- Hello? - This is...

1741
01:07:07.679 --> 01:07:09.480
- Hello. - Welcome.

1742
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.449
Hello, Beautiful.

1743
01:07:11.779 --> 01:07:13.219
What's your name?

1744
01:07:13.219 --> 01:07:14.520
Lee Da Ye.

1745
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.520
Lee Da Ye? Do you know who I am?

1746
01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.590
My name is Kim Joon Ho.

1747
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.630
Da Ye.

1748
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.029
What's that?

1749
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:25.670
That's liquor, and this is flower tea.

1750
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:28.630
- Flower tea? - Yes, that's liquor.

1751
01:07:30.199 --> 01:07:31.570
(A cup of flower tea after hard work)

1752
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:33.310
- Please sit down. - Flower tea?

1753
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.440
Yes.

1754
01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:35.840
- It's so pretty. - You all worked so hard.

1755
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.840
- Thank you. - Cheers.

1756
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.710
I hope your cabbage farming goes well.

1757
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:40.710
Please call us.

1758
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:42.750
Yes, we'll send you some.

1759
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.219
Da Ye, is something worrying you?

1760
01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:47.219
- Look at her. - You look worried.

1761
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.690
Da Ye.

1762
01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.020
She's sitting like me.

1763
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.230
Who do you like better, your mom or dad?

1764
01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:54.730
- I'll take you with me. - She says be quiet.

1765
01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:55.900
- Quiet? - She says stop talking.

1766
01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900
(Stop talking.)

1767
01:07:57.529 --> 01:08:01.829
Narsha, I made ginseng wine for you before.

1768
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:03.369
- Ginseng wine? - Yes.

1769
01:08:03.369 --> 01:08:05.710
You've kept it for over seven years.

1770
01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.310
That's amazing.

1771
01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:08.940
It still looks fresh.

1772
01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.410
- Here. - Oh, my.

1773
01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:13.310
- Really? - Let's have a ceremony.

1774
01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:16.419
(It's bright and shiny.)

1775
01:08:16.419 --> 01:08:17.679
Please stand next to her.

1776
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120
(It's a precious gift...)

1777
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.249
(that represents unchanging heart.)

1778
01:08:21.249 --> 01:08:22.990
- Thank you. - Sure.

1779
01:08:23.219 --> 01:08:26.389
I feel bad that I'm giving it to her only.

1780
01:08:26.389 --> 01:08:27.730
- I'll give you one too. - No.

1781
01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:30.429
- Chinese knotweed wine. - Gosh.

1782
01:08:30.429 --> 01:08:32.070
- This is the one. - What's that?

1783
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:33.129
Chinese knotweed wine.

1784
01:08:33.129 --> 01:08:35.400
- It's good for men. - What's that?

1785
01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.299
Yes, it's made with Chinese knotweed.

1786
01:08:37.299 --> 01:08:38.910
- Is it okay to take it? - Yes.

1787
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:40.469
I didn't really do much work.

1788
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:42.839
You did work hard.

1789
01:08:42.839 --> 01:08:44.209
(We still should celebrate.)

1790
01:08:45.879 --> 01:08:48.580
I'll consider it as the World Cup Trophy.

1791
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.919
Joon Ho, we're so lucky.

1792
01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:52.320
- We really are. - Right?

1793
01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.690
We're doing so great.

1794
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.919
Thank you so much for this.

1795
01:08:55.919 --> 01:08:57.259
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1796
01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:59.759
- Bye, Da Ye. - Say goodbye.

1797
01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:00.789
See you later, Da Ye.

1798
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:02.330
Say goodbye to him too.

1799
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:03.530
Bye, Joon Ho.

1800
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.530
- She's adorable. - We'll get going then.

1801
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:08.669
(Still no news from those who went to the market)

1802
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.700
One Night Two Days is so fun.

1803
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.240
- Tae Hyun. - It's a great show.

1804
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.509
- It is. - It's so fun.

1805
01:09:13.509 --> 01:09:14.709
- It really is. - Right.

1806
01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.209
Where should we go now? Internet cafe?

1807
01:09:16.209 --> 01:09:17.310
(Splurging made them happy.)

1808
01:09:18.179 --> 01:09:20.080
Where is it?

1809
01:09:20.179 --> 01:09:21.950
We can ask young people.

1810
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:25.419
Where is the arcade?

1811
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:27.049
Where is it?

1812
01:09:27.919 --> 01:09:29.919
- This way? - Turn and go straight.

1813
01:09:29.919 --> 01:09:31.520
- Is it far? - It's over there.

1814
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.629
It's not that far.

1815
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:34.429
We go this way.

1816
01:09:34.429 --> 01:09:35.730
- To an arcade? - Yes.

1817
01:09:36.299 --> 01:09:38.560
We should go if you want to go.

1818
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:40.330
Thank you.

1819
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:43.240
- Have you done it before? - What?

1820
01:09:43.799 --> 01:09:45.270
- Shopping like this. - No.

1821
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:46.509
- No? - No.

1822
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:50.139
- It's special. - It's very special.

1823
01:09:50.139 --> 01:09:52.780
- That's incredible. - Go outside.

1824
01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.780
Go.

1825
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:55.419
Go.

1826
01:09:55.749 --> 01:09:58.150
(They head to the arcade.)

1827
01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.950
- You're pretty. - You are too.

1828
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:03.389
(She's popular among girls.)

1829
01:10:04.919 --> 01:10:06.289
- Is this it? - Here we are.

1830
01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:07.360
Wait for me.

1831
01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:09.799
- There's a claw machine. - You can take photos.

1832
01:10:09.799 --> 01:10:10.799
Sticker photos?

1833
01:10:10.799 --> 01:10:11.799
(There's a lot that they want to do.)

1834
01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:13.469
(They're very excited.)

1835
01:10:13.469 --> 01:10:15.770
- It's been a long time. - This is great.

1836
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:16.799
It's great.

1837
01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:20.339
(They enter the arcade.)

1838
01:10:20.339 --> 01:10:21.410
Are there claw machines?

1839
01:10:22.539 --> 01:10:23.740
(They're impressed.)

1840
01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:25.910
This is amazing.

1841
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:27.879
There are other kinds.

1842
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:30.349
- What? - What are they?

1843
01:10:30.349 --> 01:10:32.190
This one is cute.

1844
01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:33.849
- You should buy it. - Right.

1845
01:10:33.849 --> 01:10:34.919
I want this one.

1846
01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:36.060
(Will she buy it with a blank check?)

1847
01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.520
- Get this one. - The blue one?

1848
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.620
No.

1849
01:10:38.929 --> 01:10:40.490
- No. - That's the one.

1850
01:10:40.759 --> 01:10:41.830
(What's going on?)

1851
01:10:42.499 --> 01:10:44.700
(She lowers the claw.)

1852
01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.400
I didn't push the button.

1853
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.469
It's okay. Do it again.

1854
01:10:47.469 --> 01:10:49.240
We have money.

1855
01:10:49.599 --> 01:10:50.740
(She's sad.)

1856
01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:51.799
Is it a dollar for a try?

1857
01:10:52.169 --> 01:10:55.169
Since you're lucky today, you'll make it.

1858
01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.539
I'm bad with claw machines.

1859
01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.980
Choose one.

1860
01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.179
(She tries again immediately.)

1861
01:11:01.179 --> 01:11:02.650
I can do it with one more try.

1862
01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.580
Try to roll it.

1863
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.089
That's not it.

1864
01:11:07.749 --> 01:11:08.889
- You got it. - I got it.

1865
01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:10.959
- I got it. - She failed.

1866
01:11:10.959 --> 01:11:11.959
Why can't you do it?

1867
01:11:14.129 --> 01:11:15.129
Grab one.

1868
01:11:15.129 --> 01:11:16.129
(She fails again.)

1869
01:11:16.129 --> 01:11:17.759
You failed.

1870
01:11:17.759 --> 01:11:18.770
(She's disappointed.)

1871
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.599
- She can't do it. - Chae Yeon.

1872
01:11:20.599 --> 01:11:21.669
Why can't she do it?

1873
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.339
- It's impossible. - She gave up.

1874
01:11:23.539 --> 01:11:25.910
Try something that's possible.

1875
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:27.870
- This is so much fun. - Why can't you do it?

1876
01:11:28.539 --> 01:11:29.709
(He stares at it.)

1877
01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.450
Let's try something else.

1878
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:33.450
Are you good at it?

1879
01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:36.219
- I can do it. - She's good.

1880
01:11:36.679 --> 01:11:38.789
- Can you get this? - I have many at home.

1881
01:11:38.789 --> 01:11:39.820
Really?

1882
01:11:39.919 --> 01:11:42.520
Stop joking around.

1883
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.690
Can you do it?

1884
01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:45.259
- What's your name? - Lee Ji Eun.

1885
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.990
Are you a girl?

1886
01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:49.799
I'm sorry.

1887
01:11:50.299 --> 01:11:51.459
Can you get this, Ji Eun?

1888
01:11:51.459 --> 01:11:52.530
(Chae Yeon couldn't get it.)

1889
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:53.570
I can get it.

1890
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.230
(Really?)

1891
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.139
(She boldly moves the claw.)

1892
01:11:59.139 --> 01:12:00.169
What is it?

1893
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:01.209
(Will she get it?)

1894
01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:02.209
Is she an expert?

1895
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.310
(She isn't an expert.)

1896
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.749
(You said that you're confident.)

1897
01:12:06.749 --> 01:12:08.919
In how many attempts can you succeed?

1898
01:12:09.249 --> 01:12:10.450
I need three dollars.

1899
01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:11.450
Three dollars?

1900
01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:13.520
Are you good at it?

1901
01:12:13.589 --> 01:12:15.620
What if you don't win?

1902
01:12:15.889 --> 01:12:17.419
The way she moves is different.

1903
01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.129
- She's good at it. - Right.

1904
01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:22.160
My goodness.

1905
01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.599
- She's good at it. - Right.

1906
01:12:24.599 --> 01:12:27.700
(She was so close to winning the toy.)

1907
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:29.770
You can do it.

1908
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:31.299
Is one more try enough?

1909
01:12:32.009 --> 01:12:33.070
I trust you.

1910
01:12:34.209 --> 01:12:36.110
There she goes.

1911
01:12:36.209 --> 01:12:38.039
(The compliment makes the claw dance.)

1912
01:12:38.039 --> 01:12:39.679
What are you doing?

1913
01:12:40.249 --> 01:12:41.709
(Everyone is focused.)

1914
01:12:43.219 --> 01:12:44.719
What are you doing?

1915
01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.950
(Will she win this time?)

1916
01:12:48.759 --> 01:12:50.719
(She fails again.)

1917
01:12:50.719 --> 01:12:52.629
It doesn't work.

1918
01:12:53.459 --> 01:12:54.990
What will you do about three dollars?

1919
01:12:55.599 --> 01:12:57.400
- I'm good with that. - With what?

1920
01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.230
- The one with hearts. - Hearts?

1921
01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:00.370
(He's gullible.)

1922
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.440
- It's this one. - My goodness.

1923
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.139
Are you sure? Which one is it?

1924
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:09.679
I think she will take a lot of money from you.

1925
01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:10.940
Are you sure?

1926
01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.549
- Is it this one? - I can do well.

1927
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:16.450
- Please succeed, Ji Eun. - I can do it.

1928
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:18.179
Come on, Ji Eun.

1929
01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:20.749
Shall we play this one?

1930
01:13:20.749 --> 01:13:22.060
(Gyeong Ree notices a punching machine.)

1931
01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:23.060
- This one? - Yes.

1932
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.459
- Let's take turns. - You and me?

1933
01:13:25.459 --> 01:13:27.089
- Yes. - Really?

1934
01:13:27.089 --> 01:13:28.129
(It's a chance to show his strength.)

1935
01:13:28.129 --> 01:13:29.160
Okay.

1936
01:13:31.099 --> 01:13:32.129
(Gyeong Ree starts first.)

1937
01:13:32.129 --> 01:13:34.469
- It hurts. - I told you that it does.

1938
01:13:34.599 --> 01:13:38.200
What's the score? It's 679. Look, Chae Yeon.

1939
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:40.639
What is it?

1940
01:13:40.639 --> 01:13:42.110
- Do you want to punch? - Sure.

1941
01:13:42.379 --> 01:13:43.379
It's the last.

1942
01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:47.450
(Her score is 598.)

1943
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:48.480
I'm stronger.

1944
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.419
- What if it breaks? - I don't think so.

1945
01:13:50.419 --> 01:13:51.950
- Gosh. - 5, 4,

1946
01:13:52.289 --> 01:13:53.450
- 3... - 3...

1947
01:13:55.759 --> 01:13:57.690
You're a real man.

1948
01:13:57.690 --> 01:13:58.990
(That was unexpected.)

1949
01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:02.160
The machine might break.

1950
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.459
- Come on. - Let's go, Defconn.

1951
01:14:04.459 --> 01:14:05.469
(He prepares himself.)

1952
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.929
That's good.

1953
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:11.700
(His punch is strong due to his weight.)

1954
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:13.770
It's 934.

1955
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:16.580
- You punched hard. - Do it again.

1956
01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:17.580
Really?

1957
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:21.980
(What are the other two up to?)

1958
01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.580
Let's do it.

1959
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.049
We came this far. Get one.

1960
01:14:27.249 --> 01:14:30.160
(She hasn't won anything.)

1961
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.520
Shall I use my own money?

1962
01:14:32.389 --> 01:14:34.660
(She's willing to spend her own money.)

1963
01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.099
Goodness.

1964
01:14:36.099 --> 01:14:37.360
I'll succeed no matter what.

1965
01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:39.629
Really?

1966
01:14:40.929 --> 01:14:41.929
I only have two dollars.

1967
01:14:41.929 --> 01:14:43.440
(She spends everything that she has.)

1968
01:14:43.799 --> 01:14:47.070
Try it with your own money.

1969
01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:48.370
(She spends all her money.)

1970
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:51.879
You weren't desperate since it wasn't yours.

1971
01:14:53.249 --> 01:14:55.249
(Will she win?)

1972
01:15:04.219 --> 01:15:05.289
Sir?

1973
01:15:05.289 --> 01:15:06.360
Sir?

1974
01:15:06.789 --> 01:15:08.330
(I spent all that I have.)

1975
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:09.700
- Sir? - Are you sure?

1976
01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.629
- I can do it. - Let's do it.

1977
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:14.700
You should get at least one.

1978
01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.900
Take your time.

1979
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:20.339
(I told you to take your time.)

1980
01:15:20.339 --> 01:15:22.280
Be more careful, Ji Eun.

1981
01:15:22.539 --> 01:15:23.610
I'm being very careful.

1982
01:15:24.339 --> 01:15:27.209
It should flip. I got it this time.

1983
01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.280
- I got it this time. - Really?

1984
01:15:34.849 --> 01:15:37.219
My goodness, I can really do it.

1985
01:15:37.789 --> 01:15:40.190
Do you have any money?

1986
01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.929
(Laughing)

1987
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:46.730
I'll pay you back.

1988
01:15:48.469 --> 01:15:49.599
Do you have any money?

1989
01:15:50.999 --> 01:15:52.070
I'll get it no matter what.

1990
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:53.639
(She's determined to win.)

1991
01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.639
Get that one.

1992
01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:58.209
(It's her last attempt.)

1993
01:16:05.349 --> 01:16:06.419
(She's overwhelmed.)

1994
01:16:08.419 --> 01:16:10.259
Let's take a photo.

1995
01:16:10.259 --> 01:16:11.490
Take a photo of us.

1996
01:16:11.959 --> 01:16:14.589
Ji Eun, you spent about 12 dollars.

1997
01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:17.259
Where's the camera?

1998
01:16:17.999 --> 01:16:20.429
(Let's stop squandering.)

1999
01:16:21.129 --> 01:16:22.139
Thank you.

2000
01:16:23.099 --> 01:16:24.999
Here's your money back.

2001
01:16:24.999 --> 01:16:28.980
(He gives back her allowance.)

2002
01:16:30.009 --> 01:16:31.280
There it is.

2003
01:16:31.639 --> 01:16:32.679
Will you play?

2004
01:16:32.879 --> 01:16:34.179
I can't play.

2005
01:16:34.179 --> 01:16:37.020
- Let's take photos. - How do I do it?

2006
01:16:37.249 --> 01:16:38.249
Sticker photos.

2007
01:16:38.349 --> 01:16:40.249
- Sticker photos? - You can have it.

2008
01:16:40.249 --> 01:16:41.849
- Sticker photos? - Yes.

2009
01:16:41.849 --> 01:16:43.959
You can keep it. It's okay.

2010
01:16:44.459 --> 01:16:46.330
(Happy)

2011
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.799
Sticker photos are so funny.

2012
01:16:50.799 --> 01:16:52.070
(They haven't taken them in a long time.)

2013
01:16:53.169 --> 01:16:54.270
Let's pick this.

2014
01:16:55.169 --> 01:16:56.240
(The background screen falls.)

2015
01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.669
- What is it? - Choose the general.

2016
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:58.910
Look at this.

2017
01:16:58.910 --> 01:17:00.639
What's going on?

2018
01:17:00.639 --> 01:17:01.740
What is it?

2019
01:17:02.179 --> 01:17:03.679
The white background is pretty.

2020
01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:04.780
- White? - White.

2021
01:17:04.879 --> 01:17:06.980
There's white and yellow.

2022
01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.379
(He's amused.)

2023
01:17:08.379 --> 01:17:09.450
It's ready.

2024
01:17:12.789 --> 01:17:14.219
That's great.

2025
01:17:14.219 --> 01:17:16.990
(The old members experience a new culture.)

2026
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:21.330
(Dance Dance Revolution is the finale.)

2027
01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:22.400
Ha Ra's song?

2028
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:23.959
Ha Ra is here.

2029
01:17:23.959 --> 01:17:25.230
- Ha Ra? - Pick a song by Kara.

2030
01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:26.230
Yes.

2031
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:29.339
Will you play in normal setting?

2032
01:17:29.339 --> 01:17:30.999
- Advanced. - Normal.

2033
01:17:30.999 --> 01:17:32.110
Normal.

2034
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:33.139
- Normal is good. - Go back.

2035
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.740
(They start at the normal level.)

2036
01:17:39.379 --> 01:17:41.280
- Come on, idol singer. - Goodness.

2037
01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.549
Come on, idol singer.

2038
01:17:43.549 --> 01:17:44.980
(She slips from the start.)

2039
01:17:46.049 --> 01:17:47.719
- You can't do it? - It's easy.

2040
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.190
Chae Yeon.

2041
01:17:49.759 --> 01:17:50.990
What are you doing?

2042
01:17:51.919 --> 01:17:53.759
Chae Yeon.

2043
01:17:53.759 --> 01:17:55.429
(She's about to lose.)

2044
01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:58.560
- Joon Young is good. - He's good at everything.

2045
01:17:59.570 --> 01:18:02.169
(She feels humiliated.)

2046
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.539
- It's by Kara. - Where is it?

2047
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.179
(Her feet seem lost.)

2048
01:18:11.179 --> 01:18:13.249
(She steps outside the platform.)

2049
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:16.080
- Gosh. - What's going on?

2050
01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.320
(She steps randomly.)

2051
01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.990
Come on, Chae Yeon.

2052
01:18:19.889 --> 01:18:22.060
(She is clumsy but still charming.)

2053
01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:25.219
(They barely finish the round.)

2054
01:18:25.219 --> 01:18:26.360
Good job.

2055
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:28.289
What did you do, Chae Yeon?

2056
01:18:28.289 --> 01:18:29.330
(Embarrassed)

2057
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:30.799
Let's go.

2058
01:18:30.799 --> 01:18:32.799
- All right. - Here we go.

2059
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:36.469
(Meanwhile at the village hall,)

2060
01:18:36.469 --> 01:18:37.669
(it's dinner time for the staff.)

2061
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:38.740
(He takes a look.)

2062
01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:39.870
(Goodness)

2063
01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.810
(She waits for her chance to eat.)

2064
01:18:44.009 --> 01:18:46.849
Today's side dishes are my favorite.

2065
01:18:46.849 --> 01:18:47.849
Really?

2066
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.620
I love them very much. Can you give me some?

2067
01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:54.690
I could give you. Do you want some?

2068
01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.259
Yes.

2069
01:18:56.589 --> 01:18:58.419
May I take one bite?

2070
01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.060
She can take one bite.

2071
01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:04.200
- Please, ma'am. - Do you hear that?

2072
01:19:04.499 --> 01:19:05.830
(She's not allowed.)

2073
01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:08.499
I want some tteokbokki.

2074
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:10.499
I'll give you one.

2075
01:19:10.499 --> 01:19:12.570
- Do you want some? - Yes.

2076
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:14.139
(The lady is sympathetic.)

2077
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.950
Even your mouth looks pretty.

2078
01:19:19.549 --> 01:19:20.679
(She ate it.)

2079
01:19:21.249 --> 01:19:22.320
(Don't tell anyone.)

2080
01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.480
Do you want some more?

2081
01:19:23.849 --> 01:19:24.879
Eat some more.

2082
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.089
Let me eat just this one.

2083
01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.020
- Just this one? - Yes, just this one.

2084
01:19:32.959 --> 01:19:34.030
(Laughing)

2085
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:36.999
I need to be quick.

2086
01:19:36.999 --> 01:19:38.499
You're right. Eat quickly.

2087
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:41.870
Joon Ho is coming. Joon Ho is coming.

2088
01:19:42.599 --> 01:19:43.940
(She quickly eats the food.)

2089
01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:45.070
Thank you.

2090
01:19:46.639 --> 01:19:47.709
(What's going on?)

2091
01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:49.940
(She pretends as if nothing happened.)

2092
01:19:51.509 --> 01:19:52.910
(She joins the staff and sits next to them.)

2093
01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.719
(Joon Ho shows up.)

2094
01:20:01.889 --> 01:20:03.759
(I got you.)

2095
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.730
Ms. Koo.

2096
01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.860
Food truck, staff's dinner,

2097
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.499
and Koo Ha Ra.

2098
01:20:11.959 --> 01:20:14.330
All right. I got her.

2099
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:17.639
I just filmed the scene where she was cheating.

2100
01:20:17.639 --> 01:20:19.509
- Hang on a second. - Spotted at the scene.

2101
01:20:19.509 --> 01:20:20.910
What are you doing?

2102
01:20:21.209 --> 01:20:22.810
It's over.

2103
01:20:23.009 --> 01:20:24.810
- Where's Jong Min? - Wait.

2104
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:28.450
- Let's make a deal. - A deal?

2105
01:20:29.179 --> 01:20:31.320
How about you eat a piece too and delete it?

2106
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.320
I eat too?

2107
01:20:33.349 --> 01:20:35.620
This kind of deals have fooled me many times.

2108
01:20:35.759 --> 01:20:37.860
- It's really tasty. - What is tasty?

2109
01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.259
- Suyuk. Bossam. - All right.

2110
01:20:39.259 --> 01:20:40.530
Let's go have a look.

2111
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:43.900
What did you eat?

2112
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.330
- Bossam and... - Bossam and...

2113
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:49.270
- a piece of tteokbokki. - a piece of tteokbokki?

2114
01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.270
All right. She just admitted.

2115
01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:55.110
She just confessed what she did.

2116
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:57.080
Sweet.

2117
01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.080
(Frustrated)

2118
01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.209
If things...

2119
01:20:59.849 --> 01:21:02.480
go bad for us, I will spread the video.

2120
01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.379
Be careful.

2121
01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.389
Why on earth did the staff let her eat?

2122
01:21:07.389 --> 01:21:10.320
My goodness. That guy is the problem.

2123
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.490
I didn't give it to her.

2124
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:13.429
The lady at the food truck did.

2125
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.530
I didn't eat it with my own hand.

2126
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:17.030
It was the lady at the food truck.

2127
01:21:17.129 --> 01:21:18.230
Ma'am, did you give the food to her?

2128
01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.230
Since she's a customer...

2129
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:22.299
Did you feed her?

2130
01:21:22.299 --> 01:21:24.240
(Did you feed her yourself?)

2131
01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.910
Both of you should get a penalty later.

2132
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:29.379
- I get a penalty? - Yes, you will be...

2133
01:21:29.379 --> 01:21:31.310
the first to get a penalty as a food truck lady.

2134
01:21:31.339 --> 01:21:32.580
Things should be fair.

2135
01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:33.950
See you later.

2136
01:21:34.549 --> 01:21:36.980
Now that I have the video,

2137
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.419
you'd better behave yourself in front of me.

2138
01:21:39.589 --> 01:21:41.349
- Joon Ho. - Yes. I made it.

2139
01:21:42.459 --> 01:21:44.660
(I finally did something.)

2140
01:21:45.429 --> 01:21:46.459
(Next week)

2141
01:21:46.929 --> 01:21:47.959
(Don't try to be funny. Take it seriously.)

2142
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:52.200
(But their bodies don't bring us down.)

2143
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:55.599
(They start to feel the pressure of the penalty.)

2144
01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:58.299
(He makes a loud noise.)

2145
01:21:59.570 --> 01:22:01.410
(They don't care about their image anymore.)

2146
01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.450
(They become competitive for their partners.)

2147
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:09.679
(The girls don't even mind doing a slapstick comedy.)

2148
01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:13.990
(Could the girls keep them from sleeping outdoors?)

2149
01:22:14.919 --> 01:22:15.990
(And!)

2150
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:18.860
(There's something one must do on this show.)

2151
01:22:19.389 --> 01:22:20.490
(It's the morning dip.)

2152
01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:23.360
(See you next week.)

2153

(20 years of friendship)

2154
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.700
(Let's run away from home.)

2155
01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.440
(An immature and fun journey...)

2156
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.440
(of 42-year-old friends.)

2157
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:41.310
(We might be immature but we have dreams!)

2158
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:44.480
(To be honest, we have never had a fight.)

2159
01:22:45.049 --> 01:22:46.589
(When they're together, they fear nothing.)
