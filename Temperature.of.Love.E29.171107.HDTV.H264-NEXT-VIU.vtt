00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.829
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:09.629
Do you think it's just fun and games for me?

3
00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.539
Why do you only think about yourself?

4
00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:27.419
I don't only think about myself.

5
00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.390
When I ask where you are, just tell me.

6
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.620
Do you think I ask you that just to hear where you are?

7
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.889
I don't care if I drown or freeze to death with you.

8
00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:38.230
That's why I asked if we could live together, but you said no.

9
00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:42.270
I'm willing to enter your life and share your pain.

10
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.470
But why are you pushing me away?

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.309
I told you that I have family issues and that they're not easy to handle.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.279
Do you think our family doesn't have any issues?

13
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.410
Every family has issues of their own.

14
00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.379
It may have been hard for you, but it might not be so for me.

15
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.940
My mom and dad...

16
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.979
had trouble having a baby for a long time even after they got married.

17
00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.239
Because of that, their parents were apparently very worried.

18
00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.179
Then they had me.

19
00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.989
That's why they always expected a lot from me ever since I was young.

20
00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.160
How can I tell her my parents got married because they had me?

21
00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:42.530
My parents thought...

22
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.300
it was very important to raise us into becoming independent.

23
00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.140
They were so in love that they cared less about their children.

24
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.739
That used to upset me when I was young.

25
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.649
My mom thinks the person who is able to give is the strong one.

26
00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.080
So she gives gifts to everyone around her.

27
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.119
Aren't you tired?

28
00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.119
Should I get off?

29
00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.390
No, I'm not tired.

30
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.929
When I talked to him about my family,

31
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.830
all he said to me was,

32
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.429
"I'm not tired."

33
00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:28.540
(Temperature of Love)

34
00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.290
Why did you wash your hair at night?

35
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.159
I felt frustrated.

36
00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.059
This is why I don't date.

37
00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:52.559
Give it to me.

38
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.399
I'm emotionally exhausted just by watching you.

39
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.339
I'm going to work until dawn.

40
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.980
I have a meeting with Joon Ha tomorrow.

41
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.010
Living life like Hong Ah might actually be the best thing.

42
00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.619
I haven't heard from her lately. How is she doing?

43
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.360
She's not meeting anyone these days.

44
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.059
She lives off the joy of having a lot of social network followers.

45
00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.080
(Trying to meet the deadline, Pulling an all-nighter)

46
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.580
(Working hard, Miniseries debut, Love does not exist.)

47
00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.649
Your photos are pretty. Let's follow each other.

48
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.089
You thought I'd miss you guys, didn't you?

49
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.219
I only treated them with love.

50
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.839
Why didn't you go home yet?

51
00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.739
I thought I should do the little things to be blessed.

52
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.809
Let's calculate how much money we'll need for the restaurant.

53
00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.409
We have two million dollars of deposit for the building.

54
00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.649
But we can't use that money because that's the key money.

55
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.750
It'd be great if I could help out at times like this.

56
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.549
Where would you get the money? Your family let you go.

57
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.219
That won't last forever. They'll take me back in eventually.

58
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.990
Of course, I should already be successful by then.

59
00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.200
Then let's say we don't earn any money for a while.

60
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.459
How much would we need to maintain the restaurant for about six months?

61
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.630
Around two million dollars.

62
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.899
That's a lot of money.

63
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.700
How much money did you borrow?

64
00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.539
I was able to get an adequate amount since it's in Pangyo.

65
00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.370
But I need to pay back money for something else.

66
00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:42.870
What?

67
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.839
My mom's debt.

68
00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.289
I was surprised to get a call from you saying that you want to meet.

69
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.190
Of course, I'm sure it's because you have something to say to me.

70
00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.229
Here.

71
00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.370
That's the list of contributions I got from Mr. Park.

72
00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.099
You don't need to pay him back.

73
00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:15.310
He did that because he likes my drawings.

74
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.909
I'll go now.

75
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.649
What a surprise to see you.

76
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.020
Come inside.

77
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.469
- Drink up. - I met up with Professor Min.

78
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.669
Why?

79
00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.200
Because I didn't think you would've told me the exact amount.

80
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.240
I need to know exactly how much you owe.

81
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.409
My gosh, you're so fastidious.

82
00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.240
It's natural for friends to help one another.

83
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.779
You can always pay him back.

84
00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.419
You're a very promising chef.

85
00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.279
Why do you think Mr. Park invested in you?

86
00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.520
He invested in you because he knew you were worth it.

87
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.959
He would never listen to me when I told him to buy Daniel's work.

88
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.060
That means it wasn't a contribution.

89
00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.200
A contribution is made when someone sees artistic value in that artist.

90
00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.729
I came to talk about how we should settle things.

91
00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:17.299
You said you got yourself in debt because I didn't give you any money.

92
00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:18.700
How much do you need a month?

93
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.740
Are you going to give me money?

94
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.380
Let me hear how much first.

95
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.549
The jjajangmyun here is really tasty.

96
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.649
Are you buying today?

97
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.159
You really like eating free food.

98
00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:41.690
Kyung hates free stuff.

99
00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:45.260
I'm really glad I became friends with you.

100
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.529
What does that mean?

101
00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.370
She knows what kind of person I am.

102
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.200
You've known me for quite some time, but you don't know me at all.

103
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.010
You're so shallow.

104
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.209
Hurry up and eat. Aren't you going to Good Soup today?

105
00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:59.209
You said that place is full of young, handsome chefs.

106
00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:00.849
It's their day off today.

107
00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:02.380
My gosh.

108
00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:05.250
- Aren't you going to go on a date? - "A date"?

109
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.750
I said I'm going to work really hard.

110
00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.589
But I should go do an interview.

111
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.419
- "Kill 2 birds with 1 stone". - "Light 2 candles with 1 flame".

112
00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:45.789
(Hyun Soo)

113
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.899
It's me.

114
00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:52.159
Where are you?

115
00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.500
I'm here to see Jung Woo.

116
00:07:55.299 --> 00:07:56.370
I see.

117
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.539
Will you be a while?

118
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.810
I need to interview Chef On.

119
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.810
It won't take long. I'll see you at Good Soup.

120
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.510
Okay.

121
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.820
Chef On is here, sir.

122
00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:23.529
Please bring us tea.

123
00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:24.959
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.430
Have a seat.

125
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.210
I'll make it short since you're busy.

126
00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:41.850
I calculated what my mom owes you.

127
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.049
Including the amount you donated to Professor Min.

128
00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:49.750
But I can't pay you back all at once,

129
00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:51.360
so I want to make monthly installments.

130
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.059
What if I say no?

131
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.029
If you say no...

132
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:02.399
Tell me what you want. I'll do as much as I can.

133
00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:08.439
Claim-obligation relationship lasts longer...

134
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.579
than a love relationship.

135
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.409
Let's go long term.

136
00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:17.120
Thank you.

137
00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:21.419
I should be thankful.

138
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.199
(Father)

139
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.140
Hello.

140
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.549
I need to see you. I'm on my way.

141
00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:06.100
Something important came up. Let's postpone the interview.

142
00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:07.699
I'll call you after work.

143
00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:09.470
I'm already here though.

144
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.909
I guess he didn't take his car.

145
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.819
What kind of restaurant closes on Mondays?

146
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.390
I need to prepare things to run the restaurant.

147
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.730
What brings you here?

148
00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:41.069
(A certified copy of real estate register)

149
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.669
What's this?

150
00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:45.069
I told you not to sell that land.

151
00:10:45.439 --> 00:10:46.569
I didn't sell it.

152
00:10:46.569 --> 00:10:47.669
At this rate, you will.

153
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.510
It's my land. I'll take care of it.

154
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.240
The value will go up if you hold on to it.

155
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:52.939
I'm saying this for you.

156
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.220
Am I even in your life?

157
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.049
Of course. You're my son.

158
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.860
Why did you take out a secured loan?

159
00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:07.890
I needed it to run the restaurant.

160
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.029
Then you shouldn't take a day off. Why is your restaurant closed today?

161
00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:13.630
I thought you were something since you were in a magazine,

162
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.870
but I guess what you do only looks good on the outside.

163
00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:17.840
That's why I tried to stop you from cooking.

164
00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:19.740
You should've gotten a professional career.

165
00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:21.840
I asked you to live with me, but you refused.

166
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.380
Your mom ruined you.

167
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.350
I chose Mom because she was the weak one.

168
00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:30.620
How...

169
00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:33.120
can you be so dignified when you made your child...

170
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.350
choose between his mom and dad?

171
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.289
Are you resenting me?

172
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.789
When I followed Mom to France,

173
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.059
there were times when I missed you, but...

174
00:11:44.659 --> 00:11:47.100
because I didn't want to be like you,

175
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.899
I hated myself for missing you.

176
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.600
What's wrong with me?

177
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.279
Why wouldn't you want to be like me?

178
00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:01.049
I've been living a stable, exemplary life.

179
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.649
You abused your wife.

180
00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:07.419
Don't you think you're too ignorant of your life?

181
00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:42.350
Chef? Chef, I'm afraid there has been a complaint.

182
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.159
(Jung Sun)

183
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.600
Are you coming to interview me today?

184
00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:54.899
I'm in the parking lot.

185
00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.500
(I'm in the parking lot.)

186
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.610
Where do you work?

187
00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:04.380
Usually this is my work area. It's called "passe".

188
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.309
Wait. Let me record this.

189
00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:11.079
What is "passe"?

190
00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:13.179
Passe means a path.

191
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.819
This is where a chef does the plating...

192
00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:17.360
and does the final inspection.

193
00:13:17.689 --> 00:13:18.720
What's this?

194
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.390
Heat lamp.

195
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.490
It heats up the food.

196
00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:26.260
Why did you become a chef?

197
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:27.970
My mom's influence.

198
00:13:29.669 --> 00:13:32.669
She was a homemaker until I was 12.

199
00:13:32.939 --> 00:13:35.569
She made everything from bread to cookies at home.

200
00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:38.740
So my friends loved to come over.

201
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:43.149
You said it only took a minute to decide to be a chef.

202
00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:47.120
One day, my mom didn't come home until very late.

203
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:49.449
I was eating alone, and I thought...

204
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.120
"I should become a chef."

205
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.600
Do you want to see the fridge next?

206
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.630
I saw it the other day already.

207
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.000
Rather...

208
00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:09.840
I want to look inside Chef On.

209
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.149
A person's occupation reveals a lot about that person.

210
00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:16.819
I need to do that to illustrate the main character.

211
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.189
Wasn't your dad against you becoming a chef?

212
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.590
He was.

213
00:14:29.429 --> 00:14:31.500
But his objection didn't stop me.

214
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.340
What else should I show you?

215
00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:48.909
A chef-owner cooks and runs a restaurant too.

216
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:51.079
What's the hardest thing?

217
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.289
Paying the employees on time.

218
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.090
Depending on whether I do or not,

219
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.760
they live or they don't.

220
00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:02.029
Did you pay them on time this month?

221
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:03.399
Yes, I did.

222
00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:07.000
With the secured loan you took out?

223
00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:10.240
Won Joon told you too much.

224
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.970
You don't need to be concerned.

225
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:14.640
Other than money, is there anything that troubles you?

226
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.909
Of course there is.

227
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.010
Your mother?

228
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.020
I don't want to talk about my mom.

229
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.620
I'm thinking how much longer I should hold back.

230
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.319
"I can't hold back any longer."

231
00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:36.260
Isn't that what you're saying now?

232
00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:39.760
I've been waiting.

233
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.270
You got angry at me for seeing your mother.

234
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.640
I was upset then.

235
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.340
I let it go because it seemed like you didn't like it.

236
00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:53.909
I'm walking on thin ice.

237
00:15:55.549 --> 00:15:59.520
When will you allow me to be in your life?

238
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.890
You're already in my life.

239
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.220
Then why I don't I feel that way?

240
00:16:05.789 --> 00:16:08.490
I allowed you to be in my life.

241
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.500
I cried, yelled, and showed you everything.

242
00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:13.630
Have you ever cried in front of me?

243
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.069
Don't cry alone.

244
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.039
Crying alone means you aren't letting me in your life.

245
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.179
I need to know exactly what pains you,

246
00:16:25.409 --> 00:16:28.010
so I could love you and understand you more deeply.

247
00:16:28.909 --> 00:16:30.819
Do you want a casual relationship?

248
00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:32.919
Aren't you being too drastic?

249
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.020
I have never shared my pain with someone.

250
00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:39.059
You can't ask me to do that right away.

251
00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:42.230
It isn't right away. There were several chances.

252
00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:44.960
When I asked you to live with me.

253
00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:46.360
When I met your mother.

254
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.630
You don't know...

255
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.140
what the children of messed-up parents are like.

256
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.970
I'll tell you when it's time.

257
00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:00.409
Your mother told me why she got a divorce.

258
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.250
Did you see my mom again? I told you not to.

259
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.920
Why are you getting angry?

260
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:08.490
She told me the last time I met her.

261
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.289
Thinking about my mom makes me angry.

262
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.319
Do you really have to go there?

263
00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.059
Don't you think it's better to end things on a good note?

264
00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:15.589
How is ending things on a good note better?

265
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.900
It's better to answer clearly and put an end to it.

266
00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:27.109
I'll go now.

267
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.779
It's useless and upsetting to talk to someone who refuses to open up.

268
00:17:40.803 --> 00:17:44.035
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E29 Temperature of Love "Let Me In"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

269
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.430
Bring them.

270
00:17:54.629 --> 00:17:57.869
You talk as if that's really easy.

271
00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.270
You worked with them before.

272
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.839
Why would they work with me again just because of that reason?

273
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.579
I thought casting would be easy because you're a famous director.

274
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.680
But I can still cast the ones who aren't...

275
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.910
doing as well as they used to do before.

276
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.020
Come in.

277
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.559
Mr. Park gave you this to eat during your meeting.

278
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.760
What's he doing right now?

279
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.129
Orion came in as number one in a music program, so he's celebrating.

280
00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:26.029
I'll be right back.

281
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.670
Thank you, Mr. Park.

282
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:30.869
- What? - Move over.

283
00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:33.410
Mr. Park, I love you.

284
00:18:33.569 --> 00:18:35.010
- This is all thanks to you. - We'll do our best.

285
00:18:35.369 --> 00:18:37.910
- Good job. - Stick closer to the center.

286
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.279
- Mr. Park. - Hello, Writer Ji.

287
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.480
Congratulations. I heard you came, so I came to congratulate you.

288
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.720
- Thank you. - Thank you.

289
00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:49.389
Can I take a photo with you?

290
00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:50.690
- Yes. - Yes.

291
00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:57.460
Okay.

292
00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.200
In 1, 2, 3.

293
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.599
(On Entertainment's Orion, Casting actors)

294
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.069
(When will I get the perfect actor?)

295
00:19:10.139 --> 00:19:11.309
(I'm enjoying life today again.)

296
00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:15.609
You must like doing social media.

297
00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:19.680
I think it's a waste of time to devote yourself to someone else.

298
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.819
Don't you feel the same way?

299
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.460
We're discussing the organization of your drama with JK.

300
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.190
You're changing the subject.

301
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:30.230
I guess relationships are your weakness.

302
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.629
You're very loyal to your desires. That's your strength.

303
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.670
People will love your work.

304
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.470
Isn't it difficult to see Hyun Soo?

305
00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:41.539
You should just cancel the contract.

306
00:19:43.379 --> 00:19:45.510
It's difficult to find a good writer.

307
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.910
So why would I do that?

308
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.950
I liked Jung Sun for about four years. And now, I don't.

309
00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.650
When I put things to an end,

310
00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:00.529
I realized that my feelings for him weren't sincere.

311
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.760
You should try to do the same.

312
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.329
Then you'll find out.

313
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.039
You'll find out if it was real or fake.

314
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.210
The fact that you can end it is enough to tell that it's fake.

315
00:20:22.309 --> 00:20:23.520
Hyun Soo.

316
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.049
Did something bad happen during the interview?

317
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.020
Didn't you get to meet Chef On?

318
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.690
I met him.

319
00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:34.730
Then why the long face?

320
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.129
I guess your love is about to get deeper.

321
00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:41.970
I wish.

322
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:47.910
(Dad)

323
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.309
Hey, Dad.

324
00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:52.240
Are you busy today?

325
00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.049
Why?

326
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.950
Can you go to the hospital with your mom?

327
00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.020
I have a lot of work to do, so I think I'll finish late.

328
00:21:00.349 --> 00:21:03.660
Your mom can go by herself, but I just feel bad.

329
00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:06.059
Okay, Dad.

330
00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:10.460
I should go back out. I need to take my mom to the hospital.

331
00:21:11.059 --> 00:21:12.329
Is she sick?

332
00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:14.670
She had menopause. Her hormones must be giving her a hard time.

333
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.650
I'm walking on thin ice.

334
00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:33.020
I'm by your side.

335
00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.650
I allowed you to be in my life.

336
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.460
Don't cry alone.

337
00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:41.960
Crying alone means you aren't letting me in your life.

338
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.470
When will you allow me to be in your life?

339
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.039
You're already in my life.

340
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:57.180
There it is. I like this.

341
00:21:57.879 --> 00:21:59.240
What don't you like?

342
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.480
You're right. I like everything.

343
00:22:55.569 --> 00:22:56.599
What's this?

344
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.740
I figured you would've finished them.

345
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.910
(Seowoo Hospital)

346
00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.319
You didn't have to come.

347
00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:47.250
Your dad really overreacts too much.

348
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.720
Ms. Park Mi Na, please come in.

349
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.589
Okay. Let's go.

350
00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:59.099
Since when did you start having bad headaches?

351
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.529
It's been around two months.

352
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.270
It got better whenever I took medicine.

353
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.609
I recently took a CT scan, and the results were fine.

354
00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:09.770
Where and how does it hurt?

355
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.450
I have headaches right here.

356
00:24:14.849 --> 00:24:15.879
Just a moment.

357
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.319
Don't move your chin, and look at my nose.

358
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.389
Please keep looking at my hand.

359
00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:27.889
Down.

360
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.859
Now, I want you to tightly hold my hands.

361
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.500
Tighter.

362
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.740
Okay. Now, let's try the other hand.

363
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.170
Okay, thank you.

364
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.650
I think you'll need to get another checkup.

365
00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.660
(CT Scan Room)

366
00:25:00.889 --> 00:25:02.160
Mom, I'll hold this.

367
00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:07.170
What's wrong with you?

368
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.569
Why are you treating me like a critical patient?

369
00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:12.039
I'll carry my own bag.

370
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.210
My gosh, why are you so sensitive? I was just holding onto your bag.

371
00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:17.910
Didn't you hear the nurse earlier?

372
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.910
"Ms. Park's guardian".

373
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.480
Okay, my guardian.

374
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.379
But I refuse for now.

375
00:25:28.849 --> 00:25:30.789
I don't think you can call yourself his guardian.

376
00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:34.990
Jung Sun's not married yet, so I am his guardian.

377
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.000
I have something to say to you.

378
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.160
Are you really not going to meet me?

379
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.539
Do you know how much Jung Sun likes you?

380
00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:51.839
He grew up with no brothers.

381
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.480
And he wasn't even able to receive any love from his father.

382
00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.879
He rarely leans on others.

383
00:25:58.579 --> 00:26:00.319
But that wasn't the case when he was with you.

384
00:26:01.889 --> 00:26:05.690
I'm pretty sure you understand. You don't seem to have any friends.

385
00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:12.760
Well, I'm just saying that you would've...

386
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.829
stomped on so many others to succeed...

387
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.799
No. What I meant to say is that...

388
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.109
you're a great person.

389
00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:24.480
Must you receive money from Jung Sun?

390
00:26:24.879 --> 00:26:27.450
I'm the one who borrowed it from you, so I'll pay you back.

391
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.049
It may take some time, but I'll pay you back.

392
00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:33.119
I didn't expect you to pay me back when I gave you money.

393
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:34.589
Right?

394
00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:37.559
You're so generous.

395
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.660
But...

396
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.760
I don't intend on stopping him if he wishes to pay me back.

397
00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:44.859
You should stick to your original thought.

398
00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:46.799
Why would you get swayed by what he decides to do?

399
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:48.730
You said you weren't planning on taking back any money.

400
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.369
You must be tired of listening to me.

401
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.180
I'm quick-witted because I lived my life tip-toeing around others.

402
00:26:57.539 --> 00:26:59.839
That's why I'm saying this to you.

403
00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:04.379
I can't bear to see someone give Jung Sun a hard time.

404
00:27:06.849 --> 00:27:08.619
What should I do in order to make you go easy on him?

405
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.089
Should I get down on my knees?

406
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.960
I can get down a hundred times more for Jung Sun.

407
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.660
You're so weird.

408
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:18.029
What do you mean?

409
00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.829
When I sometimes meet you,

410
00:27:22.529 --> 00:27:24.339
I wonder how it would've been...

411
00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:26.539
if my mom were still alive.

412
00:27:26.539 --> 00:27:28.940
I would've been really good friends with her.

413
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.139
You and Jung Sun are close.

414
00:27:31.139 --> 00:27:32.779
So your mother and I would've been close too.

415
00:27:34.849 --> 00:27:37.520
Yes, you should smile like that.

416
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:42.349
I'll be a mother to you since your mother has passed away.

417
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.730
Did you change your mind?

418
00:27:48.089 --> 00:27:49.559
You're smiling, so I'm guessing that you have.

419
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.559
I'm fun, aren't I?

420
00:27:52.829 --> 00:27:54.500
Yes, you're fun.

421
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.740
Do you know how hard it is to be fun?

422
00:27:56.869 --> 00:27:59.339
Let's stay close like family just like how we used to before.

423
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:02.010
Is it because of Hyun Soo?

424
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.279
She's crazy. You should just give up on her.

425
00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.950
I told her everything about me, but she still chose to be with Jung Sun.

426
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.849
She's crazy. How can she think about accepting me?

427
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.359
You may think there's only one love in this world because you're young.

428
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.230
But someone new will come along. This is not the end.

429
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.400
And you can keep meeting new people.

430
00:28:26.829 --> 00:28:29.900
Why are you obsessing over one woman when you're rich?

431
00:28:40.579 --> 00:28:42.049
You have cerebral aneurysm.

432
00:28:43.579 --> 00:28:45.150
"Cerebral aneurysm"?

433
00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:46.379
Yes.

434
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.289
Your blood vessels are inflated like a balloon.

435
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.029
But her last CT scan showed that she was fine.

436
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.129
That's because they weren't inflated back then.

437
00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:05.339
Then what do I need to do?

438
00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:09.470
If your blood vessels burst, it'll damage your brain severely.

439
00:29:10.379 --> 00:29:13.339
You need to receive surgery as soon as possible.

440
00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:15.950
Then please schedule a surgery for her.

441
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.220
But the thing is, it's not that easy.

442

(Seowoo Hospital)

443
00:29:31.529 --> 00:29:32.829
It's okay, Mom.

444
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.299
We fixed a surgery date.

445
00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:37.000
So you can just wait while you take your medicine.

446
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.569
I'm so upset.

447
00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.950
- I'll pick it up. - I'll...

448
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.950
I'll pick it up.

449
00:30:07.869 --> 00:30:10.069
It's okay, Mom.
