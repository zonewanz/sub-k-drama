00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.840
(Episode 19)

2
00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:11.297
Did you see the picture I sent?

3
00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:15.028
He's Lieutenant Han, a very good
friend of Prosecutor Jung.

4
00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.437
Han's former roommate
turned out to be ...

5
00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:19.367
Do Hak Young.

6
00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:22.977
I wished Prosecutor Jung to be
more rational toward this case.

7
00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:26.148
But he set Do Hak Young
free from this case.

8
00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:48.127
- Somebody help!
- Call an ambulance!

9
00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:49.838
- There's blood!
- Step aside!

10
00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:51.638
- Somebody help!
- Someone's hurt!

11
00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:00.047
Let's get just one more drink
to relieve hangover.

12
00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:02.978
Why would you drink more
if you want to relieve hangover?

13
00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:06.147
It's not that. There's a place that
sells really good sundae nearby.

14
00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:10.218
Hey.

15
00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:13.487
What happened?

16
00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:16.157
Plate number 65 C 4390.
We need to find that car.

17
00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:18.868
The driver had a shotgun.

18
00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:04.508
Are you okay?

19
00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:06.008
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:07.578
Goodness.

21
00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:52.927
The patient's bleeding severely, and
the blood pressure is undetectable.

22
00:02:52.927 --> 00:02:54.057
Put the oxygen mask on him.

23
00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:55.598
- Please prepare the equipment.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:10.938
So you were the Chestnut.

25
00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:16.918
Why didn't I recognize you?

26
00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:25.427
I want to tell you something.

27
00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:29.828
Rather than saying I can't forget
the day 13 years ago...

28
00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:32.997
Rather than saying it's great to
see you again...

29
00:03:33.628 --> 00:03:34.767
There is something that I want
to tell you more.

30
00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:39.237
I don't believe in your words.

31
00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:52.318
I am sorry.

32
00:04:01.227 --> 00:04:02.897
Don't die.

33
00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:04.698
Tell me when the wave hits 200.

34
00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:09.967
- It's charged to the full level.
- Step aside.

35
00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:11.938
3, 2, 1. Charge.

36
00:04:13.868 --> 00:04:15.837
I shouldn't have said those
words then.

37
00:04:16.238 --> 00:04:18.178
I have to save and rescue you
if I believe your words.

38
00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:21.178
If I can't, it's going to be all
my fault, and I'll blame myself.

39
00:04:21.207 --> 00:04:22.318
How can I handle all that?

40
00:04:23.477 --> 00:04:24.517
Charge one more time.

41
00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:26.017
Inject him FB1F.

42
00:04:28.388 --> 00:04:29.917
My words must have been
hurtful to you.

43
00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:33.657
You must've blamed yourself
for things you can't even handle.

44
00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:35.157
Can you handle that?

45
00:04:36.857 --> 00:04:37.897
No, I can't.

46
00:04:38.097 --> 00:04:40.167
Step aside. 3, 2, 1. Charge.

47
00:04:42.337 --> 00:04:43.897
I said such mean things to you.

48
00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:45.938
Don't die!

49
00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:47.667
I regret a lot.

50
00:04:56.147 --> 00:04:57.378
If this is the last time,

51
00:04:58.217 --> 00:05:00.448
you would blame yourself
because of me.

52
00:05:01.248 --> 00:05:02.357
I'm worried about you.

53
00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:06.328
You're going to need this later.

54
00:05:08.157 --> 00:05:09.157
Thank you.

55
00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:12.998
Back then,

56
00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:16.298
I should have said nothing and
taken your umbrella.

57
00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:27.977
I can't stand this.

58
00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:30.477
I must say...

59
00:05:32.847 --> 00:05:34.488
sorry to you.

60
00:05:44.897 --> 00:05:45.998
His pulse is back.

61
00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:48.328
We'll take him to the operating
room. Call the anesthesiologist.

62
00:05:48.328 --> 00:05:50.138
- Check the blood pressure.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:18.027
(Episode 19: A boy meets a girl)

64
00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:21.868
Around 9pm, near the intersection
in Hwayang-dong,

65
00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:26.238
a prosecutor was shot by
a 73-year-old man named Mr. Yoo.

66
00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:28.707
The prosecutor
was severely injured...

67
00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:31.707
and sent to the hospital.
He's going through an operation.

68
00:06:32.277 --> 00:06:33.907
- Mr. Yoo is...
- Hong Joo.

69
00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:36.318
known as the professional archer
Yoo Su Kyung's father.

70
00:06:36.618 --> 00:06:40.248
The police said
her father was unhappy...

71
00:06:40.448 --> 00:06:42.058
with the result of investigation
in which the suspect was set free.

72
00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:45.428
This fact drove Yoo Su Kyung's
father to commit such crime.

73
00:06:51.597 --> 00:06:53.027
(Operation Room)

74
00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:09.578
What is taking so long?
It's been over four hours!

75
00:07:09.578 --> 00:07:10.748
You should sit and wait.

76
00:07:11.017 --> 00:07:12.948
The doctor said the surgery
will take long.

77
00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:16.488
This is driving me mad.
What's taking so long?

78
00:07:34.407 --> 00:07:36.407
(Operation Room)

79
00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:43.217
Your brother will get worried
seeing your face.

80
00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:46.618
Sit here and wait.
I'll go get some plasters.

81
00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:06.538
The future might change.

82
00:08:07.038 --> 00:08:09.538
Look at Jae Chan.
He saved both you and me.

83
00:08:09.908 --> 00:08:12.247
If he can change the future,
I can too.

84
00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:14.247
You can't!
You can never change the future.

85
00:08:19.847 --> 00:08:20.847
Hong Joo!

86
00:08:22.658 --> 00:08:23.688
Hong Joo.

87
00:08:26.558 --> 00:08:27.587
Mom.

88
00:08:28.127 --> 00:08:30.097
Hong Joo, are you okay?

89
00:08:30.398 --> 00:08:32.068
Mom, you were right.

90
00:08:35.068 --> 00:08:36.867
I could not change the future.

91
00:08:37.867 --> 00:08:40.137
No, I mean,
I tried changing it,

92
00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:45.678
but I changed it to be worse.

93
00:08:47.377 --> 00:08:49.818
What if something bad
happens to Jae Chan?

94
00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:51.847
What should I do?

95
00:08:52.188 --> 00:08:55.518
If something bad happens to him
like it did to Dad, I can't...

96
00:08:56.188 --> 00:08:58.357
No, don't say such things.

97
00:08:59.487 --> 00:09:01.857
Nothing will happen.
Don't say such things.

98
00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:05.497
The surgery won't be over.

99
00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:09.737
It's been four hours already.

100
00:09:10.198 --> 00:09:11.967
The surgery is still going...

101
00:09:16.408 --> 00:09:17.438
Hong Joo!

102
00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.347
The operation is over.

103
00:09:22.747 --> 00:09:24.747
- What?
- It just ended.

104
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.418
The operation went well.
And the result is good too.

105
00:09:31.457 --> 00:09:34.688
Are you sure?
You aren't lying, right?

106
00:09:34.987 --> 00:09:36.798
I heard it from the doctor himself.

107
00:09:37.457 --> 00:09:38.497
He is okay now.

108
00:09:40.298 --> 00:09:41.328
That's a relief.

109
00:09:44.497 --> 00:09:45.938
Oh, my. Hong Joo!

110
00:09:45.938 --> 00:09:48.268
Hong Joo.
Lieutenant Han, please hold her.

111
00:09:48.268 --> 00:09:49.908
Hong Joo! Wake up.

112
00:09:50.538 --> 00:09:51.707
Hong Joo...

113
00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:54.207
Goodness.

114
00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:09.597
Goodness. He had a gun?
This is not the US.

115
00:10:10.097 --> 00:10:11.298
Where did he get the shotgun?

116
00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:13.328
He had the gun license.

117
00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:16.198
He used the shotgun from the
petrol station.

118
00:10:16.568 --> 00:10:19.007
Chief redistributed
Prosecutor Jung's cases.

119
00:10:19.007 --> 00:10:21.308
You got injury cases,
and you got fraud cases.

120
00:10:21.607 --> 00:10:22.707
You got attempted rape cases.

121
00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:27.877
Hyang Mi, are you crying?

122
00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:31.987
Yes, I'm crying.
I'm crying out of happiness.

123
00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:35.558
No more unfinished cases and
working late. I'm so happy.

124
00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:38.318
I'm so happy that I don't have to
see Prosecutor Jung

125
00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:39.788
who has so many unfinished cases.
I'm crying because I'm happy.

126
00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:41.798
Are you satisfied? Am I done here?

127
00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:47.467
Prosecutor Jung...

128
00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:50.438
What is with her? I thought
she didn't like Prosecutor Jung.

129
00:10:50.438 --> 00:10:53.438
I can tell she likes him very much.
She's deeply in love.

130
00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:54.507
It's shallow.

131
00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:56.837
She's going to turn
against him soon.

132
00:11:04.448 --> 00:11:07.918
You little brat. You cried like that
way when your father died.

133
00:11:13.058 --> 00:11:14.127
Are you awake?

134
00:11:18.768 --> 00:11:20.627
Mom, where is Jae Chan?

135
00:11:20.627 --> 00:11:23.497
His operation was a success.
He's now in the ICU.

136
00:11:23.497 --> 00:11:25.107
Seung Won called me earlier.

137
00:11:25.808 --> 00:11:28.337
Stop. You can't see him even
if you go right now.

138
00:11:28.337 --> 00:11:30.737
The ICU has limited visit hours.

139
00:11:30.808 --> 00:11:32.847
- But I should...
- You should eat first.

140
00:11:32.847 --> 00:11:34.048
You won't be late even if you go
after eating.

141
00:11:38.717 --> 00:11:40.087
When is the visiting hour?

142
00:11:40.188 --> 00:11:42.957
It's 11am. You have plenty of time.
Take your time to eat.

143
00:11:47.487 --> 00:11:51.597
By the way, Seung Won told me
to give this to you.

144
00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:55.298
What's this?

145
00:11:55.438 --> 00:11:59.038
Jae Chan wanted to meet you
last night to give you this.

146
00:12:02.107 --> 00:12:05.808
How did Jae Chan know that
you were called Chestnut?

147
00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:09.818
What do you mean?

148
00:12:09.818 --> 00:12:13.347
He came to see me out of the blue
and asked me.

149
00:12:14.087 --> 00:12:15.158
Goodness! You startled me!

150
00:12:15.457 --> 00:12:18.957
Was Hong Joo called as
Chestnut before?

151
00:12:20.188 --> 00:12:22.097
You didn't tell him that?

152
00:12:22.627 --> 00:12:23.627
No, I didn't.

153
00:12:24.658 --> 00:12:28.597
How did he know that?
It's been more than 10 years.

154
00:12:37.578 --> 00:12:38.607
What's that?

155
00:12:41.977 --> 00:12:44.747
(My dad said it's only natural
to save one when in danger.)

156
00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:47.518
(But I was too mad that I almost
couldn't. From Chestnut)

157
00:13:15.778 --> 00:13:16.818
It was you.

158
00:13:18.887 --> 00:13:19.948
Chestnut.

159
00:13:32.967 --> 00:13:34.528
Why didn't I recognize you?

160
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.107
I know, right?

161
00:13:57.857 --> 00:13:59.028
Do you remember me?

162
00:14:01.227 --> 00:14:04.158
Yes, I remember you.

163
00:14:09.337 --> 00:14:10.538
I've missed you.

164
00:14:12.007 --> 00:14:13.107
For a really long time.

165
00:14:15.908 --> 00:14:17.107
I was worried about you.

166
00:14:19.408 --> 00:14:21.178
I was scared you wouldn't
get up forever.

167
00:14:26.948 --> 00:14:29.387
I was worried about you
that you will blame yourself...

168
00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:36.928
for what I have said in the subway.

169
00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:39.497
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:42.938 --> 00:14:44.198
You don't have to be sorry.

171
00:15:00.222 --> 00:15:03.454
<font color="#80ffff">[Kocowa Ver] E19 While You Were Sleeping "A boy meets a girl"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

172
00:15:12.068 --> 00:15:13.097
I could never...

173
00:15:13.828 --> 00:15:14.898
tell that...

174
00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:17.768
you were a girl.

175
00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:20.908
A girl?
What are you saying?

176
00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:25.347
I thought you were a boy.

177
00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:27.048
I am a boy.

178
00:15:27.178 --> 00:15:29.578
What's wrong with my brother?
He's saying nonsense.

179
00:15:30.648 --> 00:15:32.117
He's showing the symptom
of unclear mindsets.

180
00:15:34.587 --> 00:15:35.617
What is that?

181
00:15:35.658 --> 00:15:38.387
It's only temporary right after
some operations.

182
00:15:38.387 --> 00:15:41.087
He will get back to his senses
after a day or two. Don't worry.

183
00:15:41.798 --> 00:15:45.597
Whatever he's saying doesn't mean
anything. So don't think too much.

184
00:15:45.597 --> 00:15:48.597
He won't even remember
what he just said.

185
00:15:49.768 --> 00:15:50.798
Is that so?

186
00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:55.877
Don't go.

187
00:15:56.808 --> 00:15:58.137
I have so much more to tell you.

188
00:15:58.137 --> 00:16:00.448
Just say yes to whatever
he's saying.

189
00:16:01.107 --> 00:16:02.448
Goodness.

190
00:16:04.048 --> 00:16:07.887
All right. Tell me whatever
you want to say. I'll listen.

191
00:16:07.918 --> 00:16:08.957
Come on.

192
00:16:14.887 --> 00:16:15.928
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:17.127 --> 00:16:18.768
The umbrella you offered
in front of the subway station...

194
00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:23.967
I should have taken it.

195
00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:30.607
How is Prosecutor Jung?
Is he back to his senses?

196
00:16:30.607 --> 00:16:34.778
He's back to his senses,
but not to his full senses.

197
00:16:34.778 --> 00:16:36.447
He can't tell people's genders.

198
00:16:36.447 --> 00:16:38.078
He called me a girl.

199
00:16:38.117 --> 00:16:39.347
Is his brain hurt too?

200
00:16:39.347 --> 00:16:41.087
No, it's just a small side effect
from the operating anesthesia.

201
00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:43.458
I had an operation
when I was in the middle school.

202
00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:45.018
I asked my dad to smoke with me
when I got back to my senses.

203
00:16:45.018 --> 00:16:46.058
He almost killed me.

204
00:16:47.857 --> 00:16:52.068
Anyway, it would take around
a month for him to recover.

205
00:16:53.298 --> 00:16:56.568
By the way,
Prosecutor Son isn't here?

206
00:17:08.447 --> 00:17:09.447
Is he still unconscious?

207
00:17:09.447 --> 00:17:10.718
Yes, he still is.

208
00:17:11.218 --> 00:17:12.417
He has advanced
pancreatic cancer.

209
00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:14.417
He might die before
he gets prosecuted.

210
00:17:14.417 --> 00:17:17.887
He might as well wanted a revenge
when he's dying anyway.

211
00:17:19.427 --> 00:17:20.587
Are you two police officers?

212
00:17:21.828 --> 00:17:23.558
How did you know, little boy?

213
00:17:23.558 --> 00:17:25.768
I know all the police officers and
prosecutors in Korea.

214
00:17:27.197 --> 00:17:28.568
Why are you guarding here?

215
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.238
Is a bad guy inside?

216
00:17:30.238 --> 00:17:34.068
Yes. There's a really bad guy,
but he's really sick.

217
00:17:34.068 --> 00:17:36.978
So he's under investigation
without physical detention.

218
00:17:38.877 --> 00:17:39.947
Good work, you guys.

219
00:17:43.518 --> 00:17:45.718
How does a little boy like that
know such things?

220
00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:52.028
Which floor are you going?

221
00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:53.528
I'm going to the 13th floor.

222
00:17:57.627 --> 00:18:00.328
Did you get into a car accident?
Or did you fall?

223
00:18:01.028 --> 00:18:02.968
I got beaten up by
my professor.

224
00:18:03.137 --> 00:18:04.837
You can totally charge him
with an injury crime.

225
00:18:05.308 --> 00:18:06.508
Do you want me to report
to the police?

226
00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:10.578
No, I'll do it myself.

227
00:18:12.478 --> 00:18:13.508
Don't forget to report.

228
00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:16.718
You have to.

229
00:18:17.548 --> 00:18:20.018
- Chan Woo!
- Mother!

230
00:18:23.558 --> 00:18:24.818
Where have you been?

231
00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:27.788
My little prince...

232
00:18:42.107 --> 00:18:44.407
Hey, I saw the news.

233
00:18:45.548 --> 00:18:48.048
Your brother was shot, right?
Is he okay?

234
00:18:48.177 --> 00:18:50.917
Yoo Su Kyung's father
is totally insane.

235
00:18:51.248 --> 00:18:53.187
Tell us all. Why did he shoot him?

236
00:18:56.617 --> 00:18:59.028
What's wrong with him?

237
00:19:00.657 --> 00:19:01.687
What's with you?

238
00:19:02.397 --> 00:19:04.458
Are you ignoring our
gesture of apology?

239
00:19:18.337 --> 00:19:20.847
You are here to attend
Prosecutor Shin's investigation?

240
00:19:21.278 --> 00:19:22.877
- Yes.
- Me too.

241
00:19:24.048 --> 00:19:26.718
Prosecutor Shin wants us to take
part in confronting investigation?

242
00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:42.238
How's Prosecutor Jung's condition?
Are visitors allowed?

243
00:19:42.697 --> 00:19:45.808
He's out of the ICU.
You can go see him today.

244
00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:47.068
He's recovering fast.

245
00:19:47.068 --> 00:19:48.478
That's a relief.

246
00:19:50.837 --> 00:19:52.907
Shall we get started, Mr. Choi?

247
00:19:53.548 --> 00:19:56.978
Yes. Yoo Su Kyung's mother said...

248
00:19:57.218 --> 00:20:01.958
Lawyer Lee sent these photos
to Yoo Man Ho.

249
00:20:02.318 --> 00:20:03.357
Is that right?

250
00:20:03.417 --> 00:20:05.127
Yes, I sent them.

251
00:20:05.187 --> 00:20:09.357
These photos made Yoo Han Ho mad,
so he shot Prosecutor Jung.

252
00:20:09.397 --> 00:20:11.768
He misunderstood that Lieutenant Han
and Prosecutor Jung are connected...

253
00:20:12.097 --> 00:20:14.298
to Do Hak Young.

254
00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:16.667
Misunderstanding?

255
00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:18.367
Is that a misunderstanding?

256
00:20:19.238 --> 00:20:21.167
Mr. Han Woo Tak,
aren't you close to Prosecutor Jung?

257
00:20:23.078 --> 00:20:24.107
Yes.

258
00:20:24.508 --> 00:20:27.947
See? It's not a misunderstanding.
It's a suspicion.

259
00:20:27.947 --> 00:20:31.718
Because they're close, he could
have requested something to Jung.

260
00:20:31.947 --> 00:20:33.647
A very reasonable suspicion that
he could have asked Jae Chan...

261
00:20:33.647 --> 00:20:35.488
to look after his close friend.

262
00:20:35.488 --> 00:20:39.058
Did you request anything
to Prosecutor Jung?

263
00:20:39.187 --> 00:20:42.328
When I met him, I told him Hak Young
is not the type that would kill.

264
00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:43.798
See? He did it.

265
00:20:45.627 --> 00:20:47.597
Then Prosecutor Jung said this.

266
00:20:47.728 --> 00:20:48.937
How can you be so sure?

267
00:20:49.068 --> 00:20:52.008
You can't assure something until
the investigation is over.

268
00:20:52.837 --> 00:20:54.667
Whether he's guilty or not.

269
00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:56.708
He said it so straightforward
that I felt a little hurt.

270
00:20:56.937 --> 00:20:58.708
I know Jae Chan well.

271
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.847
He's a bit rude sometimes,
but he's warmhearted.

272
00:21:01.947 --> 00:21:04.647
So even if he said it like that,
it must have bothered him.

273
00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:07.887
Let's think from Yoo Man Ho's
perspective too.

274
00:21:08.117 --> 00:21:10.258
His beloved daughter died
out of the blue.

275
00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:12.828
His daughter is dead, and
the prosecutor is doing nothing.

276
00:21:13.187 --> 00:21:15.028
Do Hak Young, the most obvious
suspect is here.

277
00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:17.998
And the prosecutor set him free
of charges. And it turns out...

278
00:21:18.768 --> 00:21:20.828
that the prosecutor's friend
and the suspect are all close.

279
00:21:20.828 --> 00:21:23.437
The suspect's friend requested
the prosecutor to look after him.

280
00:21:23.897 --> 00:21:26.808
This drove Mr. Yoo mad. He would
completely go mad, wouldn't he?

281
00:21:26.808 --> 00:21:30.038
He's not just free of charges.

282
00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:32.107
The evidence shows that it was
the robot vacuum.

283
00:21:32.107 --> 00:21:35.078
Yoo Su Kyung's blood was found
on the robot vacuum.

284
00:21:35.617 --> 00:21:36.978
Somebody could have fabricated it.

285
00:21:40.087 --> 00:21:43.218
It's so easy to set someone free if
a prosecutor helps with forging...

286
00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:46.528
some documents with police.
Don't you think?

287
00:21:48.187 --> 00:21:49.857
Is forging even possible at all?

288
00:21:53.927 --> 00:21:55.697
If a prosecutor wants to, he can.

289
00:21:56.068 --> 00:21:57.097
Is that so?

290
00:21:58.038 --> 00:22:02.238
A prosecutor can forge documents
if he wants to?

291
00:22:04.437 --> 00:22:08.407
Never. It's unimaginable.

292
00:22:10.117 --> 00:22:12.818
Did you forge documents when you
were a prosecutor before?

293
00:22:19.728 --> 00:22:21.258
Is that why you sent the photos?

294
00:22:22.357 --> 00:22:23.897
You thought Jae Chan forged
documents and proofs like you...

295
00:22:24.528 --> 00:22:27.328
when you were a prosecutor before.

296
00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:37.677
My enemies are everywhere.

297
00:22:38.877 --> 00:22:39.907
Hey, Hee Min.

298
00:22:41.508 --> 00:22:42.617
No, I mean Prosecutor Shin.

299
00:22:44.377 --> 00:22:46.117
Is this really a witness
investigation?

300
00:22:50.558 --> 00:22:53.288
Why is everyone investigating me
for Yoo Man Ho's crime?

301
00:22:53.758 --> 00:22:56.298
Did I shoot him?
Did I abet or aid the murder?

302
00:22:58.798 --> 00:23:00.268
What are you
going to charge me with?

303
00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:03.337
None. You're innocent
in terms of laws.

304
00:23:03.337 --> 00:23:06.637
Then why am I being
investigated like this?

305
00:23:07.837 --> 00:23:10.078
The one who shot him
will die soon anyway.

306
00:23:10.437 --> 00:23:13.147
The right of arraignment is invalid.
Then the prosecution will drop out.

307
00:23:13.147 --> 00:23:14.248
Why? Why are you investigating me?

308
00:23:18.447 --> 00:23:20.248
Why do you bother me so much?

309
00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:22.657
Prosecutor Shin.

310
00:23:23.357 --> 00:23:25.857
A man could have been
killed by a gun.

311
00:23:27.187 --> 00:23:30.998
A prosecutor can't just sit here
and do nothing about it.

312
00:23:31.728 --> 00:23:34.268
Why did Yoo Man Ho shoot him?

313
00:23:34.627 --> 00:23:38.437
I needed to record down what kind
of a lawyer you are.

314
00:23:38.538 --> 00:23:41.877
That's why I'm investigating you.

315
00:23:47.847 --> 00:23:48.847
Lee Yu Beom.

316
00:23:50.078 --> 00:23:51.478
A scary man he is.

317
00:23:51.677 --> 00:23:53.387
Yoo Man Ho is the one who shot him.

318
00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:55.258
But Lawyer Lee seems guilty.

319
00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:03.028
Lawyer Lee!

320
00:24:04.697 --> 00:24:05.697
Here.

321
00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:07.697
Here you go.

322
00:24:08.228 --> 00:24:10.137
Oh, I forgot this.
Thank you.

323
00:24:10.167 --> 00:24:12.508
Thanks for today.
Get back safely.

324
00:24:12.907 --> 00:24:13.907
Mr. Choi.

325
00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:18.137
Would you come for a manager's
position in my office?

326
00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:20.677
No, it's fine.

327
00:24:21.107 --> 00:24:24.518
Do you want me to recommend
someone else?

328
00:24:24.518 --> 00:24:25.988
Not the others. I want you.

329
00:24:26.887 --> 00:24:30.488
I feel like I'm the bad guy
all the time when I see you here.

330
00:24:32.458 --> 00:24:35.357
You were always on my side
when we worked together.

331
00:24:35.927 --> 00:24:38.627
You said I never make mistakes
on the cases.

332
00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:40.897
You're right.

333
00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:44.197
That's why I'm scared now.

334
00:24:46.238 --> 00:24:48.837
I'm wondering if I forged
anything back then.

335
00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:51.377
I'm scared I might have.

336
00:25:06.258 --> 00:25:07.288
(Jung Jae Chan, Male)

337
00:25:15.568 --> 00:25:19.008
Excuse me. Is a patient named
Jung Jae Chan not here yet?

338
00:25:19.008 --> 00:25:21.038
He came here from the
ICU last night.

339
00:25:21.877 --> 00:25:23.208
Maybe he went out for a walk.

340
00:25:24.238 --> 00:25:26.548
- Can I wait inside?
- Of course.

341
00:25:26.907 --> 00:25:27.947
Thank you.

342
00:25:31.218 --> 00:25:32.548
I must be crazy.

343
00:25:33.087 --> 00:25:35.458
How could I have come
without my makeup on?

344
00:25:50.197 --> 00:25:51.768
That's nonsense.

345
00:25:52.238 --> 00:25:54.137
I told chief that he's a girl?

346
00:25:55.238 --> 00:25:57.708
He can't come now.
My eyes makeups are not even.

347
00:25:57.708 --> 00:25:59.078
Stop making up stories.

348
00:26:03.818 --> 00:26:06.647
You stroked chief's face.

349
00:26:06.718 --> 00:26:08.887
And you said you're sorry to him.

350
00:26:09.387 --> 00:26:11.518
No way. How could I have said
such things?

351
00:26:12.627 --> 00:26:14.258
But you did.

352
00:26:14.488 --> 00:26:16.657
I thought you were in love
with your boss.

353
00:26:17.028 --> 00:26:18.597
Stop saying disgusting things.

354
00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:23.498
How about you move to
another hospital?

355
00:26:23.538 --> 00:26:24.937
Why? I like it here.

356
00:26:25.137 --> 00:26:28.268
Yoo Man Ho, who shot you...

357
00:26:29.677 --> 00:26:30.937
He's admitted to this hospital too.

358
00:26:34.377 --> 00:26:36.478
Why this hospital out of so many?

359
00:26:36.548 --> 00:26:39.187
It was a hectic back then when it
happened, and the two of them...

360
00:26:39.187 --> 00:26:40.718
were brought to the same hospital.

361
00:26:41.988 --> 00:26:43.988
Jae Chan. Let's move.

362
00:26:44.087 --> 00:26:45.127
I don't want to.

363
00:26:45.988 --> 00:26:47.058
It's better this way.

364
00:26:48.087 --> 00:26:50.697
Which room is he admitted to?
I should go and ask things.

365
00:26:50.697 --> 00:26:52.397
He can't even speak now.
What would you ask him?

366
00:26:52.397 --> 00:26:54.427
Yoo Man Ho's in a serious
condition that he'll die any time.

367
00:26:54.427 --> 00:26:56.538
Is that so? Then I should go see him
today or tomorrow.

368
00:26:57.097 --> 00:26:59.468
I have to ask why he shot me.

369
00:26:59.468 --> 00:27:01.038
You know why he shot you.

370
00:27:01.068 --> 00:27:03.578
It's because you set Do Hak Young
free of charges...

371
00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:05.407
Do Hak Young's not the suspect.

372
00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:08.107
But Yoo Man Ho didn't know that.
He was angry...

373
00:27:08.107 --> 00:27:09.417
Does it justify his shooting?

374
00:27:10.078 --> 00:27:11.478
You can kill people if you're angry?

375
00:27:14.447 --> 00:27:15.657
I have to meet Yoo Man Ho.

376
00:27:16.387 --> 00:27:19.157
I have to let him know that
anger can't justify killing...

377
00:27:19.157 --> 00:27:20.187
before he dies.

378
00:27:26.528 --> 00:27:28.538
Why should I save him?
I hate him so much.

379
00:27:28.768 --> 00:27:30.197
You're going to let him die
just because you hate him?

380
00:27:30.998 --> 00:27:33.008
- Is that the reason?
- Yes!

381
00:27:33.238 --> 00:27:35.708
Let him die because I hate him!

382
00:27:57.298 --> 00:27:58.768
Hey, Woo Tak.

383
00:27:59.397 --> 00:28:00.728
You're visiting Jae Chan too?

384
00:28:00.768 --> 00:28:03.968
Yes, why didn't you go inside?

385
00:28:04.998 --> 00:28:06.008
Just because.

386
00:28:08.268 --> 00:28:10.177
- Woo Tak.
- Yes?

387
00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:12.748
People say that...

388
00:28:13.147 --> 00:28:14.347
ignorance is bliss.

389
00:28:15.177 --> 00:28:17.278
- Yes.
- If ignorance is really a bliss,

390
00:28:17.947 --> 00:28:20.687
should I just act like I don't
know anything and lie?

391
00:28:23.357 --> 00:28:24.758
Do you think you can lie
until the end?

392
00:28:25.058 --> 00:28:27.328
I'm not sure. Maybe.

393
00:28:29.798 --> 00:28:32.568
If you can keep things until
the end, then it's not a lie.

394
00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:35.238
So just act like you don't
know anything.

395
00:28:35.637 --> 00:28:38.337
I'm surprised. I thought you would
advise the opposite.

396
00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:39.508
Why?

397
00:28:40.238 --> 00:28:42.078
Because you have a good-boy
image that everyone agrees.

398
00:28:42.437 --> 00:28:43.837
Good and straight.

399
00:28:45.377 --> 00:28:46.407
That's exactly right.

400
00:28:48.478 --> 00:28:51.177
Thank you for always saying
things I want to hear.

401
00:28:51.478 --> 00:28:52.518
I do?

402
00:28:53.748 --> 00:28:55.657
Let's go together.
Jae Chan's waiting.

403
00:28:55.657 --> 00:28:58.758
No. I think it's better
if I don't go see him.

404
00:28:58.887 --> 00:29:01.288
- Why not?
- People think we're close,

405
00:29:01.288 --> 00:29:03.157
and assume he let go of
Hak Young easily.

406
00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:06.468
I think I shouldn't see Jae Chan
for a while.

407
00:29:08.127 --> 00:29:09.167
Go alone.

408
00:29:11.468 --> 00:29:12.568
Send my regards to him.

409
00:29:13.107 --> 00:29:15.208
Okay. See you later.

410
00:29:15.508 --> 00:29:16.538
Sure.

411
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:57.789
(Episode 20 will air shortly.)
