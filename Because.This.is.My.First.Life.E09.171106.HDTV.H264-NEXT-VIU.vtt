1
00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:30.108
Come on.

2
00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:36.318
Let's go to our home.

3
00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:48.188
You dropped it at the bus station.

4
00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:54.288
(Six missed calls from Landlord)

5
00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:58.628
You called me so many times.

6
00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:00.768
Yes.

7
00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:03.667
I called you a lot.

8
00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:45.547
Would it be all right if I shower first?

9
00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:47.308
I sweated too much.

10
00:02:47.808 --> 00:02:49.577
Yes. Go ahead.

11
00:02:50.118 --> 00:02:51.118
Okay.

12
00:02:57.357 --> 00:02:58.528
Why...

13
00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.487
Yes?

14
00:03:00.727 --> 00:03:02.658
Why are you following me in?

15
00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:06.727
I didn't follow you.

16
00:03:14.737 --> 00:03:16.707
I didn't realize.

17
00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:20.077
Yes, I figured as much.

18
00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.218
You should go wash up.

19
00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:40.098
(Come to YOLO Cafe, 24. Complaint: Stalking)

20
00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:46.267
He's the suspect of Namgang Station Kidnap case.

21
00:03:47.308 --> 00:03:49.977
The one that stalked a university student?

22
00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:53.248
The details match, including the wrench.

23
00:03:54.848 --> 00:03:58.148
Then why didn't you tell me?

24
00:03:58.618 --> 00:03:59.987
Didn't you know earlier?

25
00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:02.688
You said it was hard for you to find that job.

26
00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:05.357
I couldn't be too hasty at informing you.

27
00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:09.227
It would have been better if you tipped me off.

28
00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:13.197
I could have acted oblivious while watching over him.

29
00:04:13.197 --> 00:04:17.468
You? Act oblivious?

30
00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:19.067
What is it?

31
00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:21.538
Do you think I can't do it?

32
00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:26.177
I overacted.

33
00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:27.948
So please don't say...

34
00:04:29.148 --> 00:04:30.417
"us"...

35
00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:33.247
so easily.

36
00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:34.857
I asked if you took the bus home.

37
00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:37.357
Do I have to answer that?

38
00:04:37.687 --> 00:04:39.057
No,

39
00:04:40.557 --> 00:04:42.557
- it's not necessary. - Exactly.

40
00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:50.598
You think he knows about our contract?

41
00:04:51.338 --> 00:04:52.468
Yes.

42
00:04:53.038 --> 00:04:58.408
He called you a fake husband.

43
00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:01.648
Why did you marry a fake husband?

44
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:06.718
Even if he's a stalker, how did he find out?

45
00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:07.817
I'm not sure.

46
00:05:08.857 --> 00:05:11.288
That's something only two of us know.

47
00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:18.167
- Is it because of my phone? - Pardon?

48
00:05:18.328 --> 00:05:20.968
He said that after seeing how I saved you on my phone.

49
00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:24.437
He asked me if you're really my landlord and not a husband.

50
00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:26.067
Yes.

51
00:05:27.107 --> 00:05:30.437
I noticed that you saved me as "Landlord".

52
00:05:30.838 --> 00:05:32.578
It's not common.

53
00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:35.278
Why would you save my number like that?

54
00:05:36.047 --> 00:05:38.747
Then what should I save you as?

55
00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:41.857
There's nothing else.

56
00:05:42.357 --> 00:05:45.758
Well... There's my name.

57
00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:48.497
Se Hee.

58
00:05:50.828 --> 00:05:54.768
Then what did you save me as?

59
00:05:54.768 --> 00:05:56.468
Of course I saved you as...

60
00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:03.778
"Tenant"...

61
00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.877
Bo Mi's uncle works at the police station,

62
00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:12.518
so we've informed him.

63
00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:15.057
I'm sure it'll be resolved tomorrow.

64
00:06:15.117 --> 00:06:16.758
What happens to Bok Nam?

65
00:06:16.758 --> 00:06:19.288
He will be locked up.

66
00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:21.528
Okay.

67
00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:23.528
That was close!

68
00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:25.828
Sanchez. He has to pass.

69
00:06:25.828 --> 00:06:27.567
- The ball gets delivered. - It's Giroud.

70
00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:28.937
- It's going in! - Sanchez!

71
00:06:28.937 --> 00:06:30.138
- Goal! - Yes!

72
00:06:32.437 --> 00:06:34.107
What a clean shot.

73
00:06:34.107 --> 00:06:36.578
- Sanchez is amazing. - It's a team goal.

74
00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:37.737
That's right.

75
00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:40.607
Sanchez is hugging his teammates.

76
00:06:40.948 --> 00:06:43.648
It was a counterattack.

77
00:06:44.177 --> 00:06:45.547
It was a perfect goal.

78
00:06:45.547 --> 00:06:47.317
Everything was on beat.

79
00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:48.687
Thank you...

80
00:06:52.427 --> 00:06:53.888
for coming running to me.

81
00:06:56.898 --> 00:06:58.898
For walking down with me.

82
00:07:01.127 --> 00:07:02.297
And for...

83
00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:07.667
calling it our home.

84
00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:15.948
Were you upset...

85
00:07:17.817 --> 00:07:20.747
because I drew a line?

86
00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:27.057
Because I told you not to act like my wife around others?

87
00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:33.198
And because I told you not to call us, "Us"?

88
00:07:35.268 --> 00:07:37.038
Did I upset you?

89
00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:40.567
Yes.

90
00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:44.338
I...

91
00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:48.848
don't want to become your burden.

92
00:07:50.977 --> 00:07:52.648
Unlike others,

93
00:07:53.817 --> 00:07:55.987
our marriage started with an agreement that it'll end.

94
00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.458
It provided you a place to live,

95
00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:01.997
and it allowed me to profit by getting rent.

96
00:08:02.427 --> 00:08:04.357
It was a mutual agreement,

97
00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:08.028
but after the contract ends,

98
00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:12.937
the damage might be bigger for you than me.

99
00:08:14.268 --> 00:08:15.877
You're a woman,

100
00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.377
and you're younger than me.

101
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:25.448
That's why the society might look at you more harshly.

102
00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:29.518
I thought I should minimize creating a relationship with you.

103
00:08:30.557 --> 00:08:32.587
I also thought that we should...

104
00:08:33.988 --> 00:08:35.957
avoid sharing anything...

105
00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:38.628
if I can help it.

106
00:08:39.827 --> 00:08:44.038
You were thinking about that the whole time?

107
00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:52.378
About what happens after our marriage is over,

108
00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:57.317
and how it would impact me?

109
00:09:00.148 --> 00:09:03.187
I wouldn't say I thought about it the whole time,

110
00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:07.628
but the thought came to me after our wedding.

111
00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:09.358
Why?

112
00:09:09.797 --> 00:09:12.667
Because I made a promise.

113
00:09:13.998 --> 00:09:16.297
I promised your mother...

114
00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:19.707
I wouldn't make any trouble for you.

115
00:09:22.138 --> 00:09:23.638
I wanted to keep it.

116
00:09:25.677 --> 00:09:28.947
I still want to keep it.

117
00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:32.587
I don't know much about Ji Ho yet,

118
00:09:33.288 --> 00:09:35.417
but at a certain point,

119
00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:38.557
she'll choose a path that makes her happy.

120
00:09:39.687 --> 00:09:42.628
During our marriage, I'll try...

121
00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:46.728
not to be an inconvenience to her choice.

122
00:09:48.898 --> 00:09:52.638
That's all I can promise you.

123
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.947
(Landlord)

124
00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:07.518
(Calling Landlord)

125
00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:18.868
Hello?

126
00:10:19.398 --> 00:10:20.667
It's me.

127
00:10:20.728 --> 00:10:22.898
Yes. I know.

128
00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:25.638
When I...

129
00:10:27.738 --> 00:10:31.748
graduated school and started the assistant writer job,

130
00:10:32.807 --> 00:10:35.077
I got paid 800 dollars a month.

131
00:10:36.748 --> 00:10:38.388
Then my father told me...

132
00:10:39.187 --> 00:10:41.457
to quit right away and to come back home.

133
00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.457
He told me to grow spinach instead.

134
00:10:46.628 --> 00:10:48.427
We had a small garden in our backyard.

135
00:10:49.297 --> 00:10:54.228
If we grew spinach for a week, I would make more than that.

136
00:10:55.868 --> 00:10:58.207
No one understood my job,

137
00:10:58.967 --> 00:11:03.408
but do you know how I was able to start it?

138
00:11:06.108 --> 00:11:07.947
I wasn't thinking.

139
00:11:10.177 --> 00:11:12.388
I didn't think to become a great writer.

140
00:11:13.187 --> 00:11:15.087
I didn't think to become famous,

141
00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:18.687
or to succeed.

142
00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:23.457
I never thought about such things.

143
00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:28.337
I came across a script by chance,

144
00:11:29.437 --> 00:11:31.337
and it was so much fun I went crazy over it.

145
00:11:32.738 --> 00:11:34.807
That's why I just jumped in.

146
00:11:37.508 --> 00:11:40.577
It was fun writing every day.

147
00:11:42.417 --> 00:11:44.988
I didn't want to achieve something...

148
00:11:44.988 --> 00:11:46.317
or make something of myself through writing.

149
00:11:46.888 --> 00:11:48.717
It never occurred to me.

150
00:11:49.758 --> 00:11:51.258
That's why...

151
00:11:52.258 --> 00:11:56.498
I won't think about what happens to me two years from now.

152
00:11:58.297 --> 00:12:00.067
If I had,

153
00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:03.937
I probably couldn't have gotten married.

154
00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:07.437
I just...

155
00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:10.738
needed this room right away,

156
00:12:11.337 --> 00:12:13.248
and I liked how safe I felt here.

157
00:12:14.347 --> 00:12:16.748
I didn't want to part ways with Kitty either.

158
00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:19.518
Also,

159
00:12:22.018 --> 00:12:25.658
the landlord looked trustworthy.

160
00:12:27.258 --> 00:12:28.758
That's why I did it.

161
00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:33.728
I liked being a part of this house.

162
00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:37.837
So it's not important to me...

163
00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:41.008
what happens after our marriage.

164
00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:42.778
I don't even think about it.

165
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.947
So...

166
00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:48.278
don't cross a line between us...

167
00:12:50.018 --> 00:12:51.278
on purpose.

168
00:12:53.347 --> 00:12:54.518
Okay.

169
00:12:54.888 --> 00:12:56.118
Don't...

170
00:12:57.988 --> 00:12:59.358
lock your door either.

171
00:13:01.128 --> 00:13:02.258
Okay.

172
00:13:03.557 --> 00:13:07.028
Then, goodnight.

173
00:13:08.337 --> 00:13:11.567
I have something to say too.

174
00:13:12.937 --> 00:13:16.538
Don't call me your landlord.

175
00:13:17.538 --> 00:13:19.577
People might think you live alone.

176
00:13:20.547 --> 00:13:21.847
When you're in front of others,

177
00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:26.687
call me your husband.

178
00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:30.057
Something dangerous might happen again.

179
00:13:30.057 --> 00:13:31.827
Don't let others think you're alone.

180
00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:35.858
For the next two years, you...

181
00:13:37.028 --> 00:13:39.667
belong to this house along with me.

182
00:13:45.337 --> 00:13:46.467
Okay.

183
00:13:47.108 --> 00:13:50.408
Okay. Goodnight, then.

184
00:13:51.847 --> 00:13:55.618
Hey. How did you know I was there?

185
00:13:56.717 --> 00:13:58.288
I didn't have my phone.

186
00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.567
(Enjoying the night view on my way back from work)

187
00:14:54.738 --> 00:14:57.508
It's under construction. I don't think I can go any further.

188
00:14:57.837 --> 00:14:59.847
Is there any other way to go up there?

189
00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:01.648
This is the only way to go by car.

190
00:15:02.618 --> 00:15:04.677
What about the way to go by foot?

191
00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:07.717
- This must be the way. - Okay, thank you.

192
00:15:13.028 --> 00:15:15.028
It might take more than 30 minutes though.

193
00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:00.707
Let's go watch soccer.

194
00:16:04.437 --> 00:16:07.307
(Landlord)

195
00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:15.018
(Husband)

196
00:16:16.917 --> 00:16:20.557
(Husband)

197
00:16:22.628 --> 00:16:23.728
Come on.

198
00:16:24.258 --> 00:16:27.228
Let's go to our home.

199
00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:34.908
(Husband)

200
00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:46.717
(Because This Is My First Time Belonging to Somewhere)

201
00:17:06.607 --> 00:17:08.337
(Husband)

202
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.208
(Wife)

203
00:17:18.617 --> 00:17:20.948
(Husband)

204
00:17:34.127 --> 00:17:35.238
Hello?

205
00:17:36.238 --> 00:17:37.268
Hello?

206
00:17:40.038 --> 00:17:41.208
Hello?

207
00:17:44.978 --> 00:17:46.508
You're home.

208
00:17:46.907 --> 00:17:48.478
And why did you call me?

209
00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:51.278
That's...

210
00:17:53.988 --> 00:17:56.557
I called you by mistake while trying to turn off the alarm.

211
00:17:57.258 --> 00:17:59.228
Well...

212
00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:02.028
I see.

213
00:18:04.528 --> 00:18:07.367
Did you have a good night's sleep?

214
00:18:07.928 --> 00:18:10.498
Yes, what about you, Ji Ho?

215
00:18:12.337 --> 00:18:13.438
Me too.

216
00:18:20.948 --> 00:18:23.877
Kitty, how are you here?

217
00:18:24.218 --> 00:18:26.117
She took a taxi and came home alone.

218
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:30.458
She was crying outside to come in, so I opened the door for her.

219
00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.597
She can do that?

220
00:18:40.998 --> 00:18:42.468
Of course not.

221
00:18:44.867 --> 00:18:46.567
It was a joke.

222
00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:53.847
I see, it was a joke.

223
00:18:55.577 --> 00:18:56.718
Yes.

224
00:19:10.097 --> 00:19:12.897
Hello. What's up?

225
00:19:13.268 --> 00:19:14.498
Hello, Bo Mi.

226
00:19:15.067 --> 00:19:17.168
I haven't watched the news yet.

227
00:19:17.168 --> 00:19:18.468
Watch the newscast? Why?

228
00:19:19.337 --> 00:19:20.367
What?

229
00:19:22.907 --> 00:19:24.278
He got caught?

230
00:19:25.008 --> 00:19:28.478
The culprit of the kidnap case that happened in October 30...

231
00:19:28.478 --> 00:19:30.317
got arrested by the police this dawn.

232
00:19:30.877 --> 00:19:34.488
He stalked a woman whom he met through an online game,

233
00:19:34.518 --> 00:19:37.157
kidnapped her, and locked her up for 13 hours.

234
00:19:38.087 --> 00:19:39.887
The police arrested the culprit...

235
00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:42.557
and are investigating on his additional crime.

236
00:19:43.597 --> 00:19:45.367
I still can't believe it.

237
00:19:46.998 --> 00:19:50.297
I had no idea he'd be this kind of person.

238
00:19:50.567 --> 00:19:54.008
You don't even fully know who you are, so it's hard to know others.

239
00:19:55.577 --> 00:19:58.107
Are you really okay to go to work today?

240
00:19:58.877 --> 00:20:01.377
The police could visit the cafe.

241
00:20:02.317 --> 00:20:03.448
I'm okay.

242
00:20:04.248 --> 00:20:07.218
He got arrested, so I'm okay with going to work.

243
00:20:14.827 --> 00:20:17.327
I'll see you at home later.

244
00:20:18.127 --> 00:20:21.768
You'll take a bus home, right?

245
00:20:22.668 --> 00:20:23.738
Yes.

246
00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:26.468
I'll see you later.

247
00:20:27.407 --> 00:20:28.478
Bye.

248
00:20:31.508 --> 00:20:33.278
Bok Nam, that punk.

249
00:20:33.278 --> 00:20:35.317
Ji Ho, are you okay?

250
00:20:35.617 --> 00:20:37.377
I'm okay.

251
00:20:38.047 --> 00:20:40.117
The landlord came to...

252
00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:42.157
I mean...

253
00:20:44.728 --> 00:20:45.988
My husband...

254
00:20:47.327 --> 00:20:48.698
came for me.

255
00:20:49.127 --> 00:20:51.157
I know. I heard it from Soo Ji.

256
00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.867
Your husband is amazing.

257
00:20:54.168 --> 00:20:56.198
We all fell for his smile,

258
00:20:56.367 --> 00:20:58.337
and how did he collect all the information?

259
00:20:58.468 --> 00:21:01.577
Exactly. He collected all the evidence...

260
00:21:01.778 --> 00:21:03.637
without my knowledge.

261
00:21:03.978 --> 00:21:05.978
He's so meticulous.

262
00:21:06.248 --> 00:21:07.748
Maybe Won Seok is right.

263
00:21:07.948 --> 00:21:10.948
I heard you have to be incredibly smart to solve that cube.

264
00:21:10.948 --> 00:21:13.347
Your husband set the record of it in the company, right?

265
00:21:14.587 --> 00:21:15.887
No wonder.

266
00:21:16.657 --> 00:21:20.228
He's a meticulous person who never allows mistakes.

267
00:21:40.478 --> 00:21:41.948
My goodness, he took 52 seconds.

268
00:21:42.978 --> 00:21:44.278
Se Hee, you're amazing.

269
00:21:44.278 --> 00:21:45.718
He's the best.

270
00:21:45.718 --> 00:21:47.647
- I know. - It doesn't make sense.

271
00:21:47.718 --> 00:21:50.157
- It's crazy. - It's unbelievable.

272
00:21:50.288 --> 00:21:52.357
- Goodness. - How did he solve it so fast?

273
00:21:53.627 --> 00:21:56.057
- It's impressive. - Goodness.

274
00:21:56.228 --> 00:21:57.258
- He's so cool. - Is he even a human?

275
00:21:58.627 --> 00:22:00.567
- I bet he's not. - How did he do it?

276
00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:03.668
Se Hee, can I have a moment with you if you're done?

277
00:22:03.837 --> 00:22:04.938
It's work-related.

278
00:22:10.407 --> 00:22:12.448
Did you do something to him last night?

279
00:22:13.778 --> 00:22:15.448
You didn't cross the line, did you?

280
00:22:16.147 --> 00:22:17.278
You didn't hit him, right?

281
00:22:17.678 --> 00:22:19.988
Do you think I'm the kind of person to hit people?

282
00:22:20.387 --> 00:22:21.557
Thank goodness.

283
00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:26.387
Instead, I kicked his motorbike.

284
00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:28.028
- You kicked what? - That expensive bike?

285
00:22:28.057 --> 00:22:30.958
It's worth 40,000 dollars,

286
00:22:31.028 --> 00:22:32.698
but it got knocked down at once.

287
00:22:33.567 --> 00:22:34.668
Besides,

288
00:22:34.768 --> 00:22:37.897
I didn't even give my all to kick it hard.

289
00:22:45.278 --> 00:22:46.807
Why are you staring at me like that?

290
00:22:48.647 --> 00:22:51.278
I'm serious. I didn't give my all.

291
00:22:51.448 --> 00:22:53.988
I told you in the morning that the culprit got arrested.

292
00:22:54.288 --> 00:22:56.557
Yes, I watched the news broadcasting as well.

293
00:22:59.028 --> 00:23:00.057
Take a look at this.

294
00:23:03.157 --> 00:23:06.367
It's the culprit's picture which I got from my uncle.

295
00:23:10.468 --> 00:23:13.668
It turned out someone stole and used his picture on the account.

296
00:23:14.008 --> 00:23:15.837
- What? - You saw it too.

297
00:23:15.907 --> 00:23:19.508
Bok Nam is a popular celebrity on social media.

298
00:23:24.317 --> 00:23:27.718
You can acquire a lot of information by spying on social media.

299
00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:31.218
The culprit created a new account and posted Bok Nam's picture.

300
00:23:31.387 --> 00:23:34.258
He acted like he was Bok Nam and approached women.

301
00:23:34.428 --> 00:23:35.758
He's a habitual offender.

302
00:23:37.627 --> 00:23:40.198
Then who...

303
00:23:41.668 --> 00:23:42.698
is he?

304
00:23:43.097 --> 00:23:45.768
He's just a hard-working part-timer.

305
00:23:45.968 --> 00:23:47.607
He's an innocent civilian too.

306
00:24:01.518 --> 00:24:02.688
You...

307
00:24:02.887 --> 00:24:05.557
Why are you eating toast there and not in the police station?

308
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:09.557
I heard your husband tore down his motorcycle yesterday.

309
00:24:10.097 --> 00:24:12.367
- What? - Your husband...

310
00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:15.137
kicked his motorcycle until it was completely torn down.

311
00:24:16.067 --> 00:24:19.968
Sir, it was because...

312
00:24:22.907 --> 00:24:25.907
he is a stalker.

313
00:24:25.907 --> 00:24:27.807
What? Stalker?

314
00:24:28.178 --> 00:24:31.248
He's the kidnap suspect of Namgang Station case.

315
00:24:32.218 --> 00:24:34.547
Did he escape?

316
00:24:34.688 --> 00:24:37.218
I think we have to call the police first, sir.

317
00:24:37.218 --> 00:24:40.028
Ji Ho, this is really rude.

318
00:24:40.087 --> 00:24:42.458
He's just a normal human being. How can you say he's a criminal?

319
00:24:42.458 --> 00:24:45.597
That's the point. He does look normal.

320
00:24:45.597 --> 00:24:48.168
- Do you want to start something? - Please stop it, Dad.

321
00:24:48.168 --> 00:24:50.067
Who are you trying to stop me?

322
00:24:52.307 --> 00:24:53.438
Dad?

323
00:24:59.307 --> 00:25:01.877
Call your husband now!

324
00:25:10.387 --> 00:25:14.428
Did you say he is the suspect of Namgang Station kidnap case?

325
00:25:14.827 --> 00:25:18.198
I apologize. I was confused.

326
00:25:19.428 --> 00:25:21.897
If you were confused, you should have talked to him first.

327
00:25:21.897 --> 00:25:25.107
You are a grown-up. How can you break his motorcycle?

328
00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:26.407
It's an expensive one!

329
00:25:27.407 --> 00:25:29.637
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

330
00:25:29.637 --> 00:25:31.137
Do you know what that motorcycle means to him?

331
00:25:31.208 --> 00:25:34.248
He even used his housing deposit to buy that motorcycle.

332
00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:40.948
How can someone look so modest do such a thing?

333
00:25:42.617 --> 00:25:44.057
Hello?

334
00:25:45.057 --> 00:25:46.188
That's right.

335
00:25:51.228 --> 00:25:53.367
I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

336
00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:55.198
But nobody can stop my dad when he's really upset.

337
00:25:56.637 --> 00:25:58.137
I didn't tell him one thing though.

338
00:25:58.768 --> 00:26:00.008
Your fake marriage.

339
00:26:04.307 --> 00:26:06.077
How did you find that out?

340
00:26:06.077 --> 00:26:08.817
Didn't you guys go to the wedding venue by bus?

341
00:26:09.877 --> 00:26:12.718
That doesn't happen normally.

342
00:26:14.218 --> 00:26:15.758
Especially when you are really getting married.

343
00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:36.377
I thought it was a bit funny at first.

344
00:26:36.377 --> 00:26:40.248
Do you think you'll need a handkerchief by any chance?

345
00:26:40.347 --> 00:26:42.617
I've heard the groom needs to wipe the bride's tears...

346
00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:45.347
when she cries.

347
00:26:45.347 --> 00:26:47.188
Why would I cry?

348
00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:49.057
That doesn't sound like me at all.

349
00:26:49.057 --> 00:26:52.288
I see. I'm really glad.

350
00:26:52.758 --> 00:26:56.928
By the way, I would love to pay half of your dress.

351
00:26:57.057 --> 00:27:00.468
Don't worry about it. It didn't cost me that much anyway.

352
00:27:00.468 --> 00:27:02.968
The more I listened, the weirder it got.

353
00:27:02.968 --> 00:27:06.168
You had to buy extra things like the bouquet and the wedding shoes.

354
00:27:06.168 --> 00:27:08.577
I will deduct those expenses from your rent next month.

355
00:27:09.837 --> 00:27:11.038
Thank you.

356
00:27:20.948 --> 00:27:22.488
Today?

357
00:27:22.887 --> 00:27:24.958
I can't. I have to work this evening.

358
00:27:29.097 --> 00:27:31.627
And you got off at the wedding venue where I work.

359
00:27:33.827 --> 00:27:37.337
Bok Nam, will you please set up the board in the waiting room?

360
00:27:37.337 --> 00:27:38.438
I will.

361
00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:40.768
Excuse me.

362
00:27:41.478 --> 00:27:42.577
It's okay.

363
00:27:55.958 --> 00:27:57.788
- I'm sorry. - It's fine.

364
00:28:02.797 --> 00:28:03.928
What's going on?

365
00:28:04.797 --> 00:28:06.228
So I thought...

366
00:28:06.228 --> 00:28:08.768
you two were not in a normal situation.

367
00:28:09.067 --> 00:28:11.137
I thought it was something like a contractual marriage.

368
00:28:11.538 --> 00:28:12.807
Well done.

369
00:28:13.907 --> 00:28:15.637
- Thank you. - Thanks for your work.

370
00:28:19.307 --> 00:28:21.107
Thank you, Bo Mi.

371
00:28:21.347 --> 00:28:22.617
Thank you so much.

372
00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:24.547
- Why don't you take one more? - What?

373
00:28:25.617 --> 00:28:28.488
We frame one picture for free.

374
00:28:28.617 --> 00:28:30.887
Why don't you take one more picture for that?

375
00:28:30.887 --> 00:28:31.958
- We don't need it. - Okay.

376
00:28:31.958 --> 00:28:33.458
Is it free? Then we'll do that.

377
00:28:33.458 --> 00:28:34.928
Go back to where you were.

378
00:28:42.567 --> 00:28:45.067
Don't you need to pose a little bit?

379
00:28:45.337 --> 00:28:47.538
You guys don't seem to be close to each other at all.

380
00:28:47.538 --> 00:28:48.678
Do they?

381
00:28:49.107 --> 00:28:51.208
Se Hee, try something else.

382
00:28:52.448 --> 00:28:53.877
Something else?

383
00:28:53.877 --> 00:28:55.047
You can kiss her.

384
00:28:55.047 --> 00:28:56.147
- What? - What?

385
00:28:56.478 --> 00:28:58.647
You can put your arm around her waist.

386
00:28:59.288 --> 00:29:00.887
It's a wedding picture.

387
00:29:01.147 --> 00:29:02.587
What you've done is so lame.

388
00:29:03.188 --> 00:29:06.887
They will blame the photographer for ages if that's the final result.

389
00:29:08.728 --> 00:29:11.228
Just try something.

390
00:29:12.367 --> 00:29:14.938
I mean, you two can at least try to be physically affectionate now.

391
00:29:24.307 --> 00:29:26.008
Okay.

392
00:29:26.448 --> 00:29:28.418
It's so much better, isn't it?

393
00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:32.218
I agree. Shaking hands can be also something physically affectionate.

394
00:29:32.587 --> 00:29:33.847
Here we go.

395
00:29:39.827 --> 00:29:42.428
How did you know about my signature?

396
00:29:42.428 --> 00:29:45.867
You signed when you were paying for the wedding venue.

397
00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:47.627
(Nam Se Hee)

398
00:29:48.867 --> 00:29:49.968
That's right.

399
00:29:50.867 --> 00:29:54.367
Then why did you take out the wrench?

400
00:29:54.538 --> 00:29:55.637
Why?

401
00:30:15.528 --> 00:30:19.228
I was going to open your beer. We didn't have a bottle opener.

402
00:30:20.567 --> 00:30:24.538
Why don't you drink now, you fake husband and wife?

403
00:30:25.107 --> 00:30:27.837
Or should I call you happy slappers?

404
00:30:28.837 --> 00:30:29.938
That's...

405
00:30:40.988 --> 00:30:44.018
By the way, I'll claim for the damages tomorrow.

406
00:30:46.988 --> 00:30:48.928
The motorcycle...

407
00:31:01.807 --> 00:31:04.678
Bok Nam.

408
00:31:06.008 --> 00:31:07.107
Mr. Yeon.

409
00:31:07.678 --> 00:31:09.678
No. Sir.

410
00:31:12.918 --> 00:31:14.117
Can I talk to you for a second?

411
00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:21.188
You came here early today. Did you only do the morning shift?

412
00:31:21.657 --> 00:31:23.627
Yes, I need some days like this.

413
00:31:27.827 --> 00:31:29.438
Are you going to the get-together today?

414
00:31:29.738 --> 00:31:30.968
The get-together?

415
00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:35.238
Do you mean the one with the high school classmates?

416
00:31:35.238 --> 00:31:36.538
I will definitely go.

417
00:31:36.607 --> 00:31:38.748
Isn't it for getting Su Jin's wedding invitation card too?

418
00:31:39.008 --> 00:31:41.008
Yes, it is.

419
00:31:41.377 --> 00:31:42.547
Is Ji Ho going to be there too?

420
00:31:43.418 --> 00:31:45.317
I want it to have some colors today.

421
00:31:45.948 --> 00:31:48.117
- Are you sure? - I'm off tomorrow. It's fine.

422
00:31:53.627 --> 00:31:55.528
- You are here. - I'm sorry.

423
00:31:57.228 --> 00:31:59.268
I'm sorry. Did you guys wait for a long time?

424
00:31:59.268 --> 00:32:00.698
It's okay. Aren't you cold?

425
00:32:00.698 --> 00:32:03.198
How did it go? Is Bok Nam really upset?

426
00:32:03.198 --> 00:32:05.238
Does Se Hee need to sell his house to pay back for his motorcycle?

427
00:32:05.238 --> 00:32:07.208
Stop speaking too fast.

428
00:32:08.208 --> 00:32:09.438
Did you guys sort things out?

429
00:32:10.377 --> 00:32:13.877
We don't have to sell the house.

430
00:32:14.547 --> 00:32:17.748
We talked to him well and it's all fine now.

431
00:32:18.518 --> 00:32:22.157
Something's different about that expensive motorcycle though.

432
00:32:23.887 --> 00:32:27.327
Everything's fine but the side mirror. We just need to...

433
00:32:28.928 --> 00:32:30.057
pay for that by installments.

434
00:32:31.127 --> 00:32:34.268
I just need to work harder because it's Bok Nam's store.

435
00:32:34.498 --> 00:32:37.367
Who knew he's the store owner's son?

436
00:32:37.998 --> 00:32:40.268
Anyway, it changed our view of...

437
00:32:40.268 --> 00:32:42.137
- your husband a little bit. - How?

438
00:32:42.137 --> 00:32:45.407
He's someone who doesn't spend any money, basically.

439
00:32:45.407 --> 00:32:47.407
But he tore down that expensive motorcycle.

440
00:32:47.407 --> 00:32:48.678
We were completely shocked.

441
00:32:49.418 --> 00:32:52.387
I was a bit shocked too.

442
00:32:52.448 --> 00:32:56.288
You didn't tell me, but I guess he's a devoted husband, right?

443
00:32:57.157 --> 00:33:01.127
That's the power of love. I know it's hard for you to understand.

444
00:33:01.127 --> 00:33:02.597
Stop being annoying.

445
00:33:02.928 --> 00:33:05.498
I'm not in a good mood because I'm going to this stupid get-together.

446
00:33:06.297 --> 00:33:07.498
What is that?

447
00:33:07.498 --> 00:33:09.297
I was curious about that too.

448
00:33:09.297 --> 00:33:11.097
What is it and why you guys call it like that?

449
00:33:11.607 --> 00:33:13.468
You'll know when you get there.

450
00:33:14.168 --> 00:33:15.377
I was thinking about cutting my hair.

451
00:33:15.538 --> 00:33:16.607
How are you?

452
00:33:16.607 --> 00:33:18.278
I'm so glad to hear that.

453
00:33:19.778 --> 00:33:20.907
- Earlier... - What I thought was...

454
00:33:22.117 --> 00:33:23.948
By the way, the cosmetics I use these days are...

455
00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:27.288
Ji Ho, say something about your marriage.

456
00:33:27.587 --> 00:33:29.258
We are actually pretty sad.

457
00:33:29.258 --> 00:33:32.188
How did you not tell us about it at all?

458
00:33:32.188 --> 00:33:34.627
I'm sorry. I was really busy.

459
00:33:34.688 --> 00:33:36.797
Where do you live now?

460
00:33:36.857 --> 00:33:39.498
Is it an apartment? Did you rent it or buy it?

461
00:33:40.097 --> 00:33:41.768
We bought it.

462
00:33:41.837 --> 00:33:44.198
- That's awesome. - Your husband must be making a lot.

463
00:33:44.198 --> 00:33:46.538
We took some loan out too.

464
00:33:46.538 --> 00:33:49.607
Who can buy a house without it these days? That's nothing.

465
00:33:49.607 --> 00:33:52.347
We were so happy like you guys are when we first got married.

466
00:33:52.678 --> 00:33:54.577
Are you happy because you are married now?

467
00:33:56.147 --> 00:33:57.748
Yes, I am.

468
00:34:04.418 --> 00:34:05.887
I think I am happy.

469
00:34:06.688 --> 00:34:08.327
What do you like about it?

470
00:34:08.458 --> 00:34:10.527
My husband also came home right away after work...

471
00:34:10.527 --> 00:34:12.427
and had good time with me during our first year.

472
00:34:13.128 --> 00:34:15.068
Doesn't he look for you right away when he gets home?

473
00:34:15.998 --> 00:34:18.608
What? Yes, he does.

474
00:34:19.038 --> 00:34:22.177
He does that a lot too.

475
00:34:22.938 --> 00:34:25.407
- Hey, Kitty. - He looks for me...

476
00:34:25.708 --> 00:34:28.148
- Kitty. - and calls out my name.

477
00:34:29.048 --> 00:34:30.378
When I go greet him,

478
00:34:31.847 --> 00:34:33.117
You're home.

479
00:34:42.097 --> 00:34:45.798
he holds me tight...

480
00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:47.398
Bye then.

481
00:34:48.637 --> 00:34:51.298
and brings me into our bedroom.

482
00:34:51.637 --> 00:34:52.668
- Gosh. - My goodness.

483
00:34:53.068 --> 00:34:55.637
- That's too hot. - That's very hot.

484
00:34:56.038 --> 00:34:58.378
But don't give birth too early.

485
00:34:58.507 --> 00:35:01.108
It's over once you give birth.

486
00:35:01.208 --> 00:35:04.788
Hey, that's possible only when we're in our 20s. We're too old now.

487
00:35:04.887 --> 00:35:08.788
You're right. I think it's better to give birth early too.

488
00:35:09.217 --> 00:35:12.958
But then that thought evaporates after visiting the in-law's.

489
00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:15.898
Hey, they must be way better than...

490
00:35:15.898 --> 00:35:17.298
the jerks I meet at work.

491
00:35:17.628 --> 00:35:18.967
Let's drink and get over it.

492
00:35:19.768 --> 00:35:21.068
Cheers.

493
00:35:22.338 --> 00:35:24.498
Soo Ji, do you still drink so much?

494
00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:26.108
You're amazing.

495
00:35:27.538 --> 00:35:29.807
I craved for beer so much when I was pregnant,

496
00:35:29.807 --> 00:35:32.077
so I calmed myself by watching beer commercials.

497
00:35:32.177 --> 00:35:34.878
Didn't you just want to look at Song Joong Ki, the commercial star?

498
00:35:36.248 --> 00:35:39.447
Hey, Park Bo Gum's way more popular than Song Joong Ki.

499
00:35:39.447 --> 00:35:42.557
How would single girls like you understand how I must've felt?

500
00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:43.757
I wouldn't know.

501
00:35:47.327 --> 00:35:48.798
Is there a smoking room?

502
00:35:48.927 --> 00:35:51.568
- You can smoke by the parking lot. - Okay.

503
00:35:52.027 --> 00:35:54.367
- Why did you ask that? - Because I might get fined...

504
00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:55.398
if I just smoke anywhere.

505
00:35:55.467 --> 00:35:58.307
That's right. The fine's about 100 dollars.

506
00:36:00.068 --> 00:36:01.068
Soo Ji.

507
00:36:01.438 --> 00:36:03.807
Aren't you going to get married?

508
00:36:04.077 --> 00:36:06.378
Yes, I don't want to.

509
00:36:06.548 --> 00:36:09.478
You might get married later if your thoughts change.

510
00:36:09.717 --> 00:36:12.418
You're right. I might if my thoughts change.

511
00:36:12.918 --> 00:36:16.518
Then shouldn't you quit smoking?

512
00:36:17.157 --> 00:36:19.987
- What? - Aren't I right?

513
00:36:20.228 --> 00:36:23.498
If you're going to give birth, you might want to quit smoking...

514
00:36:23.697 --> 00:36:26.128
because nicotine accumulates in your body.

515
00:36:26.128 --> 00:36:28.597
That's really bad for your body.

516
00:36:28.597 --> 00:36:31.038
- I see. - You're right. It's really bad.

517
00:36:31.038 --> 00:36:32.708
- Did you see that? - What?

518
00:36:33.038 --> 00:36:35.407
- They are... - That's right. If you want to...

519
00:36:35.407 --> 00:36:36.838
give birth, it's important to take care of your body.

520
00:36:37.038 --> 00:36:39.708
so nosy. That's the meaning of this get-together's name.

521
00:36:45.947 --> 00:36:49.188
Why do people get so nosy when they get married?

522
00:36:49.588 --> 00:36:50.818
They tell you to do this and that.

523
00:36:51.487 --> 00:36:53.188
That's why everyone gets married.

524
00:36:53.527 --> 00:36:57.358
The most fun part of life is to tell people what to do.

525
00:36:59.298 --> 00:37:00.298
Ho Rang.

526
00:37:00.628 --> 00:37:02.597
Didn't you eat something at the dinner?

527
00:37:03.168 --> 00:37:04.867
- Are you hungry? - Yes.

528
00:37:05.507 --> 00:37:06.568
I was hungry.

529
00:37:07.608 --> 00:37:10.177
I couldn't eat much there. My stomach was upset.

530
00:37:10.737 --> 00:37:13.608
I was the one who fought with them. Why would your stomach be upset?

531
00:37:14.177 --> 00:37:15.277
I was jealous.

532
00:37:16.617 --> 00:37:19.947
My stomach got upset because I was jealous of my married friends.

533
00:37:20.347 --> 00:37:21.717
So I couldn't eat anything.

534
00:37:28.427 --> 00:37:31.157
It's really different when we're in 30s. I'm getting out of shape too.

535
00:37:31.768 --> 00:37:34.898
I know. I get easily tired when I serve at the restaurant.

536
00:37:34.938 --> 00:37:36.467
My skin's older too.

537
00:37:36.697 --> 00:37:37.898
- Yesterday... - That's right.

538
00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:41.068
My body changed after giving birth. Didn't yours change too?

539
00:37:41.438 --> 00:37:43.777
Your kid's in kindergarten now. You're all done.

540
00:37:44.007 --> 00:37:47.307
That's nonsense. I have to take care of the kid for my whole life.

541
00:37:47.677 --> 00:37:50.378
I'm so tired. You know how I never weighed more than 46kg.

542
00:37:50.478 --> 00:37:52.617
I never weighed heavier than that.

543
00:37:52.788 --> 00:37:55.757
- That's how it is. - My weight changed too.

544
00:37:55.788 --> 00:37:57.117
I can't be on diet too.

545
00:38:10.438 --> 00:38:11.467
Bye guys.

546
00:38:16.007 --> 00:38:17.208
Bye.

547
00:38:19.208 --> 00:38:21.478
Gosh, my skirt's going to explode.

548
00:38:21.478 --> 00:38:23.518
I haven't had that much food for a while.

549
00:38:24.117 --> 00:38:26.847
Then shall we walk for a bit?

550
00:38:27.148 --> 00:38:28.358
Shall we?

551
00:38:31.088 --> 00:38:34.458
Hee Ji and Young Ok became best friends after they got married.

552
00:38:35.257 --> 00:38:36.298
I know.

553
00:38:36.427 --> 00:38:39.367
They never got along before.

554
00:38:40.798 --> 00:38:41.867
Ji Ho, you too.

555
00:38:42.597 --> 00:38:44.197
What? Me?

556
00:38:44.668 --> 00:38:46.737
They weren't comfortable with you before.

557
00:38:46.967 --> 00:38:49.438
But they're much closer to you after you got married.

558
00:38:49.777 --> 00:38:51.648
You guys have a common ground.

559
00:38:52.777 --> 00:38:55.677
That's because we haven't seen each other for a long time.

560
00:38:56.248 --> 00:38:59.987
To be honest, there's nothing wrong with what they said earlier.

561
00:39:00.617 --> 00:39:03.318
- About what? - In the end, women...

562
00:39:03.318 --> 00:39:04.657
are the ones that give birth.

563
00:39:05.157 --> 00:39:08.097
So it's better to give birth when we're younger and healthier.

564
00:39:08.597 --> 00:39:12.197
Then it's only right to get married when I'm younger.

565
00:39:13.697 --> 00:39:14.838
Ho Rang.

566
00:39:16.168 --> 00:39:19.708
Why do you want to get married?

567
00:39:27.048 --> 00:39:28.217
You know this, right?

568
00:39:28.818 --> 00:39:31.818
I never wore black clothes when I was young.

569
00:39:32.418 --> 00:39:33.518
Of course.

570
00:39:33.847 --> 00:39:37.157
Your clothes were all red, pink, and yellow.

571
00:39:37.717 --> 00:39:39.057
Whenever we hung out,

572
00:39:39.358 --> 00:39:41.927
Soo Ji and I would guess what color your outfit...

573
00:39:42.398 --> 00:39:43.527
would be on that day.

574
00:39:43.998 --> 00:39:45.867
But when I open my closet now,

575
00:39:46.298 --> 00:39:49.668
I only select clothes that don't stand out.

576
00:39:50.398 --> 00:39:52.737
They suit every other clothes...

577
00:39:53.208 --> 00:39:55.137
and they don't look fancy.

578
00:39:57.108 --> 00:39:58.248
That's why I like them now.

579
00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.518
You know,

580
00:40:01.878 --> 00:40:05.347
there's this woman whom my mom hangs out with...

581
00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:08.387
who works as a team manager in an insurance company.

582
00:40:09.418 --> 00:40:12.188
She's really fit because she works out and watches her diet,

583
00:40:12.387 --> 00:40:13.757
and she has no wrinkles.

584
00:40:14.157 --> 00:40:16.057
She makes a lot of money too.

585
00:40:16.557 --> 00:40:19.867
She always treats meals to my mom and her friends.

586
00:40:20.197 --> 00:40:23.168
And the other ladies envy her for being so cool.

587
00:40:23.938 --> 00:40:25.068
I see.

588
00:40:26.137 --> 00:40:27.338
But...

589
00:40:28.237 --> 00:40:29.878
whenever my mom and her friends go somewhere,

590
00:40:30.338 --> 00:40:32.347
they always leave that lady out.

591
00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:35.018
Really? Why?

592
00:40:35.478 --> 00:40:36.947
That lady...

593
00:40:38.788 --> 00:40:40.188
is the red coat.

594
00:40:43.887 --> 00:40:46.257
She couldn't get married because she was too busy working.

595
00:40:48.927 --> 00:40:50.298
Ji Ho,

596
00:40:51.358 --> 00:40:54.668
I just want to live an ordinary life like everyone else.

597
00:40:56.568 --> 00:40:58.338
A life as a married woman...

598
00:40:59.007 --> 00:41:01.068
with a husband and children.

599
00:41:02.108 --> 00:41:05.277
I want to talk about in-laws and raising kids...

600
00:41:05.978 --> 00:41:07.677
with my friends.

601
00:41:08.478 --> 00:41:12.188
I want to wear black coats that fit in everywhere.

602
00:41:15.518 --> 00:41:18.958
I want to be like everyone else who doesn't stand out.

603
00:41:20.827 --> 00:41:23.097
I want to do what everyone else does...

604
00:41:23.697 --> 00:41:27.097
and share similar stories we can all laugh about.

605
00:41:28.438 --> 00:41:29.798
That's my dream.

606
00:41:31.938 --> 00:41:33.608
To me,

607
00:41:34.737 --> 00:41:37.177
marriage is something that proves...

608
00:41:38.007 --> 00:41:39.978
that I'm all right and I have a value as a woman.

609
00:41:41.077 --> 00:41:44.378
Marriage is like that black coat.

610
00:41:48.358 --> 00:41:49.487
Ho Rang...

611
00:41:50.057 --> 00:41:52.958
was a girl who looked good in red.

612
00:41:54.458 --> 00:41:56.697
Darn it. What's taking her so long?

613
00:41:57.757 --> 00:42:00.367
- She'll come. - Ji Ho! Soo Ji!

614
00:42:04.597 --> 00:42:05.938
Goodness, I want to go home.

615
00:42:06.168 --> 00:42:08.307
- Hold on. - Why?

616
00:42:09.538 --> 00:42:10.907
Are you a red light or something?

617
00:42:11.108 --> 00:42:12.807
What? Isn't it pretty?

618
00:42:13.108 --> 00:42:14.777
It's gross.

619
00:42:15.248 --> 00:42:16.418
- Let's go. - Let's go!

620
00:42:17.018 --> 00:42:18.987
She was always confident...

621
00:42:19.617 --> 00:42:21.557
even when she wore a coat that stands out.

622
00:42:22.117 --> 00:42:23.717
That's how Ho Rang used to be.

623
00:42:26.887 --> 00:42:29.257
(Friends)

624
00:42:29.257 --> 00:42:31.257
(Kyung Hye)

625
00:42:52.347 --> 00:42:54.018
When did we...

626
00:42:55.117 --> 00:42:57.018
begin to feel shame...

627
00:42:57.418 --> 00:42:59.788
for wearing a different color?

628
00:43:04.498 --> 00:43:06.728
What's even bitter...

629
00:43:07.367 --> 00:43:09.467
In 1, 2, 3.

630
00:43:11.197 --> 00:43:12.407
is that...

631
00:43:12.907 --> 00:43:15.907
I also felt quite happy for wearing a black coat...

632
00:43:16.378 --> 00:43:18.177
that resembles marriage.

633
00:43:21.478 --> 00:43:23.878
No, to be more honest...

634
00:43:27.918 --> 00:43:29.818
Ji Ho, congratulations on your marriage once again.

635
00:43:29.918 --> 00:43:31.757
Since we're all married women, let's see each other more often.

636
00:43:31.827 --> 00:43:34.088
That's right. Let's all meet with our husbands.

637
00:43:34.188 --> 00:43:35.798
Welcome to married life.

638
00:43:37.527 --> 00:43:38.628
It felt really good.

639
00:43:39.668 --> 00:43:41.568
It felt good...

640
00:43:42.668 --> 00:43:44.038
to belong somewhere.

641
00:44:05.057 --> 00:44:07.288
What are you doing here?

642
00:44:07.688 --> 00:44:10.898
You texted me earlier that you're coming by bus.

643
00:44:14.298 --> 00:44:15.867
It was getting late,

644
00:44:17.068 --> 00:44:20.108
and there was an incident with Bok Nam yesterday.

645
00:44:21.137 --> 00:44:24.478
So I was a little worried...

646
00:44:25.048 --> 00:44:26.748
as a co-inhabitant.

647
00:44:29.117 --> 00:44:32.318
As a co-inhabitant?

648
00:44:33.588 --> 00:44:34.688
Yes.

649
00:44:36.057 --> 00:44:40.088
Is it like a favor done by a landlord?

650
00:44:40.088 --> 00:44:42.657
Or are you caring for me since I'm a tenant?

651
00:44:43.527 --> 00:44:47.097
No, it's more like a soccer club owner...

652
00:44:47.097 --> 00:44:49.838
caring for its own players.

653
00:44:51.407 --> 00:44:52.507
I see.

654
00:44:53.307 --> 00:44:54.467
Shall we get going?

655
00:44:59.048 --> 00:45:01.108
You met with your alumni?

656
00:45:01.577 --> 00:45:02.717
Yes.

657
00:45:03.648 --> 00:45:07.418
It was actually a little weird.

658
00:45:09.057 --> 00:45:12.288
They aren't that close to me,

659
00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:15.728
but because I got married,

660
00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:20.298
I felt much closer to them.

661
00:45:21.228 --> 00:45:24.438
It sort of felt like belonging in a group.

662
00:45:25.637 --> 00:45:27.768
I haven't felt that way for a long time.

663
00:45:30.077 --> 00:45:31.277
It actually...

664
00:45:34.818 --> 00:45:37.478
felt good.

665
00:45:37.947 --> 00:45:41.188
I guess you're going through a phase of belonging somewhere.

666
00:45:42.117 --> 00:45:44.487
- Pardon? - Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

667
00:45:44.728 --> 00:45:49.157
People seek for the next level of need after satisfying one.

668
00:45:49.628 --> 00:45:50.898
Why are you...

669
00:45:52.527 --> 00:45:54.998
suddenly talking about Maslow?

670
00:45:54.998 --> 00:45:58.168
It's not sudden. Your current condition...

671
00:45:58.307 --> 00:46:00.768
is the basic need of humans.

672
00:46:01.907 --> 00:46:04.038
For you, you are satisfying...

673
00:46:04.038 --> 00:46:07.177
the most basic needs through marriage.

674
00:46:07.177 --> 00:46:11.148
And through me, you're satisfying the next need, which is safety.

675
00:46:11.148 --> 00:46:13.918
So now you're in the third level, which is the need of belonging.

676
00:46:14.248 --> 00:46:17.818
You now have to satisfy the need of belonging somewhere.

677
00:46:18.228 --> 00:46:20.088
I'm just saying those feelings...

678
00:46:20.487 --> 00:46:22.728
are just animal-like needs.

679
00:46:22.958 --> 00:46:26.027
I feel this occasionally.

680
00:46:26.298 --> 00:46:30.038
They're all vain needs of humans.

681
00:46:30.367 --> 00:46:34.038
He's sometimes really obnoxious.

682
00:46:38.608 --> 00:46:40.947
Why are you looking at me like that?

683
00:46:44.048 --> 00:46:45.887
There are...

684
00:46:47.347 --> 00:46:48.458
no stars in the sky tonight.

685
00:46:52.657 --> 00:46:55.027
I transferred this month's rental today.

686
00:46:56.027 --> 00:46:57.898
Yes, I checked it.

687
00:47:25.922 --> 00:47:29.154
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E09 Because This is My First Life

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

688
00:47:42.006 --> 00:47:43.306
Ho Rang, are you still sleeping?

689
00:47:43.736 --> 00:47:44.835
Yes.

690
00:47:45.935 --> 00:47:48.705
Get up. It's noon already.

691
00:47:49.105 --> 00:47:52.516
Let me sleep some more. I should sleep in on my day off.

692
00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:55.415
Hurry! I want to hang the blankets outside when the sun's out.

693
00:47:59.315 --> 00:48:03.625
Why are you cleaning so hard today of all days?

694
00:48:03.886 --> 00:48:05.326
Stop scratching already.

695
00:48:05.656 --> 00:48:07.995
Ho Rang, you might get dandruff.

696
00:48:09.266 --> 00:48:10.366
What?

697
00:48:10.466 --> 00:48:13.665
Now that we're in our seventh year, you don't care anymore.

698
00:48:13.665 --> 00:48:16.006
You used to get up first and wash your hair.

699
00:48:16.006 --> 00:48:18.775
You even put on makeup. But look at you now.

700
00:48:20.335 --> 00:48:23.545
You're the one who's being ridiculous.

701
00:48:23.975 --> 00:48:25.516
Don't start with me today.

702
00:48:25.516 --> 00:48:27.676
I'm not doing anything including washing.

703
00:48:30.716 --> 00:48:33.516
Get up already.

704
00:48:33.886 --> 00:48:35.025
What's this?

705
00:48:36.225 --> 00:48:37.786
Is this dirt in your nails?

706
00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:39.156
How gross.

707
00:48:39.756 --> 00:48:42.466
Ho Rang, there's dirt in your nails.

708
00:48:42.466 --> 00:48:45.096
Hey! What are you talking about?

709
00:48:45.096 --> 00:48:46.795
Look at them closely! There's nothing...

710
00:48:48.766 --> 00:48:50.036
Won Seok.

711
00:48:51.375 --> 00:48:52.736
Look at that.

712
00:48:55.705 --> 00:48:58.145
What's this?

713
00:48:58.875 --> 00:49:02.846
Ho Rang, remember my favorite mathematician?

714
00:49:03.446 --> 00:49:04.716
Mr. Kurt Godel.

715
00:49:04.915 --> 00:49:07.815
His theorem of incompleteness...

716
00:49:07.955 --> 00:49:10.286
is the basis of today's computer system.

717
00:49:10.455 --> 00:49:11.756
There's a saying...

718
00:49:12.056 --> 00:49:14.625
that there's a mathematical proposition...

719
00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:17.525
that cannot be proven even if it's the mathematical truth.

720
00:49:20.565 --> 00:49:25.136
I think for all this time, I wanted to prove myself to you.

721
00:49:26.105 --> 00:49:28.076
But what I realized is...

722
00:49:28.906 --> 00:49:32.815
that our love will never be completely proven.

723
00:49:34.516 --> 00:49:36.446
It's because our love is the perfect truth.

724
00:49:39.786 --> 00:49:42.125
Do you get what I mean?

725
00:49:45.225 --> 00:49:49.125
Do you think I understand...

726
00:49:51.435 --> 00:49:52.636
what you mean?

727
00:49:54.065 --> 00:49:56.866
Stop talking developer's nonsense and say it now.

728
00:50:00.406 --> 00:50:05.045
I'll never make you feel insecure anymore.

729
00:50:07.176 --> 00:50:08.446
So Ho Rang,

730
00:50:09.886 --> 00:50:11.045
will you...

731
00:50:16.656 --> 00:50:18.125
marry me?

732
00:50:42.846 --> 00:50:46.355
Am I really getting married?

733
00:50:46.355 --> 00:50:49.286
Yes, we are really getting married.

734
00:50:51.656 --> 00:50:54.926
You should've proposed when I'm looking pretty, not like this.

735
00:50:54.926 --> 00:50:57.565
That's why I told you to wash up.

736
00:51:41.006 --> 00:51:44.475
What's this? Where's this water dripping from?

737
00:51:48.045 --> 00:51:49.216
What's going on?

738
00:51:53.915 --> 00:51:56.256
Let's wrap up our meeting today.

739
00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:59.895
Ms. Yoon Bo Mi. Your boss is talking.

740
00:51:59.895 --> 00:52:01.056
Have a seat.

741
00:52:06.065 --> 00:52:10.105
Everyone, I have good news.

742
00:52:10.435 --> 00:52:14.335
I scouted a super competent developer to our company.

743
00:52:14.335 --> 00:52:15.545
- Really? - Really?

744
00:52:15.545 --> 00:52:16.645
Who is it?

745
00:52:16.875 --> 00:52:19.346
Many of you might know this person.

746
00:52:19.516 --> 00:52:20.616
I present...

747
00:52:21.076 --> 00:52:22.915
Mr. Shim Won Seok.

748
00:52:24.245 --> 00:52:25.355
Give him a hand.

749
00:52:28.656 --> 00:52:29.926
What's wrong with you guys?

750
00:52:31.556 --> 00:52:33.326
Let's talk outside.

751
00:52:36.995 --> 00:52:39.335
Please wrap up the meeting.

752
00:52:43.036 --> 00:52:44.636
Why are they against him?

753
00:52:45.176 --> 00:52:46.306
What do you mean?

754
00:52:46.775 --> 00:52:48.446
That's because "Get Up" was a complete failure.

755
00:52:48.506 --> 00:52:52.415
If you're scouting him based on friendship and sympathy,

756
00:52:52.475 --> 00:52:55.886
I thought it was only right for me to stop you on behalf of them.

757
00:52:56.446 --> 00:53:00.315
Se Hee, do you think I'm a corrupted man?

758
00:53:00.556 --> 00:53:03.085
Won Seok might look naive,

759
00:53:03.085 --> 00:53:04.525
but he's a real genius.

760
00:53:04.525 --> 00:53:05.926
Do you remember the sensational website, "07 Finder"?

761
00:53:06.196 --> 00:53:09.725
You know the freshman of Computer Engineering department...

762
00:53:09.866 --> 00:53:12.866
who made the website for finding a hot girl from the class of 2007.

763
00:53:12.866 --> 00:53:16.036
It was so popular and its server was down many times.

764
00:53:17.105 --> 00:53:19.306
Won Seok made that website.

765
00:53:19.576 --> 00:53:22.205
Do you know how old he was then? He was only 18.

766
00:53:22.275 --> 00:53:25.516
He went to school earlier and finished high school earlier too.

767
00:53:25.516 --> 00:53:29.085
He was the top though he's two years younger than others in the class.

768
00:53:30.245 --> 00:53:33.016
I know he doesn't really know...

769
00:53:33.315 --> 00:53:36.156
about business.

770
00:53:36.455 --> 00:53:39.556
But as a developer, he is the best.

771
00:53:39.625 --> 00:53:42.065
It's true. Do you not believe me, Se Hee?

772
00:53:45.466 --> 00:53:47.395
What's that face?

773
00:53:47.866 --> 00:53:50.565
You are making a face like you are looking at a stray cat in the rain.

774
00:53:50.705 --> 00:53:51.775
No.

775
00:53:52.435 --> 00:53:54.745
- What are you talking about? - No!

776
00:53:56.605 --> 00:53:59.745
Do you know what the most annoying thing is in the world?

777
00:54:00.076 --> 00:54:02.685
Having to stop pooping half way, not wiping after pooping,

778
00:54:02.685 --> 00:54:04.386
and someone not saying what he was trying to say.

779
00:54:04.516 --> 00:54:07.085
I see. Let's go out and talk.

780
00:54:07.286 --> 00:54:09.025
Why do we have to go out? It's cold outside.

781
00:54:12.025 --> 00:54:13.225
I see.

782
00:54:15.525 --> 00:54:18.335
Mr. Ma. Did you...

783
00:54:19.466 --> 00:54:20.665
cry by any chance?

784
00:54:27.275 --> 00:54:28.375
Why would I cry?

785
00:54:29.446 --> 00:54:31.716
What? What do you mean?

786
00:54:32.145 --> 00:54:34.446
Your eyes go red like that after crying.

787
00:54:34.745 --> 00:54:36.815
Your skin under your eyes is more sensitive than others'.

788
00:54:37.745 --> 00:54:41.355
What are you talking about? What is red?

789
00:54:43.355 --> 00:54:45.855
What do you know about my skin?

790
00:54:46.426 --> 00:54:47.895
What do you know about me?

791
00:54:48.395 --> 00:54:49.395
I see.

792
00:54:49.795 --> 00:54:52.366
Even though I've known you for 18 years,

793
00:54:52.935 --> 00:54:55.506
I cannot say I know everything about you.

794
00:54:55.705 --> 00:54:59.036
Yes, even though you are my closest friend, you cannot know everything.

795
00:54:59.205 --> 00:55:01.705
Look. I'm just allergic to something.

796
00:55:01.705 --> 00:55:03.245
So this part is always a bit red like this.

797
00:55:03.446 --> 00:55:05.875
Why would I cry? It's normally red like this anyway.

798
00:55:06.245 --> 00:55:09.216
That's true. Everyone doesn't know everything about himself.

799
00:55:09.685 --> 00:55:11.556
So a person wouldn't know everything about the other person either.

800
00:55:13.355 --> 00:55:14.455
That's right.

801
00:55:17.855 --> 00:55:18.995
By the way,

802
00:55:20.196 --> 00:55:21.225
Yes?

803
00:55:21.225 --> 00:55:23.826
why did you cry?

804
00:55:28.506 --> 00:55:30.605
It looks totally fine like it's new.

805
00:55:31.705 --> 00:55:32.835
I know, right?

806
00:55:33.975 --> 00:55:37.506
I wanted to keep it clean until I say goodbye to it though.

807
00:55:38.545 --> 00:55:39.745
"Until I say goodbye"?

808
00:55:40.815 --> 00:55:43.185
Are you trying to sell it to someone?

809
00:55:43.745 --> 00:55:45.085
How much would you like to get from it?

810
00:55:50.386 --> 00:55:51.455
It's a secret.

811
00:56:02.205 --> 00:56:03.665
He's so adorable.

812
00:56:04.136 --> 00:56:07.636
I think I will sleep with you if I stay with you more tonight.

813
00:56:07.676 --> 00:56:08.775
By the way,

814
00:56:08.875 --> 00:56:12.116
the room number was 304. It wasn't 303. The room we stayed, you know.

815
00:56:12.116 --> 00:56:14.475
Did I say I wanted to date you? I said I wanted to sleep with you.

816
00:56:15.446 --> 00:56:16.516
That's right.

817
00:56:17.185 --> 00:56:18.756
I'm evil.

818
00:56:18.986 --> 00:56:21.685
I'm evil and that's why I can survive in this field.

819
00:56:37.165 --> 00:56:38.306
Mr. Ma.

820
00:57:00.895 --> 00:57:01.895
Excuse me,

821
00:57:09.006 --> 00:57:10.065
are you crying?

822
00:57:12.475 --> 00:57:13.475
Why are you...

823
00:57:15.645 --> 00:57:16.846
Are you sick?

824
00:57:29.325 --> 00:57:30.325
Why are you...

825
00:57:32.495 --> 00:57:33.696
Are you sick?

826
00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.760
- Mr. Ma! - Mr. Ma!

827
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.829
Come with me.

828
00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:48.670
- Where is he? - Mr. Ma!

829
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:50.291
- Where is he? - Mr. Ma!

830
00:57:51.698 --> 00:57:52.897
I couldn't find him here.

831
00:57:54.328 --> 00:57:55.967
Then where is he?

832
00:57:56.138 --> 00:57:57.868
- Let's go this way. - Mr. Ma!

833
00:58:02.408 --> 00:58:04.678
If your employees find their boss crying,

834
00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:06.978
it will be really embarrassing.

835
00:58:10.047 --> 00:58:12.817
What is it? Are you really sick or something?

836
00:58:13.217 --> 00:58:14.388
Do you want me to take you to a hospital?

837
00:58:16.217 --> 00:58:17.888
I thought about it,

838
00:58:19.728 --> 00:58:21.428
but I don't think I can give up my work.

839
00:58:22.797 --> 00:58:23.928
What?

840
00:58:24.928 --> 00:58:26.868
I thought about it a lot.

841
00:58:30.967 --> 00:58:33.208
I don't think I can sell my company.

842
00:58:38.547 --> 00:58:40.308
But if I don't do that,

843
00:58:42.647 --> 00:58:44.547
I can't see you anymore.

844
00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:46.448
So...

845
00:58:47.788 --> 00:58:49.288
my heart is...

846
00:58:50.558 --> 00:58:52.158
aching so much.

847
00:58:54.587 --> 00:58:58.527
If you really want to sleep with me, sell your company and quit your job.

848
00:58:59.598 --> 00:59:00.928
Then I will date you.

849
00:59:02.237 --> 00:59:05.067
Just because I told you to...

850
00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:07.837
sell your company away...

851
00:59:08.377 --> 00:59:09.678
Did you take it seriously?

852
00:59:10.337 --> 00:59:12.547
Love matters to me.

853
00:59:13.308 --> 00:59:14.377
But...

854
00:59:15.978 --> 00:59:18.587
my work matters too.

855
00:59:19.487 --> 00:59:21.658
It's really embarrassing.

856
00:59:22.518 --> 00:59:23.717
But...

857
00:59:26.458 --> 00:59:28.428
just the thought of not seeing you made me this way.

858
00:59:38.138 --> 00:59:39.308
Can I...

859
00:59:41.467 --> 00:59:42.507
kiss you now?

860
00:59:45.877 --> 00:59:46.908
What?

861
00:59:48.478 --> 00:59:49.547
What did you say?

862
00:59:49.647 --> 00:59:51.047
Can I kiss you now?

863
00:59:54.118 --> 00:59:57.257
Don't do this to me. I cannot give up my work.

864
00:59:57.958 --> 00:59:59.357
So? Should I not kiss you?

865
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:02.328
That's not what I meant.

866
01:00:05.627 --> 01:00:06.768
Should I do it then?

867
01:00:08.467 --> 01:00:09.538
Yes.

868
01:00:24.248 --> 01:00:27.888
Most of us misunderstand others.

869
01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:32.627
We shouldn't say,

870
01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:35.598
"I know how you feel."

871
01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:46.937
Where's Mr. Ma?

872
01:00:49.538 --> 01:00:52.208
Let's go to the cafe. I'll buy you a cake.

873
01:00:53.948 --> 01:00:55.748
The reason I'm hopeful is...

874
01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:59.587
because I know people have their limits.

875
01:01:03.257 --> 01:01:04.388
Hi, how are you?

876
01:01:07.857 --> 01:01:09.698
Unless we try hard,

877
01:01:10.828 --> 01:01:13.797
we can't understand each other.

878
01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:21.877
Love exists...

879
01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.678
in this kind of world.

880
01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:31.448
Mr. Shim, I heard you are moving to Gyul Mal Ae.

881
01:01:31.547 --> 01:01:32.948
Is that why you stopped our project?

882
01:01:33.388 --> 01:01:35.757
I feel pathetic for wasting two years just because of you.

883
01:01:36.018 --> 01:01:37.487
Let's see how it goes.

884
01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:40.558
As long as you love someone,

885
01:01:41.087 --> 01:01:43.558
we have to try hard.

886
01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:44.928
Here I am! I'm all ready!

887
01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:47.598
What do you think? Do I look good?

888
01:01:51.638 --> 01:01:53.268
- Isn't it pretty? - It is.

889
01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:56.837
Trying hard for the other person...

890
01:01:57.308 --> 01:01:58.607
makes life...

891
01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:02.277
something worth trying.

892
01:02:07.618 --> 01:02:09.817
(We have to work hard as long as we're in love.)

893
01:02:12.928 --> 01:02:15.897
That book must be fun. You're always reading it.

894
01:02:16.897 --> 01:02:19.328
Yes, it's fun.

895
01:02:22.768 --> 01:02:25.507
Are you still mad at me?

896
01:02:25.667 --> 01:02:26.837
What do you mean?

897
01:02:28.237 --> 01:02:30.078
Oh, you mean how I almost ruined myself...

898
01:02:30.078 --> 01:02:32.507
because I tried to hit on you?

899
01:02:34.377 --> 01:02:35.777
I'm really sorry.

900
01:02:37.248 --> 01:02:40.047
I'm letting it go because your fake husband is cool.

901
01:02:40.618 --> 01:02:42.458
I never thought I'd fall by such words.

902
01:02:42.788 --> 01:02:44.518
You have a sweet landlord.

903
01:02:45.058 --> 01:02:46.187
What did he say?

904
01:02:47.027 --> 01:02:50.297
I asked him when he came to pay for the rearview mirror.

905
01:02:50.297 --> 01:02:51.667
I asked him why he married you.

906
01:02:51.728 --> 01:02:54.067
So? What did he say?

907
01:03:33.667 --> 01:03:36.538
Why didn't Mr. Ma come today?

908
01:03:36.708 --> 01:03:38.248
Oh, Mr. Ma...

909
01:03:39.547 --> 01:03:41.478
had another important plan.

910
01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:46.917
Oh, I heard Won Seok is going to work in your company.

911
01:03:47.288 --> 01:03:49.018
Yes, I think he's going to work in my team.

912
01:03:50.788 --> 01:03:51.987
I see.

913
01:03:55.158 --> 01:03:59.328
There are so many stars in the sky tonight.

914
01:04:04.268 --> 01:04:06.308
Is that the Big Dipper?

915
01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:48.917
What's that?

916
01:04:49.817 --> 01:04:51.618
They're our wedding photos.

917
01:04:56.987 --> 01:04:58.788
They look nice.

918
01:04:59.127 --> 01:05:00.687
I forgot about them.

919
01:05:01.127 --> 01:05:03.127
My colleagues worked on them...

920
01:05:03.257 --> 01:05:04.728
as a wedding gift.

921
01:05:10.567 --> 01:05:12.437
It looks quite empty.

922
01:05:13.467 --> 01:05:15.337
You should've called more people.

923
01:05:17.377 --> 01:05:20.547
Actually, I don't have that many friends.

924
01:05:20.607 --> 01:05:22.018
I have only these two.

925
01:05:22.348 --> 01:05:23.877
Two is a lot.

926
01:05:26.817 --> 01:05:28.288
That's not a lot.

927
01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:31.627
I think having just one friend...

928
01:05:32.187 --> 01:05:33.757
is more than enough in life.

929
01:05:35.297 --> 01:05:36.828
That's how I think.

930
01:05:42.237 --> 01:05:43.538
What about love?

931
01:05:47.538 --> 01:05:49.808
Does that apply to love?

932
01:05:51.277 --> 01:05:55.877
I think one love is also enough...

933
01:05:57.147 --> 01:05:58.348
in life.

934
01:06:02.357 --> 01:06:03.558
Sure.

935
01:06:04.288 --> 01:06:07.857
I agree.

936
01:06:09.328 --> 01:06:10.857
In life,

937
01:06:12.027 --> 01:06:13.297
having one love...

938
01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.368
is more than enough.

939
01:06:19.168 --> 01:06:22.277
Soo Ji once said that it's better to meet as many boyfriends...

940
01:06:22.277 --> 01:06:24.708
as possible, just like real estate agents.

941
01:06:30.647 --> 01:06:33.288
Ho Rang once said the one you're marrying...

942
01:06:33.288 --> 01:06:36.118
is the love and destiny of life.

943
01:06:37.718 --> 01:06:39.227
But for me,

944
01:06:43.727 --> 01:06:45.798
ever since I was young, I thought having one love...

945
01:06:46.027 --> 01:06:50.538
in life is more than enough.

(Wife: Jung Min)

950
01:07:39.218 --> 01:07:42.817
I like someone.

951
01:07:44.487 --> 01:07:47.158
- What are you talking about? - Who?

952
01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.767
My husband.

953
01:07:54.698 --> 01:07:56.097
Are you kidding me?

954
01:07:56.237 --> 01:07:58.737
What are you doing? Are you rubbing it in?

955
01:07:58.737 --> 01:08:01.237
Then I'm going to say out loud that I love Won Seok.

956
01:08:01.538 --> 01:08:03.807
These wenches. Go to sleep already!

957
01:08:23.828 --> 01:08:26.128
The one and only love in my life...

958
01:08:30.968 --> 01:08:32.368
has begun.

(Because This Is My First Life)

960
01:08:59.597 --> 01:09:03.237
I love being married.

961
01:09:03.368 --> 01:09:05.307
Having a crush on your husband...

962
01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.168
after marriage must not be easy.

963
01:09:07.168 --> 01:09:08.277
Is it that obvious?

964
01:09:08.807 --> 01:09:10.338
Is it because of this?

965
01:09:10.338 --> 01:09:12.578
Your immediate superior is that lady.

966
01:09:12.647 --> 01:09:15.177
Are you okay with working here?

967
01:09:15.177 --> 01:09:16.347
I'm getting married!

968
01:09:17.777 --> 01:09:19.987
Are you writing a contract for going out with me?

969
01:09:19.987 --> 01:09:22.317
I like you. I'd love to go out with you.

970
01:09:22.317 --> 01:09:25.987
You and Soo Ji? Your life is ruined now. You can never fix it.

971
01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:27.088
Sang Goo, my darling.

972
01:09:27.088 --> 01:09:29.198
How are you going to make everything alone?

973
01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.628
How can I make my daughter-in-law work when she's so precious?

974
01:09:31.628 --> 01:09:33.767
Ji Ho is now getting what in-laws are like.

975
01:09:33.767 --> 01:09:37.298
Is there any way...

976
01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.307
to get inside his heart?
