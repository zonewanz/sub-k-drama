1
00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.549
Please come home, I have something
to tell you in a hurry,

2
00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.719
Grandma, I don't like this,
Can I just not do this?

3
00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.149
No,

4
00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.189
The police officer will scold you,

5
00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.419
Where are we going?

6
00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.230
We're going to meet the woman
we talked about,

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.730
Do you mean the one with
the big eyes that hates me?

8
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.969
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.329
She doesn't hate you,

10
00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.069
Will I be able to see Dad there?

11
00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:39.910
He's at the hospital,

12
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.709
You need to behave there,

13
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.109
That way, she will like you,

14
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.279
I miss Dad,

15
00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.190
I'll move out with Yeon Ju,

16
00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.800
What? Hey,

17
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.359
I've thought over it,

18
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.499
You told me to choose one,

19
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.439
But I can't do that,

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.010
Both Yeon Ju and Han Gyul,,,

21
00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:16.139
mean so much to me,

22
00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:19.049
So what you're saying is,,,

23
00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.450
you're going to split me from
my child and destroy my life,

24
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.889
But you're going to be happy
with both of them?

25
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.790
I'm sorry, I have no other choice,

26
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.919
Hey, Be quiet!

27
00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.490
Follow me outside,

28
00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.689
I can't do that, Father!

29
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.600
This won't change anything,

30
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.499
What? Follow me!

31
00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:41.669
Let me go!

32
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.200
This isn't your life, It's my life,

33
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.269
You've ruined my life enough,

34
00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.710
What more do you want from me?

35
00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.850
Please, I beg you, Stay out of this,

36
00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.919
I'm going to live my own life
from now on,

37
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.820
You jerk! How dare you!

38
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.859
Hard work is wasted,

39
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.600
The child has driven him crazy,

40
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.230
He's gone crazy,

41
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.970
You jerk,

42
00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.470
Do you know how I raised you?

43
00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.440
I put so much effort
into raising you!

44
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.239
I know what I mean to you,

45
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.350
I know that you treat me preciously
and that I'm your pride and hope,

46
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.519
If you know that,
how can you do this to me?

47
00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.950
I'm doing this because I know,

48
00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.820
Until now, I've been trying to
live up to your expectations,

49
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.820
But I don't want to do that anymore,

50
00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.190
I feel so burdened,
Please let me go,

51
00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.869
All right, All right,

52
00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.030
Okay,

53
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.470
So you're saying you want to
live your own life?

54
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.579
But what it is
that you've decided to do?

55
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.250
I have tried to persuade you
over and over again,,,

56
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.579
even I was being embarrassed,

57
00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.820
But you still didn't understand
what I mean?

58
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.060
Is disobeying your father,,,

59
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.660
and making your wife become,,,

60
00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.530
an undutiful daughter the only thing
your clever brain could think of?

61
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.329
- Father,
- I don't want to hear anymore,

62
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.839
It's been decided that your mother
and I will raise Han Gyul,

63
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.739
It has been decided,
You can't say anything now,

64
00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.780
And I can't let some like you,,,

65
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.450
raise a child,

66
00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:34.510
I won't let you do that,

67
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.179
She's my child,

68
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.450
Be quiet!

69
00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.919
Shut your mouth
and apologize to Mrs, Yang,

70
00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.290
Go on, Go on,

71
00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.230
If you are going to continue this,
do it at home,

72
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.600
The game is over here,

73
00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.570
It's done, It's the end,

74
00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.799
- Mrs, Yang, Mrs, Yang,
- Get out of my way,

75
00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.040
He's too young, and that's why
he's making a mistake,

76
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.440
- Keep still,
- All right,

77
00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.679
I'll tell you something
because I pity you,

78
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.250
Do you think Yeon Ju will even
listen to you if you tell her this?

79
00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.320
You've only lived with her
for four years,

80
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.320
She has spent 10 months
inside my stomach,

81
00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.530
and I've been raising her
for 30 years,

82
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.200
So I know everything
about my daughter,

83
00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.200
I don't know where you came up
with an idea like that,

84
00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:30.399
but Yeon Ju won't be able
to live without me,

85
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.070
She'll never leave,

86
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.110
That's how special
our relationship is,

87
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.479
Of course, You've gone through a lot
to raise your daughter,

88
00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.880
And one more thing,
Yeon Ju can't live without money,

89
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.420
The minute you leave my house,

90
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.019
I'll stop all financial funding,

91
00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.060
I'll use every connection I have to
make sure no bank helps you,

92
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.630
Mrs, Yang,

93
00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.099
Gosh, you're going to have to,,,

94
00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.639
live off your salaries,

95
00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.070
Do you think you'll be able to
cover Yeon Ju's expenses?

96
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.039
Don't kid yourself,

97
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.510
Wake up,

98
00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.849
Mrs, Yang, Mrs, Yang,

99
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.519
Mrs, Yang, Mrs, Yang, Mrs, Yang!

100
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.889
(Episode 17)

101
00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:26.229
What? Move out?

102
00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.260
What an ungrateful jerk,

103
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.130
How dare he get smart with me?
I can't believe this,

104
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.229
Goodness,

105
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.099
Mrs, Yang,

106
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.310
Please, You can't leave like this,

107
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.039
I'll apologize on his behalf,
Please forgive him,

108
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.839
Mrs, Yang,

109
00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.810
I'll move Dr, Lee's stuff
out of my house tomorrow,

110
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.420
You did such a fine job
raising a wonderful son,

111
00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.089
Mrs, Yang,

112
00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.099
Darn it,

113
00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.409
Oh, my goodness!
This is infuriating me,

114
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.010
I'm going to pull out the tongue
of whoever mentions the word,

115
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.149
"moving out" and throw it out
on the street,

116
00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:24.820
I can't believe this, It was so
hard for me to conceive Yeon Ju,

117
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.219
When my nasty
mother-in-law passed away,

118
00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.459
I fed my husband who didn't
have an ounce of energy,,,

119
00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.360
the best herbal medicine and other
health supplements I could get,

120
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:42.329
It was a miracle that
I conceived Yeon Ju,

121
00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.170
But he wants me to live in separate
houses with my precious daughter?

122
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.570
That jerk!

123
00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:50.539
How dare he come up
with such an idea?

124
00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.979
Goodness, that scumbag,

125
00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.750
Ma'am, please calm down,

126
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.550
Shut your mouth! How could I calm
down in this state of affair?

127
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.820
Oh, Yeon Ju!

128
00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.019
I love the scene of the autumn,

129
00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:06.630
Why do you have flowers?

130
00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:09.459
That's none of your business,
I'm going to give them as a present,

131
00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.870
To whom? Are those for a guy?

132
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.070
It's a secret,

133
00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.510
Look at that, What is he doing here?
He got fired,

134
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.570
What is he doing here?

135
00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.079
But don't hate him so much,

136
00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:26.250
We found out Joo Ae Ri was behind it
because he gave us the USB,

137
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.010
Hey, that's why he's
even more suspicious,

138
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.349
With what intention
did he give that to us?

139
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.550
I can't let this fly,

140
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.389
I must find out what he's plotting,

141
00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:37.860
Let me go,

142
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.060
Hold on! Stop!

143
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:54.310
Mr, Kim Sung Tan,
what brings you here?

144
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.279
Weren't you fired along
with Chef No?

145
00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.779
Well,

146
00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.450
Chef Jung put in a good word for me,

147
00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:02.550
So I got my job back,

148
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.849
Really?

149
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.849
Then will we be working
together from now on again?

150
00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:08.250
I hope we'll be a good team,

151
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.560
Sure,

152
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.560
You'd better watch yourself,

153
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.969
Hey, you jerk!

154
00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:22.870
Give back my plant!

155
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.639
You saw what he did, right, Ru Ri?
That's what he does,

156
00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.539
He takes all of my stuff,

157
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.680
The other day, he took
the beverage box from me,

158
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.149
He even did my cleaning task,

159
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.050
What has he got against me?

160
00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:38.979
Could it be,,,

161
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.489
Could it be what?

162
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.190
He's trying to steal my job,
isn't he?

163
00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:45.459
Could it be that Sung Tan likes you?

164
00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:48.660
What? There's no way,

165
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.329
He must have standards,

166
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:52.469
Hey! There's nothing wrong with you,

167
00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:55.670
Look at his behavior,
He can't even look you in the eye,

168
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.099
He's doing everything because
he doesn't want you to get tired,

169
00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:01.810
No, no, That's impossible,

170
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.810
Hey,

171
00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.849
After Oh Mok Sin dumped me,
I learned about men,

172
00:09:06.349 --> 00:09:07.680
I know my place now too,

173
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.320
The men who are nice to me,,,

174
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.749
are the ones trying to sell me
something like jade mats,

175
00:09:18.219 --> 00:09:19.359
Jade mats?

176
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.670
If you think of Jung Tae Yang
as your successor,

177
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.839
it'd be a good idea to
make him see Ae Ri,

178
00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:43.849
Did you want to see me, sir?

179
00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:44.849
Hello,

180
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.589
I saw your proposal,

181
00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:52.160
I thought pork neck steaks
were very innovative,

182
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.290
It's worth a try,

183
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.259
We'll invite managers
of every branch and hold a tasting,

184
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.369
And if we receive
good evaluations from them,

185
00:09:59.369 --> 00:10:00.900
we plan on serving the new dish
at our branches,

186
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.640
Anyway, I'd like
to congratulate you,

187
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.609
And I apologize on behalf of Ae Ri,

188
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.940
Sir, how did you find out
what happened?

189
00:10:11.109 --> 00:10:14.450
I know you covered it up
for my sake too,

190
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.349
I can't thank you enough,

191
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.579
Don't mention it, sir,

192
00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:22.619
I have another favor,,,

193
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.390
to ask you,

194
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.430
Please,,,

195
00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:29.900
make Ae Ri a decent human being,

196
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.229
She's a complete mess
as I failed to raise her right,

197
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.869
Her cooking skills need
improvement as well,

198
00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:38.900
Please be her teacher, and
guide her to the right path,

199
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.670
Sir, I'm not qualified for,,,

200
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.040
This is a favor,,,

201
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.310
from a desperate father,
not the chairman of the company,

202
00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:50.780
Please?

203
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.219
She needs a teacher
for her culinary skills to improve,

204
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.920
I will introduce her
a better chef than me,

205
00:10:59.229 --> 00:11:01.489
Would that be okay with you?

206
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.660
Of course,

207
00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.770
I will let you take the lead,
I'll leave everything up to you,

208
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.780
A last chance?

209
00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:18.509
Keep this in mind,

210
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.619
Chairman Kevin didn't want to see
you, but I managed to persuade him,

211
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.020
You must win Jung Tae Yang's
approvals,

212
00:11:26.349 --> 00:11:29.259
Earn his approvals either
professionally or personally,,,

213
00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:30.890
to quell Chairman's disappointment,

214
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.030
Okay,

215
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.229
You're the only one who understands
my misery, Director Park,

216
00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.599
Please help him ease his mind,

217
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.540
I beg of you,

218
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.979
Why does it have
to be Jung Tae Yang?

219
00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:56.950
How am I going to win him over?

220
00:12:02.859 --> 00:12:06.890
Chef Jung, Do you know
what day it is today?

221
00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:12.869
It's been exactly a year since
the day we met on the train,

222
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.040
Your skirt is stuck,

223
00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:27.749
- What happened?
- My gosh,

224
00:12:27.749 --> 00:12:29.979
- Don't push me,
- What are you doing?

225
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.450
- It's not what you think!
- Stop it!

226
00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:43.999
Oh, my goodness!

227
00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:45.359
Ma'am, this is,,,

228
00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:46.770
It's hot!

229
00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:48.170
This is so hot,

230
00:12:48.329 --> 00:12:49.999
It's burning hot,

231
00:12:54.209 --> 00:12:56.180
What I see every day,,,

232
00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:58.410
and what I eat every day
become new,,,

233
00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:01.879
when I'm with you,

234
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.489
I hope you and I continue
to walk the same path,

235
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.450
I look forward to working with you,

236
00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:14.930
Look at you, A handwritten
card won't blow him away,

237
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.459
I bought this for you,

238
00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:20.469
Give this to Chef Jung,
so you can get lucky tonight,

239
00:13:20.469 --> 00:13:22.739
Get lucky?
What's so special about it?

240
00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:24.200
These flowers mean,,,

241
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.739
that you're going to give him
your everything,,,

242
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.310
including your soul and body,

243
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.849
Gosh, I can't believe this,

244
00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:36.249
I know you like it,

245
00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.219
- How am I going to give him that?
- I know you want to,

246
00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:40.489
No, no, I don't want to,

247
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.390
What are you two laughing about?

248
00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:45.989
It's nothing,

249
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:47.859
You heard the news, right?

250
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.129
After the mangers
of the branches evaluate,,,

251
00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.869
Pork Neck Love Set,
we can serve it to the customers,

252
00:13:53.869 --> 00:13:56.070
- This is amazing!
- This is amazing!

253
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.040
And if the sales go up
for the two weeks,

254
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.570
it will be on the menu permanently,

255
00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:02.170
I'm confident we'll do great!

256
00:14:02.339 --> 00:14:03.339
So am I!

257
00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:04.410
Me too!

258
00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:07.209
I don't need to introduce
Sung Tan to you, right?

259
00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:10.020
Manager Joo isn't here yet,

260
00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:18.119
Are we late?

261
00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:21.259
No, we were about
to start the meeting,

262
00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:24.200
Then I'd like to have
a word with you for a second,

263
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.910
(Manager Jung Tae Yang)

264
00:14:37.339 --> 00:14:38.810
It's an order from Chairman Kevin,

265
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.520
I would like to apologize
to you, Manager Jung,

266
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.060
And,,,

267
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.020
Ms, Lee Ru Ri,

268
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.229
I'm really sorry,

269
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.629
I will start from the bottom,

270
00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.900
Please don't hate me,
I'd appreciate your support,

271
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.940
I'm sorry,

272
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.969
That's fine,

273
00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:12.379
Ms, Lee and I don't hold grudges,

274
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.479
Look forward to working with you,

275
00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:21.520
Let's give it up!

276
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.359
Congratulations on your promotion,
Manager Jung,

277
00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:26.560
Don't act up,

278
00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:36.469
How did it go?

279
00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:37.800
Everything was handled well,

280
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.640
Mr, Jung and the team members
accepted the offer generously,

281
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.209
Then can I expect more from Ae Ri
this time?

282
00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:46.579
You should trust Mr, Jung,

283
00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:49.979
He is talented,
and he has a great personality,

284
00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:54.849
I agree, I think he's perfect
as Ae Ri's future husband,

285
00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:58.759
He isn't dating anyone now,
If Ae Ri changes, it'd be possible,

286
00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:01.359
It would be great
for the company too,

287
00:16:02.999 --> 00:16:06.229
If that happens, I'd have achieved
something by coming to Korea,

288
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:09.499
Although the child I had expected
to see didn't exist,

289
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.999
I have at least got myself
a decent son-in-law,

290
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:16.979
I've been searching around
under your orders,,,

291
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.450
to find out why Go Jung Do
came to our company so often,

292
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.950
What's the reason?

293
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.520
He comes here with Jung Hwa Young,
They must know someone here,

294
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.890
You're right,

295
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.759
They have a family member
in our company,

296
00:16:32.219 --> 00:16:34.959
A family member? Who is it?

297
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.759
Who is it?

298
00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:56.520
Stop drinking, Father,

299
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.650
Let me go,

300
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.950
Others only wish they could get
married to a family like that,

301
00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:02.989
But you wish to run away
from that house?

302
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.160
If you want to do that,

303
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.660
you need to bury
your drunk father first,

304
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.600
Why are you doing this?

305
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.769
Can't you try to understand me?

306
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.700
I don't care about that,
Just tell me,,,

307
00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:20.170
you're going to take back
your words,

308
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:24.209
If you don't, I'll drink
all the alcohol here,,,

309
00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.850
and die,

310
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.580
Are you really going to do this?

311
00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:29.380
Yes,

312
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.719
Let's see who wins, You punk,

313
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.690
Hey, hey! Are you crazy?
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

314
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:41.330
You have a bad stomach,
You'll get sick,

315
00:17:41.529 --> 00:17:43.799
Gosh, you're driving me crazy,
Let go of this, Let it go,

316
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.430
Spit it out, Spit it out,

317
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.870
So stop it!

318
00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.999
Just leave me alone,
so that I can do what I want,

319
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.479
So Won! So Won! Gosh,

320
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.009
Gosh, So Won! So Won!

321
00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.150
Gosh, So Won,

322
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.190
- Do you like it here?
- Yes, I like it,

323
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:16.630
Whose house is this?

324
00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.430
Is this Dad's house?

325
00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:24.499
I want to live here,

326
00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:30.580
Dad, Grandma, Aunt, and Han Gyul
should live here,

327
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.559
You're here,

328
00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:45.319
Hello,

329
00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:55.600
I brought her here
because you told me to,

330
00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:57.440
but I'm worried
that I'm being disrespectful,

331
00:18:58.499 --> 00:19:02.509
No, it's all right, I wanted to see
her again, That's why I called you,

332
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.680
But still, there's the helper and,,,

333
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.950
Mom's not here, Don't worry,

334
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.950
All right,

335
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.989
You look ill,

336
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.819
Let's finish up quickly,

337
00:19:16.219 --> 00:19:17.519
You wanted to talk to me
about something,

338
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.499
Wait, Han Gyul, there's
a flower over there,

339
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.969
Isn't it pretty? Go and look at it,

340
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.850
I don't know,

341
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.749
So Won wants to raise the child,

342
00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:49.789
so I've tried to change my mind,

343
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.190
I wanted you to bring her because
I thought it could change my mind,

344
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:56.200
But I can't do it,

345
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.930
I thought I could do it,
but I'm not sure if I can,

346
00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:04.400
I'm not sure if I can love her,

347
00:20:08.709 --> 00:20:10.709
You can say that I am cruel,

348
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.019
I hate that I have to break off
with So Won because of her,

349
00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:18.479
And when I think of her mom,
I hate the fact that she exists,

350
00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:25.160
I'm sorry, Mother,

351
00:20:25.489 --> 00:20:27.959
I don't think I can raise her,

352
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.430
I can't accept the fact that
she's So Won's child,

353
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.239
I couldn't have his child
despite all my efforts,

354
00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:41.569
But why,,,

355
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.380
All right,

356
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.249
That's all right,

357
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.989
It's okay, I understand,

358
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.219
If you can't raise her,

359
00:20:58.289 --> 00:21:01.160
I can do that for you, It's fine,

360
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.200
It's okay,

361
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.370
- Grandma,
- Yes?

362
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.999
I want to go to the bathroom,

363
00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:25.350
Are you done?

364
00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:30.890
Wash your hands,

365
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.739
Why do you wipe your hands
on your skirt?

366
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.150
Gosh, why do you wear
clothes like that?

367
00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:04.590
Stand up properly,

368
00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:23.080
Here,

369
00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:26.080
Can you wrap it on my back?

370
00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:30.920
Gosh,

371
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.430
Miss,

372
00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:51.069
Do you hate me?

373
00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:58.140
I'm sorry,

374
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.650
I'm so sorry,

375
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:16.860
Mrs, Yang is here,

376
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:29.380
Oh, my,

377
00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:32.509
What brings you here?

378
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.650
I came here to meet Yeon Ju,

379
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.519
While your son threw
a bomb at me outside,

380
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.729
you're trying to convince
my daughter here?

381
00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:49.160
Mrs, Yang, what are you
talking about?

382
00:23:49.229 --> 00:23:51.229
Is this a scheme,,,

383
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.830
to convince us both?

384
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.940
Mrs, Yang,

385
00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:00.569
I don't know why you're acting
like this, but you're overreacting,

386
00:24:00.569 --> 00:24:02.880
I'm not overreacting,

387
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.580
It's not like we're in a war,

388
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.910
and yet you want to
separate me from my daughter?

389
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.249
We're not even in-laws anymore,
Just leave,

390
00:24:10.249 --> 00:24:11.350
Mom,

391
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:15.519
Mom, what are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

392
00:24:20.989 --> 00:24:23.999
Are you going to say
I was wrong now?

393
00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:28.630
You brought the little girl,,,

394
00:24:28.769 --> 00:24:30.700
to convince my daughter, right?

395
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.969
Gosh, I'll tell you
her response instead,

396
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.180
Whatever happens to this world,
Yeon Ju,,,

397
00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:40.880
will stay next to me,

398
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.850
Gosh, What? Move out?

399
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.650
That'll never happen!

400
00:24:46.749 --> 00:24:48.019
Move out?

401
00:24:48.749 --> 00:24:52.019
So Won wants to move out from
the house with Yeon Ju?

402
00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:53.989
Don't pretend like you don't know,

403
00:24:53.989 --> 00:24:56.630
He wants to live with his daughter
and my daughter,

404
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.400
I will never allow that to happen,

405
00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:02.170
I don't want to see her ever again,

406
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.670
Get her out of here!

407
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.610
Mom, did So Won really say
he wanted to move out with me?

408
00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:09.880
Are you deaf?

409
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.479
What are you doing?

410
00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:16.380
Kick them out of here,
and throw salt at them,

411
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.580
They're bad luck,

412
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.600
He's crazy, Gosh!

413
00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:38.370
He's so thoughtless,
He doesn't know anything,

414
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.809
How dare he say,,,

415
00:25:39.969 --> 00:25:42.640
not to interfere with his life,

416
00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:46.350
I'm the reason
he's successful today,

417
00:25:48.809 --> 00:25:49.819
Honey,

418
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.789
Is that true?

419
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:57.120
Where have you been with the child?

420
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.489
I'm already upset,

421
00:25:58.489 --> 00:26:00.590
We were at that woman's house,

422
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.759
What? That woman?

423
00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:07.400
An old lady who wore a hat
yelled at us,

424
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.469
"Are you deaf? What are you doing?"

425
00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:14.469
"Kick them out of here,
and throw salt at them,"

426
00:26:14.469 --> 00:26:16.779
- Stop it,
- What?

427
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.249
What is she talking about?

428
00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:24.049
Did you go to Cheongdam-dong?

429
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:26.150
Yeon Ju wanted to see me,
so we went there,

430
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.890
But Mrs, Yang barged in,

431
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.920
Are you crazy? Are you
out of your mind?

432
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.090
She's already mad, You didn't
need to upset her more,

433
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.830
Why would you go there?

434
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.360
How dare you go
there with the child?

435
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.670
Han Gyul, it's okay,

436
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.600
Play in Ru Ri's room for a minute,

437
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.209
I can't believe this,

438
00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:53.610
Please don't yell
when the child is around,

439
00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:56.620
She's already scared after being
thrown out by Mrs, Yang,

440
00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.920
Why did you take her there then?

441
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.519
I would have also been
really upset,,,

442
00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:05.459
if I were Mrs, Yang and saw
the child,

443
00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:07.160
Do you know what So Won said?

444
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.459
When Mrs, Yang asked him to choose
either Yeon Ju or his daughter,

445
00:27:09.459 --> 00:27:11.600
he told her that they would live
separately from now on,

446
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.670
I heard that,

447
00:27:13.229 --> 00:27:15.900
Who knows? That could be
a good idea,

448
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.140
Are you serious?

449
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.269
Living separately isn't
child's play,

450
00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:23.009
Don't you know what Yeon Ju means
to Mrs, Yang?

451
00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:25.180
It's like excluding,,,

452
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.350
So Won from my life,

453
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.380
Honey,

454
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.120
The children are already grown up,

455
00:27:31.749 --> 00:27:34.019
If you try to grab a bird with
all your might because it's pretty,

456
00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:35.759
it will die from suffocation,

457
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:38.719
They're old enough,

458
00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:41.259
Just let them live their own lives
however they want to,,,

459
00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:43.600
regardless of the results,

460
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.029
How could you say that?

461
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.170
Do you want to ruin
the lives of your children?

462
00:27:49.499 --> 00:27:52.610
Don't you know
that So Won will be ruined,,,

463
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.370
the moment he leaves that house?

464
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.279
Mrs, Yang threatened him
right in front of him,

465
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:02.549
She said she would ruin his life
by taking away all the money,

466
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:05.580
Are you going to make him abandon
his child because of money?

467
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:08.519
What use is there living
in a castle-like house,,,

468
00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:10.120
when you can't live at ease?

469
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.190
It's better to live without money,,,

470
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.930
than becoming a sinner from
abandoning his own child,

471
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.559
I'm begging you, Please,

472
00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:20.269
Please let So Won do
the right thing, will you?

473
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:23.340
Wait a minute, Look at this,

474
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.200
It's because of you,

475
00:28:25.969 --> 00:28:28.940
So Won was so obedient,,,

476
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.739
until a few days ago,

477
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.380
You're the reason,,,

478
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.019
he became so mad and disobedient,,,

479
00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:38.019
overnight,

480
00:28:39.019 --> 00:28:40.989
You made him do that, didn't you?

481
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:43.559
Did you make him decide to move out?

482
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.219
It was So Won's life,

483
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.989
So Won thought about it
and made his own decision,

484
00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:51.200
I can't make him do that,

485
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.259
That's enough!

486
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.600
This is an order,

487
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.239
Don't say a word regarding
So Won from now on,

488
00:28:59.569 --> 00:29:02.640
If So Won is thrown out
from that house,

489
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.910
I'm not going to see you ever again,

490
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.309
So don't say a word,

491
00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:12.080
What are you planning to do?

492
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.219
I'm going to register
Han Gyul legally under my name,

493
00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:16.420
so that So Won won't dare to do
something stupid,

494
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.719
Are you saying you're going to,,,

495
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.660
make So Won her brother
instead of her father?

496
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.890
It doesn't matter,

497
00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:26.370
Don't move, Don't do anything,

498
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.180
I can't believe this,

499
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.219
Guess who?

500
00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:55.289
Judging by your hands,

501
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.130
you must be the guard,

502
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.630
Stop,

503
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.440
Why are you here?
You said you were going to be late,

504
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.870
It's no fun being alone,

505
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.440
That's why there are rumors,,,

506
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.279
that I'm going out with
a little girl,

507
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:12.279
Really? That's good,
Then girls won't approach you,

508
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.120
I want to sew your mouth to stop
you from talking,

509
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.019
My back hurts,

510
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:25.559
My whole body hurts,,,

511
00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:26.930
from crouching all day,

512
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.930
That's why I found,,,

513
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.430
a place to recharge yourself,

514
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:35.400
My whole body hurts,

515
00:30:39.969 --> 00:30:42.170
Why did you bring me here?

516
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.140
It seems like old people are having
a get-together here,

517
00:30:45.209 --> 00:30:46.580
Be quiet,

518
00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.809
Welcome, How can I help you?

519
00:30:48.809 --> 00:30:50.850
We want to give a bed
as a present for our mom,

520
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.690
Can we try the beds out?

521
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.219
Of course, Please come this way,

522
00:30:55.219 --> 00:30:56.690
Okay, Come on,

523
00:30:59.789 --> 00:31:02.459
You can operate the bed with this,

524
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.959
I know,

525
00:31:03.959 --> 00:31:05.029
Okay,

526
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.630
Lie down,

527
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.840
We don't have the money to buy this,

528
00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.670
Just lie down,

529
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.979
My whole body hurts,
That spot feels good,

530
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.519
You're like an old lady,

531
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:29.259
Oh, right,

532
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:31.360
Look at this,

533
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.930
Why did you take a photo of this?

534
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.499
I'm going to show this to Grandma,

535
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.600
Are you crazy?

536
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.799
I'm taking this away from you,

537
00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:44.269
I already told you,

538
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:47.370
I'm going to find
Tae Yang's real father for him,

539
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.840
They work at the same company,
It's nonsense that he doesn't know,

540
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.650
Who can stop you?

541
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.019
Count me out, I have a bad feeling
about this,

542
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:04.860
I found out why Go Jung Do
keeps visiting our company,

543
00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:07.860
He's the son of Choi Sun Young,

544
00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:11.799
Come in,

545
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.469
Did you want to see me,
Chairman Kevin?

546
00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:20.309
Please take a seat,

547
00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:21.410
Okay,

548
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.880
I was about to go home,

549
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.009
What is this about?

550
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.650
Do you know Chef Go Jung Do?

551
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.019
I heard that he's your son,

552
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.789
How did you know that?

553
00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:38.719
I told him,,,

554
00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:41.930
that you wanted to recruit
him to our company,

555
00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:45.999
Why isn't there any news about that?

556
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.400
Yes,

557
00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:53.069
He's such a famous chef
and professor,

558
00:32:53.069 --> 00:32:55.239
A lot of people want
him to work for them,

559
00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:57.009
I think that's why it's hard
for him to move here,

560
00:32:57.239 --> 00:33:00.549
I'm working on him, so don't worry,

561
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.009
Okay,

562
00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:06.890
How old is Chef Go Jung Do?

563
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.549
He's 39 years old,

564
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:13.130
Then he must be married,

565
00:33:16.459 --> 00:33:19.330
You're going to make me upset,
Please don't mention that to me,

566
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:23.799
He was tricked by a wicked woman
who is 10 years older than him,

567
00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:25.569
He's even raising not 1,
but 2 children,,,

568
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.670
from her other husbands,

569
00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:30.380
Oh, I see,

570
00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:32.009
Then,,,

571
00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:35.150
they're not married legally, right?

572
00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:37.080
That's right,

573
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:40.519
Who is the real father
of the other two children?

574
00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:41.749
What?

575
00:33:43.219 --> 00:33:45.059
Why are you asking that?

576
00:33:46.059 --> 00:33:48.160
Please excuse me,

577
00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:53.469
I'm really interested in Chef Go,

578
00:33:55.069 --> 00:33:56.999
Anyway, don't worry,

579
00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.110
If he breaks up with that woman,
he can work for us right away,

580
00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:02.979
I'll do my best,

581
00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:05.239
I'll look forward to it,

582
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.450
Okay,

583
00:34:12.279 --> 00:34:15.049
Chairman Kevin is really interested
in Jung Do,

584
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.419
We need to bring Jung Do in,,,

585
00:34:17.419 --> 00:34:19.430
before Jung Tae Yang establishes
his position here,

586
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.290
Is there any news from the US?

587
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:26.000
The whereabouts of Jung Hwa Young's
first husband is unknown,

588
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.299
He must have moved to
another state,,,

589
00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:30.339
or changed his name,

590
00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:32.439
What about the criminal record
of Jung Hwa Young?

591
00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:34.469
We will receive
information about that soon,

592
00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.710
Tell them to hurry up,

593
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.450
I need to separate that woman
from Jung Do as soon as I can,

594
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.810
Yes, ma'am,

595
00:34:47.549 --> 00:34:50.020
Hey, How did it go?

596
00:34:50.259 --> 00:34:52.460
Did you reserve a steamy night
with Manager Jung?

597
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.460
Let alone a steamy night, I don't
think he even knows what today is,

598
00:34:55.799 --> 00:34:57.529
That can't be true,

599
00:34:57.529 --> 00:35:00.069
He was a complete romanticist
in Guam,

600
00:35:00.529 --> 00:35:03.299
How could he ignore
your one year anniversary?

601
00:35:03.799 --> 00:35:04.870
Really?

602
00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:07.839
Is he pretending to not know
to tease me?

603
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.839
Give him that card and approach him,

604
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:14.509
People like us
have to approach first,

605
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.680
Hurry, Come on,

606
00:35:23.759 --> 00:35:26.189
Are you leaving now?

607
00:35:26.489 --> 00:35:28.189
What is it?
Do you want to talk to me?

608
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:29.399
No,

609
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.529
I just wanted to say good job today,

610
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.600
Sure, See you tomorrow,

611
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:38.969
I have an important plan,
so I'll go first,

612
00:35:41.009 --> 00:35:45.540
Can you stop by at the SC's
main office on the way home?

613
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.450
Why?

614
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.520
Next week is the tasting
for all managers,

615
00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:52.649
Come up with a theme in advance,

616
00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:55.290
Do I have to do it today?

617
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:56.919
Hey,

618
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.560
Are you getting lazy already?

619
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.960
You're still an intern,
You have to work hard,

620
00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:03.529
Don't slack off,

621
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.500
Bye,

622
00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:11.100
How dare you!

623
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.439
He's making me work overtime
on our first anniversary,

624
00:36:14.969 --> 00:36:18.879
Why do I always get crush alone?
Why do I always do this?

625
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.310
No, That's not true, I do that too,

626
00:36:22.879 --> 00:36:23.919
Cross?

627
00:36:29.419 --> 00:36:30.819
Why would you bite me?

628
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.100
It's a beautiful night, isn't it?

629
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.629
I'm probably the only one working
overtime on the first anniversary,

630
00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:42.000
Right,

631
00:36:42.569 --> 00:36:44.270
You've finally gone crazy,

632
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.540
I'll work overtime with you instead,

633
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.870
For friendship,

634
00:36:48.939 --> 00:36:51.439
- For friendship,
- Cross,

635
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.850
Hey, that's Manager Jung,

636
00:36:56.319 --> 00:36:57.520
What's he doing there?

637
00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.350
You must be happy,

638
00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:03.020
He's waiting to surprise you,

639
00:37:08.189 --> 00:37:11.830
- Bye now, Myung Rang,
- Bye,

640
00:37:12.399 --> 00:37:13.500
Hey, wait,

641
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.210
I think you're mistaken,

642
00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:28.450
What's going on right now, Ru Ri?

643
00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.250
He said he has an important plan,

644
00:37:30.779 --> 00:37:34.390
Is he cheating on you
with Joo Ae Ri?

645
00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:36.759
My goodness,

646
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.500
Did you hear from the director
where we're going?

647
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.169
I heard we're going to your house,

648
00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.439
I have to say I was surprised
to hear,,,

649
00:37:52.669 --> 00:37:54.609
that you'll even teach me
how to cook,

650
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.980
Thank you for your help,

651
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.080
You should thank someone else,

652
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:01.410
Who?

653
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.680
You'll find out,

654
00:38:09.689 --> 00:38:11.120
(SC main office)

655
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.129
Jung Tae Yang speaking,

656
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.560
Reservation confirmation?
Yes, at 8pm,

657
00:38:18.859 --> 00:38:20.069
Yes, with a cake,

658
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.669
Do you know Intern Lee Ru Ri?

659
00:38:23.469 --> 00:38:26.509
She'll arrive soon,
Please show her to the seat,

660
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.009
Thank you,

661
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:36.049
Are you having dinner
with Lee Ru Ri?

662
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.649
Yes,

663
00:38:37.819 --> 00:38:38.919
Are you,,,

664
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.290
going out with her?

665
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.060
Let's not talk about
my personal life,

666
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.960
I'm sorry, I'm worried you'll be
late because of me,

667
00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:02.540
He said he will move out,

668
00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.410
He'll abandon your old mother
and take you with him,

669
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:19.489
I'm so upset that
I'm even trembling,

670
00:39:19.759 --> 00:39:21.890
Do you want to take foot bath
to calm down?

671
00:39:22.759 --> 00:39:24.899
There's already fire inside me,

672
00:39:24.899 --> 00:39:28.169
I'll burn if I put my feet
in hot water,

673
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.939
Are you okay, Mom?

674
00:39:34.569 --> 00:39:36.180
Absolutely not,

675
00:39:36.509 --> 00:39:40.279
He's mistaken you for a big time,

676
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:44.480
Yeon Ju, I can never
live without you,

677
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.089
Don't you feel the same way?

678
00:39:49.319 --> 00:39:51.620
Is that why you're upset?

679
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.290
Because So Won said
he'll take me with him?

680
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.460
You didn't say it correctly,

681
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.029
I'm not upset, I'm offended,

682
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.770
He couldn't have got all this
without me,

683
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.700
How could he stab me in the back?

684
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.509
It's still a relief,

685
00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:09.480
He wouldn't have said it
unless he loves me,

686
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:12.549
How could you say that, you wench?

687
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.649
If he loves you,
he should leave his child,

688
00:40:16.819 --> 00:40:21.219
He's clearly challenging you and me,

689
00:40:21.489 --> 00:40:23.589
He loves his child more than you,

690
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:27.560
so he's testing us
even taking a risk to divorce,

691
00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:29.529
So what are you going to do?

692
00:40:29.529 --> 00:40:31.200
What do you mean?

693
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.169
I'm going to kick him out tomorrow,

694
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.439
Who does he think he is to get in
between us?

695
00:40:39.569 --> 00:40:41.870
We're not just an ordinary
mother and daughter,

696
00:40:42.009 --> 00:40:43.980
You are me, and I'm you,

697
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.680
We're one in body and soul,

698
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.980
Right, baby girl?

699
00:40:50.819 --> 00:40:52.149
Of course,

700
00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:56.259
You're the one I love the most
in the whole world,

701
00:40:56.859 --> 00:40:58.419
Yes, Yes,

702
00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:00.089
I don't care about anything else,

703
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.859
Nothing good happened
ever since he moved in,

704
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.200
Let's just think we were
in a muddy puddle,,,

705
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.169
and forget about it,

706
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.609
I'll always be on your side,

707
00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:16.379
I'm going to live long for you,
My poor baby,

708
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.480
My poor baby,

709
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.319
You're the only one I need, and
the same goes for you,

710
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.279
My poor baby,

711
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.419
Adoption?

712
00:41:30.419 --> 00:41:32.319
Yes, That's the best way,

713
00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:35.629
It deletes the trace of the parent
who gave birth,

714
00:41:35.629 --> 00:41:37.299
It disconnects them completely,

715
00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:39.669
That's exactly what I want,

716
00:41:40.029 --> 00:41:42.129
Change her first and last name,

717
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.169
so that she becomes my own daughter
who doesn't have anything to do,,,

718
00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:45.500
with So Won,

719
00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.569
- Her mother's in prison?
- Yes,

720
00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:51.810
First, get a consent that she will
give up the parental right,,,

721
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:54.879
- and custody,
- Don't worry about that,

722
00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:58.319
Her mom told us this clearly,

723
00:41:58.779 --> 00:42:01.089
She told us to take care of
everything since she's our family,

724
00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.890
Does she become my daughter
as soon as I apply?

725
00:42:06.359 --> 00:42:09.759
You get rejected sometimes,

726
00:42:10.259 --> 00:42:13.299
Your son's capable of
raising his daughter,,,

727
00:42:13.299 --> 00:42:15.629
that it's not reasonable for her to
go under grandfather,

728
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.339
What are you talking about?

729
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.009
So Won's not capable of raising her,

730
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.040
He'll get divorced as soon as
he takes the kid with him,

731
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.279
so I must raise her,

732
00:42:26.149 --> 00:42:28.580
It doesn't matter how much it costs,

733
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.219
Hurry up on the adoption, please,

734
00:42:37.919 --> 00:42:40.730
What are you doing, Han Gyul?

735
00:42:43.259 --> 00:42:45.529
It's okay, Show me,

736
00:42:46.129 --> 00:42:47.969
Let me see how good your drawing is,

737
00:42:47.969 --> 00:42:50.439
- No one else can see it,
- Sure,

738
00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.239
Here,

739
00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:57.710
Who is this?

740
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.379
It's Dad, My dad,

741
00:43:00.509 --> 00:43:02.009
I see,

742
00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:05.819
You did a good job,

743
00:43:06.819 --> 00:43:08.819
Is Dad coming home today?

744
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:13.629
I'm not sure,
I don't know that either,

745
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.660
I wish he does,

746
00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:22.330
Why do you like your dad so much?

747
00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.899
Because he's my dad,

748
00:43:27.509 --> 00:43:29.540
(Doctor Job)

749
00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:38.649
Oh, hi, How did it go?

750
00:43:39.819 --> 00:43:41.250
Yes, The pay doctor,

751
00:43:43.259 --> 00:43:45.830
I was a wealthy doctor once,
but it turned out that way,

752
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:48.759
Suwon?

753
00:43:50.259 --> 00:43:51.460
That's the only place?

754
00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:57.500
Yes, I'm in a rush,
Set me up for an interview, please,

755
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.680
I'll call you back later,

756
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:10.450
What are you doing here?

757
00:44:10.819 --> 00:44:12.080
Are you seriously asking me that?

758
00:44:14.219 --> 00:44:15.350
Let's sit down first,

759
00:44:21.489 --> 00:44:24.230
Did you really mean
what you said to my mom?

760
00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:25.600
Yes,

761
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.140
Moving out is the best thing I can
think of right now,

762
00:44:30.899 --> 00:44:33.410
The best way to protect
you and my child,

763
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:36.839
That's only the best way for you,
but not for me,

764
00:44:37.509 --> 00:44:41.710
Did you think I really meant it
when I said I'll move out?

765
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.950
I can't abandon my mom,

766
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:47.819
I can't live without her,

767
00:44:48.089 --> 00:44:51.689
As much as your daughter means
to you, so does my mom,

768
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.689
You're telling me to abandon my mom
and move out?

769
00:44:55.189 --> 00:44:57.899
How can you be so selfish
and shameless?

770
00:44:57.899 --> 00:45:00.700
You don't have to cut your mom off
completely by moving out,

771
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.939
When she sees us living happy
on our own,

772
00:45:03.939 --> 00:45:05.399
she'll forgive us one day,,,

773
00:45:05.399 --> 00:45:07.439
You don't know my mom,

774
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:11.040
Once she says no, it's a no forever,

775
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.480
Once I choose you,
she's no longer my mom,

776
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.189
That's not all, She'll be 70 soon,

777
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.020
She's taking medicine for her heart,

778
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.689
What if something bad
happens to her?

779
00:45:23.689 --> 00:45:25.689
Can't you understand why
I said that?

780
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.529
It's really hard for me too,

781
00:45:28.529 --> 00:45:31.460
Can't you try to understand me
and stop being selfish?

782
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.469
I'm here because I understand you,

783
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.469
How will we live without her help?

784
00:45:37.669 --> 00:45:40.169
She's going to throw us out
without a penny,

785
00:45:40.169 --> 00:45:41.839
How will we survive?

786
00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:43.279
I'm confident,

787
00:45:43.279 --> 00:45:45.580
I won't let you and Han Gyul starve,

788
00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:48.480
I'm going to sell that room
and rent a house,

789
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.680
I can work as a doctor
at a friend's hospital,

790
00:45:51.049 --> 00:45:53.890
I can open my own office
after 2 or 3 years of hard work,

791
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.319
Do you want me to bargain
the cost of groceries,,,

792
00:45:56.319 --> 00:45:58.520
and take public transportation?

793
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.600
I live in a 500m² house,
and yet, you want me to live,,,

794
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.730
in a rented house
and have a hard time?

795
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.200
People all live like that,

796
00:46:06.299 --> 00:46:08.370
Why can't we live like that?

797
00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:12.939
Honestly, it's better to live
in a rented house,,,

798
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:15.439
than have a hard time
while living with your mother,

799
00:46:16.939 --> 00:46:20.180
As you said before,
if you really love me,

800
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.719
please just follow what I say,

801
00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:29.189
I'll do my best to you,

802
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.330
Please, Let's move out,

803
00:46:36.529 --> 00:46:37.629
Yeon Ju,

804
00:46:44.169 --> 00:46:46.210
Let's get a divorce,,,

805
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.310
if you really want to move out,

806
00:46:53.279 --> 00:46:54.350
Are you,,,

807
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.049
serious?

808
00:46:57.319 --> 00:46:59.989
Yes, I'm serious,

809
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.689
Yeon Ju,

810
00:47:07.689 --> 00:47:09.529
Yeon Ju!

811
00:47:37.989 --> 00:47:39.129
I can't send you like this,

812
00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:41.989
What will you do then?

813
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:52.410
I've never told you this before,
have I?

814
00:47:55.169 --> 00:47:56.580
Yeon Ju, I love you,

815
00:47:59.879 --> 00:48:00.910
Let's,,,

816
00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:03.549
not break up,

817
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.250
- I brought the kids,
- You're home,

818
00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:15.020
Why is the kitchen so shiny?

819
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.919
You even arranged flowers,

820
00:49:16.919 --> 00:49:18.719
Why did you clean
in the middle of the night?

821
00:49:18.719 --> 00:49:20.390
An important guest is coming,

822
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:21.629
Who's coming when it's so late?

823
00:49:21.629 --> 00:49:22.899
A woman,

824
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.660
- A woman?
- A woman?

825
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.129
What are you talking about? Why
would a woman visit here so late?

826
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:29.799
Dad,

827
00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.569
Are you having an affair?

828
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:35.410
Tae Yang is having an affair,
not me,

829
00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:38.379
He's finally bringing
his girlfriend here,

830
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.009
Is he bringing that funny lady?

831
00:49:40.009 --> 00:49:44.020
Yes, he's finally introducing
her properly to us,

832
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.250
- Gosh,
- Gosh,

833
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:49.219
Why is he bringing her so suddenly?
He was hiding her from us,

834
00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:54.259
Is this your house?

835
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.689
Yes,

836
00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:58.759
Wait a minute,

837
00:49:59.569 --> 00:50:03.640
I want to leave
a good impression to your family,

838
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.870
Let me make this clear,
We're here for work,

839
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.779
The beginning might be for work,

840
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:16.120
but things will end according
to my will,

841
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.250
- I'm home,
- He's here,

842
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.560
Hello,

843
00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.890
I want you to meet my mom,

844
00:50:27.759 --> 00:50:30.730
Welcome, I heard
a lot about you from Tae Yang,

845
00:50:31.129 --> 00:50:32.129
Sorry?

846
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:34.899
I see,

847
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.939
I'm the youngest, Eun Byul,

848
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:39.270
I'm Woo Joo,

849
00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:42.210
Your makeup is amazing,

850
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:43.879
You know the makeup trend
of this fall,

851
00:50:44.279 --> 00:50:47.250
The color of your lipstick is
especially amazing,

852
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.450
This is Chef Go Jung Do, who will
teach you how to cook from now on,

853
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:55.020
Welcome, let's do our best,

854
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:58.520
I'm Joo Ae Ri, I'll do my best,

855
00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.330
Please start the lesson,
I have to go meet someone,

856
00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:03.960
You can't leave me here alone,

857
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.799
I came here with you
because it's the first day,

858
00:51:07.799 --> 00:51:09.029
Come by yourself from next time,

859
00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:16.540
- Welcome,
- Gosh,

860
00:51:19.279 --> 00:51:20.850
Hurry,

861
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.879
This doesn't feel right,

862
00:51:23.379 --> 00:51:24.549
- Welcome,
- Oh, my,

863
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:25.819
What are we going to do?

864
00:51:25.819 --> 00:51:26.819
Don't mind her,

865
00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:28.950
This isn't right,

866
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:32.430
We're from the Menu Research and
Development Team for the tasting,

867
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.460
Are you the Intern Lee Ru Ri?
Let me show you to a reserved seat,

868
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.600
A reserved seat?

869
00:51:37.399 --> 00:51:38.730
We didn't make a reservation,

870
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:40.370
Manager Jung did,

871
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:42.100
He didn't mention that,

872
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:45.239
There must be a mistake,

873
00:51:45.239 --> 00:51:47.969
Don't you understand?

874
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:51.210
He didn't tell to surprise you,

875
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.910
Manager Jung is so romantic,

876
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.080
Really?

877
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.319
Please follow me,

878
00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:01.020
Ru Ri, I'm going to leave,

879
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:03.960
I hope you have a good time tonight,

880
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:07.290
Myung Rang,
have dinner with us before you go,

881
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.730
That's okay, I don't want to feel
uncomfortable,

882
00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.529
I didn't mean it, Just leave,

883
00:52:11.529 --> 00:52:12.629
You're making me mad,

884
00:52:12.899 --> 00:52:15.529
I'm jealous, I hope
you have a good time,

885
00:52:15.939 --> 00:52:17.200
Please take good care of her,

886
00:52:18.799 --> 00:52:19.839
Okay,

887
00:52:20.439 --> 00:52:22.339
You must be surprised because
I asked you to come so suddenly,

888
00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.040
I only had time tonight,

889
00:52:25.339 --> 00:52:27.950
You must feel awkward
because Tae Yang's not here,

890
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:32.649
It's okay, I understand
since he's busy with work,

891
00:52:33.489 --> 00:52:36.560
You're even kind,

892
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.060
Let's take a test
to see how skilled you are,

893
00:52:42.129 --> 00:52:44.759
I'll wash my hands before that,

894
00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.239
Wait,

895
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.779
is Ru RI the girlfriend of
Jung Tae Yang?

896
00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.850
That won't do,

897
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.379
Jung Tae Yang will be
mine from now on,

898
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:07.089
Do you know Intern Lee Ru Ri?

899
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.560
She'll arrive soon,
Please show her to the seat,

900
00:53:18.799 --> 00:53:19.830
Is this the main office?

901
00:53:20.629 --> 00:53:22.969
I'm calling you because of
Manager Jung's request,

902
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.870
Please cancel today's reservation,

903
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:31.310
and tell Lee Ru Ri,,,

904
00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:35.779
that he can't go because he's with
a very important person,

905
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.290
I hope you have a good time tonight,

906
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:42.279
Ms, Lee?

907
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:44.649
I just got a call from Manager Jung,

908
00:54:44.649 --> 00:54:46.589
When will he arrive?

909
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:50.419
He can't come because he's with
a very important person,

910
00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:56.700
A very important person?

911
00:54:57.899 --> 00:54:59.600
I have an important plan,

912
00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.810
I guess he can't make a call because
they're having a good time,

913
00:55:28.189 --> 00:55:29.359
Manager Jung,

914
00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.399
- Is my guest still waiting?
- She just left,

915
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.169
What are you talking about?

916
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:41.739
Excuse me,

917
00:55:45.439 --> 00:55:49.219
Chef Jung, Do you know
what day it is today?

918
00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:54.750
It's been exactly a year since
the day we met on the train,

919
00:56:20.879 --> 00:56:22.779
I guess he's sorry,

920
00:56:23.419 --> 00:56:26.149
He keeps playing push and pull,

921
00:56:27.219 --> 00:56:28.390
No, thank you,

922
00:56:28.689 --> 00:56:32.089
I'll leave you two alone,
Have fun with Joo Ae Ri,

923
00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:37.930
The number you have dialed
is unavailable,

924
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.830
Why isn't she picking up?

925
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:49.040
I haven't eaten anything when it's
our first anniversary,

926
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.250
That looks good,

927
00:56:56.419 --> 00:56:59.689
Eating is the best way
to relieve stress,

928
00:57:00.989 --> 00:57:02.719
- Hello,
- What would you like?

929
00:57:03.259 --> 00:57:07.029
Please give me two servings of
tteokbokki, sundae,

930
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:09.830
and the fishcake bar,

931
00:57:16.839 --> 00:57:19.640
The number you have dialed
is unavailable,

932
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:23.739
This is weird,

933
00:57:24.839 --> 00:57:26.750
It's our first anniversary,
but she's not answering,

934
00:57:34.149 --> 00:57:36.759
What did you think of her?
Did you like her?

935
00:57:36.989 --> 00:57:39.890
Tae Yang's pretty picky
because he takes after you,

936
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:42.259
She was nice and pretty, I like her,

937
00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:44.399
I know, right? She was polite too,

938
00:57:44.399 --> 00:57:47.200
I like her too,
If she goes light on her makeup,

939
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.370
she'll be beautiful,

940
00:57:49.339 --> 00:57:50.870
I don't like her,

941
00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:53.009
I have a bad feeling about her,

942
00:57:53.939 --> 00:57:56.379
You always get jealous
when someone's prettier than you,

943
00:57:56.379 --> 00:58:00.279
That's not it,
Women know women better,

944
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:02.080
I can tell she's a total succubus,

945
00:58:04.049 --> 00:58:05.450
That's enough,

946
00:58:05.919 --> 00:58:08.890
She's the first girlfriend
Tae Yang brought home,

947
00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.919
We should support him, okay?

948
00:58:11.919 --> 00:58:14.790
She didn't mind even
when he left her alone,

949
00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:16.529
She looked really nice,

950
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.899
Nice, my foot, She had
a wicked look,

951
00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.620
The number you have dialed,,,

952
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.120
is unavailable, Please leave
a message,,,

953
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.290
Why isn't she picking up?

954
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:45.930
Is she in trouble?

955
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:02.439
Myung Rang, I'm at Ru Ri's house,,,

956
00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:03.839
because I couldn't get
ahold of Ru Ri,

957
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.719
She's here, Bye,

958
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.419
Hey, Lee Ru Ri,

959
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.359
What happened?
Why didn't you pick up?

960
00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:23.960
What's wrong?

961
00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:26.029
What are you doing here?

962
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:28.370
You said you can't come because
you're with an important person,

963
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:30.140
When did I say that?

964
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:33.210
You're denying that?

965
00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:34.810
I saw everything,

966
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:38.640
I saw you leaving with Joo Ae Ri
in front of the company,

967
00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.279
Are you laughing now?

968
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.149
Why is she so important?

969
00:59:44.219 --> 00:59:45.620
Do you like her or something?

970
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.520
What do you like about her?

971
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:49.919
Do you like her because
she's the chairman's daughter?

972
00:59:50.919 --> 00:59:54.060
Or is it because she's pretty, fit,

973
00:59:56.359 --> 00:59:57.700
and has pale skin?

974
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:03.069
I didn't know you were that kind
of a guy,

975
01:00:04.239 --> 01:00:05.839
How could you,,,

976
01:00:05.839 --> 01:00:07.109
All men are same,

977
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:09.040
When a woman has a pale skin,
beautiful,

978
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.980
and smiles while being sweet,

979
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.480
- they think they like,,,
- "What I see every day,,,"

980
01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.819
"and what I eat every day
become new,,,"

981
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.489
"when I'm with you,"

982
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:23.489
Is it true?

983
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.730
New, my foot,

984
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:31.759
Here,

985
01:00:33.669 --> 01:00:34.770
What's this?

986
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:40.810
Your horoscope necklace, Capricorn,

987
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.839
You remembered by birthday?

988
01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:45.509
Of course,

989
01:00:46.149 --> 01:00:49.080
You even colored it red
on the company calendar,

990
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.080
It's so beautiful,

991
01:00:55.759 --> 01:00:59.330
Lee Ru Ri, Since it's been a year,

992
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:02.060
listen carefully to what I say,
I won't say it twice,

993
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.899
No matter what happens, you don't
need to worry about other women,

994
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.939
I don't like women who are
pretty, fit,

995
01:01:13.939 --> 01:01:15.169
and have pale skin,

996
01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.439
Someone who's less pretty like you,

997
01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.879
less fit and dark skin,,,

998
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.089
I like you so much,,,

999
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:32.859
That's not enough,

1000
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:35.830
I think I love,,,

1001
01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:42.969
I love,,,

1002
01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:50.680
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

1003
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.239
I was in the middle of
something very important,

1004
01:01:52.239 --> 01:01:53.450
What were you saying?

1005
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:54.680
I can't get it,

1006
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.850
Do you like it that much?

1007
01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.919
Yes, I never got anything
from a man before,

1008
01:02:02.149 --> 01:02:03.489
Come here, I'll do it for you,

1009
01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:27.279
Done,

1010
01:02:28.379 --> 01:02:29.879
How do I look? Is it pretty?

1011
01:02:32.279 --> 01:02:34.689
Gosh, how beautiful,

1012
01:02:35.759 --> 01:02:36.890
I mean that necklace,

1013
01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:38.989
Seriously,

1014
01:02:44.299 --> 01:02:46.629
Thank you for remembering
the first anniversary,

1015
01:02:47.399 --> 01:02:51.100
Thank you for filling one year
of my life,

1016
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.270
Thank you in advance for the future,

1017
01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:55.980
Okay,

1018
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.839
Yes, I'm in the studio,

1019
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.739
Why won't you come home?

1020
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.739
Mother would feel uncomfortable
if I were there,

1021
01:03:32.279 --> 01:03:33.710
I'll stay here for a while,

1022
01:03:35.049 --> 01:03:37.620
Call me when you make up your mind,

1023
01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.189
I can't believe how mean you are,

1024
01:03:43.859 --> 01:03:44.960
Yeon Ju,

1025
01:03:59.509 --> 01:04:00.669
Darn it,

1026
01:04:01.439 --> 01:04:04.640
You know I don't like having flour
for breakfast,

1027
01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.450
It's what Han Gyul wants,

1028
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.219
Hey, Han Gyul,

1029
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.120
You must have rice for breakfast,

1030
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.790
Koreans need the rice power,

1031
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.719
What is the rice power?

1032
01:04:17.489 --> 01:04:19.589
You don't know what rice power is?

1033
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:24.100
This is what rice power is,
Reliable like this,

1034
01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.629
In other words, a source of power,

1035
01:04:27.169 --> 01:04:29.770
Why are you packing side dishes?

1036
01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:30.899
Who are they for?

1037
01:04:30.899 --> 01:04:33.640
It's for So Won, He probably
didn't go home,,,

1038
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.669
after all that mess because it'd
have been uncomfortable,

1039
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:38.810
Why did you make him say that
in the first place?

1040
01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:43.250
I applied for adoption of Han Gyul,
Don't ever instigate him again,

1041
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:45.350
Honey, How could you,,,

1042
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:56.029
Yes, Yeon Ju, Hi, What's going on?

1043
01:05:00.469 --> 01:05:02.939
Okay, I'll meet you there,

1044
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:17.520
Do you have to see her?

1045
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.089
I can't forgive her,

1046
01:05:20.219 --> 01:05:22.020
I'm so upset and angry,,,

1047
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.919
that I want to talk to her about it,

1048
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.390
Yes, I get it, I get how you feel,

1049
01:05:29.399 --> 01:05:33.069
But she won't get it,

1050
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:37.870
She'll only humiliate you
if you see her,

1051
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:41.870
I'm here to make the final decision,
so don't try to stop me,

1052
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:46.509
What do you mean
by the final decision?

1053
01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.049
Inmate 601, A visit,

1054
01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.640
Ms, Ha Yeon Ju?

1055
01:06:18.939 --> 01:06:20.680
I don't know you,

1056
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:23.149
Who are you?

1057
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:26.450
I'm Lee So Won's wife,

1058
01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:32.189
Since you're talking down,
I'll talk down too,

1059
01:06:34.089 --> 01:06:35.589
You're just as I imagined,

1060
01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.000
I was always curious about,,,

1061
01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.930
how the rich daughter
So Won chose for money,,,

1062
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.569
would look like,

1063
01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.210
Having money must be nice,

1064
01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:49.609
So Won married you even though
you're not his type,

1065
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:51.279
Same goes for you,

1066
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:53.149
I also wanted to see,,,

1067
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:57.279
how shameless you must be to
dump your child to someone else,

1068
01:06:58.419 --> 01:07:01.250
I can tell you're more than
capable of doing that,

1069
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.259
seeing how rude you are,

1070
01:07:04.989 --> 01:07:07.430
I'm sure you're not here
to check that,

1071
01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.629
Are you here to check,,,

1072
01:07:09.629 --> 01:07:12.430
how deep my relationship was
with So Won?

1073
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:21.870
So? How deep was it?

1074
01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:23.910
Are you ready to hear it?

1075
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.140
Sure,

1076
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.750
Tell me in detail,

1077
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.020
Did you know we met each other
while we were in college?

1078
01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:35.859
He was the hottest guy
in our college,

1079
01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.020
Girls even joined the volunteer
service,,,

1080
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.759
to see him and follow him around,

1081
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.029
Were you one of them?

1082
01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.700
Not at all,

1083
01:07:45.299 --> 01:07:48.100
I was already busy with my life,
I wasn't interested in him,

1084
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:50.200
But the funny thing is,,,

1085
01:07:51.169 --> 01:07:53.939
he fell in love with me
at a first sight,

1086
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.080
and begged me to date him,,,

1087
01:07:57.509 --> 01:07:59.350
for a year,

1088
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:03.250
So you dated him for his effort?

1089
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.980
I heard it's the other way around
for you,

1090
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:07.450
I heard,,,

1091
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.020
you tried so hard to marry him,

1092
01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:14.660
An apartment and a hospital,
My goodness,

1093
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.560
Talk about yourself,

1094
01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.430
I know my story better than you do,

1095
01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.469
I'm sorry if it offended you,

1096
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.670
It's all in the past anyway,

1097
01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:29.010
But it comes to my mind
from time to time,

1098
01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:33.550
The future So Won and I dreamed of,

1099
01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:37.580
Sleeping together every night
after we get married,

1100
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:40.689
Waking up together in the morning,

1101
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.120
Giving birth to a child
who resembles both me and him,

1102
01:08:45.019 --> 01:08:47.689
Right, I accomplished one of them,

1103
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:51.899
I gave birth to a child
that resembles him,

1104
01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:54.470
Have you seen Han Gyul?

1105
01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:56.540
She looks just like him,

1106
01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.769
Her eyes, nose and even her lips,

1107
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:02.170
Isn't it amazing?

1108
01:09:03.679 --> 01:09:06.309
Oh, right, Do you have a child?

1109
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:10.149
You probably do since you've been
married for four years,

1110
01:09:10.519 --> 01:09:14.689
Should I say sorry for making
a step-sister of your child?

1111
01:09:15.989 --> 01:09:18.590
There's no need,
I can't get pregnant,

1112
01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.500
Do you want to know why I'm here?

1113
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.670
It's because I can't decide whether
I should accept your child or not,

1114
01:09:29.099 --> 01:09:32.170
I thought you'd be at least sorry
if you're a mother,

1115
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:34.139
and that's the way it should be,

1116
01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:38.710
So you're saying that you can't
raise Han Gyul,,,

1117
01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:40.580
now you've met me?

1118
01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:45.019
I feel pity for you,

1119
01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.290
I never knew you even existed,

1120
01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:52.790
I feel sad that you repelled me
when you don't even know me,

1121
01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.399
It's so sad that I even feel sorry,

1122
01:09:56.399 --> 01:09:57.899
What are you trying to say?

1123
01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.500
Are you going to raise my child
or what?

1124
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.739
Promise me one thing
as a mother to mother,

1125
01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.809
Whatever happens in the future,

1126
01:10:07.809 --> 01:10:10.179
you'll never get near So Won
and Han Gyul,

1127
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:13.809
If you're going to play dirty
after you're released,

1128
01:10:14.309 --> 01:10:16.920
I'm not going to raise your child,

1129
01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.620
What? Can't you promise me on that?

1130
01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:24.960
I get it then,

1131
01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.389
Your daughter has nothing to do
with me from now on,

1132
01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:30.599
Wait,

1133
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.899
Everything's up to you,

1134
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:37.040
Fine, I beg you,

1135
01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.870
Please raise her as your daughter,

1136
01:10:44.439 --> 01:10:47.450
Raise her with love like your own,

1137
01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.819
so that she won't even remember,,,

1138
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:55.590
that I was,,,

1139
01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.989
her mother once,

1140
01:11:00.429 --> 01:11:03.800
Then if I ever play dirty later,

1141
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:06.429
Han Gyul,,,

1142
01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:09.439
will be your child,

1143
01:11:11.069 --> 01:11:12.300
Please do that,

1144
01:11:13.309 --> 01:11:14.569
I beg you,

1145
01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:20.479
I beg you, Please,

1146
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.189
Hey,

1147
01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.460
How did it go, Yeon Ju?

1148
01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:37.660
Did you cry?

1149
01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:41.099
Gosh, I told you,

1150
01:11:41.099 --> 01:11:43.899
I told you that witch,,,

1151
01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:46.069
isn't worth meeting because she's
way below your level,

1152
01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:48.370
I don't know what to do,

1153
01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:51.809
I can't abandon my mom or So Won,

1154
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:59.220
Let me ask you for one last time,

1155
01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.420
Do you love So Won
from the bottom of your heart?

1156
01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:05.830
Of course,

1157
01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:10.029
Are you willing to do anything
to live with him?

1158
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:12.429
Yes, Of course,

1159
01:12:12.769 --> 01:12:15.739
Good, There's nothing
you can't do now,

1160
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.470
From now on,

1161
01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.540
you'll be a mother,

1162
01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.439
A mother?

1163
01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.540
What do you mean?

1164
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.189
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1165
01:12:35.319 --> 01:12:37.760
I like you as a son-in-law,

1166
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.859
What do you think of Ae Ri?

1167
01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:41.359
I went to Tae Yang's home last night
and met his parents,

1168
01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:43.460
His mother is beautiful,

1169
01:12:43.599 --> 01:12:44.700
Attempted murder?

1170
01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.099
My son is living with a woman
who is a criminal?

1171
01:12:48.099 --> 01:12:49.340
Did you order correctly?

1172
01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.670
When will Lee Ru Ri
become a full-time employee?

1173
01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:53.010
You should delay it a little,

1174
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:55.779
I'm sorry, Mom,
I'm pregnant, I'm four weeks in,

1175
01:12:55.779 --> 01:12:57.239
What is the chairman doing here?

1176
01:12:57.239 --> 01:13:00.910
He doesn't even know
his son's alive,

1177
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.649
Tell me, What is the truth?

1178
01:13:02.819 --> 01:13:04.420
Show me my son,
