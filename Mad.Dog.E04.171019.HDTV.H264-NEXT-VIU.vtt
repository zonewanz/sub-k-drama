00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.258
I'm not your brother anymore.

How may I help you?

12
00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:19.248
Oh, may I ask you a question?

13
00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:21.448
I was going to meet my brother here,

14
00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.788
but I can't reach him.

15
00:01:22.788 --> 00:01:25.457
He's a guy in his mid-20s, rather thin.

16
00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.157
Oh, him.

17
00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:28.728
He came by, then left.

18
00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:30.388
You should give him another call.

19
00:01:31.127 --> 00:01:32.558
Excuse me.

20
00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:34.498
Could you tell me...

21
00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:36.668

23
00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:42.607
Your brother asked me the same question.

24
00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:44.778
Are you two looking for the same person?

25
00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.207
Like I told him,

26
00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.877
she never came by after the year 2015.

27
00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:51.948
Oh, you mean...

28
00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:53.648
this lady?

29
00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:55.888
Oh, that's not her.

30
00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:59.217
Your brother was looking for the woman next to her.

31
00:02:01.857 --> 00:02:02.987
This person?

32
00:02:03.187 --> 00:02:04.698
Yes, her.

33
00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.898
She never came by.

34
00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.567
Why is he looking for someone who's dead?

35
00:02:29.317 --> 00:02:30.988
Could you give me a moment?

36
00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:40.227
Sorry to wake you while you're still jet lagged.

37
00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:41.798
I left my watch to get it fixed,

38
00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:43.097
but I forgot to pick it up.

39
00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:44.368
Is that your girlfriend?

40
00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:48.868
No, she's someone I grew up with.

41
00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.608
I thought you grew up at aunt's.

42
00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:51.708
Well, what happened is...

43
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:52.977
I thought you were late.

44
00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:54.078
Go.

45
00:02:57.518 --> 00:02:58.618
Hey, Min Joon.

46
00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:01.048
Aren't you going to say goodbye to your brother?

47
00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:02.947
Have a good trip or whatever.

48

I don't have anyone like that.

52
00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:15.467
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:16.998
I'm really sorry.

54
00:03:17.537 --> 00:03:18.738
I don't want to hear that.

55

Park it elsewhere!

128
00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:05.257
I should move to a different place.

There's a problem every day.

130

You have no parking space.

Your dash cam is brand new too.

138

That jerk.

139
00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:44.027
Did he just take the laptop and leave...

140
00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:45.427
without helping Kang Eun Joo?

141
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:46.858
That scumbag.

142
00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:49.667
Who is that?

143
00:08:52.738 --> 00:08:54.537

He's a pharmaceutical researcher.

I guess they only hire the pretty ones.

148
00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:10.287
How much should I buy for a date?

149
00:09:10.287 --> 00:09:11.787
Get lost, mister.

150
00:09:21.498 --> 00:09:24.598

151
00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:25.968
I'm growling.

152
00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:33.478
It's so dirty.

153
00:09:33.478 --> 00:09:35.407
- It's really bad. - I can...

154
00:09:35.578 --> 00:09:38.147
make it all clean.

155
00:09:43.588 --> 00:09:46.358

Han Sung Ho? Han Sang...

157
00:09:49.228 --> 00:09:50.728
You mean Professor Han Seong Jin.

158
00:09:50.728 --> 00:09:52.257
He has a good reputation.

159
00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:54.868
They say he's gentle, quiet, and polite.

160
00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.238
His research hadn't been...

161
00:09:57.238 --> 00:09:58.667
showing results for a few years.

162
00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:01.608
But that changed all of a sudden.

163
00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:04.478
The rumor of him doing...

164
00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.108
some amazing research started...

165
00:10:06.108 --> 00:10:07.708
Right after Lee Soo Oh died.

166
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:08.777
Bingo.

167
00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:10.948
But recently, for over a month,

168
00:10:10.948 --> 00:10:12.578
he's been cranky.

169
00:10:12.748 --> 00:10:14.887
He's been hysterical about bathrooms...

170
00:10:14.887 --> 00:10:16.618
not being clean.

171
00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.917
He needed Lee Soo Oh's laptop.

172
00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:21.728
If we prove that Han Seong Jin's research...

173
00:10:21.728 --> 00:10:23.127
and documents in Lee Soo Oh's laptop...

174
00:10:23.127 --> 00:10:24.897
are the same,

175
00:10:25.027 --> 00:10:26.958
the police will start investigating again.

176
00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.397
We need to find the laptop then.

177
00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:30.968
Where could it be?

178
00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:31.998
It'll be there.

179
00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:34.267
A place with...

180
00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.767
high security.

181
00:10:36.468 --> 00:10:38.377
Shall we pull "Mission Impossible"?

182
00:10:38.377 --> 00:10:39.677
There are a ton of surveillance cameras.

183
00:10:39.677 --> 00:10:41.208
Up, down, sideways. They're all difficult.

184
00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:42.578
It's impossible to penetrate.

185
00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:49.318
Kim Min Joon.

186
00:10:51.287 --> 00:10:52.517
You speak German, right?

187
00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.988
Since I'm German, I do.

188
00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.657
Okay. Come down here.

189
00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.027
Why?

190
00:10:59.328 --> 00:11:00.797
You told me not to do anything.

191
00:11:00.797 --> 00:11:02.167
But I want you to come down...

192
00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:04.037
and speak some German.

193
00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:05.368
Get here quickly.

194
00:11:10.907 --> 00:11:12.877
Will you use Kim Min Joon as a player?

195
00:11:12.877 --> 00:11:13.877
What?

196
00:11:16.307 --> 00:11:18.647
Kang Woo. I don't trust him.

197
00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:20.818
How can I work with someone I don't trust?

198
00:11:20.818 --> 00:11:21.917
Soon Jung.

199
00:11:22.318 --> 00:11:23.958
There's a mosquito in a room.

200
00:11:24.588 --> 00:11:25.887
You hear it buzzing,

201
00:11:25.887 --> 00:11:27.757
but you can't see it.

202
00:11:28.657 --> 00:11:30.188
How would you catch it?

203
00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.927
You should lock the door...

204
00:11:33.057 --> 00:11:34.927
and wait patiently.

205
00:11:35.527 --> 00:11:36.627
That's right.

206
00:11:36.998 --> 00:11:38.397
Will you lock him in there?

207
00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.698
Watch closely.

208
00:11:40.738 --> 00:11:42.868
- Okay? - Where's "there"?

209
00:11:43.407 --> 00:11:44.877
There.

210
00:11:44.877 --> 00:11:46.037
(Samhu Pharmaceutical)

211
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.877
Samhu Pharmaceutical has...

212
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:52.277
a short-term guest researcher program.

213
00:11:53.177 --> 00:11:56.017
I'll turn you into Dr. Jonas Kim,

214
00:11:56.318 --> 00:11:58.017
a German researcher from German company.

215
00:11:58.358 --> 00:12:01.127
Why doesn't Cheetah do this?

216
00:12:01.127 --> 00:12:02.157
Gosh.

217
00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:04.598
Goodness.

218
00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:05.797
Should I go?

219
00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:12.368
- I don't think so. - Why not?

220
00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:13.598
You stand out too much.

221
00:12:13.598 --> 00:12:16.537
No, I'm very plain.

222
00:12:18.507 --> 00:12:19.537
Jang Ha Ri.

223
00:12:20.377 --> 00:12:21.748
Are you flirting with me?

224
00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:23.108
You crazy...

225
00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:25.248
Sit down.

226
00:12:25.248 --> 00:12:27.417
Goodness.

227
00:12:28.488 --> 00:12:29.787
Gosh.

228
00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:33.927
Proceed, Dr. Kim.

229
00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:39.328
It's itchy.

230
00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.797
Do you always wear that when you're scamming?

231
00:12:43.998 --> 00:12:45.267
People put their guards guards down...

232
00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:46.397
when I look naive.

233
00:12:47.307 --> 00:12:48.738
A few of you were fooled too.

234
00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:55.578
1, 2, 3.

235
00:13:12.698 --> 00:13:13.998
Pentium.

236
00:13:13.998 --> 00:13:16.027
Let's run a passport business together.

237
00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:17.027
10 to 0.

238
00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:18.297
- Who gets 10? - Me.

239
00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:19.338
Why would I do it then?

240
00:13:19.338 --> 00:13:20.938
It means he won't work with you.

241
00:13:20.938 --> 00:13:22.807
Dr. Kim, you're not that bright.

242
00:13:22.807 --> 00:13:24.478
Didn't you know that?

243
00:13:31.118 --> 00:13:33.078
Be careful, Dr. Kim.

244
00:13:33.147 --> 00:13:34.287
Sorry.

245
00:13:35.688 --> 00:13:38.287
You're amazing at cleaning.

246
00:13:38.287 --> 00:13:40.287
Of course, I am.

247
00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.257
The cafeteria is that way.

248
00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:44.358
There he comes.

249
00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:46.228
Your room is this way.

250
00:13:57.407 --> 00:13:58.578
Start moving.

251
00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.068
Close your eyes.

252
00:14:34.348 --> 00:14:35.907
Here I go.

253
00:14:56.968 --> 00:14:58.037
Ha Ri.

254
00:14:58.167 --> 00:14:59.537
Will you be okay to share a room with him?

255
00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:01.468
I'm not sure if he'll be all right.

256
00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:02.767
Focus, guys.

257
00:15:04.978 --> 00:15:06.838
Goodness, you're all busy.

258
00:15:07.348 --> 00:15:09.407
All right, guys. Say hello to each other.

259
00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:14.748
He's the new researcher of our lab.

260
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.818
He's Doctor Jonas Kim from Germany.

261
00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:28.767
How does he look?

262
00:15:31.938 --> 00:15:33.037
He looks fine.

263
00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:38.978
Will you be all right alone?

264
00:15:40.547 --> 00:15:41.948
I'm not alone.

265
00:15:41.948 --> 00:15:43.078
I have you guys.

266
00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:45.677
About the Lee Soo Oh case...

267
00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.047
How do you think it's related to Lee Mi Ran?

268
00:15:48.188 --> 00:15:49.287
I need to find out.

269
00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:51.958
Don't lose him.

270
00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.157
Keep a close eye on him.

271
00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:55.427
Okay, don't worry.

272
00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.598
It's going great.

273
00:15:59.897 --> 00:16:01.868
He's Doctor Jonas Kim who came from...

274
00:16:01.868 --> 00:16:03.127
Higel Medical Laboratory in Germany.

275
00:16:03.127 --> 00:16:04.968
This is Doctor Han Seong Jin.

276
00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.838
Hello, I'm Jonas Kim.

277
00:16:07.608 --> 00:16:09.167
Jonas Kim.

278
00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:11.578
My name is Han Seong Jin.

279
00:16:12.277 --> 00:16:15.047
Have we ever met before?

280
00:16:15.047 --> 00:16:17.218
I hear that often.

281
00:16:18.047 --> 00:16:21.488
Maybe it's because I have friendly looks.

282
00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:22.848
What on earth are they talking about?

283
00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.818
They must be bragging about themselves.

284
00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.488
Those punks.

285
00:16:26.488 --> 00:16:28.188
Same here.

286
00:16:28.757 --> 00:16:29.988
Can you speak in Korean?

287
00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:31.228
Korean...

288
00:16:31.228 --> 00:16:32.427
I can speak Korean very well.

289
00:16:33.797 --> 00:16:35.927
You're fluent in German.

290
00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:38.098
I went there to study when I was little.

291
00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:39.137
I see.

292
00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:40.907
Let's have a team dinner soon.

293
00:16:40.907 --> 00:16:41.968
Sure.

294
00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:43.108
- Nice to meet you. - Me too.

295
00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:45.578
I'll show you your desk.

296
00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:46.578
Okay.

297
00:16:48.948 --> 00:16:50.307
You can use this desk.

298
00:16:59.387 --> 00:17:00.787
(Taeyang Insurance protects your family.)

299
00:17:07.498 --> 00:17:10.128
Gosh, what do they want me to do...

300
00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:11.138
with this petty information?

301
00:17:11.138 --> 00:17:12.168
Nothing's in there.

302
00:17:12.968 --> 00:17:14.307
You don't have to bother.

303
00:17:14.307 --> 00:17:16.307
That's exactly how I feel.

304
00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:21.307
I mean, you're the great Chairman Cha,

305
00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:23.148
and you're being sensitive for something small.

306
00:17:24.148 --> 00:17:25.517
What's making you so scared?

307
00:17:25.517 --> 00:17:26.678
Do I look...

308
00:17:26.878 --> 00:17:28.718
like I'm scared to you?

309
00:17:33.718 --> 00:17:34.757
No?

310
00:17:34.757 --> 00:17:36.357
Your dad once said this.

311
00:17:36.527 --> 00:17:38.698
His only son is...

312
00:17:39.027 --> 00:17:40.797
the dumbest person...

313
00:17:40.797 --> 00:17:42.728
in the JH family.

314
00:17:44.198 --> 00:17:45.867
Don't try to use your brain.

315
00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.738
Don't try to think.

316
00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:49.408
Don't try to judge.

317
00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:51.507
Just do as you're told.

318
00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:53.978
Okay.

319
00:17:57.107 --> 00:17:59.317
Well, Chairman Cha of Taeyang Insurance.

320
00:18:00.317 --> 00:18:02.218
My dad's place will be mine soon.

321
00:18:02.218 --> 00:18:04.857
I'm soon-to-be the chairman of JH Group.

322
00:18:04.857 --> 00:18:06.218
Not yet.

323
00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:08.988
You may not be the chairman forever.

324
00:18:10.658 --> 00:18:12.728
Okay, I give up.

325
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.797
He keeps even the dead person alive.

326
00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:18.398
It was too thoughtless of me.

327
00:18:18.638 --> 00:18:19.668
Get out.

328
00:18:20.238 --> 00:18:21.968
I don't have meals with someone...

329
00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:23.168
who's ungrateful to their parents.

330
00:18:43.027 --> 00:18:45.198
You look nice!

331
00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:47.527
Do you two date each other?

332
00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:50.797
Let's continue.

333
00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.767
Hey, Hong Joo!

334
00:18:56.968 --> 00:18:59.007
Stop playing and come out.

335
00:19:11.557 --> 00:19:12.587
Get in.

336
00:19:15.527 --> 00:19:17.428
You'll get in anyway, so let's make it short.

337
00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:20.527
I'm in a terrible mood because of your dad.

338
00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:22.498
- Just go. - I'd like to...

339
00:19:22.498 --> 00:19:24.638
irritate your dad very much.

340
00:19:25.138 --> 00:19:26.998
My mouth is becoming so light.

341
00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:28.708
It's driving me crazy.

342
00:19:32.378 --> 00:19:33.638
What do you want?

343
00:19:35.678 --> 00:19:37.077
Let's have a drink together.

344
00:19:37.547 --> 00:19:38.748
You're sickening.

345
00:19:38.748 --> 00:19:41.117
That's my charm, Hong Joo.

346
00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:00.398
Keep yourself in control.

347
00:20:00.638 --> 00:20:03.408
Stop having fun with those trainers, Hong Joo.

348
00:20:03.408 --> 00:20:04.738
What are you talking about?

349
00:20:04.738 --> 00:20:06.077
I'm not like you.

350
00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.978
I quit playing around with girls.

351
00:20:08.978 --> 00:20:11.918
- I'm busy working. - I see.

352
00:20:11.918 --> 00:20:14.248
You never believe in what I say.

353
00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:16.587
I don't lie to you.

354
00:20:16.587 --> 00:20:17.918
I tell you everything.

355
00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:19.057
Please don't.

356
00:20:19.057 --> 00:20:20.688
That's not how things should be between us.

357
00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:22.087
There's nothing...

358
00:20:22.357 --> 00:20:23.688
between us.

359
00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.057
There isn't?

(Kang Eun Joo)

361
00:20:40.178 --> 00:20:41.478
You wanted to have a drink.

362
00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:42.507
Sit.

363
00:20:43.878 --> 00:20:45.678
You have soju, right?

364
00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.287
- Yes. - That and dakbal, please.

365
00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:48.287
Okay.

366
00:20:48.488 --> 00:20:49.817
Hey, Hong Joo.

367
00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:52.958
How can you have...

368
00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.027
chicken's feet as a human?

369
00:20:55.527 --> 00:20:58.198
You should have a heart at least.

370
00:21:00.198 --> 00:21:02.297
Give us cow heart please.

371
00:21:02.297 --> 00:21:03.327
Okay.

372
00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:08.168
I didn't know you liked this stuff.

373
00:21:08.238 --> 00:21:09.468
You should've told me earlier.

374
00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:11.238
I can open 100 franchise restaurants...

375
00:21:11.238 --> 00:21:13.107
that sell these kinds of food.

376
00:21:13.107 --> 00:21:14.978
Stop bluffing.

377
00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:20.918
Drink it.

378
00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:35.698
Hyun Ki.

379
00:21:36.668 --> 00:21:37.797
Do you like me?

380
00:21:39.597 --> 00:21:40.668
I don't.

381
00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:42.238
Right?

382
00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:44.277
I thought so.

383
00:21:45.077 --> 00:21:46.408
And why do you act like it?

384
00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:48.077
You know,

385
00:21:48.378 --> 00:21:50.617
my life is full of pretending.

386
00:21:55.248 --> 00:21:56.817
My life's the same.

387
00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:59.488
I know. That's why I like...

388
00:21:59.488 --> 00:22:02.428
I mean, pretend to like you.

389
00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:03.898
Stop with your pretending.

390
00:22:03.898 --> 00:22:05.128
It's not fun at all.

391
00:22:05.128 --> 00:22:06.357
It's fun for me.

392
00:22:12.267 --> 00:22:13.297
Gosh.

393
00:22:15.638 --> 00:22:18.007
I'm okay.

394
00:22:18.077 --> 00:22:19.178
I'll help you.

395
00:22:19.178 --> 00:22:20.607
No, it's all right.

396
00:22:22.448 --> 00:22:23.948

397
00:22:24.817 --> 00:22:26.748
Let's go for another round.

398
00:22:27.218 --> 00:22:29.017
Take him home safely.

399
00:22:29.287 --> 00:22:30.918
I'll take you to your house too.

400
00:22:31.357 --> 00:22:32.817
If he finds out that I didn't...

401
00:22:32.817 --> 00:22:34.388
I'll say you did.

402
00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:41.267
You must be tired. Go straight home after.

403
00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:42.428
Goodbye.

If you do that,

409
00:24:15.357 --> 00:24:17.658
it'll take money...

410
00:24:18.527 --> 00:24:20.297
and a bit more time.

411
00:24:20.498 --> 00:24:21.597
Should I use the internal fund...

412
00:24:21.597 --> 00:24:22.898
to find some more shares?

413
00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:25.267
If they end up noticing it,

414
00:24:25.267 --> 00:24:26.597
the whole thing will be over.

415
00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:28.767
How much more do we need?

416
00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.507
About 10 million dollars.

417
00:24:31.408 --> 00:24:33.948
Okay. I will deposit it tomorrow.

418
00:24:33.948 --> 00:24:34.978
Yes, sir.

419
00:24:38.077 --> 00:24:39.448
I'll get going then.

420
00:24:51.628 --> 00:24:53.428
Why does the legal manager of Juhan Air...

421
00:24:53.428 --> 00:24:54.928
keep coming here?

422
00:24:54.928 --> 00:24:57.668
He's very much interested in plants.

423
00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:03.267
You're probably giving them what they want...

424
00:25:03.267 --> 00:25:04.537
and asking Joo Hyun Ki...

425
00:25:04.537 --> 00:25:06.378
to do what you want them to do.

426
00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:07.678
What is this?

427
00:25:07.678 --> 00:25:09.978
A file that you gave to Hyun Ki.

428
00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:12.347
Who else other than you...

429
00:25:12.347 --> 00:25:14.248
would give him a file like this?

430
00:25:14.918 --> 00:25:17.718
Wasn't it you who handed this over?

431
00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:19.757

432

disclose our confidential information...

433

This is called a redbud tree.

439
00:25:39.507 --> 00:25:40.878
It's a tree you see everywhere...

440

if you go out to the suburbs.

441

This tree has...

442
00:25:45.378 --> 00:25:46.847
another name.

443
00:25:47.918 --> 00:25:49.188
It's called a Judas tree.

444
00:25:49.988 --> 00:25:51.817
You know, the same Judas who betrayed Jesus.

445
00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:55.057
It's apparently the tree which he hung himself,

446
00:25:55.057 --> 00:25:56.458
so it's also called a Judas tree.

It's a type of keto acid.

When this meets with fat,

496
00:30:18.188 --> 00:30:19.587
it doesn't get absorbed into your body,

497
00:30:19.587 --> 00:30:21.587
but it goes right out.

498

How effective is this?

499
00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:24.498
It's five times faster...

500
00:30:24.498 --> 00:30:27.027
than the existing pills.

501
00:30:27.128 --> 00:30:29.128
But we haven't done any clinical tests.

502

513
00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:11.478
But I've never met any of the others...

514
00:31:17.047 --> 00:31:18.478
Where have I seen him?

515
00:31:18.748 --> 00:31:19.777
Where?

516
00:31:20.547 --> 00:31:22.617
No, never mind.

517
00:31:24.488 --> 00:31:26.958
If you ever see them, please do let me know.

518
00:31:28.228 --> 00:31:29.728
I'm sure they will come.

519
00:31:29.728 --> 00:31:30.827
Why would they find me?

520
00:31:30.998 --> 00:31:33.027
That's what they do.

521
00:31:33.027 --> 00:31:34.468
They get suspicious of anyone with no grounds,

522
00:31:34.468 --> 00:31:36.168
and disregard everything including the law...

523
00:31:36.168 --> 00:31:37.367
to go ahead with their plans.

524
00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:39.168
I see.

525
00:31:39.668 --> 00:31:42.168
If you ever see anyone out of the ordinary,

526
00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:43.668
or if any strange situations occur,

527
00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.238
please give me a call.

528
00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:58.988
Taeyang's Dog met up with the doctor.

529
00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:05.428
Park Moo Shin is meeting with Han Seong Jin.

530
00:32:17.238 --> 00:32:19.007
How did he find out?

531
00:32:19.238 --> 00:32:20.607
This dog, and that dog,

532
00:32:20.607 --> 00:32:21.978
they're all problematic.

533
00:32:33.357 --> 00:32:35.428
It looks like the doctor found out something.

534
00:32:36.158 --> 00:32:37.898
I agree with you 100 percent.

535
00:32:38.698 --> 00:32:41.398
We'll bring out the laptop tomorrow.

536
00:32:41.867 --> 00:32:43.827
Researchers usually come to work at 8am,

537
00:32:43.827 --> 00:32:45.168
then leave at 6pm.

538
00:32:45.168 --> 00:32:46.638
But Han Seong Jin comes to work at 4pm,

539
00:32:46.638 --> 00:32:48.367
and leaves at 8am the next day.

540
00:32:49.408 --> 00:32:50.807
There are people in here...

541
00:32:50.807 --> 00:32:52.638
24 hours a day. How can I do that?

542
00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:53.948
We can empty out the place.

543
00:32:53.978 --> 00:32:56.408
Tell me how.

544
00:32:56.408 --> 00:32:58.117
Can you take a look around,

545
00:32:58.678 --> 00:32:59.918
Doctor Kim?

546
00:33:03.688 --> 00:33:06.658
What's the scariest thing to happen in a lab?

547
00:33:13.228 --> 00:33:14.367
Virus?

548
00:33:14.597 --> 00:33:17.468
Soon Jung, can you ask Professor Byeon...

549
00:33:17.468 --> 00:33:19.468
for a rat on your way here?

550
00:33:19.468 --> 00:33:20.498
Okay.

551
00:33:24.238 --> 00:33:27.577
You must bring Laura back.

552
00:33:28.577 --> 00:33:29.577
Okay.

553
00:33:32.978 --> 00:33:34.047
Goodbye.

554
00:33:35.918 --> 00:33:38.418
Sir. What does he do?

555
00:33:38.418 --> 00:33:40.188
AFAS.

556
00:33:40.188 --> 00:33:43.057
What does AFAS do?

557
00:33:43.057 --> 00:33:45.398
They raise the oldest mice.

558
00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:46.658
Why do they do that?

559
00:33:46.658 --> 00:33:48.097
Their genome is...

560
00:33:48.097 --> 00:33:50.668
99 percent identical to that of human's.

561
00:33:50.668 --> 00:33:51.867
They're perfect for researching...

562
00:33:51.867 --> 00:33:54.307
aging or degenerative disease.

563
00:33:54.307 --> 00:33:55.367
Unbelievable.

564
00:33:55.607 --> 00:33:56.867
Each one...

565
00:33:56.867 --> 00:33:58.638
costs over 1,000 dollars.

566
00:33:58.708 --> 00:33:59.708
Goodness.

567
00:33:59.908 --> 00:34:01.077
I'm serious.

568
00:34:04.777 --> 00:34:06.347
Tonight's the last night.

569
00:34:07.148 --> 00:34:08.248
Do you want to come up?

570
00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:15.228
What are you thinking?

571
00:34:15.358 --> 00:34:17.157
I'm offering to sleep on the floor.

572
00:34:28.068 --> 00:34:29.508
What are you doing?

573
00:34:29.508 --> 00:34:31.677
You've been sleeping down here for days.

574
00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:33.508
I'll take the floor.

575
00:34:33.677 --> 00:34:35.447
Women shouldn't sleep on the floor.

576
00:34:35.677 --> 00:34:38.148
I'm not a woman.

577
00:34:38.847 --> 00:34:39.947
So don't mind me.

578
00:34:41.248 --> 00:34:42.318
Hey, I told you...

579
00:34:42.318 --> 00:34:43.818
you aren't even a...

580
00:34:44.217 --> 00:34:45.758
Cars that are about to be scrapped.

581
00:34:46.258 --> 00:34:47.588
Train stations.

582
00:34:48.557 --> 00:34:49.787
Public bathrooms.

583
00:34:51.628 --> 00:34:53.697
As long as the floor isn't wet, I'm good.

584
00:34:55.068 --> 00:34:57.637
Compared to them, this place is a hotel.

585
00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:02.037
I'm really okay. You take the bed.

586
00:35:02.537 --> 00:35:04.137
I don't need to hear your sad story.

587
00:35:04.938 --> 00:35:06.708
Be quiet and go to sleep.

588
00:35:08.577 --> 00:35:09.807
You believed me a bit, didn't you?

589
00:35:11.017 --> 00:35:12.248
You did.

590
00:35:12.248 --> 00:35:13.447
You felt sorry for me.

591
00:35:13.447 --> 00:35:15.918
I saw your eyes shaking.

592
00:35:17.217 --> 00:35:18.318
That was fun.

593
00:35:18.758 --> 00:35:19.887
Hey!

594
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:23.188
I see you have a soft spot for a story like this.

595
00:35:24.427 --> 00:35:25.427
Good night.

596
00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:56.783
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E04 Mad Dog "Chasing After a Dead Person"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

597
00:36:03.798 --> 00:36:05.498
Mr. Ahn, please move the car.

598
00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:13.978
What happened to your face?

599
00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:20.217
He lost a very important document.

600
00:36:20.217 --> 00:36:21.447
So I asked him.

601
00:36:21.447 --> 00:36:22.487
"Do you want to go to jail..."

602
00:36:22.487 --> 00:36:23.617
"or get beaten up?"

603
00:36:24.258 --> 00:36:25.258
He chose the beating.

604
00:36:25.258 --> 00:36:26.287
So did you hit him?

605
00:36:26.287 --> 00:36:28.088
I asked him to choose.

606
00:36:28.088 --> 00:36:30.628
He chose that himself.

607
00:36:37.097 --> 00:36:38.767
I'm here to ask you too.

608
00:36:39.398 --> 00:36:41.338
Hong Joo, did you take what's mine?

609
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.438
- No, right? - Yes.

610
00:36:45.307 --> 00:36:47.608
I took it because it was my company's document.

611
00:36:48.347 --> 00:36:49.847
I'm happy you don't lie.

612
00:36:50.307 --> 00:36:52.347
Never do that again. That was...

613
00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.487
in my car.

614
00:36:54.987 --> 00:36:57.188
So that was mine, Hong Joo.

615
00:36:57.188 --> 00:36:58.688
Why did you have...

616
00:36:59.117 --> 00:37:00.688
my company's case file?

617
00:37:01.387 --> 00:37:02.628
Don't ask.

618
00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:04.128
I don't want to lie.

619
00:37:06.798 --> 00:37:07.798
Let's go.

620
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.407
Is Mr. Choi here?

621
00:37:21.778 --> 00:37:22.778
Yes.

622
00:37:23.378 --> 00:37:24.617
How have you been?

623
00:37:24.617 --> 00:37:26.677
She's pretty. Is she pretty in person?

624
00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:28.617
She's super pretty.

625
00:37:29.148 --> 00:37:30.987
I want to have tea with her too.

626
00:37:31.557 --> 00:37:32.588
Should we go out there?

627
00:37:33.887 --> 00:37:36.088
Who is this? Gosh.

628
00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:42.467
- Yes, sir. - Turn the monitor off.

629
00:37:42.728 --> 00:37:43.728
Okay.

630
00:37:44.798 --> 00:37:45.838
What is it?

631
00:37:45.838 --> 00:37:46.898
- Turn it off. - Okay.

632
00:37:49.168 --> 00:37:51.838
Is everything being recorded?

633
00:37:52.237 --> 00:37:53.478
It's okay now. You can talk.

634
00:37:57.577 --> 00:37:58.648
I'm just wondering...

635
00:37:59.548 --> 00:38:02.447
how that case is going.

636
00:38:03.887 --> 00:38:04.987
It's going well.

637
00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:07.557
What?

638
00:38:07.758 --> 00:38:09.028
Are you keeping it a secret?

639
00:38:09.228 --> 00:38:10.327
What's going on?

640
00:38:12.258 --> 00:38:13.427
You look frozen.

641
00:38:14.068 --> 00:38:15.068
What's wrong?

642
00:38:17.168 --> 00:38:18.398
Nothing's wrong.

643
00:38:18.398 --> 00:38:19.938
I'm just worried about you.

644
00:38:19.938 --> 00:38:21.037
Why?

645
00:38:21.367 --> 00:38:23.208
I don't know. I'm just worried.

646
00:38:23.508 --> 00:38:24.577
What is it?

647
00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:28.608
About that case...

648
00:38:28.608 --> 00:38:30.648
You found out that Lee Mi Ran was the planner.

649
00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.088
It's okay.

650
00:38:34.517 --> 00:38:35.588
It's nothing.

651
00:38:37.688 --> 00:38:39.358
How can it be nothing?

652
00:38:39.987 --> 00:38:41.688
Are you starting over?

653
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:43.958
Are you going back to two years ago?

654
00:38:44.798 --> 00:38:45.798
Hong Joo.

655
00:38:47.827 --> 00:38:49.327
I realized it this time.

656
00:38:52.498 --> 00:38:53.537
I've never...

657
00:38:55.108 --> 00:38:56.367
been over it.

658
00:38:57.307 --> 00:38:58.478
Every day has been the same.

659
00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:00.947
What do you mean?

660
00:39:01.447 --> 00:39:02.478
Cha Hong Joo.

661
00:39:03.548 --> 00:39:04.818
You should live your life.

662
00:39:08.517 --> 00:39:09.517
Go.

663
00:39:11.387 --> 00:39:12.688
You should stop it...

664
00:39:12.688 --> 00:39:14.358
and live your life.

665
00:39:17.798 --> 00:39:18.827
Hong Joo.

666
00:39:20.327 --> 00:39:21.528
I have no such thing.

667
00:39:24.068 --> 00:39:25.137
Go home.

668
00:39:39.177 --> 00:39:40.248
Did you hear us talking?

669
00:39:42.217 --> 00:39:43.248
Aren't you sleeping?

670
00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:44.858
I told you to turn off the monitor.

671
00:39:44.858 --> 00:39:46.117
We did.

672
00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:48.657
You didn't tell us to turn off the sound though.

673
00:39:51.827 --> 00:39:53.028
Go to sleep.

674
00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:54.867
We have a lot to do tomorrow.

675
00:39:55.097 --> 00:39:56.097
- Okay. - Okay.

676
00:40:10.378 --> 00:40:12.177
It's all set up.

677
00:40:19.688 --> 00:40:21.528
Is he off work yet?

678
00:40:25.057 --> 00:40:26.597
He's getting off work late today.

679
00:40:26.597 --> 00:40:27.998
Is he inside?

680
00:40:32.568 --> 00:40:34.168
I can't check it from here.

681
00:40:34.168 --> 00:40:36.508
Dr. Kim. Use your brain.

682
00:40:43.677 --> 00:40:44.778
I'm sorry.

683
00:40:48.048 --> 00:40:49.048
Are you happy?

684
00:40:49.548 --> 00:40:50.588
Good job.

685
00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.858
He's leaving the office.

686
00:40:54.858 --> 00:40:56.358
Players, get ready.

687
00:40:56.358 --> 00:40:57.498
- Okay. - Okay.

688
00:41:13.878 --> 00:41:16.407
Doctor. Stop using so much tissues.

689
00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:17.717
Goodness.

690
00:41:18.447 --> 00:41:19.818
It's very gentle.

691
00:41:19.818 --> 00:41:21.248
Don't frighten it.

692
00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:48.108
- A rat! - What?

693
00:41:52.878 --> 00:41:55.088
There's a rat! Catch it!

694
00:41:56.217 --> 00:41:57.318
Goodness.

695
00:41:57.318 --> 00:41:59.387
Oh, my gosh. Seoul virus!

696
00:42:02.387 --> 00:42:04.858
There's virus in a holy, special place like this.

697
00:42:04.858 --> 00:42:06.898
Virus!

698
00:42:07.798 --> 00:42:08.967
Let's get out!

699
00:42:18.208 --> 00:42:20.278
- Hurry. - Let's go.

700
00:42:20.278 --> 00:42:21.278
Quickly.

701
00:42:39.798 --> 00:42:40.798
Laura.

702
00:42:44.338 --> 00:42:45.597
Laura.

703
00:42:49.708 --> 00:42:51.307
Player Jang is going up.

704
00:43:08.827 --> 00:43:10.287
Player Jang is going in.

705
00:43:29.407 --> 00:43:30.478
Player Jang is in.

706
00:43:34.017 --> 00:43:36.347
I'm hacking into Han Seong Jin's computer.

707
00:43:38.088 --> 00:43:39.487
Let's do it.

708
00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:47.898
- A rat? - Yes.

709
00:43:48.398 --> 00:43:51.367
I don't think the virus will spread to your lab.

710
00:43:51.537 --> 00:43:53.467
Still, I thought I should let you know.

711
00:43:53.467 --> 00:43:55.367
That's what they do.

712
00:43:55.367 --> 00:43:56.838
They get suspicious of anyone with no grounds,

713
00:43:56.838 --> 00:43:58.478
and disregard everything including the law...

714
00:43:58.478 --> 00:43:59.737
to go ahead with their plans.

715
00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:02.248
If you ever see anyone out of the ordinary,

716
00:44:02.248 --> 00:44:03.677
or if any strange situations occur,

717
00:44:03.677 --> 00:44:05.017
please give me a call.

718
00:44:19.427 --> 00:44:20.628
(28 percent through the copying process)

719

(Haemyung Children's Piano Competition)

("Clinical Pathology")

724
00:45:15.787 --> 00:45:17.517
Show me the hard disk drive.

725
00:45:22.157 --> 00:45:24.258
It must be from Lee Soo Oh's laptop.

726
00:45:26.458 --> 00:45:28.028
It's still not done yet?

727
00:45:28.798 --> 00:45:30.697
It's 47 percent done.

728
00:45:30.697 --> 00:45:31.838
How much longer will it take?

729
00:45:31.967 --> 00:45:33.168
About five minutes.

730
00:45:34.407 --> 00:45:36.008
We need that file, right?

731
00:45:36.537 --> 00:45:38.037
We must prove Han Seong Jin's files...

732
00:45:38.037 --> 00:45:39.307
and Lee Soo Oh's files...

733
00:45:39.307 --> 00:45:41.248
are the same to issue a warrant.

734
00:45:44.347 --> 00:45:45.677
Goodness.

735
00:45:45.677 --> 00:45:46.918
What's the matter?

736
00:45:48.088 --> 00:45:49.287
Look.

737
00:45:53.758 --> 00:45:54.927
Han Seong Jin's there.

738
00:45:54.927 --> 00:45:56.588
Everyone, get out of there.

739
00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:57.858
I haven't caught Laura yet though.

740
00:45:57.858 --> 00:45:59.157
We can't issue a warrant without these files.

741
00:45:59.157 --> 00:46:00.197
Everyone, out!

742
00:46:00.398 --> 00:46:01.467
Get out.

743
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:03.068
Gosh.

744
00:46:03.467 --> 00:46:05.737
Mad Dog won't work without me.

745
00:46:05.737 --> 00:46:06.867
I'll take care of it.

746
00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:08.068
How will you take care of it?

747
00:46:08.068 --> 00:46:10.267
Wait and see. You'll be surprised.

748
00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:11.577
Okay, we will be.

749
00:46:11.577 --> 00:46:12.637
Go ahead and try.

750
00:46:13.037 --> 00:46:14.907
- Mr. Choi. - It's okay.

751
00:46:23.487 --> 00:46:24.617
Doctor Han.

752
00:46:26.057 --> 00:46:27.987
Who's Lee Soo Oh?

753
00:46:31.498 --> 00:46:32.498
Who?

754
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.867
Do you know a person named Lee Soo Oh?

755
00:46:35.728 --> 00:46:38.298
How do you know the name?

756
00:46:39.398 --> 00:46:40.737
Was it Mad Dog?

757
00:46:41.838 --> 00:46:43.807
What was the name? Gosh, hold on.

758
00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:47.208
Oh, here. "Jang Ha Ri".

759
00:46:48.108 --> 00:46:49.148
That little...

760
00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:50.548
(Mad Dog)

761
00:46:50.947 --> 00:46:52.048
Do you know her?

762
00:46:53.077 --> 00:46:54.117
What about her?

763
00:46:54.748 --> 00:46:56.048
I met her in the lab,

764
00:46:56.048 --> 00:46:57.617
and she asked me something.

765
00:46:57.617 --> 00:46:59.287
But I don't know a thing.

766
00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:01.287
I heard someone died.

767
00:47:02.927 --> 00:47:04.597
He was your friend?

768
00:47:05.358 --> 00:47:06.498
He wasn't my friend.

769
00:47:06.498 --> 00:47:07.798
He was my junior in college.

770
00:47:07.798 --> 00:47:09.498
I see. He wasn't your friend.

771
00:47:09.798 --> 00:47:12.137
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused unintentionally.

772
00:47:12.137 --> 00:47:13.237
I'm sorry about that.

773
00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:17.778
We still need a minute.

774
00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:19.807
Hold him for two more minutes.

775
00:47:19.907 --> 00:47:21.177
Two more minutes?

776
00:47:22.407 --> 00:47:23.577
Doctor Han.

777
00:47:25.278 --> 00:47:28.918
Someone else asked me about you too.

778
00:47:29.418 --> 00:47:31.358
Who is it this time?

779
00:47:31.517 --> 00:47:33.987
Was it Park Moo Shin?

780
00:47:36.057 --> 00:47:38.398
He said he was a claims examiner...

781
00:47:38.398 --> 00:47:40.597
of Taeyang Insurance or something.

782
00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:43.568
My, my.

783
00:47:43.568 --> 00:47:46.867
Oh, I met this person before too.

784
00:47:47.367 --> 00:47:48.867
He asked me...

785
00:47:48.867 --> 00:47:50.237
what you were researching on.

786
00:47:50.737 --> 00:47:52.778
Is it Lafora?

787
00:47:55.878 --> 00:47:58.248
How do you know that?

788
00:47:58.617 --> 00:48:00.148
Ms. Jang told me...

789
00:48:00.148 --> 00:48:01.248
that Lee Soo Oh...

790
00:48:01.248 --> 00:48:03.017
was studying on Lafora.

791
00:48:03.318 --> 00:48:05.557
So I guessed it.

792
00:48:05.887 --> 00:48:07.228
Dr. Jonas Kim.

793
00:48:10.057 --> 00:48:11.197
It's complete.

794
00:48:11.197 --> 00:48:12.298
I'm going out now.

795
00:48:13.867 --> 00:48:14.927
Here.

796
00:48:16.498 --> 00:48:18.068
Laura, let's go.

797
00:48:20.037 --> 00:48:21.438
Cheetah and Laura are going out.

798
00:48:22.668 --> 00:48:23.668
Who...

799
00:48:24.237 --> 00:48:25.237
are you?

800
00:48:25.237 --> 00:48:28.278
I'm Doctor Jonas Kim.

801
00:48:34.918 --> 00:48:36.688
It's all done.

802
00:48:37.758 --> 00:48:39.318
Dr. Jonas Kim.

803
00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.287
Watch your mouth.

804
00:48:50.967 --> 00:48:53.037
Everyone's out. Good job.

805
00:48:53.168 --> 00:48:54.307
Doctor Kim.

806
00:48:55.168 --> 00:48:56.208
Good job.

807
00:48:56.208 --> 00:48:57.407
No problem.

808
00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:27.537
I found it!

809
00:49:33.708 --> 00:49:34.778
The left one is from Lee Soo Oh's file,

810
00:49:34.778 --> 00:49:36.347
and the right is from Han Seong Jin's.

811
00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.517
They're exactly the same.

812
00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:40.048
Shall I call Detective Jo?

813
00:49:40.447 --> 00:49:42.487
Isn't there anything else in his computer?

814
00:49:43.248 --> 00:49:45.717
I've found another locked file here.

815
00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:48.827
What?

816
00:49:51.557 --> 00:49:53.128
- It's a virus. - What?

817
00:49:53.128 --> 00:49:54.467
Turn the power off!

818
00:49:54.927 --> 00:49:57.128
Turn everything off.

819
00:49:57.128 --> 00:49:58.398
Turn it off.

820
00:49:59.367 --> 00:50:00.737
It won't work.

821
00:50:02.938 --> 00:50:04.008
Goodness.

822
00:50:04.008 --> 00:50:05.307
Han Seong Jin,

823
00:50:05.307 --> 00:50:08.077
that psychopath!

824
00:50:11.447 --> 00:50:14.787
What if something goes wrong with my internet?

825
00:50:15.217 --> 00:50:16.887
Your internet is fine.

826
00:50:16.887 --> 00:50:18.258
The computers are in trouble.

827
00:50:20.887 --> 00:50:22.458
Goodness.

828
00:50:24.028 --> 00:50:25.327
You want mine?

829
00:50:25.958 --> 00:50:26.998
No, thanks.

830
00:50:27.427 --> 00:50:29.267
I won't make my hands dirty.

831
00:50:30.798 --> 00:50:32.037
Min Joon.

832
00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:33.537
Did you have dinner?

833
00:50:33.537 --> 00:50:34.708
Will you feed me?

834
00:50:34.708 --> 00:50:35.737
Mr. Choi.

835
00:50:52.088 --> 00:50:53.258
Good job today.

836
00:50:53.887 --> 00:50:56.088
You too, Mr. Choi.

837
00:50:58.697 --> 00:51:00.867
Good job locking me up and running around.

838
00:51:06.398 --> 00:51:09.237
So have you found anything?

839
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.278
Why are you looking for someone who's dead?

840
00:51:11.537 --> 00:51:12.537
Something like this?

841
00:51:12.537 --> 00:51:14.148
You've caught up a lot.

842
00:51:14.978 --> 00:51:16.077
Good job.

843
00:51:16.478 --> 00:51:18.717
Why are you looking for Lee Mi Ran?

844
00:51:19.478 --> 00:51:22.287
Mr. Choi, let me give you a piece of warning.

845
00:51:23.017 --> 00:51:25.188
Change your way of thinking.

846
00:51:25.557 --> 00:51:27.017
You might have to...

847
00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.628
look for "something"...

848
00:51:28.628 --> 00:51:30.597
instead of "the reason".

849
00:51:33.628 --> 00:51:35.028
Something instead of the reason?

850
00:51:37.068 --> 00:51:38.597
Something very odd.

851
00:51:38.597 --> 00:51:40.168
Something so strange...

852
00:51:40.168 --> 00:51:42.508
that you can't understand.

853
00:51:43.037 --> 00:51:44.407
What nonsense is he talking about?

854
00:51:44.407 --> 00:51:46.478
I can't take this any longer.

855
00:51:48.807 --> 00:51:49.847
Yes!

856
00:51:52.847 --> 00:51:54.287
I unlocked the file...

857
00:51:54.287 --> 00:51:57.048
in which Seong Jin implanted so many viruses.

858
00:51:57.048 --> 00:51:58.887
- What is that? - The amount of sunshine.

859
00:51:58.887 --> 00:52:01.458
It's a year long record of the amount of sunshine.

860
00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:04.097
The amount of sunshine per day?

861
00:52:04.327 --> 00:52:05.528
Why would he?

862
00:52:05.697 --> 00:52:06.697
Hold on.

863
00:52:06.697 --> 00:52:08.427
It was a really hot day.

864
00:52:08.427 --> 00:52:10.068
We had the air conditioner on and windows closed,

865
00:52:10.068 --> 00:52:11.467
then I heard the explosion.

866
00:52:12.498 --> 00:52:14.338
How old is Han Seong Jin's daughter?

867
00:52:14.338 --> 00:52:15.467
She's four years old.

868
00:52:16.407 --> 00:52:18.278
Children's Piano Competition...

869
00:52:19.037 --> 00:52:20.208
Whose was that award?

870
00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:22.177
(Haemyung Children's Piano Competition)

871
00:52:27.617 --> 00:52:29.217
Let's see.

872
00:52:30.248 --> 00:52:32.958
(Haemyung Children's Piano Competition)

873
00:52:38.057 --> 00:52:39.597
This is how the fire was caught.

874
00:52:42.998 --> 00:52:45.498
There's the huge award.

875
00:52:56.347 --> 00:52:58.818
It's like you burn a paper with a magnifying glass.

876
00:54:01.108 --> 00:54:02.177
The magnifying glass...

877
00:54:02.878 --> 00:54:04.648
was the one thing we couldn't think of.

878
00:54:39.478 --> 00:54:42.017
See? Means are more important than the motive.

879
00:54:42.287 --> 00:54:45.318
"What" is more important than "why", right?

880
00:54:45.717 --> 00:54:46.717
So is it "what"?

881
00:54:47.088 --> 00:54:48.358
Should we be looking for that "what"?

882
00:54:48.358 --> 00:54:50.128
Do you want to bet...

883
00:54:50.128 --> 00:54:51.298
who'll find that first?

884
00:54:51.298 --> 00:54:52.298
Should we?

885
00:54:53.697 --> 00:54:55.927
(List of compensations)

886
00:54:57.998 --> 00:55:00.907
I'll delete all of Han Seong Jin's files.

887
00:55:00.907 --> 00:55:03.208
A researcher who tried to leak a research result...

888
00:55:03.208 --> 00:55:06.677
of a rare genetic disease to overseas was arrested.

889
00:55:06.907 --> 00:55:08.878
He even killed his junior to take the honor himself.

890
00:55:08.878 --> 00:55:10.077
Why didn't he throw away the plaque?

891
00:55:10.077 --> 00:55:12.048
He used the sunlight and stainless steel wall.

892
00:55:12.048 --> 00:55:13.318
He must've wanted...

893
00:55:13.818 --> 00:55:15.517
to commemorate his murder.

894
00:55:15.847 --> 00:55:16.847
What?

895
00:55:16.847 --> 00:55:18.887
(The suspect, Han)

896
00:55:25.528 --> 00:55:27.057
Why did you call me?

897
00:55:27.467 --> 00:55:29.097
Have you ever met...

898
00:55:29.898 --> 00:55:31.097
anyone named Jonas Kim?

899
00:55:31.097 --> 00:55:32.097
Who?

900
00:55:34.767 --> 00:55:36.108
Check your e-mail.

901
00:55:50.758 --> 00:55:51.758
(You have one new e-mail.)

902
00:55:51.758 --> 00:55:54.157
(There is a stranger here.)

903
00:55:56.427 --> 00:55:58.327
I think I've seen him somewhere.

904
00:56:06.798 --> 00:56:08.407
I'm glad you're awake.

905
00:56:11.978 --> 00:56:13.137
Min Joon...

906
00:56:16.508 --> 00:56:17.748
You were right.

907
00:56:19.878 --> 00:56:21.117
He didn't kill himself.

908
00:56:23.387 --> 00:56:24.487
Han Seong Jin...

909
00:56:25.287 --> 00:56:26.318
is caught.

910
00:56:50.978 --> 00:56:51.978
Eun Joo.

911
00:56:56.387 --> 00:56:58.418
I helped you out,

912
00:56:59.858 --> 00:57:01.657
so as you promised, help me out.

913
00:57:06.228 --> 00:57:07.228
I am...

914
00:57:09.597 --> 00:57:10.998
Kim Bum Joon's brother,

915
00:57:12.438 --> 00:57:13.498
Kim Min Joon.

916
00:57:17.577 --> 00:57:20.177
The planner who gave 3.4 million dollars,

917
00:57:21.248 --> 00:57:22.307
Lee Mi Ran.

918
00:57:25.117 --> 00:57:26.378
Is she really dead?

919
00:57:40.998 --> 00:57:42.568
Not "what", but "why".

920
00:57:44.537 --> 00:57:46.498
Something so strange...

921
00:57:48.338 --> 00:57:49.568
that I can't understand.

922
00:58:02.217 --> 00:58:03.287
Goodness, kid.

923
00:58:10.697 --> 00:58:13.758
Yes, we did send this by parcel service.

924
00:58:14.197 --> 00:58:16.097
Do you remember who bought this?

925
00:58:16.097 --> 00:58:17.367
Of course.

926
00:58:17.367 --> 00:58:20.068
We don't usually sell such expensive products.

927
00:58:23.608 --> 00:58:26.008
Was it her?

928
00:58:26.737 --> 00:58:28.278
Yes, you're right.

929
00:58:30.617 --> 00:58:31.918
Are you sure?

930
00:58:56.108 --> 00:58:57.737
She's alive.

931
00:59:23.097 --> 00:59:24.338
She was alive.

932
00:59:31.938 --> 00:59:34.878
Goodness, Cha Joon Kyu, that old man...

933
00:59:34.878 --> 00:59:36.708
isn't quite old yet.

934
00:59:37.748 --> 00:59:39.617
He has a really great sixth sense.

935
00:59:45.588 --> 00:59:48.427
(Taeyang Insurance Chairman Cha Joon Kyu)

936

(Taeyang Insurance Chairman Cha Joon Kyu)

937
00:59:54.498 --> 00:59:57.298
As you can see, we'll develop...

938
00:59:57.298 --> 00:59:59.037
a program just for our VIPs...

939
00:59:59.637 --> 01:00:01.108
to increase our sales...

940
01:00:01.108 --> 01:00:04.177
and to let them return for more business...

941
01:00:12.318 --> 01:00:14.487
She was alive.

942
01:00:26.228 --> 01:00:27.228
Kim Bum Joon.

943

945
01:00:35.068 --> 01:00:36.438
(Signed by Kim Min Joon)

946
01:00:39.508 --> 01:00:41.608
I'm Manager Park Moo Shin, a claims examiner.

947
01:00:43.947 --> 01:00:45.447
I do not know anything.

948
01:00:47.787 --> 01:00:48.918
I do not know...

949
01:00:51.117 --> 01:00:52.188
anything.

950
01:00:55.188 --> 01:00:56.728
Kim Bum Joon's brother,

951
01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:58.458
Jan Gebauer?

952
01:01:02.728 --> 01:01:03.767
Where is she?

953
01:01:06.398 --> 01:01:07.938
Where is she right now?

954
01:01:32.057 --> 01:01:33.057
Han Mi Sook.

955
01:01:52.117 --> 01:01:53.177
Choi Ju Won.

956
01:01:56.287 --> 01:01:58.157
Are you happy that you're alive,

957
01:01:59.918 --> 01:02:01.258
Ms. Lee Mi Ran?

958
01:02:54.278 --> 01:02:57.177
(Mad Dog)

959
01:02:57.577 --> 01:03:00.278
Kim Bum Joon's brother is onto this?

960
01:03:00.517 --> 01:03:02.017
Are you all insane?

961
01:03:02.588 --> 01:03:03.588
Lee Mi Ran.

962
01:03:03.887 --> 01:03:05.987
Do you want to bet who finds her first?

963
01:03:05.987 --> 01:03:07.088
When one is thrown off,

964
01:03:07.088 --> 01:03:08.287
they tend to make a mistake.

965
01:03:08.487 --> 01:03:09.588
Did you say this was...

966
01:03:09.588 --> 01:03:11.728
where the last signal Min Joon's phone gave off?

967
01:03:12.228 --> 01:03:13.798
He had nowhere to escape.

968
01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:16.097
He had a place to return to.

969
01:03:16.128 --> 01:03:18.467
Why did you want to live that badly?

970
01:03:18.668 --> 01:03:20.068
Why didn't you kill yourself?

971
01:03:20.938 --> 01:03:22.237
He wasn't watching.

972
01:03:22.237 --> 01:03:24.677
He was being watched.

973
01:03:24.677 --> 01:03:26.508
Isn't Doctor Kim in danger right now?

974
01:03:26.508 --> 01:03:27.677
It's Ko Jin Chul.

975
