(Episode 36)

2
00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:25.438
What happened?

3
00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:29.508
Is Doctor Song going somewhere?

4
00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:31.177
She was fired.

5
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.048
Is it our fault?

6
00:00:34.048 --> 00:00:35.117
Mom.

7
00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:37.647
Don't you worry.

(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

9
00:00:48.357 --> 00:00:49.397
Mr. Chu.

10
00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:53.537
What's wrong? Who's sick?

11
00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:56.198
My wife. I don't know what's wrong.

12
00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:57.967
- Come with me. - Okay.

13
00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:07.917
Keep this for me.

14
00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:09.417
- Doctor. - Honey.

15
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.718
Can you step back so I can check her?

16
00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:14.488
- How is she? - Hey.

17
00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:16.688
She's very jaundiced.

18
00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:22.128
Did she have...

19
00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:23.768
a chronic liver disease?

20
00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:25.998
No, she didn't.

21
00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:29.468
Ma'am. Ma'am.

22
00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:30.908
What's your name?

23
00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:34.938
Ma'am, where are you?

24
00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:37.477
Seoul.

25
00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:39.677
You're in Seoul?

26
00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:41.578
Yes.

27
00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:45.018
What year is it?

28
00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:47.688
1988.

29
00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:50.527
It's 1988?

30
00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.227
Of course.

31
00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:56.598
Why is she talking nonsense? Honey.

32
00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:57.768
Ma'am.

33
00:01:57.897 --> 00:01:59.968
Can you stretch your arms out?

34
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:01.968
Keep them level.

35
00:02:02.298 --> 00:02:03.507
Hands back.

36
00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:05.037
Hold them like this.

37
00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:17.147
- Flapping tremors. - Yes.

38
00:02:17.247 --> 00:02:19.647
A typical symptom of hepatic encephalopathy.

(Symptom of liver failure)

40
00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:24.328
If she had no chronic disease, it's probably hepatic insufficiency.

41
00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.397
Since she vomited blood,

42
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:30.097
get a gastroenterologist to treat that and then...

43
00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:31.228
Doctor Song.

44
00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:35.738
What are you doing here?

45
00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.837
Doctor Song, out. Doctor Myung, you're in.

46
00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:40.508
Sir.

47
00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:41.508
Doctor Kang.

48
00:02:41.677 --> 00:02:43.708
Yes, sir.

49
00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:46.147
Don't you know Doctor Song no longer works here?

50
00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.388
I know that.

51
00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:53.187
Why are you letting her see a patient?

52
00:02:53.818 --> 00:02:56.458
You're in charge. Is this how you run the ER?

53
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.728
I apologize.

54
00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:01.427
Doctor Song.

55
00:03:17.377 --> 00:03:18.747
Call a gastroenterologist...

56
00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:21.147
to stop the bleeding first,

57
00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:23.518
then run blood and liver tests.

58
00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:25.187
Yes, doctor.

(Geoje Jeil Hospital Extension Plan)

60
00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:03.288
What...

61
00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:04.958
will you do now?

62
00:04:07.698 --> 00:04:08.997
Don't worry about me.

63
00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:12.127
Your wife is so sick.

64
00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.638
What do you think will happen?

65
00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:22.008
We'll have to see the test results, but I think...

66
00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:24.847
Tell me.

67
00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:27.118
What do you think will happen?

68
00:04:27.948 --> 00:04:30.518
Let's wait until we have the test results.

69
00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:32.688
Let's talk about it then.

70
00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:39.758
I have to take this.

71
00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:41.258
Okay.

72
00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:49.938
Doctor Song, it's me.

73
00:04:50.438 --> 00:04:51.508
How are things?

74
00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:55.078
We're waiting for the test results.

75
00:04:56.647 --> 00:04:57.647
I think...

76
00:04:58.607 --> 00:05:01.178
it's acute hepatic insufficiency.

77
00:05:02.647 --> 00:05:03.688
Oh dear.

78
00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:06.657
Won't you come over?

79
00:05:08.157 --> 00:05:10.527
The captain and I...

80
00:05:10.888 --> 00:05:12.657
have something to sort out here.

81
00:05:13.657 --> 00:05:14.727
Okay.

82
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:15.958
Take care.

83
00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:31.078
What did she say?

84
00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:33.647
Is his wife very sick?

85
00:05:36.948 --> 00:05:38.487
Shouldn't we be there?

86
00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:43.487
Let's grab the governor by the collar if we must.

87
00:05:43.987 --> 00:05:47.027
That will help Mr. Chu more than any moral support.

88
00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:50.727
You have a big set of them.

89
00:05:50.897 --> 00:05:52.527
Of what? Guts?

90
00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:53.868
Yes.

91
00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:59.368
It'll look so shabby with just the two of us.

92
00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:03.607
Should we call all the doctors and nurses...

93
00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:07.318
and get them to join in?

94
00:06:08.477 --> 00:06:09.618
They're all busy.

95
00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:11.118
Are they?

96
00:06:11.987 --> 00:06:13.157
Doing what?

97
00:06:20.498 --> 00:06:21.797
Doctors.

98
00:06:23.428 --> 00:06:24.428
Why are you here?

99
00:06:24.928 --> 00:06:26.498
Must you even ask?

100
00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:27.897
I'm disappointed.

101
00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:30.337
You can't treat patients without me.

102
00:06:31.837 --> 00:06:33.138
- You called them? - Yes.

103
00:06:33.678 --> 00:06:35.138
I thought they'd want to come.

104
00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:37.607
Great.

105
00:06:38.078 --> 00:06:39.078
Let's go.

106
00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:40.217
Come along.

107
00:06:47.318 --> 00:06:49.758
She has what?

108
00:06:50.428 --> 00:06:51.958
Acute hepatic insufficiency.

109
00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.227
(Non-chronic liver failure)

110
00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:55.097
Acute hepatic insufficiency?

111
00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:56.698
What...

112
00:06:57.027 --> 00:06:59.368
will happen to her now?

113
00:06:59.597 --> 00:07:02.467
We managed to stabilize her for now,

114
00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:04.667
but she might crash.

115
00:07:05.407 --> 00:07:07.907
We can't guarantee anything at the moment.

116
00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:09.847
You can't guarantee anything?

117
00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:14.378
What does that mean?

118
00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:17.917
Will she die or something?

119
00:07:19.717 --> 00:07:21.558
Say something, Doctor Song.

120
00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:25.958
She doesn't have much time.

121
00:07:26.328 --> 00:07:27.328
What?

122
00:07:27.758 --> 00:07:28.828
What?

123
00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:31.068
If we don't do something now,

124
00:07:33.027 --> 00:07:35.868
she might not last the next few days.

125
00:07:37.268 --> 00:07:40.938
She was perfectly fine. There was nothing wrong with her.

126
00:07:40.938 --> 00:07:44.178
She seemed fine when I saw her at Chuseok.

127
00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:46.107
Doctors fail to pinpoint the cause...

128
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:50.287
in over 30 percent of acute hepatic insufficiency cases.

129
00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:56.188
I'm really sorry, Mr. Chu.

130
00:07:56.857 --> 00:07:57.928
What...

131
00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:01.698
must we do now? What must we do...

132
00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:04.628
to bring her back?

133
00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:05.768
A transplant.

134
00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:08.138
A transplant?

135
00:08:08.297 --> 00:08:09.297
Yes.

136
00:08:09.768 --> 00:08:13.308
A liver transplant is the best cure.

137
00:08:16.178 --> 00:08:18.547
You should've said so sooner.

138
00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:22.047
Doctor Song, can she live if she gets a transplant?

139
00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:24.047
- Yes. - Gosh.

140
00:08:24.618 --> 00:08:27.118
I'll give her a piece of mine.

141
00:08:27.118 --> 00:08:28.917
Do you have the same blood type?

142
00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.587
No, I'm type B, she's type A.

143
00:08:32.658 --> 00:08:34.357
- Then it won't work. - Why not?

144
00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:37.997
These days, you can donate organs with different blood types.

145
00:08:38.428 --> 00:08:39.997
You told me so...

146
00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:43.367
That only applies when the recipient is stable.

147
00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:46.068
Your wife is in critical condition.

148
00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:48.477
The donor has to have a matching blood type.

149
00:08:51.377 --> 00:08:53.648
Call the liver transplant center.

150
00:08:54.578 --> 00:08:55.578
Okay.

151
00:08:57.387 --> 00:08:58.987
If we find a donor,

152
00:08:59.418 --> 00:09:02.617
she'll be on the top of the list, so...

153
00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:05.828
Doctor Myung.

154

Suction.

155
00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:17.708
Inject 10mg of valium.

156
00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:19.168
(Valium treats muscle spasms.)

157
00:09:22.507 --> 00:09:24.648
It's a spasm caused by hepatic encephalopathy.

Let's talk.

161
00:10:17.668 --> 00:10:18.928
How about...

162
00:10:19.737 --> 00:10:22.367
transferring her to another hospital?

163
00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:25.908
How can you transfer her in that condition?

164
00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:28.308
That's exactly why she should be transferred.

165
00:10:28.308 --> 00:10:31.007
- Why? - There's no one to operate on her.

166
00:10:32.477 --> 00:10:35.778
You might be able to do it, but I can't.

167
00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:38.818
I can't transplant a liver with a team I've never worked with.

168
00:10:40.188 --> 00:10:42.087
It's not just that. I've...

169

You've what?

170
00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:45.757
I've never done it before.

a liver on my own as the surgeon in charge.

174
00:11:02.477 --> 00:11:04.377
Where did he go?

175
00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:10.517
Were you at the government office?

176
00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:13.958
Yes, though we got nothing out of it.

177
00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:17.757
How is Mr. Chu holding up?

178
00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:21.698
- Well... - Well what?

179
00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:25.097
Is there a problem?

180
00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:28.538
He said he'd donate his liver, but I said...

181
00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:31.038
he couldn't because his blood type doesn't match.

182
00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:34.737
That's when his wife suddenly worsened and...

183
00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:40.847
Where is he right now?

184
00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:43.987
- I don't know. - You don't know?

185
00:11:47.318 --> 00:11:50.658
Okay. I'll go and look for him.

186
00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:52.688
Thank you.

187

(Public Health Clinic)

188
00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:08.507
Hello.

189
00:12:08.507 --> 00:12:11.178
- You're finally here. - Doctor.

190
00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:12.808
Did you have a hard time?

191
00:12:12.808 --> 00:12:14.548
Don't even ask.

192
00:12:14.548 --> 00:12:17.747
I still can't believe what hit me.

193
00:12:17.747 --> 00:12:20.418
You can rest now. We'll take care of it from here.

194
00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:21.918
I can't rest.

195
00:12:21.918 --> 00:12:23.887
I'll call the patients who left to come back.

196
00:12:23.887 --> 00:12:25.428
No, we'll go to them.

197
00:12:25.688 --> 00:12:28.997
It'll be worse if the elderly fall while walking in the dark.

198
00:12:29.627 --> 00:12:33.398
You're so thoughtful, doctor.

199
00:12:34.237 --> 00:12:37.137
You treat the people here. We'll go to all the homes...

200
00:12:37.137 --> 00:12:38.668
and treat the people we can.

201
00:12:38.668 --> 00:12:41.637
- We'll bring the rest back here. - Okay.

202
00:12:41.837 --> 00:12:44.308
- Let's go. - Let's go.

203
00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:46.948
Hello.

204
00:12:46.948 --> 00:12:48.678
How are you feeling?

205
00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:50.017
Just so-so.

206
00:12:50.448 --> 00:12:52.087
Is this the remote medical service?

207
00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:54.418
Yes, but...

208
00:12:54.418 --> 00:12:56.318
will they respond at this time?

209
00:12:56.528 --> 00:12:57.928
I'll give it a go first.

210
00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:01.757
Let me have a look at this.

211
00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:25.148
You used it just fine last time. Did you forget what to do?

212
00:13:25.418 --> 00:13:27.217
I couldn't use it at all.

213
00:13:27.217 --> 00:13:29.617
I just pressed what they told me to.

214
00:13:31.428 --> 00:13:33.627
Can't you keep the laptop...

215
00:13:33.627 --> 00:13:35.298
and come see me every day?

216
00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:38.328
I could stick needles in you every day,

217
00:13:38.627 --> 00:13:40.237
but what about your medicine?

218
00:13:41.198 --> 00:13:43.137
You need Doctor Kwak for that.

219
00:13:43.137 --> 00:13:45.668
Why is it so complicated?

220
00:13:47.538 --> 00:13:50.247
What's taking so long? Hurry up.

221
00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:52.507
No one's responding.

222
00:13:57.247 --> 00:13:58.587
What's up?

223
00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:02.017
None of the doctors are responding to the call.

224
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.688
Can you get me the number of...

225
00:14:05.688 --> 00:14:07.597
the Chief Internalist at Jeil Hospital?

226
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.497
Okay. Let me find out.

227
00:14:12.398 --> 00:14:14.637
- He's waiting online too? - Yes.

228
00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:17.237
Let me go make a call.

229
00:14:26.107 --> 00:14:28.078
(Dad)

230
00:14:30.487 --> 00:14:31.887
The remote medical service.

231
00:14:32.418 --> 00:14:34.688
Don't you know how dangerous that is?

232
00:14:34.688 --> 00:14:35.818
I need to save the ER.

233
00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:37.788
It could kill the hospital ship.

234
00:14:37.788 --> 00:14:40.828
Patients will die on the street if we close our ER.

235
00:14:43.997 --> 00:14:45.168
If you...

236
00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:48.568
had to choose between our ER...

237
00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:51.538
and the hospital ship, which would it be?

238
00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:53.408
This isn't a matter of choice.

239
00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:55.337
It is a matter of choice.

240
00:14:55.337 --> 00:14:58.708
Nothing in this world can satisfy both sides.

(Geoje Jeil Hospital Doctor Kang)

242
00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:19.938
Hi, Jae Geol.

243
00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:24.168
The Chief Internalist's number? Why?

244
00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:26.367
The old ladies couldn't see a doctor...

245
00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:28.438
because they can't use the laptop.

246
00:15:28.538 --> 00:15:30.908
We're here on the island,

247
00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:35.148
but none of the doctors are responding to the system.

248
00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:37.918
Do that during the day tomorrow.

249
00:15:38.017 --> 00:15:40.058
Don't you think we have to work too?

250
00:15:41.117 --> 00:15:43.928
Do you think public health doctors...

251
00:15:47.658 --> 00:15:51.127
You know what happens to us if we don't stay at our post.

252
00:15:51.127 --> 00:15:53.668
He clocked off and went home to rest.

253
00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:56.237
I can't tell him to come back to work.

254
00:15:56.237 --> 00:15:58.038
Does he have to be at the hospital?

255
00:15:58.538 --> 00:16:01.678
He needs to use the software on his office PC.

256
00:16:02.877 --> 00:16:04.408
Okay, okay.

257
00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:06.948
Let me give him a call first.

258
00:16:06.948 --> 00:16:09.548
Okay, please do that.

259
00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:12.887
Hey, Jae Geol.

260
00:16:13.558 --> 00:16:16.058
Do you have any idea...

261
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:19.127
what went on here today?

262
00:16:19.627 --> 00:16:21.928
What went on?

263
00:16:26.227 --> 00:16:27.367
What?

264
00:16:31.668 --> 00:16:32.837
Really?

265
00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:36.038
Take another deep breath.

266
00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:42.278
- Her back. - Turn around.

267
00:16:49.517 --> 00:16:51.558
I don't like the sound.

268
00:16:55.428 --> 00:16:56.528
Jae Geol.

269
00:16:56.528 --> 00:16:59.227
- Try again. Someone's online. - Really?

270
00:17:00.298 --> 00:17:01.938
That's great.

271
00:17:02.597 --> 00:17:04.338
Okay, thanks.

272
00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:15.378
- Hello. - Hi.

273
00:17:17.047 --> 00:17:18.047
What's wrong?

274
00:17:18.047 --> 00:17:20.688
The elderly are having trouble using the system.

275
00:17:20.688 --> 00:17:23.358
I'm here to help. Do you mind?

276
00:17:23.358 --> 00:17:24.588
Who are you?

277
00:17:24.588 --> 00:17:27.297
I'm Doctor Kwak from the hospital ship.

278
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:29.898
You're a doctor? Not a helper?

279
00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:32.067
Consider me a helper if you want.

280
00:17:32.168 --> 00:17:35.567
Okay, then. Let's see the patient.

281
00:17:37.767 --> 00:17:39.408
What's the problem?

282
00:17:39.878 --> 00:17:42.408
Ma'am, look straight at him.

283
00:17:43.908 --> 00:17:47.317
I have a headache and I'm always sweating.

284
00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.618
My whole body aches as well.

285
00:17:51.148 --> 00:17:52.547
What's her temperature?

286
00:17:52.547 --> 00:17:54.557
37.5°C.

287
00:17:54.557 --> 00:17:57.958
Her blood pressure, pulse, and breathing are normal,

288
00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.827
but she has a lot of phlegm.

289
00:17:59.827 --> 00:18:03.297
I hear a crackling in the lower part of her right lung.

290
00:18:03.527 --> 00:18:06.327
It could be pneumonia, then.

291
00:18:06.938 --> 00:18:09.497
She needs a blood test and an x-ray.

292
00:18:10.438 --> 00:18:12.208
Can you do that there?

293
00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:14.138
We can on the hospital ship,

294
00:18:14.138 --> 00:18:16.577
but we aren't allowed to sail right now.

295
00:18:16.577 --> 00:18:17.878
Oh dear.

296
00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:22.977
Then you have to bring the patient to our hospital.

297
00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.118
Doctor.

298
00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.188
There aren't any boats right now.

299
00:18:27.188 --> 00:18:28.987
Should we ask the Coast Guard?

300
00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:31.388
This is insane.

301
00:18:32.358 --> 00:18:33.827
In that case,

302
00:18:33.928 --> 00:18:37.067
let me make a few calls and get back to you.

303
00:18:43.767 --> 00:18:45.208
Will you be okay?

304
00:18:48.307 --> 00:18:49.848
Doctor Kim.

305
00:18:49.848 --> 00:18:52.247
How did it go? Are you done seeing the patients?

306
00:18:52.747 --> 00:18:54.618
I just saw one.

307
00:18:55.017 --> 00:18:56.418
There's a whole line left.

308
00:18:56.418 --> 00:18:58.348
- Pardon me? - Why did they...

309
00:18:58.517 --> 00:19:00.287
get rid of the hospital ship?

310
00:19:00.688 --> 00:19:03.128
Shall we call the Coast Guard for a CT scan?

311
00:19:03.787 --> 00:19:06.158
Shall we send a helicopter from the hospital?

312
00:19:06.398 --> 00:19:07.797
- Pardon me? - Remote Medical Service.

313
00:19:07.797 --> 00:19:10.398
Is this really necessary?

314
00:19:10.398 --> 00:19:12.398
There are two Internal Medicine doctors from the hospital ship...

315
00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:14.037
and from the general hospital.

316
00:19:14.368 --> 00:19:16.507
They sit in front of the computer with the patient.

317
00:19:17.007 --> 00:19:19.438
- What on earth is this? - It's...

318
00:19:19.838 --> 00:19:22.737
They can simply diagnose and treat the patient.

319
00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:25.848
This is very inefficient.

320
00:19:25.848 --> 00:19:28.217
Working remotely will drive everyone crazy.

321
00:19:28.217 --> 00:19:30.787
- I see. - My goodness.

322
00:19:33.658 --> 00:19:36.017
Why is he taking it out on me?

323
00:19:36.317 --> 00:19:38.557
I didn't get rid of the hospital ship.

324
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.928
Goodness.

325
00:19:43.168 --> 00:19:44.567
Please take care.

326
00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:53.537
- Hello, is it finished? - Almost.

327
00:19:54.307 --> 00:19:56.777
- How's her fever? - It's gotten worse.

328
00:19:59.148 --> 00:20:01.178
Let's go. We have a fishing boat ready.

329
00:20:01.378 --> 00:20:02.577
Will she be okay?

330
00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:05.747
The cold air could make her worse.

331
00:20:06.148 --> 00:20:07.958
We'll ask to keep the boat warm inside.

332
00:20:08.517 --> 00:20:10.458
Let's go to Geoje Island as soon as possible.

333
00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.698
You don't look so good. Is something wrong?

334
00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:18.128
I think Mr. Chu is in big trouble now.

335
00:20:28.638 --> 00:20:31.007
(Yang Choon Ho)

336
00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:47.098
(Yang Choon Ho)

337
00:20:51.698 --> 00:20:53.967
Why aren't you picking up? He's your follower.

338
00:20:56.537 --> 00:20:58.567
Why aren't you going in?

339
00:20:59.368 --> 00:21:01.938
Aren't you here to see your children?

340
00:21:02.608 --> 00:21:04.277
I'm too embarrassed.

341
00:21:12.848 --> 00:21:14.188
Do you know this?

342
00:21:17.628 --> 00:21:20.428
When my wife gave birth to our children,

343
00:21:22.227 --> 00:21:24.168
I was never there.

344
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.338
Like a widower,

345
00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.267
she saw an OB-GYN all alone.

346
00:21:33.277 --> 00:21:34.708
She went through it...

347
00:21:36.848 --> 00:21:38.077
and gave birth to our children.

348
00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:40.678
Were you on the hospital ship?

349
00:21:47.987 --> 00:21:51.428
I couldn't be there on their first day of school or graduation.

350
00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:55.628
I completely forgot about...

351
00:21:56.198 --> 00:21:59.368
the school violence committee.

352
00:22:01.797 --> 00:22:05.037
After neglecting them for all these years,

353
00:22:07.007 --> 00:22:08.638
I tell them, "Your mother is dying."

354
00:22:09.878 --> 00:22:11.408
"Pack and come out."

355
00:22:14.178 --> 00:22:15.277
Still,

356
00:22:16.178 --> 00:22:17.888
I should say goodbye for the last time.

357
00:22:19.118 --> 00:22:20.557
It's not the last.

358
00:22:27.398 --> 00:22:29.358
Dong Min's mom won't die.

359
00:22:29.928 --> 00:22:31.168
I'll save her.

360
00:22:32.198 --> 00:22:35.698
Go in and bring out your children.

361
00:22:36.807 --> 00:22:38.567
It's not the last time.

362
00:22:39.237 --> 00:22:41.807
Tell them that we should cheer her up...

363
00:22:42.438 --> 00:22:44.007
before her operation.

364
00:22:46.577 --> 00:22:47.717
Nurse Pyo.

365
00:22:48.517 --> 00:22:51.547
I have the same blood type as your wife.

366
00:22:52.588 --> 00:22:54.358
I'm quite brave.

367
00:22:55.017 --> 00:22:56.527
My liver is big enough...

368
00:22:56.727 --> 00:22:59.858
to give a transplant.

369
00:23:04.168 --> 00:23:05.398
I'll save...

370
00:23:06.497 --> 00:23:07.967
your wife.

371
00:23:09.098 --> 00:23:10.507
Mr. Chu.

372
00:23:11.267 --> 00:23:15.178
Work harder to save the hospital ship.

373
00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:21.517
30 years on the hospital ship.

374
00:23:22.678 --> 00:23:26.658
"My life on the ship was worthless and meaningless."

375
00:23:27.918 --> 00:23:29.188
Don't regret it.

376
00:23:30.057 --> 00:23:31.188
If you do,

377
00:23:32.358 --> 00:23:33.827
I'll scold you.

378
00:23:39.527 --> 00:23:41.198
Why is it worthless?

379
00:23:42.067 --> 00:23:44.037
You hung in there.

380
00:23:44.938 --> 00:23:47.338
Do you know how many lives that you saved?

381
00:24:28.477 --> 00:24:29.547
Yes?

382
00:24:37.358 --> 00:24:38.727
What are you doing?

383
00:24:39.458 --> 00:24:40.898
Why are you dressed that way?

384
00:24:41.198 --> 00:24:43.398
Is it wrong for a surgeon...

385
00:24:44.497 --> 00:24:46.567
- to wear scrubs? - What?

386
00:24:47.098 --> 00:24:48.698
Open up the OR.

387
00:24:50.767 --> 00:24:52.037
I want to save...

388
00:24:53.908 --> 00:24:55.507
Patient Kim Sung Hee.

389
00:24:57.848 --> 00:24:59.247
That's impossible.

390
00:25:02.178 --> 00:25:03.547
At Jeil Hospital,

391
00:25:05.017 --> 00:25:07.688
we don't have any OR for dangerous doctors.

392
00:25:10.928 --> 00:25:12.588
Don't you agree, Director Kim?

393
00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:18.527
If you don't open the OR,

394
00:25:18.797 --> 00:25:20.838
the patient may die tonight.

395
00:25:22.198 --> 00:25:25.138
Transfer the patient to another hospital.

396
00:25:25.338 --> 00:25:28.608
I want to save the patient, sir.

397
00:25:30.577 --> 00:25:34.118
Remember the support that Doosung Group promised you.
