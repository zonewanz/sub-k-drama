00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:11.104
(Episode 35)

2
00:00:11.104 --> 00:00:13.073
- I need water. - It's over there.

3
00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:14.073
All right.

4
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:15.877
Aren't we going to depart?

5
00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:18.176
Doctor Kwak isn't here yet.

6
00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:20.376
He's not coming.

7
00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:23.647
What do you mean?

8
00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:25.586
He will catch a ferry later in the afternoon.

9
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:26.987
Why?

10
00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:28.856
He's at the police station.

11
00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:31.487
For what?

12
00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:35.926
It's Ms. Hwang In Kyung's baby,

13
00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:38.866
Han Sol. From the moment she was born...

14
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.167
to the moment she was transferred...

15
00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.767
to Jeil Hospital's NICU,

16
00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:45.837
I'm the one who handled...

17
00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:48.576
all of her treatments.

18
00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:53.316
So if there was a problem in the process,

19
00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:57.246
I'm the one who should take the responsibility.

20
00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:58.917
We will also press charges against Kwak Hyun,

21
00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:00.587
the internal medicine doctor.

22
00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.087
A surgeon who wields the scalpel...

23
00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:07.996
even without the guardian's consent,

24
00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:13.236
and an internal medicine doctor who can't handle the after-treatment.

25
00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:16.837
The hospital ship is a mess indeed.

26
00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:21.876
Song Eun Jae is...

27
00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:23.846
a reckless surgeon who wields the scalpel...

28
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:25.977
even without the guardian's consent.

29
00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:27.617
And Kwak Hyun is...

30
00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.317
an incompetent doctor who put the patient's life in danger...

31
00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:32.546
because of his poor after-treatment.

32
00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:35.716
Because of them, the safety of their patients is...

33
00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:38.557
seriously threatened.

34
00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:41.927
Above all, people can have free surgeries...

35
00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:43.966
as long as they live on the island...

36
00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.266
regardless of their financial status.

37
00:01:47.596 --> 00:01:50.736
Free medical treatment. It has many problems.

38
00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:53.167
There are quite many wealthy people...

39
00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:54.677
living on the island.

40
00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:58.346
Those who have money should pay for their treatments.

41
00:01:58.346 --> 00:01:59.346
Don't you agree?

42
00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:02.947
If we keep providing free treatment, our city will run out of budget.

43
00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:05.317
How do you plan to solve the problems...

44
00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:06.887
of the hospital ship, governor?

45
00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:11.356
First of all, we will suspend the operation of the hospital ship.

46
00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:13.296
We will investigate the safety...

47
00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:15.727
of the treatment they offer and the lax management of the facility.

48
00:02:16.097 --> 00:02:18.227
After that, we'll suggest the shutdown of the hospital ship...

49
00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:20.097
to the city council.

50
00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:21.437
Shutdown?

51
00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:24.766
It's finally happening.

52
00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:29.236
What is this?

53
00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:31.847
Are they going to close the hospital ship?

54
00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.176
(Hospital ship is wasting the city budget.)

55
00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:36.016
Does this mean...

56
00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:39.387
we won't be able to set sail again?

57
00:02:45.187 --> 00:02:47.056
If Doctor Kwak gets involved in this too,

58
00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.627
didn't you know it would gain traction...

59
00:02:49.657 --> 00:02:51.667
even before we come up with a plan?

60
00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:53.637
No, I knew.

61
00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:54.866
Why didn't you stop him?

62
00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:57.206
I did.

63
00:02:57.206 --> 00:02:59.567
You did and he still went?

64
00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:02.776
How frustrating.

65
00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:06.247
Why is he so naive?

66
00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:08.247
He's not naive.

67
00:03:09.477 --> 00:03:11.347
He wanted to do things by the rules.

68
00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:13.657
Didn't he?

69
00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:29.437
You'll tell the truth?

70
00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:31.037
Yes.

71
00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:32.437
Why?

72
00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:34.076
That's the rule.

73
00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:38.576
Don't you know the situation we're in?

74
00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:41.276
If you become a target too, the officials...

75
00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:44.317
will try to decommission our ship.

76
00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:47.887
- I know. - And you'll still do it?

77
00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:52.287
Are you saying you don't mind if we lose the ship?

78
00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:53.326
Would I?

79
00:03:53.326 --> 00:03:55.526
Then why are you being so stubborn?

80
00:03:56.097 --> 00:03:57.097
I'm a doctor.

81
00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:01.697
However bad or desperate the situation gets,

82
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.467
the doctor has a duty to tell the guardian the truth.

83
00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:08.806
I can't turn against that.

84
00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:13.676
The second we lose the trust of any patient...

85
00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:15.916
is the second...

86
00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:18.516
we stop being doctors.

87
00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:27.326
I want to protect the ship.

88
00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.427
I will fight as best I can, but...

89
00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:33.536
I won't do it their way.

90
00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:37.007
If we have a righteous purpose,

91
00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:39.367
we must fight for it...

92
00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:42.237
in a righteous way.

93
00:05:04.427 --> 00:05:07.336
Doctor Kwak was right, but it's still frustrating.

94
00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:12.007
I bet you're also worried about the tough fight...

95
00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:14.076
we have ahead.

96
00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:18.447
It's hilarious.

97
00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:22.377
What is?

98
00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:25.846
What you and Doctor Kwak are doing.

99
00:05:27.016 --> 00:05:28.317
I think you two...

100
00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:31.226
completely swapped places.

101
00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:36.766
You were the headstrong one who stuck to the rules...

102
00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:39.396
while Doctor Kwak was the tactful one...

103
00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:41.096
who tried to find ways...

104
00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:43.266
around the problem.

105
00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:46.266
What a unique way to scold someone.

106
00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:48.607
I'm scolding you?

107
00:05:53.007 --> 00:05:55.346
"Why isn't a doctor sticking to the rules?"

108
00:05:57.016 --> 00:05:58.687
That's what you're saying.

109
00:05:59.187 --> 00:06:00.216
No.

110
00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:04.427
I'm saying I understand how much you grew to like...

111
00:06:04.627 --> 00:06:06.427
the hospital ship.

112
00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:12.197
You're doing this to protect her.

113
00:06:14.137 --> 00:06:16.807
How much must you love the ship to be willing to...

114
00:06:17.437 --> 00:06:19.607
go against the rules to try to save it...

115
00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:22.637
by taking the blame for everything?

116
00:06:24.076 --> 00:06:25.547
I feel sorry for you,

117
00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:27.846
but I'm also ashamed.

118
00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:30.687
Mr. Chu.

119
00:06:30.687 --> 00:06:32.016
We all had...

120
00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:34.757
the same idea you did.

121
00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:39.726
We avoid feces because it's dirty, not because we're scared of it.

122
00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:41.197
That's why...

123
00:06:42.096 --> 00:06:44.666
we all decided to let you take the fall,

124
00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:46.666
hoping the crisis would pass.

125
00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:50.607
But we were wrong.

126
00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:55.137
We should clean up what's dirty, not leave it.

127
00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:57.146
Mr. Chu.

128
00:06:57.307 --> 00:06:58.406
I apologize,

129
00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:00.447
Doctor Song.

130
00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:03.987
I should stick to the rules so...

131
00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:07.086
you can treat patients in peace.

132
00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.687
I'm such a useless administrator.

133
00:07:11.357 --> 00:07:12.427
You aren't.

134
00:07:13.456 --> 00:07:14.497
Don't say that.

135
00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:17.067
It's not too late now.

136
00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:19.937
Let's go by the rules.

137
00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.036
It won't be easy.

138
00:07:26.576 --> 00:07:27.976
It will be difficult.

139
00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:30.906
The biggest problem...

140
00:07:31.507 --> 00:07:32.677
will be our absence.

141
00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.776
While our ship is forced to stay docked,

142
00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:40.117
what will happen to the patients on the island?

143
00:07:56.237 --> 00:07:59.307
Don't you worry about the ship's absence.

144
00:07:59.737 --> 00:08:02.007
The ship's young, inexperienced doctors...

145
00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:05.146
are nothing compared to the staff...

146
00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:09.076
at Geoje Jeil Hospital and Seoul Daehan Hospital.

147
00:08:10.247 --> 00:08:11.487
Aren't I right?

148
00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:13.047
You are.

149
00:08:13.786 --> 00:08:14.786
Of course.

150
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.317
Out of all the doctors...

151
00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:18.857
at both our hospitals,

152
00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:21.357
we'll select a few who have a great reputation...

153
00:08:21.956 --> 00:08:25.297
to care for the islands' residents via the remote service system.

154
00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:28.036
If and when there is an emergency,

155
00:08:28.596 --> 00:08:31.007
my company's helicopter is at your disposal.

156
00:08:31.607 --> 00:08:34.806
Any patient will be transported swiftly to get treatment.

157
00:08:35.676 --> 00:08:37.406
I feel so reassured.

158
00:08:39.747 --> 00:08:40.747
Right.

159
00:09:01.597 --> 00:09:02.597
Are you done?

160
00:09:04.036 --> 00:09:05.207
Why are you here?

161
00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:08.406
- Were you worried for me? - No.

162
00:09:09.237 --> 00:09:10.906
I want to go somewhere with you.

163
00:09:11.207 --> 00:09:13.377
With me? Where?

164
00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:14.847
You'll find out.

165
00:09:17.646 --> 00:09:19.487
Okay, let's go.

166
00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:33.597
This is where you wanted to bring me?

167
00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:37.707
I'm in charge of the groceries, and I have a lot to buy.

168
00:09:38.066 --> 00:09:39.607
You know I don't have a car.

169
00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:51.646
- Hello. - You're back.

170
00:09:52.247 --> 00:09:54.887
What happened? Your wife's in a good mood today.

171
00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:57.926
She isn't my wife, ma'am.

172
00:09:58.487 --> 00:09:59.587
What are you then?

173
00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:00.896
What's fresh today?

174
00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:02.056
What did you say?

175
00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:03.696
Don't you have a list?

176
00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:06.127
Life doesn't always go as planned.

177
00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:10.007
What would you recommend?

178
00:10:10.007 --> 00:10:13.107
Oysters, of course. They just came into season.

179
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:15.436
They taste good and are good for you.

180
00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:17.306
I'm cooking for 10 people.

181
00:10:17.306 --> 00:10:18.707
I'll give you enough.

182
00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:20.377
We have a budget.

183
00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:22.516
A discount as well, then.

184
00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:23.617
Thank you.

185
00:10:24.686 --> 00:10:26.686
Kim, give them a little extra.

186
00:10:26.857 --> 00:10:28.487
- Try something tasty. - Okay.

187
00:10:29.987 --> 00:10:32.286
What do you want to taste?

188
00:10:33.186 --> 00:10:34.227
This.

189
00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:38.666
Just a moment.

190
00:10:40.737 --> 00:10:42.266
My goodness.

191
00:10:44.837 --> 00:10:46.066
You'll never get it.

192
00:10:47.977 --> 00:10:49.276
- I'll eat it. - Okay.

193
00:10:49.707 --> 00:10:51.007
A piece for you.

194
00:10:51.847 --> 00:10:52.847
Isn't it good?

195
00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:55.916
- It's delicious. - What else do you want?

196
00:10:56.347 --> 00:10:57.387
Here.

197
00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:01.487
- Isn't it good? - It's so tasty.

198
00:11:03.087 --> 00:11:04.357
What else do you want?

199
00:11:13.597 --> 00:11:14.896
You laughed so much.

200
00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:17.207
Now you're back to being quiet.

201
00:11:18.237 --> 00:11:19.266
I laughed?

202
00:11:20.837 --> 00:11:21.877
When?

203
00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:32.247
Let's go for a walk.

204
00:11:32.816 --> 00:11:33.816
To talk.

205
00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:48.666
What do you want to say?

206
00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.467
That's what I wanted to ask you.

207
00:11:52.607 --> 00:11:53.877
You asked me once...

208
00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:56.877
if I laughed because it was funny...

209
00:11:58.007 --> 00:12:00.247
or if it was just because things were unbearable.

210
00:12:02.416 --> 00:12:04.587
That was just what you seemed like.

211
00:12:06.757 --> 00:12:08.257
Are you copying me?

212
00:12:08.887 --> 00:12:10.087
You noticed?

213
00:12:21.396 --> 00:12:22.467
I never used to...

214
00:12:23.337 --> 00:12:25.607
expect much from a relationship.

215
00:12:26.637 --> 00:12:29.607
I'd never made eye contact for over three seconds,

216
00:12:31.247 --> 00:12:33.046
memorized a patient's name,

217
00:12:34.847 --> 00:12:37.587
or opened up to a colleague or friend.

218
00:12:41.316 --> 00:12:42.316
Guess what?

219
00:12:45.727 --> 00:12:47.196
When you expect nothing,

220
00:12:48.257 --> 00:12:49.827
you fear nothing.

221
00:12:50.727 --> 00:12:52.266
Because there's nothing to lose.

222
00:12:54.896 --> 00:12:56.467
Is it different now?

223
00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:02.776
I think so.

224
00:13:05.007 --> 00:13:07.977
What if the hospital ship stops running...

225
00:13:07.977 --> 00:13:09.847
forever?

226
00:13:10.016 --> 00:13:12.786
What will happen to the crew?

227
00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:15.056
What about the patients?

228
00:13:16.016 --> 00:13:18.587
I have many concerns and fears.

229
00:13:19.186 --> 00:13:20.796
I tried to get rid of them...

230
00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:25.896
by pretending to be happy.

231
00:13:25.896 --> 00:13:28.536
I tried to laugh as much as possible.

232
00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:33.306
It doesn't seem effective for me.

233
00:13:40.546 --> 00:13:44.087
It wasn't effective for me either.

234
00:13:45.087 --> 00:13:47.656
You noticed sadness in my laughter.

235
00:13:48.487 --> 00:13:50.757
Your comforting words were more effective.

236
00:13:55.926 --> 00:13:57.196
I'm relieved...

237
00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:01.066
that I can notice it right away.

238
00:14:04.406 --> 00:14:06.436
However, don't do that anymore.

239
00:14:07.237 --> 00:14:09.176
Tell me when you're afraid.

240
00:14:09.946 --> 00:14:12.107
Ask for help when things are difficult.

241
00:14:12.946 --> 00:14:14.977
Cry when you're sad.

242
00:14:16.016 --> 00:14:17.316
Just let it go.

243
00:14:18.747 --> 00:14:20.457
I noticed it today,

244
00:14:22.087 --> 00:14:23.186
but next time,

245
00:14:24.286 --> 00:14:26.026
I may not notice it.

246
00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:40.837
From now on, tell me everything.

247
00:14:41.477 --> 00:14:42.607
Whatever it is,

248
00:14:43.906 --> 00:14:45.776
don't try to fight it alone.

249
00:14:47.446 --> 00:14:50.247
It's a very bad habit of yours.

250
00:14:52.887 --> 00:14:54.056
Promise me.

251
00:14:55.156 --> 00:14:56.487
Can you promise me?

252
00:15:01.156 --> 00:15:02.396
That's good.

253

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

254
00:15:56.686 --> 00:15:59.957
I called everyone here tonight...

255
00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:05.987
because there's something I'd like to ask.

256
00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:11.597
In a few days,

257
00:16:11.967 --> 00:16:16.536
the hospital ship will shut down temporarily.

258
00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:22.776
All of you will be reassigned quickly.

259
00:16:22.776 --> 00:16:24.507
Are you accepting it?

260
00:16:24.507 --> 00:16:26.077
Without even a fight?

261
00:16:26.077 --> 00:16:28.916
We'll take care of it.

262
00:16:29.676 --> 00:16:32.487
Public health doctors must stay out of it.

263
00:16:32.487 --> 00:16:34.117
- But... - As you know,

264
00:16:35.656 --> 00:16:37.257
this is your military service.

265
00:16:37.587 --> 00:16:40.627
If you break the rules, you'll be reported.

266
00:16:40.627 --> 00:16:42.426
Once you're sentenced,

267
00:16:42.426 --> 00:16:45.896
you must join the military right away.

268
00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:48.566
In that case,

269
00:16:48.566 --> 00:16:52.266
you won't ever see your precious patients again.

270
00:16:52.607 --> 00:16:54.337
Do you understand me?

271
00:16:56.207 --> 00:16:59.007
Why aren't you answering him?

272
00:16:59.007 --> 00:17:01.546
You should say yes loud and clear.

273
00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:04.746
Remember when you received your assignment?

274
00:17:04.746 --> 00:17:06.216
Doctor Kim Jae Geol.

275
00:17:06.857 --> 00:17:10.127
You looked like you were boarding a haunted ship.

276
00:17:10.627 --> 00:17:12.186
That's not all.

277
00:17:12.527 --> 00:17:14.857
Doctor Cha Joon Young tried everything...

278
00:17:14.857 --> 00:17:16.327
not to board the hospital ship.

279
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:19.396
I saw you attaching...

280
00:17:19.396 --> 00:17:23.097
an amulet on your forehead.

281
00:17:23.097 --> 00:17:24.906
Come on, Captain.

282
00:17:26.807 --> 00:17:30.607
The local council wants to see you, Dr. Song.

283
00:17:31.146 --> 00:17:32.706
They'll hold an investigation...

284
00:17:33.176 --> 00:17:35.246
related to medical malpractice.

285
00:17:35.246 --> 00:17:37.787
Go and give your testimony.

286
00:17:38.387 --> 00:17:39.387
Okay.

287
00:17:41.017 --> 00:17:43.627
- Go with her, Dr. Kwak. - Okay.

288
00:17:45.127 --> 00:17:47.156
Dr. Song, you'll be reassigned...

289
00:17:48.496 --> 00:17:51.896
based on the investigation results.

290
00:17:53.027 --> 00:17:54.196
I understand.

291
00:17:55.597 --> 00:17:57.837
Regarding where the crew members...

292
00:17:57.837 --> 00:18:01.506
and the nurses will be reassigned,

293
00:18:01.506 --> 00:18:03.676
I'll get a call in a few days.

294
00:18:03.676 --> 00:18:06.577
No, I won't go anywhere else.

295
00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:10.587
Let's fight instead and keep...

296
00:18:11.416 --> 00:18:13.186
the hospital ship running.

297
00:18:14.287 --> 00:18:17.226
Fighting is the last resort.

298
00:18:17.686 --> 00:18:20.797
For now, Captain Bang, Mr. Chu, and I...

299
00:18:20.797 --> 00:18:23.966
will try our best to persuade the local council.

300
00:18:24.627 --> 00:18:27.196
Don't do anything rash.

301
00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:29.436
Stay in your places, okay?

302
00:18:29.436 --> 00:18:31.267
Nurse Pyo.

303
00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:34.077
It's okay.

304
00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:36.706
Everything will be okay.

305
00:18:36.706 --> 00:18:38.107
Don't cry.

306
00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:34.896
Where are they taking the ship?

307
00:19:35.597 --> 00:19:38.307
They'll keep it at Gwanyongseon Dock...

308
00:19:38.307 --> 00:19:40.337
and check its maintenance.

309
00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:41.936
After maintenance,

310
00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:45.077
what will happen?

311
00:19:45.777 --> 00:19:49.317
Will they renovate it and use it for something else?

312
00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:54.387
Do you think...

313
00:19:55.057 --> 00:19:57.557
we can go back?

314
00:19:58.486 --> 00:20:02.027
Can we go back to the hospital ship...

315
00:20:03.156 --> 00:20:05.127
and visit each island?

316
00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:10.736
Will we see our patients again?

(Provincial Government Office)

318
00:21:02.986 --> 00:21:06.057
Shutting down the hospital ship is unjust.

319
00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.557
We ask to speak with the governor.

320
00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:12.426
Why can't we speak with the governor?

321
00:21:12.426 --> 00:21:14.196
He's out of the office.

322
00:21:14.196 --> 00:21:16.706
We saw him going in.

323
00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:18.706
- You're mistaken. - Sir.

324
00:21:18.706 --> 00:21:20.637
Please go back.

325
00:21:20.637 --> 00:21:24.377
If you get aggressive, we'll call the security guards.

- Governor. - Sir.

We need to talk to you.

331

Please don't shut down the hospital ship.

332

Let's take it to court.

333

If we lose the case, we'll give up.

What should we do now?

337
00:21:50.807 --> 00:21:54.236
We must wait until he sees us.

338
00:21:54.236 --> 00:21:56.676
Otherwise, we'll protest.

Hello, I can't talk right now. I'll call you later.

341
00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:09.186
Why are you so rude?

342
00:22:09.617 --> 00:22:12.327
I can't answer calls right now.

343
00:22:15.027 --> 00:22:17.527
My goodness.

344
00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:20.097
What a mess.

345
00:22:27.607 --> 00:22:29.077
How does he sound?

346
00:22:29.077 --> 00:22:30.946
He seemed well yesterday,

347
00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:33.246
but he's struggling today.

348
00:22:45.726 --> 00:22:47.256
What are you doing?

349
00:22:49.097 --> 00:22:50.926
Why did you let her come near my baby?

350
00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:53.996
Don't you know she's the one who made my daughter sick?

351
00:22:53.996 --> 00:22:57.067
Ms. Hwang, you shouldn't accuse her like that.

352
00:22:57.307 --> 00:22:58.837
I don't know...

353
00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:00.807
what your lawyer said to you,

354
00:23:00.807 --> 00:23:03.347
but you can't conclude that Dr. Song made her sick.

355
00:23:03.347 --> 00:23:06.506
If it wasn't her, did you make my daughter sick?

356
00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:09.847
- No, what I mean is... - It's okay.

357
00:23:11.087 --> 00:23:14.017
I'm sorry. Please see your baby now.

358
00:23:14.557 --> 00:23:16.216
I'll leave now.

359
00:23:36.607 --> 00:23:37.847
Yes, sir.

360
00:23:37.847 --> 00:23:40.146
- Where are you now? - I'm in the ER.

361
00:23:40.317 --> 00:23:41.517
Come to my office.

362
00:23:42.347 --> 00:23:43.517
Okay.

363
00:23:47.557 --> 00:23:50.726
What did you just say?

364
00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:54.127
I said stop working at the ER.

365
00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:58.597
- What's the reason? - Your name...

366
00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:02.067
has been on the news too often recently...

367
00:24:03.037 --> 00:24:05.067
and not in a good way.

368
00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:07.077
- But that's... - I know it's unfair to you.

369
00:24:07.837 --> 00:24:10.176
I don't know how far the baby's mother wants to take this,

370
00:24:11.006 --> 00:24:12.706
but I also know...

371
00:24:13.476 --> 00:24:17.347
that it's most likely that she will lose the case.

372
00:24:17.887 --> 00:24:19.787
Most doctors and experts...

373
00:24:20.587 --> 00:24:22.416
would agree with me.

374
00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:24.226
Then why?

375
00:24:26.696 --> 00:24:28.756
It's because ordinary people believe the press.

376
00:24:30.127 --> 00:24:33.027
It's ordinary people who come to hospitals for treatments,

377
00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:35.537
not doctors or experts.

378
00:24:38.267 --> 00:24:41.906
Let me get this straight. You're advising me to quit...

379
00:24:43.137 --> 00:24:47.146
because you're worried about damaging your hospital's reputation?

380
00:24:55.456 --> 00:24:56.756
It's your three months' salaries.

381
00:24:58.186 --> 00:25:01.097
People will forget about this in three months.

382
00:25:01.797 --> 00:25:03.097
Take some rest,

383
00:25:04.027 --> 00:25:06.396
and get a job at another hospital when things die down.

384
00:25:06.996 --> 00:25:10.236
With your ability, hospitals will line up to have you.

385
00:25:10.906 --> 00:25:12.067
Is this...

386
00:25:12.867 --> 00:25:14.506
your own decision?

387
00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:18.877
Whose else would it be?

388
00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:26.587
I understood.

389
00:25:27.716 --> 00:25:29.857
I will do as you say,

390
00:25:31.156 --> 00:25:32.827
but please let me work...

391
00:25:33.827 --> 00:25:37.327
until you find a replacement at least.

392
00:25:39.127 --> 00:25:40.996
The ER is full of emergency patients every night.

393
00:25:41.767 --> 00:25:43.936
Doctor Kang can't handle it alone.

394
00:25:44.607 --> 00:25:47.137
We have quite many emergency surgeries, so...

395
00:25:47.137 --> 00:25:49.077
Don't worry about that.

396
00:25:50.506 --> 00:25:52.047
I've found a replacement already.

397
00:25:58.146 --> 00:26:01.216
Sir. Doctor Myung Se Joon is here.

398
00:26:01.486 --> 00:26:02.517
Hi.

399
00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:06.027
Is Doctor Myung Se Joon my replacement?

400
00:26:07.726 --> 00:26:10.027
Transfer your duties to him,

401
00:26:11.226 --> 00:26:14.736
and stop working at the ER as of today.

402
00:26:20.137 --> 00:26:22.976
Goodness. You acted like you're the smartest person,

403
00:26:22.976 --> 00:26:24.847
but you couldn't even protect the hospital ship.

404
00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:28.577
Is there hope?

405
00:26:29.617 --> 00:26:31.117
How long should I stay here?

406
00:26:33.887 --> 00:26:37.387
I think you should ask Doosung Group, not me.

407
00:26:38.656 --> 00:26:41.196
I guess there can't be any hope.

408
00:26:41.696 --> 00:26:44.127
Their chairman came all the way here and made a fuss.

409
00:26:44.127 --> 00:26:45.926
It means they will push ahead with the bill...

410
00:26:45.926 --> 00:26:47.666
on remote medical service this time.

411
00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:50.466
Of course, they'd try to remove the hospital ship, the biggest obstacle.

412
00:26:51.767 --> 00:26:53.137
Still, they didn't have to...

413
00:26:53.137 --> 00:26:55.236
fire you from the ER too.

414
00:26:57.107 --> 00:26:59.246
So, do you have a place to work?

415
00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:01.617
I should look for one.

416
00:27:02.646 --> 00:27:04.716
Doctor Kim Do Hoon is very worried about you.

417
00:27:04.716 --> 00:27:05.887
You should call him.

418
00:27:06.517 --> 00:27:07.956
It looked like...

419
00:27:07.956 --> 00:27:09.517
he was talking to...

420
00:27:09.517 --> 00:27:12.156
Chief Director Jang Sung Ho about having you back in Seoul.

421
00:27:13.087 --> 00:27:14.926
Doosung Group wouldn't like it so much.

422
00:27:14.926 --> 00:27:17.767
Why not? They'll welcome you.

423
00:27:19.327 --> 00:27:22.666
When we lost you before, do you know...

424
00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:25.107
what Chief Director Jang said to Doctor Kim?

425
00:27:25.607 --> 00:27:28.706
"Businessmen even embrace their enemies if they need to,"

426
00:27:28.936 --> 00:27:31.006
"so you have to embrace the betrayers too."

427
00:27:32.077 --> 00:27:35.146
You're on the hospital ship's side now, so that means...

428
00:27:35.146 --> 00:27:36.817
you're the enemy of the remote medical service.

429
00:27:37.517 --> 00:27:39.087
They will welcome you with open arms.

430
00:27:40.256 --> 00:27:42.216
It'll be turning the strongest enemy into an ally.

431
00:27:48.097 --> 00:27:50.867
- What are you doing? - Can't you see I'm making coffee?

432
00:27:51.627 --> 00:27:54.067
- What have you been doing all day? - Paperwork.

433
00:27:54.797 --> 00:27:57.567
- Is it going well? - It's a piece of cake.

434
00:27:58.406 --> 00:27:59.466
What about you?

435
00:28:00.337 --> 00:28:02.877
- I wrote a report. - Gosh.

436
00:28:03.446 --> 00:28:05.976
Why do you have to write a report? You've done nothing wrong.

437
00:28:07.416 --> 00:28:11.146
Anyway, it's comfortable here, but it's distressing.

438
00:28:11.146 --> 00:28:12.216
Right.

439
00:28:12.517 --> 00:28:14.557
If I had been placed to a place like this...

440
00:28:14.557 --> 00:28:17.527
before I got on the hospital ship, I would've been so happy.

441
00:28:18.456 --> 00:28:21.527
Why do I want to go back so badly? It only makes me seasick.

442
00:28:21.756 --> 00:28:23.127
Tell me about it.

443
00:28:23.597 --> 00:28:24.996
My gosh.

444
00:28:25.726 --> 00:28:27.736
I wonder how the elderly are doing.

445
00:28:27.736 --> 00:28:28.966
They'd be fine, right?

446
00:28:29.837 --> 00:28:31.067
They have helpers.

447
00:28:31.637 --> 00:28:33.137
I hope so.

448
00:28:36.277 --> 00:28:38.077
(Haeshim Island Health Center)

449
00:28:40.117 --> 00:28:42.746
- I guess they're not. - What do you mean?

450
00:28:43.517 --> 00:28:44.547
Hello?

451
00:28:44.547 --> 00:28:47.456
Doctor, we have a big problem.

452
00:28:47.686 --> 00:28:48.817
A big problem?

453
00:28:53.797 --> 00:28:54.926
What is that about?

454
00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:58.267
- This isn't working. - We can't deal with them.

455
00:28:59.027 --> 00:29:00.396
This is broken!

456
00:29:01.436 --> 00:29:04.206
Sir, you just need to charge it.

457
00:29:04.206 --> 00:29:05.506
Charge what?

458
00:29:05.666 --> 00:29:07.577
The doctor says he can't see my face.

459
00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:10.146
Please look at the camera.

460
00:29:10.146 --> 00:29:11.706
There is no camera here.

461
00:29:11.877 --> 00:29:13.847
Are they teasing us or what?

462
00:29:14.577 --> 00:29:16.347
I may not know how to read or write,

463
00:29:16.347 --> 00:29:18.517
but I know what a camera looks like.

464
00:29:18.746 --> 00:29:20.956
Hey, come and look at this.

465
00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:23.887
- Me too. - Mine isn't working either.

466
00:29:24.956 --> 00:29:26.456
Are you hearing this?

467
00:29:27.127 --> 00:29:29.057
Please do something.

468
00:29:29.057 --> 00:29:32.896
This will make me sick soon.

469
00:29:33.027 --> 00:29:34.797
I heard they sent helpers for the elderly.

470
00:29:34.797 --> 00:29:36.037
Haven't they arrived?

471
00:29:36.236 --> 00:29:38.037
They came and left already.

472
00:29:38.037 --> 00:29:40.176
They just said what they needed to say...

473
00:29:40.176 --> 00:29:44.176
even though the elderly didn't understand it, and they just left.

474
00:29:44.377 --> 00:29:46.716
I'll tell you the details about the most urgent patients first,

475
00:29:46.716 --> 00:29:48.976
- so please help them. - Okay. Go on.

476
00:29:49.347 --> 00:29:52.047
Mr. Park Sung Ryeol and Ms. Kang Jung Boon have to take...

477
00:29:52.047 --> 00:29:53.587
their prescriptions today.

478
00:29:53.756 --> 00:29:56.956
The hospital will send them the prescription drugs, right?

479
00:29:57.486 --> 00:29:58.956
What did they say about that again?

480
00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:02.027
I'm not really sure.

481
00:30:03.527 --> 00:30:05.127
How does this sound?

482
00:30:05.627 --> 00:30:08.767
I can't go there right now, but I'll go as soon as I get off work.

483
00:30:08.767 --> 00:30:10.837
I'll go and help you with the patients.

484
00:30:11.236 --> 00:30:12.666
When do you get off work?

485
00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:14.906
It's 5pm, so I can be there by 8pm.

486
00:30:16.337 --> 00:30:18.676
It'll be too late then.

487
00:30:19.246 --> 00:30:22.317
We're only open from 10am to 4pm.

488
00:30:23.146 --> 00:30:25.847
My goodness. Forget it.

489
00:30:27.087 --> 00:30:29.287
They're throwing a tantrum again.

490
00:30:35.426 --> 00:30:36.527
What should we do?

491
00:30:37.696 --> 00:30:39.127
We should go there.

492
00:30:39.127 --> 00:30:40.567
She said it'd be closed by then.

493
00:30:40.767 --> 00:30:42.236
There must be a way.

494
00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:44.837
All right.

495
00:30:45.706 --> 00:30:47.236
Let's meet at the lobby after work.

496
00:30:47.736 --> 00:30:49.337
We should hurry to catch the last ferry.

497
00:30:51.607 --> 00:30:54.377
What are the captain and Mr. Chu doing?

498
00:30:54.817 --> 00:30:56.216
Can't they settle this faster?

499
00:30:57.186 --> 00:30:58.646
Governor!

500
00:31:00.956 --> 00:31:03.156
Come on out already!

501
00:31:03.456 --> 00:31:05.057
We request a face-to-face talk!

502
00:31:05.256 --> 00:31:07.426
Sir! Governor!

503
00:31:11.496 --> 00:31:12.827
This is absurd.

504
00:31:12.827 --> 00:31:14.696
Where on earth is he?

505
00:31:14.696 --> 00:31:16.966
Where else would he be? He must be in his office.

506
00:31:16.966 --> 00:31:18.607
- My gosh. - Goodness.

507
00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:21.936
What a great scene. What are you doing here?

508
00:31:22.976 --> 00:31:25.807
What brings you here?

509
00:31:27.017 --> 00:31:28.277
I need you to come with me.

510
00:31:28.277 --> 00:31:30.146
- Where? - Just come with me.

511
00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:33.047
Come here.

512
00:31:35.857 --> 00:31:38.887
- Let go of me! - What's wrong with you?

513
00:31:39.587 --> 00:31:41.756
- Just come with me. - I can't.

514
00:31:42.226 --> 00:31:43.426
The hospital ship is having a crisis.

515
00:31:43.426 --> 00:31:45.696
That darn hospital ship.

516
00:31:46.567 --> 00:31:48.267
It's the only thing you care about, right?

517
00:31:48.597 --> 00:31:50.037
What do we do?

518
00:31:50.037 --> 00:31:53.406
I'm scared that his wife might punch him soon.

519
00:31:54.807 --> 00:31:57.446
- Maybe I should stop them. - Stay here.

520
00:31:57.446 --> 00:31:59.607
- Don't be ridiculous. - Shouldn't I?

521
00:31:59.607 --> 00:32:01.976
The hospital ship is more important than your children, right?

522
00:32:02.047 --> 00:32:04.686
Why? Did something happen to our kids?

523
00:32:06.117 --> 00:32:07.716
There will be a disciplinary committee.

524
00:32:08.317 --> 00:32:10.726
Your brilliant second son, Dong Min,

525
00:32:10.726 --> 00:32:13.297
punched his classmate and broke his tooth.

526
00:32:14.426 --> 00:32:16.256
The school wants the parents to...

527
00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:19.936
Are you feeling okay?

528
00:32:20.097 --> 00:32:22.666
You actually look a little pale.

529
00:32:24.837 --> 00:32:26.436
Stop acting like you care about me.

530
00:32:27.077 --> 00:32:29.006
Stop acting, and come with me to his school.

531
00:32:29.006 --> 00:32:30.176
We'll go there and...

532
00:32:39.547 --> 00:32:40.587
Honey.

533
00:32:41.287 --> 00:32:43.557
Honey!

534
00:32:43.956 --> 00:32:45.956
Honey!

535
00:32:46.426 --> 00:32:47.857
- Honey! - Is she okay?

536
00:32:48.297 --> 00:32:51.166
What's happening? Honey!

537
00:32:51.996 --> 00:32:53.027
Honey!

538
00:32:53.951 --> 00:32:57.451
(Episode 36 will air shortly.)
