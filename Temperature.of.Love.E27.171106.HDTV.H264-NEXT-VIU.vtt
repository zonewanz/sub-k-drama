1
00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.150
Do you want tea?

2
00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:15.849
Let's live together.

3
00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:19.820
Let's stay together.

4
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.299
(Episode 27)

5
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.369
You're waiting a long time to ask me a question.

6
00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.300
I was so startled today.

7
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.839
I thought my heart was going to stop.

8
00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:09.770
Why would your heart stop beating?

9
00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:12.040
Why did you cry?

10
00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.880
I was faced with a reality I couldn't change.

11
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.509
Good job.

12
00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.580
- What do you mean? - You cried.

13
00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.290
Crying makes you feel refreshed.

14
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.190
You seem like someone who grew up receiving a lot of love.

15
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.600
Were you surprised when I asked you to live together?

16
00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:36.499
Do you want to live with me?

17
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.339
Yes.

18
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469
I want to make you happy.

19
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.749
When we first met, you asked me why I didn't have...

20
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.389
a cellphone.

21
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.320
I ran away from my mom.

22
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.430
I thought she wouldn't be able to find me if I didn't have a phone.

23
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.559
But she did.

24
00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:07.669
So I just gave up on abandoning her.

25
00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.539
- I'm going to accept her. - Why?

26
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.869
- What? - I ran away from her...

27
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.270
because I didn't want to accept her even when I'm her son.

28
00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.779
So why would you try to accept her?

29
00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.779
Because I love you.

30
00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.610
Don't sacrifice your life just because you love me.

31
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.619
I don't think about it as sacrifice.

32
00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.890
The fact that you decided to let my mom in...

33
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.589
means that you've put your life on hold for her.

34
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.059
You're swaying.

35
00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.589
I'll hold onto you, so you can sway as much as you want.

36
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.930
When you're trying to save someone who's drowning,

37
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.140
do you know that you need to wait until that person gets exhausted?

38
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.610
Otherwise, you'll both die.

39
00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.010
Everything I've tried to suppress until now has all blown up at once.

40
00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.680
It all just might get uprooted.

41
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.369
Go in now.

42
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.170
Okay. Good night.

43
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.379
I'll leave after I see you go in.

44
00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.879
Everything I've tried to suppress until now has all blown up at once.

45
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.450
It all just might get uprooted.

46
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.599
(Temperature of Love)

47
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.270
I left your lunch appointment open.

48
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.640
Good.

49
00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:29.539
Mr. Park.

50
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.239
I think you should go into Ms. Ji and Director Kim's meeting.

51
00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.479
Why?

52
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.049
You think a I'm a pushover?

53
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.320
I'm not saying you are.

54
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.049
Is it wrong to ask you to shoot what's on the script?

55
00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:42.950
Why are you asking me to do that when I don't understand it?

56
00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.219
Why don't you understand this?

57
00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.659
So the chairman flips a table...

58
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.729
and bosses his wife around with money.

59
00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.659
But why does he eat meals with his dog?

60
00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.200
I wrote that based on a true story.

61
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.130
Even if it's based on a true story, you should make it believable.

62
00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.510
- Jung Woo. - Sir.

63
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.140
What's wrong?

64
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.640
The script doesn't make sense.

65
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.650
Sir. Why are you criticizing my script...

66
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.250
like you've directed some amazing work?

67
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.250
Ms. Ji.

68
00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.549
He said he liked my script.

69
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.349
You're the problem.

70
00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.950
- Excuse me? - Joon Ha.

71
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.989
Jung Woo, I'm sorry, but I can't do this.

72
00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.089
This is unacceptable.

73
00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:25.460
I'm sorry, Ms. Ji. We can't work together.

74
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.870
If I was a star writer, you would've directed it without a word.

75
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.169
Then you should've been a star writer.

76
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.810
What's wrong with him?

77
00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.539
I told you.

78
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.039
You and Director Min would make a good team.

79
00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.279
If I work with Director Min, I can't air it on SBC now.

80
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.779
I have no time to lose.

81
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.150
More haste, less speed.

82
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.989
Buy me lunch.

83
00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.489
Where do you want to eat?

84
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.460
I want to help my friends with financial difficulties.

85
00:05:58.299 --> 00:05:59.400
Do you mind?

86
00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.770
No. I love Good Soup too.

87
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.659
(Carrot puree)

88
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.159
Did you make a new puree?

89
00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.789
I made it the day before yesterday.

90
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:30.729
Make it again. It's too old.

91
00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:32.529
Yes, Chef.

92
00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:36.500
Did you check the oyster and bass that came in?

93
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.770
- Yes, Chef. - When?

94
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.299
- Yesterday. - Freshness is important.

95
00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.370
- Check again. - Yes, Chef.

96
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.380
These are all wilted.

97
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.779
I told you to discard wilted and yellowed leaves.

98
00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.479
Yes. I'll prepare them again.

99
00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:58.060
Table seven, two lunch courses.

100
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.419
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

101
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.099
Ms. Ji and Mr. Park are here.

102
00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.770
Why do you like Jung Sun's dish?

103
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.880
It's a matter of personal taste.

104
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.549
Then you should just hire a personal cook.

105
00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:23.919
Why do you invest in a restaurant?

106
00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:26.150
It costs too much.

107
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.690
Will you retrieve the investment?

108
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.890
I'm not retrieving it. Chef On...

109
00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.659
is buying my share.

110
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.229
I should've come to you, but you came.

111
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.370
I came here for lunch.

112
00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.669
I'll meet you on the terrace after lunch.

113
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.289
Do you like it?

114
00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:10.900
Yes, I like it.

115
00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:13.700
Since my investor likes it, I'll go with it.

116
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.020
Did you bring the contract?

117
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.020
I only came here today to have lunch.

118
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:43.529
I'll get going now.

119
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.929
Don't you have anything to say to me?

120
00:08:45.429 --> 00:08:47.100
I think you have a lot to say to me.

121
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.100
How much money did you lend my mother?

122
00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.400
Why did you do that without telling me?

123
00:08:53.669 --> 00:08:54.770
What if I told you?

124
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.309
Then I wouldn't be in more debt.

125
00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:57.409
Wrong.

126
00:08:57.409 --> 00:08:59.610
If I didn't, where would've your mom gone to get the money?

127
00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:04.020
I did you a favor.

128
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.850
Doing me a favor could cause problems for me.

129
00:09:08.289 --> 00:09:10.860
My mom have made troubles with money before,

130
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.289
and I know how to handle it.

131
00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:15.929
I'm upset because I inconvenienced you.

132
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.699
What I hate the most...

133
00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:22.230
is causing inconvenience to people I love.

134
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:25.840
Come to my office.

135
00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:29.209
Let's draw up a contract for purchasing the investment shares.

136
00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:00.510
Get big fridges.

137
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.169
I was going to. We were thinking the same.

138
00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:06.579
Fridges and kitchen are everything...

139
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.980
to a chef.

140
00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:17.490
I'm glad I started this with you.

141
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.429
The end will be good too.

142
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.490
I like it when the start and the end are the same.

143
00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.740
Do I just cut it?

144
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.240
You should cut it diagonally.

145
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.340
Like this?

146
00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:47.750
Why are you still here?

147
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:49.049
As you see,

148
00:10:49.189 --> 00:10:52.819
I'm reading the news, and seeing Won Joon acting childish.

149
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.260
Sorry. I'm a bit childish.

150
00:10:56.429 --> 00:10:59.230
Aren't you going too far? I know you're going out.

151
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.400
But you can still say hi to me.

152
00:11:01.699 --> 00:11:04.000
I guess it's because you've been too mean to him.

153
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.470
It's nothing compare to how mean you were to me.

154
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:10.140
I'm leaving.

155
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.740
Don't you think I'm super nice?

156
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.250
You and Won Joon treat me like this,

157
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.949
but I still asked Mr. Park to come here for lunch.

158
00:11:18.549 --> 00:11:19.579
Thanks.

159
00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:23.720
Bye. I'll never come back here again.

160
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.289
But you always come back.

161
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:40.510
I know you'll come running after me.

162
00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:45.439
What? Are they really not coming out?

163
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.709
Gosh, they're really mean.

164
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.620
This is why you shouldn't be nice to people.

165
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.179
How can they do this to me?

166
00:11:55.419 --> 00:11:56.520
Sous chef.

167
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720
Yes, Soo Jung?

168
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.159
You can't control love.

169
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.130
You can't stop it, and it can't be stopped.

170
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.829
That's why it's love.

171
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.699
I'm rooting for your love.

172
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.610
Still, you fell for me a little bit. Right?

173
00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:23.449
Yes.

174
00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:27.520
I'll settle for how you fell for me a little.

175
00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:39.299
You should love someone like her, you idiot.

176
00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:43.029
What are you doing?

177
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.309
Mom.

178
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.110
Hi.

179
00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.279
There you go.

180
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.590
You're coming to see me often.

181
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.459
You must need a lot of cheering up.

182
00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:08.429
It's so difficult.

183
00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:10.900
Are you having a hard time with work?

184
00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:14.230
No. Loving someone is so difficult.

185
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.100
Are things not going so well with Chef On?

186
00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:23.309
I asked him to live with me, but I got rejected.

187
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.209
I was willing to sacrifice everything for him.

188
00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:30.350
But he told me not to.

189
00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:32.980
I'm upset.

190
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.360
Why are you upset about that?

191
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.329
He seems to have a sense of responsibility and cautiousness.

192
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:43.799
I actually like him a lot more now.

193
00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:47.429
It's not like he's the only one who knows how to be responsible.

194
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:49.770
I'm also responsible, and I want to take responsibility...

195
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.770
for this situation.

196
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.000
What kind of situation is that?

197
00:13:54.809 --> 00:13:56.169
It's complicated.

198
00:13:58.579 --> 00:14:00.409
Love isn't about pitying someone.

199
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.120
It starts with pity, gets maintained with responsibility,

200
00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:07.220
and it all comes to an end with guilt.

201
00:14:07.419 --> 00:14:09.689
The results can't be the same for everyone.

202
00:14:09.689 --> 00:14:11.159
Each person goes through different things.

203
00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:12.919
People aren't that different.

204
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.490
But that doesn't mean they're all the same.

205
00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:18.559
You used to analyze and be picky about everything...

206
00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:21.100
when you used to date men in the past.

207
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.169
It's really awkward to see you act like this.

208
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.370
I tried to figure out when I started loving Jung Sun.

209
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.079
I think it started when he asked me out when we first met.

210
00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:38.120
How complicated.

211
00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:42.289
But I wasn't able to recognize my feelings back then.

212
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.220
I should've known back then.

213
00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:50.329
What's wrong with you?

214
00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:54.870
Back in the days, if a guy asked you to meet during your exams,

215
00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:57.539
you refused because you had to study.

216
00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:01.409
You used to be very strict about what to do and what not to do.

217
00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:05.539
Back then, it didn't hurt to be so coldhearted.

218
00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:08.309
So I thought that was what love was.

219
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.049
Get up.

220
00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:14.150
I have lunch plans with your dad.

221
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.220
Why won't he lean on me?

222
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.659
I'm so upset.

223
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.090
My gosh, you're upsetting me.

224
00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:31.240
Is your headache okay now?

225
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.069
Yes, I'm okay now.

226
00:15:33.569 --> 00:15:36.640
Dad's really the only one who looks after you.

227
00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:39.740
By the way,

228
00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:43.709
I'm not sure if I should tell you this or not.

229
00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:44.850
What?

230
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.850
We got a gift from Mr. Park.

231
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.860
It was the day when the articles about the co-writer...

232
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.020
for "Unruly Detectives" came out.

233
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.029
It seems he sent us something to comfort us.

234
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.360
I accepted it because I thought you'd end up dating him.

235
00:15:57.659 --> 00:15:58.730
What should I do?

236
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.260
Should I give it back to him?

237
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.669
I think that could be a bit rude.

238
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.699
Let's think about it.

239
00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.610
- Eat up. - You too.

240
00:16:08.209 --> 00:16:09.740
(On Jung Sun)

241
00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.709
You've become really impatient.

242
00:16:17.819 --> 00:16:20.279
(Purchase of Investment Equity)

243
00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.549
I signed the contract.

244
00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:25.360
Are you sure you won't regret it?

245
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.329
You can't do business based on your emotions.

246
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.799
If you decide to cancel this right now,

247
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.029
I can take you back.

248
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.299
No, I don't do whatever it takes like you.

249
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.069
I'll do things my way.

250
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.079
I don't want to shake your hand...

251
00:16:49.449 --> 00:16:50.750
because I'm being swayed.

252
00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.949
I'll also pay back my mom's debt.

253
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.360
Please tell me the exact amount.

254

<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E27 Temperature of Love "Let's Live Together"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

255
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.570
I'm going to accept her as well.

256
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.669
I ran away from her because I didn't want to accept her...

257
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:16.040
even when I'm her son.

258
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.580
So why would you try to accept her?

259
00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:24.749
Don't sacrifice your life...

260
00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:27.120
just because you love me.

261
00:17:33.489 --> 00:17:35.929

(Lee Hyun Soo)

263
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.320
(Accept)

264
00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:09.290
I thought you weren't going to pick up.

265
00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:11.130
What took you so long to answer?

266
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.959
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.900
Aren't you curious about me?

268
00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:16.830
I am.

269
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.100
You don't sound so happy to talk to me.

270
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.040
No, I am. Let's talk.

271
00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:26.110
I just called you...

272
00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:27.909
because of how things ended the last time we met.

273
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:30.949
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:36.419
Don't apologize. It makes me feel distant.

275
00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:38.390
Then what should I say?

276
00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:43.800
"Where are you?"

277
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.669
- Where are you? - I'm not going to tell you.

278
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.370
Okay.

279
00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.560
Hong Jin.

280
00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:13.790
I can't work with Writer Ji.

281
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.689
Why not?

282
00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:18.830
How can I shoot something I can't understand?

283
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.499
Try to work things out.

284
00:19:20.499 --> 00:19:23.530
Gosh, she's too stubborn. I can't handle her.

285
00:19:24.499 --> 00:19:26.040
My gosh.

286
00:19:27.239 --> 00:19:30.880
I'll work with Hyun Soo. Let me do what I want for a change.

287
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.479
I already failed big time from doing what you told me to do last time.

288
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.780
You talk as if you're proud of that.

289
00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:38.650
Hong Jin, who do you think is going to be working here for longer?

290
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.519
I'll still be working here even after you retire.

291
00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:43.620
I'll treat you well when that day comes.

292
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.689
You little...

293
00:19:45.659 --> 00:19:48.459
- Come over here. - Gosh, stop it.

294
00:19:48.459 --> 00:19:50.159
Good work, everyone.

295
00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:52.429
You too. Rest up, and I'll see you guys next week.

296
00:19:52.429 --> 00:19:53.499
- Okay. - Okay.

297
00:19:53.499 --> 00:19:55.130
Good work. Bye.

298
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.199
I should get going as well.

299
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.110
Soo Jung.

300
00:20:06.209 --> 00:20:08.810
I think Hong Ah has become a habit to me now.

301
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.120
I understand.

302
00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:15.820
But I think you're a really great person...

303
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.820
Then...

304
00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.719
do you want to casually see each other for a month?

305
00:20:21.689 --> 00:20:23.860
That might help you come to a decision.

306
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.729
Will that be okay with you?

307
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.640
Yes.

308
00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:36.769
It's always the chase that makes you have butterflies in your stomach.

309
00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:39.909
After a month of that, I'm sure you'll be able to decide.

310
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.650
- Bye, then. - Bye.

311
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.209
Mom.

312
00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:47.650
- Jung Woo, you're home. - I'm home.

313
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.479
- Did you have a good day? - Yes.

314
00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:52.550
My gosh, it's so hard to see your face.

315
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.449
Wash up, and get ready to eat.

316
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.169
Jung Woo.

317
00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:14.209
You're coming here often.

318
00:22:18.439 --> 00:22:19.610
You're becoming weak.

319
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.830

320
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.870
(Number of calories burned)

321
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:49.370
All by myself

322
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.989
(Life is all about being alone. I like running.)

323
00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:08.890
(I don't need love.)

324
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560
(All by myself)

325
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.380
I shouldn't stay home at times like this.

326
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.719
(Mr. Park)

327
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:38.959
This is Park Jung Woo.

328
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.860
Mr. Park, I need to work.

329
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.199
Please schedule a meeting with Director Min.

330
00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:46.900
How's my drama being organized?

331
00:23:47.229 --> 00:23:48.900
Are you doing your job properly?

332
00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:51.269
Calm down.

333
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.340
I'll schedule a meeting with Director Min.

334
00:23:54.209 --> 00:23:55.269
I'm going to hang up now.

335
00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.110
My gosh, this psycho.

336
00:23:59.409 --> 00:24:00.479
I told you, right?

337
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.550
I'm out of words.

338
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.880
I told Hyun Soo to come. Let's go have a meeting.

339
00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:12.090
Jung Woo, you can go inside first. I need to go to the bathroom.

340
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.080
Where's Joon Ha?

341
00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:39.179
Hyun Soo's really sick.

342
00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:40.790
I'm going to call 911.

343
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.790
(January, 2017)

344
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.159
Hyun Soo.

345
00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:48.560
I think she got stressed after meeting Director Min...

346
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.759
because she kept eating.

347
00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:51.560
Hyun Soo. Hyun Soo.

348
00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.060
We can take my car.

349
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.249
The airing of "Unruly Detectives" might get postponed.

350
00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:13.820
Yi Bok apparently wants to work on another drama.

351
00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:17.219
Then Hyun Soo will have to work with another director.

352
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.429
What do you mean the situation has changed?

353
00:25:23.229 --> 00:25:26.360
You and Joon Ha will be working together like we originally planned.

354
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.400
Okay. Now, where did we leave off?

355
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.540
You weren't slacking off, were you?

356
00:25:33.969 --> 00:25:35.969
I was rereading the script I had written until episode three.

357
00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:37.640
What's Writer Hwangbo doing?

358
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.739
She's probably interviewing the chefs at Good Soup.

359
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.150
Why does she keep going there?

360
00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.820
Joon Ha. If you like Kyung,

361
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.850
tell her about how you feel, and treat her nicely.

362
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.489
You said you've loved someone before. But are you sure about that?

363
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.019
You guys are doing it again.

364
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.219
You're making me feel left out.

365
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.330
Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

366
00:25:56.489 --> 00:25:57.530
Jung Woo, buy us meat.

367
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.300
It's too late to eat anything.

368
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.630
There's never a set time to eat.

369
00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:03.300
You're so selfish.

370
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.739
Okay, let's eat.

371
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.880
Were you surprised when I asked you to live together?

372
00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:19.719
Do you want to live with me?

373
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.249
I want to make you happy.

374
00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:26.489
I'm sorry.

375
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.659
Don't apologize. It makes me feel distant.

376
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.469
Hyun Soo is the best there is at cutting meat.

377
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.969
I never forget what I learn.

378
00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:45.080
This reminds me of my days as an assistant writer.

379
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.840
Jung Woo, eat up.

380
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.880
Here, have a drink.

381
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:50.820
You too.

382
00:26:51.449 --> 00:26:53.919
Jung Woo, please support us all the way.

383
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.550
Let us shoot some scenes abroad,

384
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.360
and invest a lot of money in our drama.

385
00:26:57.419 --> 00:26:59.620
Why would he need to spend that much money on a romantic drama?

386
00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.090
We just need to cast good actors and actresses.

387
00:27:01.659 --> 00:27:03.659
Are you a writer or an employee at a production company?

388
00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:05.100
What's your identity?

389
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.929
I'm a writer who wants to save money for the production company.

390
00:27:12.699 --> 00:27:14.009
(Jung Sun)

391
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.140
I'll be right back after I take this call.

392
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.979
It's Jung Sun.

393
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.949
I've seen her for over 10 years,

394
00:27:26.219 --> 00:27:27.949
yet it's so awkward to see her like this.

395
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.419
I guess love does exist.

396
00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:34.159
I thought it didn't, but she makes me think otherwise.

397
00:27:38.999 --> 00:27:39.999
What's gotten into you?

398
00:27:40.699 --> 00:27:42.969
Where are you? I didn't get to ask you this earlier.

399
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.999
You lost the right timing, but I'll still answer you.

400
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.439
I'm on my way to Good Soup.

401
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.370
I'm thinking about taking you with me if you're nearby.

402
00:27:51.009 --> 00:27:52.580
Then I'll go nearby.

403
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.749
We'll know when the drama will get aired in the beginning of next year.

404
00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.219
Mr. Park. Joon Ha.

405
00:28:04.219 --> 00:28:05.290
You can go.

406
00:28:05.659 --> 00:28:06.759
Can I really go?

407
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.130
Go.

408
00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:13.530
Thank you. See you guys.

409
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:20.709
- Pour me one more glass. - Okay.

410
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.759
I want to see your tattoo.

411
00:28:43.929 --> 00:28:44.999
Can I?

412
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.530
Go ahead if you can.

413
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.709
Right now.

414
00:29:01.409 --> 00:29:03.780
How much more do I have to roll this up?

415
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.080
- Here we go. - No!

416
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.320
There it is.

417
00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:14.159
I like this.

418
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.459
What don't you like?

419
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.300
You're right. I like everything.

420
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.830
I'm not going anywhere.

421
00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.429
So don't be nervous.

422
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.580
Hyun Soo, congratulations.

423
00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.150
You're able to work again.

424
00:30:12.949 --> 00:30:14.019
How did you find out?

425
00:30:14.219 --> 00:30:15.919
Director Kim called me.

426
00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:17.959
Why did he report that to you?

427
00:30:18.489 --> 00:30:20.759
He wasn't reporting anything. He just told me...

428
00:30:20.759 --> 00:30:21.989
because he thought I'd want to know.

429
00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:24.759
Why are you overreacting?

430
00:30:25.959 --> 00:30:27.100
Do you like him?

431
00:30:27.729 --> 00:30:32.169
Hyun Soo. If you make fun of me, I'm going to make fun of you too.

432
00:30:33.199 --> 00:30:35.209
I didn't see it on purpose.

433
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.479
I just looked out the window because the weather was so nice.

434
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.979
I may not be capable of looking inside a car,

435
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.019
but I know how to sense what's going on.

436
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.290
It was rated R.

437
00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:49.989
- Kyung. - Am I wrong?

438
00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:51.759
Was it a lot more intense than that?

439
00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:54.090
- Kyung. - What?

440
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.390
I wonder what's wrong.

441
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.699
What do you mean?

442
00:30:59.229 --> 00:31:01.100
I don't know why I feel so nervous.

443
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.400
When I meet him, I feel relieved and nervous at the same time.

444
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.739
When we're apart, I'm nervous that we'll stay separated forever.

445
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:11.439
What is this feeling?

446
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.150
It's love.

447
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.249
Hey, come on. I'm not kidding.

448
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.050
I wonder why I feel this way.

449
00:31:23.421 --> 00:31:26.521
(Episode 28 will air shortly.)
