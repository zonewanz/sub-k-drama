00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.399
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.289
Gosh, Prosecutor Jung. To what do I owe the pleasure of this call?

3
00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.490
I'm at Sangku Division working on a story on those stray cats.

4
00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.030
Woo Tak, I have a favor to ask of you.

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.329
I can do anything as long as it's not an inappropriate request.

6
00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.799
Just tell me. What is it?

7
00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.909
"April 11, 10:12pm".

8
00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:34.209
"The rooftop at Sujo Building in Sangku-dong".

9
00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:36.480
I had a dream.

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.150
At that time and place,

11
00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.409
Hong Joo got attacked by a man named Kang Dae Hee.

12
00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.079
Kang Dae Hee? Who is that?

13
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.950
He's being tried for murder as a defendant at the moment.

14
00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:47.359
Murder?

15
00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:48.760
There's no way he'll be acquitted,

16
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.459
so I have no idea why I had a dream like that.

17
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.829
Please don't worry.

18
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.370
I'll make sure Hong Joo is not there alone at that time.

19
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.969
Hello?

20
00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:03.069
Are you there? Where are you calling from?

21
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.709
Hello? Hello?

22
00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:11.150
The customer you're calling is unavailable at the moment.

23
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.450
Shall I call a patrol division nearby and ask for backup?

24
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.650
Yes, please do that.

25
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.750
Request backup.

26
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.180
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.450
If you see this in your dream, please don't forget to come here.

28
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.120
I'm on the rooftop at Sujo Building in Sangku-dong.

29
00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.260
Today is April 11.

30
00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.829
It's 10:12pm now.

31
00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.050
He's a patrol officer from Sangku Division.

32
00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:45.680
We're on the first floor of Sujo Building.

33
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.650
- We need an ambulance here. - Woo Tak.

34
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.219
- A police officer got stabbed. - Woo Tak!

35
00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.819
He's breathing.

36
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.449
I can take care of this. You need to go catch that jerk.

37
00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:54.659
He fled to the rooftop.

38
00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:56.919
I'll leave him in your hands.

39
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560
Mr. Jung.

40
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.860
Block all possible escape routes and preserve the scene.

41
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.599
- Got it. - Mr. Jung!

42
00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.300
Gosh, we need an ambulance.

43
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.469
We need an ambulance right now.

44
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.270
Mr. Jung, it's dangerous to go up there alone!

45
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.479
Mr. Jung!

46
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.840
My goodness.

47
00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:17.650
Mr. Jung...

48
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.680
Why isn't he using the elevator?

49
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.919
He's so weird.

50
00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:10.312
- You jerk. - Stay still, you scumbag!

51
00:03:10.312 --> 00:03:11.682
Go ahead and hire an attorney, jerk.

52
00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.981
I'll be acquitted anyway.

53
00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:15.682
Call Lawyer Lee Yu Beom.

54
00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:18.052
Tell Lee Yu Beom to come here, you jerks!

55
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.022
Why did you run up the stairs instead of taking the elevator?

56
00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:25.122
I had noodles for dinner. I had to run because of you, jerk.

57
00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:44.341
Mr. Jung, don't take off alone like that.

58
00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:47.651
You have unusually long legs, but the rest of us don't.

59
00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:49.251
Are you okay?

60
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.381
Did you get hurt?

61
00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:01.631
It's all over. You're okay now.

62
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:03.461
It's all right.

63
00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:05.232
Everything is okay now.

64
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.282
What about Woo Tak? Is he okay?

65
00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:46.771
You woke up?

66
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:48.542
Are you okay?

67
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:52.982
Doctor! The patient just regained his consciousness!

68
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:54.982
Kyung Han, Kyung Han!

69
00:04:55.182 --> 00:04:56.622
Where are you? Lieutenant Han woke up!

70
00:04:56.622 --> 00:04:57.651
What about Hong Joo?

71
00:04:58.581 --> 00:04:59.951
Is she all right?

72
00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:03.391
Yes, I'm right here. I'm fine.

73
00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:08.932
I'm so relieved that you're okay.

74
00:05:18.242 --> 00:05:19.571
You're the only one who's not okay.

75
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.081
You're the only person who nearly died, idiot.

76
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:27.511
Are you really okay? Can you recognize us?

77
00:05:27.782 --> 00:05:28.782
Who am I?

78
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:31.222
You're Kyung Han.

79
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:33.951
Yes, that's right.

80
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:38.162
I am Oh Kyung Han, your senior colleague.

81
00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:41.932
You can recognize people now.

82
00:05:45.232 --> 00:05:46.401
Did you catch the suspect?

83
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:48.872
Yes, he's been arrested.

84
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:58.112
Mr. Kang, you're basically asking me to fill a bottomless barrel.

85
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.982
You need to tell me where the hole is...

86
00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:04.451
for me to patch it up and fill up the barrel with water.

87
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:06.992
I can fill it up myself.

88
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:09.391
I mean, I did it last time. Why can't I do it again this time?

89
00:06:09.622 --> 00:06:10.961
(Please be quiet.)

90
00:06:17.302 --> 00:06:18.331
Excuse me.

91
00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:21.302
Could you please call Lawyer Lee Yu Beom and ask him to come here?

92
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.501
Hey, call Lawyer Lee Yu Beom!

93
00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:27.672
Call my lawyer! Tell him to come here right now!

94
00:06:27.812 --> 00:06:30.141
Bring Lee Yu Beom here immediately!

95
00:06:34.482 --> 00:06:36.422
Bring Lee Yu Beom here.

96
00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:38.622
Go bring Lawyer Lee Yu Beom.

97
00:06:38.722 --> 00:06:40.422
Right now!

98
00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:45.821
Gosh, that was my first time getting stabbed.

99
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:47.591
What we see in movies is a complete lie.

100
00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:50.961
Actors keep fighting even after getting stabbed a few times.

101
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:53.032
That's totally impossible in real life.

102
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.441
The moment you get stabbed, you lose all of your strength.

103
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:59.042
I couldn't even lift up my fingers.

104
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:02.071
I'm sorry. All of this happened because of what I said to you.

105
00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:03.081
What do you mean?

106
00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:06.912
Look at this. I can't even open this lid.

107
00:07:09.782 --> 00:07:11.552
I asked you to protect Hong Joo.

108
00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:12.682
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:15.591
I'm so thankful that you told me about it.

110
00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.001
What will happen to Kang Dae Hee?

111
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:24.461
It won't be easy for him to get out of it.

112
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:26.532
We have evidence that he poisoned his brother to death.

113
00:07:26.532 --> 00:07:28.602
His sister has decided to testify against him in court as well.

114
00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:32.701
Most importantly, the prosecutor in charge is a very reliable man.

115
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.441
Oh, who is he?

116
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:37.441
It's me.

117
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:39.211
Pardon?

118
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:42.052
(Seoul Hangang District Prosecutors' Office)

119
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:45.651
It's mine.

120
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:47.352
- Mr. Choi. - Okay, I heard you.

121
00:07:48.222 --> 00:07:50.761
My gosh, Mr. Jung. Look at your face.

122
00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:52.492
Did that jerk, Kang Dae Hee, punch you?

123
00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:55.762
Well, I didn't exactly get punched. It's just a minor injury,

124
00:07:55.762 --> 00:07:57.932
which I got while trying to overpower him. It's very minor.

125
00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:00.731
Mr. Choi, how can you be totally fine when Mr. Jung got hurt?

126
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:01.932
Didn't you go with him?

127
00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:04.571
I did. I went to the scene with him.

128
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:08.542
He hopped up four steps at a time. How could I keep up with that?

129
00:08:08.642 --> 00:08:10.182
The most I can do is two steps.

130
00:08:10.182 --> 00:08:11.481
Four steps at a time?

131
00:08:12.382 --> 00:08:15.711
I see. I guess it's possible with those long legs of his.

132
00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:17.552
Well, it's...

133
00:08:17.652 --> 00:08:20.621
So? Did you fight that killer all by yourself?

134
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:22.321
That's what I'm saying.

135
00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:25.062
He ran at him fearlessly because he's a fourth-degree black belt.

136
00:08:25.062 --> 00:08:27.361
A fourth-degree black belt? What about you, Mr. Choi?

137
00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:28.892
I have a black belt too.

138
00:08:28.892 --> 00:08:31.802
Every man who served in the military holds a first degree black belt.

139
00:08:33.532 --> 00:08:34.601
A front kick.

140
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.142
A side kick.

141
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.512
Look at this. The angle is just perfect.

142
00:08:40.512 --> 00:08:44.142
Mr. Jung, what's the most important thing in execution of a warrant?

143
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:46.552
Mr. Choi, we can talk about it in private.

144
00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:48.782
No! Please answer my question now.

145
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.052
What is it?

146
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:53.422
Well... Arresting the suspect?

147
00:08:53.422 --> 00:08:55.221
Wrong! Wrong answer.

148
00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.292
Your safety. Arresting the suspect comes after that.

149
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.361
Hey!

150
00:09:02.032 --> 00:09:03.101
That is true,

151
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:05.502
but you shouldn't criticize him for reversing the order.

152
00:09:05.502 --> 00:09:06.502
Right. I agree, sir.

153
00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:10.402
Great job. I didn't know that you did all the work by yourself.

154
00:09:10.402 --> 00:09:11.941
No, Mr. Choi worked hard too.

155
00:09:12.402 --> 00:09:15.672
Great work. My gosh, your arms are rock hard.

156
00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:19.142
Mr. Jung, you have the brains as well as the physical strength.

157
00:09:20.412 --> 00:09:21.451
Keep up the good work.

158
00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:24.552
Both of you are men.

159
00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:26.991
Do you belong to different species?

160
00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:28.951
Thank you for calling me out on that.

161
00:09:29.392 --> 00:09:30.491
I'll remember your advice.

162
00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:33.262
See you later.

163
00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:38.502
When did I call him out?

164
00:09:38.502 --> 00:09:40.471
Was I calling him out? Was I?

165
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:42.772
No, it was an insult.

166
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:44.042
You insulted yourself.

167
00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:46.772
In other words, you dug your own grave.

168
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:48.371
You deserve a kick.

169
00:09:56.182 --> 00:09:57.382
Going up.

170
00:10:08.392 --> 00:10:10.461
Isn't it hard to be a lawyer after working as a prosecutor?

171
00:10:10.932 --> 00:10:13.302
You're obligated to side with wrongdoers, knowing what they did.

172
00:10:13.532 --> 00:10:15.802
I don't think I can do it even if I'm offered millions of dollars.

173
00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:19.542
Don't be so sure.

174
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:22.272
My today may become your tomorrow.

175
00:10:22.272 --> 00:10:23.611
Will you not take Kang Dae Hee's case?

176
00:10:23.782 --> 00:10:25.081
You said you have enough evidence.

177
00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:27.351
Didn't you confiscate the medicine with cyanide...

178
00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:28.912
and also get his sister's statement?

179
00:10:28.912 --> 00:10:31.022
That gives you all the more reason to ask for more money.

180
00:10:34.252 --> 00:10:35.292
I won't take it.

181
00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:39.062
Even if it involves a ton of money,

182
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:41.292
I don't bet on things that I'm not likely to win.

183
00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:43.162
Never.

184
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:45.062
Doors are opening.

185
00:10:51.642 --> 00:10:54.741
Mr. Kang, you're being investigated for murder, attempted murder,

186
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:56.741
personal injury, property damage,

187
00:10:57.012 --> 00:11:00.451
and violating the Animal Protection Act. You're aware of it, right?

188
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.382
You guys are heartless. Can't you at least give me a cup of coffee?

189
00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:06.292
Mr. Kang, you're here as a suspect.

190
00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:09.321
Mister, I guess you don't understand the presumption of innocence.

191
00:11:09.491 --> 00:11:11.892
I get that I'll have to go on trial after your investigation is over,

192
00:11:12.062 --> 00:11:14.861
but I'm considered innocent until the Supreme Court rules me guilty.

193
00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:17.762
You should give up if you're acting like this because of Lawyer Lee.

194
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:19.432
He won't take your case.

195
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.871
The experience of going through the trial...

196
00:11:22.272 --> 00:11:24.241
has almost turned me into a legal expert.

197
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:27.371
Article 12 Section 4 of the Constitution...

198
00:11:27.512 --> 00:11:30.211
states that any person who is arrested or detained...

199
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:34.052
shall have the right to prompt assistance of counsel.

200
00:11:34.182 --> 00:11:36.522
The Constitution grants me the right to hire Lawyer Lee.

201
00:11:36.522 --> 00:11:38.782
I mean, you guys know the law inside out.

202
00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.652
Why are you trying to hinder our relationship?

203
00:11:40.652 --> 00:11:42.252
Article 12 Section 4 of the Constitution.

204
00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:45.892
"When a criminal defendant is unable to secure counsel himself,"

205
00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:48.731
"the State shall assign counsel for the defendant as prescribed by Act."

206
00:11:51.302 --> 00:11:52.971
I think that applies to you.

207
00:11:53.302 --> 00:11:57.341
I'm trying to find a lawyer myself, but you guys keep interfering.

208
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:00.172
Call Lawyer Lee Yu Beom for me. He'll come if I call him!

209
00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:02.642
Lawyer Lee told me...

210
00:12:03.211 --> 00:12:05.611
that he's decided not to take your case...

211
00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:08.481
because he never places bets on things that he's not likely to win.

212
00:12:13.022 --> 00:12:14.621
He also asked me to pass this along.

213
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.292
Tell Kang Dae Hee this if you happen to meet him.

214
00:12:19.632 --> 00:12:21.691
"Your barrel is already smashed."

215
00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:23.432
"No matter what you do..."

216
00:12:23.662 --> 00:12:24.932
No matter what you do,

217
00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:27.101
you won't be able to fill it up.

218
00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:31.841
He said you'd know what it means.

219
00:12:33.642 --> 00:12:35.542
- No. - Do you get what it means?

220
00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:36.782
I said I don't.

221
00:12:37.282 --> 00:12:38.882
Well, it sounds like you got the message.

222
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.481
All right then, let's get this investigation started.

223
00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:43.022
Bring Lee Yu Beom.

224
00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:45.782
I said he'll come if I call him. Call him right now!

225
00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:48.191
Hurry up! Bring him here immediately, okay?

226
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:51.062
- Sit down. - Bring him here right now!

227
00:12:51.162 --> 00:12:53.562
Go bring him now. Call him.

228
00:12:53.562 --> 00:12:55.032
- You punk! - Keep it down.

229
00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:58.032
- Stay still. - Bring Lee Yu Beom here right now!

230
00:12:58.262 --> 00:13:00.601
Hey! Let go, you jerk!

231
00:13:00.601 --> 00:13:02.002
- Shut it! - Let go!

232
00:13:09.542 --> 00:13:11.782
Spring flowers will continue to blossom...

233
00:13:11.882 --> 00:13:14.282
until royal azalea flowers come into full bloom in May.

234
00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:16.252
- "SBC News". This was... - When will they cover your case?

235
00:13:16.552 --> 00:13:17.752
- It'll be on soon. - A man...

236
00:13:17.752 --> 00:13:18.981
who was tried for killing his brother...

237
00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:20.721
- Oh, it's on now. - to get an insurance payout...

238
00:13:20.922 --> 00:13:24.121
got arrested again on the day he was acquitted.

239
00:13:24.392 --> 00:13:25.691
Reporter Nam Hong Joo has more details.

240
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:26.831
My gosh, it's Hong Joo.

241
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:29.601
A residential area in Sangku-dong, Hangang-gu, Seoul.

242
00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:31.902
Stray cats that died from poisoning...

243
00:13:31.902 --> 00:13:36.002
have been found frequently all over this area since January.

244
00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:39.841
The suspect is a 37-year-old man who runs a fried chicken restaurant.

245
00:13:40.371 --> 00:13:42.571
He was previously tried for staging a car accident...

246
00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:46.481
and killing his own brother in order to obtain an insurance payout...

247
00:13:46.682 --> 00:13:49.882
but was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

248
00:13:50.052 --> 00:13:51.752
However, the prosecution has revealed...

249
00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:54.351
that he put the cyanide he used to kill the stray cats...

250
00:13:54.351 --> 00:13:57.591
in his brother's herbal medicine in order to kill him.

251
00:13:57.691 --> 00:13:59.932
Then he staged a car accident and received...

252
00:13:59.932 --> 00:14:02.632
an insurance payout of 2.7 million dollars.

253
00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:04.802
The prosecution has arrested him again.

254
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.331
The traces left...

255
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:08.871
- by the dead stray cats... - Goodness.

256
00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.172
served as crucial evidence that allowed the prosecution...

257
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:13.241
to arrest the suspect again after his acquittal.

258
00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:15.441
This was Reporter Nam Hong Joo of "SBC News".

259
00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:18.882
You're not happy with it? You look like you think it's unfair.

260
00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:23.481
Tell me. What's so unfair?

261
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:27.491
It's totally spoiled.

262
00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.022
What? Your beer?

263
00:14:29.022 --> 00:14:30.262
No, you spoiled it.

264
00:14:30.422 --> 00:14:31.762
What are you saying?

265
00:14:34.491 --> 00:14:36.662
The victim, Kang Byung Hee, who's also the defendant's brother,

266
00:14:37.132 --> 00:14:40.302
worked as a courier during the day and as a relief driver at night.

267
00:14:40.471 --> 00:14:42.731
He bought his brother's birthday gift with his hard-earned money,

268
00:14:42.871 --> 00:14:45.941
and being able to give his sister an allowance made him happy.

269
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:50.711
Blinded by his greed for money, the defendant robbed his brother...

270
00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:54.152
of all the happiness and joy, which he rightfully deserved.

271
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:59.152
Even though he committed one of the gravest crimes,

272
00:14:59.252 --> 00:15:01.991
the defendant shed fake tears right in front of the victim's body...

273
00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:03.562
and deceived the investigators.

274
00:15:03.562 --> 00:15:06.292
He hasn't even expressed any remorse for what he did.

275
00:15:07.831 --> 00:15:11.101
Ergo, I do not think that separating him from society indefinitely...

276
00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:12.932
is too heavy of a punishment.

277
00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:17.201
Please sentence the defendant...

278
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:19.441
to life imprisonment, Your Honor.

279
00:15:31.882 --> 00:15:39.731
(Episode 13: The Secret That Can't Be Told)

280
00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:48.101
(Give credit to others and blame yourself.)

281
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:50.542
It would've been absolutely horrible.

282
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:52.441
Thanks to Mr. Jung, we were able to prevent it.

283
00:15:53.471 --> 00:15:56.382
Mr. Jung should take all the credit.

284
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:58.741
I know that he's not here now, but we should applaud him.

285
00:16:00.912 --> 00:16:03.851
And I'll take all the blame...

286
00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.321
for acquitting Kang Dae Hee.

287
00:16:05.922 --> 00:16:08.321
Even though I'm fully aware of how careless Mr. Lee can be,

288
00:16:08.392 --> 00:16:12.091
I didn't double-check everything when we were doing the postmortem.

289
00:16:13.062 --> 00:16:14.432
I've always known...

290
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.101
that Ms. Shin's arrogance would get us in trouble someday.

291
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.532
What was I thinking letting her be in charge of such a big case?

292
00:16:19.871 --> 00:16:22.331
It is all my fault.

293
00:16:22.632 --> 00:16:24.672
No, it's my fault.

294
00:16:24.971 --> 00:16:27.212
I should've checked everything more carefully as a senior prosecutor.

295
00:16:27.212 --> 00:16:30.312
No, I should've paid more attention as her direct supervisor.

296
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:31.742
It's my fault.

297
00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:34.812
Yes, I also think that it's your fault.

298
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:44.992
Are you saying that you're not responsible for it at all?

299
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:48.492
That's right. Had you taken care of the autopsy properly,

300
00:16:48.492 --> 00:16:50.032
Kang Dae Hee wouldn't have been acquitted.

301
00:16:50.032 --> 00:16:51.901
What's the matter? What's going on?

302
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:54.831
Right, I don't have any excuses for that.

303
00:16:55.071 --> 00:16:57.972
But you were the prosecutor-in-charge.

304
00:16:58.302 --> 00:17:00.472
Why didn't you notice the medicine pouch while searching his place?

305
00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:01.611
Had you found it...

306
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:03.812
I would've confiscated it had you concluded...

307
00:17:03.812 --> 00:17:06.252
from the autopsy that the cause of death was poisoning.

308
00:17:06.252 --> 00:17:08.851
You concluded that it was caused by a traffic accident,

309
00:17:08.851 --> 00:17:11.851
so I was obviously only looking for evidence that would match it.

310
00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:13.022
I never said I'm in the right!

311
00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:17.522
I know that I made a mistake, but you're also responsible for it!

312
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:19.831
A police officer got stabbed because of us.

313
00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.792
There could've been an additional victim.

314
00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:23.232
Doesn't it scare you at all?

315
00:17:23.732 --> 00:17:25.631
My hands are still trembling from the fear.

316
00:17:26.302 --> 00:17:27.371
Not at all.

317
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.802
Even if something like that happened,

318
00:17:29.942 --> 00:17:31.841
it wouldn't be my fault.

319
00:17:33.012 --> 00:17:34.242
It's your fault.

320
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:42.351
My gosh!

321
00:17:55.762 --> 00:17:56.901
You stay here.

322
00:17:56.901 --> 00:17:59.431
Call the police if anything happens, okay?

323
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:06.242
Run away.

324
00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:26.361
Be careful.

325
00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:29.232
Gosh, she keeps running around.

326
00:18:29.232 --> 00:18:32.032
(Youngdeok Crab)

327
00:18:33.732 --> 00:18:35.401
Why are you calling me at this hour?

328
00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:37.042
Where are you?

329
00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:38.841
Why do you ask?

330
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:41.042
I promised you that I'd take you to work every day.

331
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:44.841
I'm at the police station now.

332
00:18:45.212 --> 00:18:46.812
I need to stay here for a few days.

333
00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:50.282
Oh, okay. I'll send it right away!

334
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.992
Sorry, I'm so busy that I don't even have time to be scared these days.

335
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:57.321
So, you don't need to take me to work...

337
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:12.202
Is this the police station?

338
00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:13.841
Are you camping out in this park or what?

339
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:15.841
And where's your colleague?

340
00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:31.022
Well, how did you know that I'd be here?

341
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:34.861
I had a dream. I saw you beating yourself up here alone...

342
00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:36.202
and crying, looking all ugly.

343
00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.502
I cried?

344
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:44.242
Me? Ugly?

345
00:19:44.472 --> 00:19:47.571
Gosh, you have quite the imagination.

346
00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:50.782
How can you have such a ridiculous dream?

347
00:19:58.022 --> 00:20:01.052
Stop crying. You'll fill yourself up with snot in no time at this rate.

348
00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:03.562
Gosh, please!

349
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.692
Do you think that Woo Tak got injured because of you?

350
00:20:10.631 --> 00:20:14.202
"Had I not told him about the fried chicken place..."

351
00:20:14.202 --> 00:20:15.532
You must be beating yourself up like that.

352
00:20:16.302 --> 00:20:18.042
I can't even sleep...

353
00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:20.141
because of that thought.

354
00:20:25.942 --> 00:20:28.911
Then I should wail and have a sleepless night every single day.

355
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:33.792
I'm also hugely indebted to Woo Tak.

356
00:20:34.121 --> 00:20:35.851
What do you owe him?

357
00:20:36.692 --> 00:20:38.121
My debt is bigger than yours.

358
00:20:38.492 --> 00:20:40.131
I'm beating myself up too.

359
00:20:40.232 --> 00:20:42.931
You look totally at ease for someone who's beating himself up.

360
00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:44.262
How can you be like that?

361
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:47.671
I tried putting myself in his shoes.

362
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.331
If I were him,

363
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:51.601
I wouldn't want to boast about the injury,

364
00:20:51.601 --> 00:20:52.911
and I wouldn't resent us either.

365
00:20:53.772 --> 00:20:54.772
Rather,

366
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:57.812
he was probably glad to see that you're okay.

367
00:20:57.812 --> 00:20:59.512
It must've been a relief to him.

368
00:21:03.752 --> 00:21:06.651
So, don't cry too much.

369
00:21:34.111 --> 00:21:35.581
Don't beat yourself up for too long.

370
00:21:36.012 --> 00:21:37.851
But never forget what happened.

371
00:21:39.052 --> 00:21:40.452
Only then, you can fully repay him.

372
00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:47.361
- Hello. - You can't go in now.

373
00:21:47.532 --> 00:21:48.962
- I have to go in. - Go this way.

374
00:21:48.962 --> 00:21:50.802
Off you go. Let's go.

375
00:21:51.262 --> 00:21:53.272
Let's go! Go on.

376
00:21:53.702 --> 00:21:54.871
Go.

(Investigating, do not disturb)

378
00:21:56.002 --> 00:21:57.502
Regrets are pointless.

379
00:21:57.671 --> 00:21:59.141
There's no use in crying over spilled milk.

380
00:22:00.141 --> 00:22:03.242
All you can do is slowly fill the glass up again.

381
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:05.712
Time won't flow backward for you, you know.

382
00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:11.022
- Is it from a song or what? - What?

383
00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:14.022
It doesn't sound like something you'd say.

384
00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:16.121
You're copying what someone else said, right?

385
00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:19.792
You're good.

386
00:22:23.262 --> 00:22:24.931
I manipulated my report cards.

387
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:29.101
Gosh, you punk. Why did you lie about your grades?

388
00:22:32.542 --> 00:22:34.671
- Chief. - Gosh, Chief.

389
00:22:45.952 --> 00:22:47.022
Hey.

390
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:49.861
Chief Jung's son.

391
00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:52.621
What's your name?

392
00:22:55.262 --> 00:22:56.802
Why do you need to know my name?

393
00:22:59.062 --> 00:23:00.101
Are you crying?

394
00:23:01.002 --> 00:23:02.171
No, I'm not.

395
00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:06.171
Hey, wipe your nose first.

396
00:23:09.841 --> 00:23:12.542
It'd be amazing if time could flow backward, but what can you do?

397
00:23:13.052 --> 00:23:14.552
There's no use in crying over spilled milk.

398
00:23:19.452 --> 00:23:20.792
You have a lot of time.

399
00:23:21.022 --> 00:23:23.262
You can fill up the glass again slowly.

400
00:23:24.522 --> 00:23:25.992
Then there will come a time...

401
00:23:26.692 --> 00:23:28.462
when your dad is no longer disappointed in you.

402
00:23:29.732 --> 00:23:32.002
So, don't cry too much.

403
00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:33.901
Don't beat yourself up for too long.

404
00:23:35.302 --> 00:23:36.942
But never forget what happened.

405
00:23:37.942 --> 00:23:39.002
Got it?

406
00:23:52.351 --> 00:23:55.391
It's what someone told me a long time ago.

407
00:23:55.391 --> 00:23:56.621
I knew it.

408
00:23:57.891 --> 00:23:58.921
Who was it?

409
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:01.292
I don't know. I don't even remember his name.

410
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:04.202
Anyway, did it make you feel better?

411
00:24:12.071 --> 00:24:13.312
Can I lean on you?

412
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:28.722
"Don't cry too much."

413
00:24:30.192 --> 00:24:31.861
"Don't beat yourself up for too long."

414
00:24:34.462 --> 00:24:37.101
"But never forget what happened."

415
00:24:38.802 --> 00:24:40.802
At that moment, I couldn't even imagine...

416
00:24:42.841 --> 00:24:44.802
that those warm comforting words...

417
00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:48.371
would be remembered...

418
00:24:49.242 --> 00:24:51.012
as someone's last words one day.

419
00:25:14.671 --> 00:25:15.671
Have some of this.

420
00:25:18.502 --> 00:25:19.942
Thank you.

421
00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:22.982
I think it's fixed. Could you check to see if it's working now?

422
00:25:23.141 --> 00:25:24.181
Sure.

423

(2016 Rio Olympics Full Schedule)

424

Yes, it's working now.

425
00:25:34.022 --> 00:25:36.421
Did I do something to lose the connection?

426
00:25:36.421 --> 00:25:38.722
It looks like one of your neighbors touched the wrong cable.

427
00:25:43.931 --> 00:25:47.831
Miss, the customer service rating is very important to us.

428
00:25:48.702 --> 00:25:51.571
Please put in a good word for me when you receive the survey call.

429
00:25:52.171 --> 00:25:53.171
Sure.

430
00:25:53.171 --> 00:25:57.911
Then do you mind taking those boxes out to the recycling area?

431
00:25:58.042 --> 00:25:59.881
There are too many of them.

432
00:25:59.952 --> 00:26:04.121
I'll tell her to rate your customer service 10 out of 10.

433
00:26:04.722 --> 00:26:07.222
No, it's okay. I'll take them out. Please don't worry about it.

434
00:26:07.222 --> 00:26:09.022
No, I'll take them out.

435
00:26:09.052 --> 00:26:10.361
I'm heading out anyway.

436
00:26:15.631 --> 00:26:18.861
Miss, please put in a good word for me.

437
00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:19.901
Of course.

438
00:26:20.472 --> 00:26:22.431
- Goodbye. - Take care.

439
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:23.802
- You too. - Goodbye.

445
00:26:58.972 --> 00:27:01.071
You can check out this afternoon.

446
00:27:01.071 --> 00:27:03.012
Please go to Administration to pay your bills.

447
00:27:03.341 --> 00:27:04.341
Sure.

448
00:27:06.782 --> 00:27:08.381
I verified it.

449
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:10.581
Hong Joo, what about the dashboard camera?

450
00:27:11.081 --> 00:27:13.091
I heard that it's already been submitted to the police.

451
00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:15.821
Things will be complicated without it.

452
00:27:15.821 --> 00:27:17.121
Get your hands on it at all costs.

453
00:27:17.121 --> 00:27:18.121
Okay.

454
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:26.702
Hong Joo, I'll be checking out of the hospital in a bit. Can you come?

455
00:27:30.371 --> 00:27:32.341
Du Hyun, I have to leave early today.

456
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:34.012
- Okay. - And I'll do everything I can...

457
00:27:34.012 --> 00:27:36.442
to get the dashboard camera footage.

458
00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:38.012
What did you say? Hey!

459
00:27:38.242 --> 00:27:40.452
Hey, Hong Joo. Where are you going?

460
00:27:40.452 --> 00:27:41.482
Hong Joo!

461
00:27:42.552 --> 00:27:43.881
How can she be so gutsy?

462
00:27:44.552 --> 00:27:45.651
Is her brain not working?

463
00:27:47.552 --> 00:27:49.222
She must've lost her mind.

464
00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:56.631
Oh, my. You're ripped.

465
00:27:56.861 --> 00:27:58.732
All police officers are as fit as I am.

466
00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:01.732
That colleague of yours is an exception though.

467
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:03.571
Woo Tak!

468
00:28:04.742 --> 00:28:06.171
Oh, gosh!

469
00:28:09.911 --> 00:28:11.411
Don't you know how to knock?

470
00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:12.742
You're here too, Jae Chan.

471
00:28:14.982 --> 00:28:17.022
Why are you covering him? Let me see it too.

472
00:28:17.022 --> 00:28:18.252
See what?

473
00:28:18.252 --> 00:28:19.421
Hurry up, will you?

474
00:28:19.651 --> 00:28:21.321
Turn around, and look elsewhere.

475
00:28:23.321 --> 00:28:24.562
- Goodness. - Are you okay?

476
00:28:24.562 --> 00:28:26.091
- Can you be discharged? - Yes.

477
00:28:26.732 --> 00:28:29.661
Hong Joo, can I stay at your place for a few days?

478
00:28:29.661 --> 00:28:30.732
Why?

479
00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:35.532
Why does it have to be her place?

480
00:28:35.532 --> 00:28:39.242
Oh, my doctor said I should stay at home and try to recuperate,

481
00:28:39.242 --> 00:28:40.712
but I can't really do that alone.

482
00:28:40.742 --> 00:28:42.641
I don't want to go to my parents' place either.

483
00:28:43.111 --> 00:28:45.282
Is their place very far? Shall I give you a ride?

484
00:28:45.282 --> 00:28:48.052
It's not that. I'm a third-generation only son.

485
00:28:48.552 --> 00:28:52.081
When I was a kid, a persimmon fell on my head.

486
00:28:52.282 --> 00:28:55.621
My parents cut down all persimmon trees in the area right away.

487
00:28:55.952 --> 00:28:58.161
Before joining the force, I even had to write a pledge that I'd quit...

488
00:28:58.161 --> 00:28:59.631
if I ever get injured.

489
00:28:59.692 --> 00:29:02.391
If they find out, I'll have to write a letter of resignation.

490
00:29:02.762 --> 00:29:03.762
Please help me out.

491
00:29:03.762 --> 00:29:05.831
Sure thing. Thanks for asking me.

492
00:29:05.931 --> 00:29:08.272
You're welcome to stay at my place.

493
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:12.472
I have a favor to ask of you as well, Jae Chan.

494
00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:23.151
What happened?

495
00:29:23.252 --> 00:29:25.022
Jae Chan, Jae Chan!

496
00:29:30.192 --> 00:29:31.292
Who are you?

497
00:29:31.522 --> 00:29:33.232
I called Jae Chan, not you!

498
00:29:35.835 --> 00:29:39.335
(Episode 14 will air shortly.)
