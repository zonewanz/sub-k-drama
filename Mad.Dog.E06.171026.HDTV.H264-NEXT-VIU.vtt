(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:15.958
Mr. Choi, the burn phone started to move.

4
00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:18.089
It's moving quite fast. I think he's in a car.

5
00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:20.258
- How far is it? - 2.3km ahead of you.

6
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.429
2.2km now. Getting closer.

7
00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.699
You're at two kilometers. Step on it.

8
00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:31.669
He's stepping on it too.

9
00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.939
(Gohang Farm)

10
00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:43.148
Why did you stop? What's going on?

11
00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:52.428
Kim Min Joon!

12
00:00:56.998 --> 00:00:59.229
Kim Min Joon! Kim Min Joon!

13
00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.068
Stay with me. Stay with me!

14
00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:10.009
Kim Min Joon! Kim Min Joon!

15
00:01:34.438 --> 00:01:36.199
Kim Min Joon. Kim Min Joon.

16
00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:38.009
Stay with me.

17
00:01:47.778 --> 00:01:48.849
Bum Joon...

18
00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:14.678
Kang Woo!

19
00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:16.779
Mr. Choi!

20
00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:19.749
Are you all right?

21
00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.928
(Mad Dog)

22
00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:34.259
(Episode 6)

23
00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:44.409
Who's that?

24
00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.409
Hey, why did you come?

25
00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.048
What happened?

26
00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:55.419
They'll do an autopsy, but she's completely burnt,

27
00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.678
so I doubt we'll find anything.

28
00:02:58.148 --> 00:02:59.919
Can I take just one look at her?

29
00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:02.759
Hey, they're already suspicious enough of you.

30
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.229
Do you want to get blamed for this?

31
00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.868
Why didn't you tell me about Bum Joon's brother?

32
00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:14.039
Am I even your friend?

33
00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:16.638
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:22.638
Maybe that kid did this with Ko Jin Chul.

35
00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:24.749
She's the woman that made those 3.4 million dollars.

36
00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.849
His brother wouldn't have crashed the plane...

37
00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.379
if it hadn't been for that money.

38
00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.088
Wait, do you trust him?

39
00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.858
I have no idea what I should trust.

40
00:03:41.828 --> 00:03:42.999
Hey, your hand...

41
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.699
I'm fine.

42
00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:51.669
Your boyfriend will be fine.

43
00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.969
Don't worry.

44
00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.138
He's not my boyfriend.

45
00:04:57.368 --> 00:04:59.308
I hope Mr. Choi is fine.

46
00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:20.729
Nothing?

47
00:05:21.128 --> 00:05:22.928
I can understand why the equipment are gone,

48
00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:24.368
but there isn't even a fingerprint left.

49
00:05:24.368 --> 00:05:25.729
But you said you saw something here yesterday.

50
00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:26.829
This makes no sense.

51
00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:29.568
Exactly. How baffling is this?

52
00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.008
What about the farm? The farm...

53
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:35.508
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

54
00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:37.608
Mr. Choi.

55
00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.419
What is this? Why are they all gone?

56
00:05:46.248 --> 00:05:47.488
This place is done and over with.

57
00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:49.219
Let's go.

58
00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.889
Mr. Choi, Ms. Kang's phone had a new voice mail.

59
00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.688
I thought you need to listen to this.

60
00:06:25.628 --> 00:06:29.058
Eun Joo, this is Ha Seong.

61
00:06:29.858 --> 00:06:34.139
My mom told me to tell you we'll be there soon,

62
00:06:34.298 --> 00:06:35.839
but she won't come.

63
00:06:36.238 --> 00:06:38.238
She's gone.

64
00:06:38.608 --> 00:06:41.008
Can you come and pick me up?

65
00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.128
Ms. Kang.

66
00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:17.548
Mr. Choi.

67
00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:21.719
Can we talk for a minute?

68
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.019
Ms. Lee Mi Ran is dead.

69
00:07:35.358 --> 00:07:38.498
This man. He's the killer.

70
00:07:38.998 --> 00:07:40.238
Do you know him?

71
00:07:41.698 --> 00:07:42.938
He's the guy who found...

72
00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.938
the body to replace Mi Ran two years ago.

73
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:50.248
Why did Ms. Lee do that?

74
00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:52.508
Why did she fake her death?

75
00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:55.248
She said she was scared.

76
00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:57.818
She felt like someone was after her.

77
00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:00.988
I don't know anything more than that.

78
00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:03.758
No matter how much I asked, she didn't tell me.

79
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:05.089
At that time,

80
00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:08.058
I really didn't understand her either.

81
00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:10.498
Then why did you help her?

82
00:08:11.128 --> 00:08:15.339
Aren't you the one who said the body was Ms. Lee?

83
00:08:16.198 --> 00:08:17.639
She was a family.

84
00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:20.068
We weren't related by blood,

85
00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:22.678
but we were...

86
00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:25.479
a family.

87
00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:28.979
We promised...

88
00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:32.948
we won't bring up Ha Seong in loneliness like us.

89
00:08:33.859 --> 00:08:35.259
How old is he?

90
00:08:35.489 --> 00:08:36.889
He's 11 years old.

91
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.298
Ha Seong is all alone now.

92
00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:43.968
He's not alone.

93
00:08:45.298 --> 00:08:48.438
He has you, Ms. Kang.

94
00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:50.739
Thank you,

95
00:08:51.968 --> 00:08:53.068
Mr. Choi.

96
00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:57.509
There's no sign of a brain hemorrhage,

97
00:08:57.779 --> 00:08:59.249
but since he's still unconscious,

98
00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:02.119
we can only be sure once he wakes up.

99
00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:04.448
Then when will he wake up?

100
00:09:05.489 --> 00:09:08.289
I don't know. We'll have to wait.

101
00:09:20.098 --> 00:09:22.769
Hey. You need to wake up quickly.

102
00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:31.609
Are you here by yourself?

103
00:09:42.088 --> 00:09:43.629
Kim Min Joon?

104
00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:58.169
My name is Kim Bum Joon.

105
00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:01.678
Are you my brother?

106
00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:05.749
I'm a pilot.

107
00:10:06.478 --> 00:10:10.818
I've been coming to Germany for six years...

108
00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:12.718
to find my brother.

109
00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:16.318
Min Joon, it's me.

110
00:10:18.359 --> 00:10:19.728
Get lost, you jerk.

111
00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:22.759
Min Joon.

112
00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:31.169
Min Joon.

113
00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:33.139
Bum Joon.

114
00:10:36.078 --> 00:10:38.249
Kim Min Joon!

115
00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:40.948
Stay with me!

116
00:10:41.178 --> 00:10:43.279
Min Joon.

117
00:10:43.718 --> 00:10:44.848
Stay with me.

118
00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:57.428
Ha Ri.

119
00:10:59.298 --> 00:11:00.899
I'll call the doctor.

120
00:11:01.468 --> 00:11:02.598
Don't.

121
00:11:03.568 --> 00:11:04.769
What are you doing?

122
00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.269
Let's go.

123
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:07.308
What are you doing?

124
00:11:07.308 --> 00:11:09.178
You've been unconscious for a day.

125
00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.379
I had a good sleep after a long while.

126
00:11:11.808 --> 00:11:12.808
Turn around.

127
00:11:14.249 --> 00:11:15.448
Don't do this.

128
00:11:15.448 --> 00:11:16.818
You should have tests first.

129
00:11:16.818 --> 00:11:18.489
Are you worried about me?

130
00:11:20.558 --> 00:11:22.188
That feels nice.

131
00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:26.058
You seem fine.

132
00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:27.828
I'll wait for you outside.

133
00:11:36.938 --> 00:11:38.169
Are you hurt?

134
00:11:38.568 --> 00:11:39.769
Did something happen?

135
00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:41.978
It's not my blood. It's yours.

136
00:11:42.838 --> 00:11:43.879
Why...

137
00:11:44.249 --> 00:11:46.409
is my blood on your jacket?

138
00:11:46.808 --> 00:11:48.749
You don't need to know. Let's go.

139
00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:50.289
Mr. Choi is waiting.

140
00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:53.759
Go easy on me. I'm a patient.

141
00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.458
Easy, please.

142
00:12:10.068 --> 00:12:12.639
What's this? Are you interrogating me?

143
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:13.938
Yes, we are.

144
00:12:14.838 --> 00:12:17.708
How do you know Ko Jin Chul?

145
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.109
Who's Ko Jin Chul?

146
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:33.529
The one who tried to kill you and Lee Mi Ran.

147
00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:35.499
He was after you first.

148
00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:38.869
He chased after you and got Lee Mi Ran.

149
00:12:39.428 --> 00:12:41.798
He was after me first? Why?

150
00:12:42.438 --> 00:12:43.708
Who is he?

151
00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:48.379
Where is he now?

152
00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.509
Did you lose him?

153
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:52.509
Yes.

154
00:12:52.808 --> 00:12:54.548
We lost him while saving you.

155
00:12:56.548 --> 00:12:57.718
Mr. Choi.

156
00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:00.259
Are you out of your mind?

157
00:13:00.859 --> 00:13:03.529
You should've gone after him.

158
00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:04.889
You should've caught him and found out...

159
00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:06.289
who made him do it.

160
00:13:06.289 --> 00:13:07.529
What if I did?

161
00:13:08.098 --> 00:13:10.399
Do you think we can verify that Bum Joon's...

162
00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.928
crash wasn't suicidal?

163
00:13:13.068 --> 00:13:14.639
Is that what you want?

164
00:13:15.298 --> 00:13:19.208
That Bum Joon did not crash the plane.

165
00:13:27.948 --> 00:13:29.178
It's too bad though.

166
00:13:29.548 --> 00:13:31.548
There is proof everywhere that...

167
00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:33.289
Bum Joon did it.

168
00:13:33.289 --> 00:13:34.558
What proof?

169
00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:38.058
The proof you believed for the past two years?

170
00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:39.659
I'm not like you.

171
00:13:39.928 --> 00:13:41.428
I don't believe such things.

172
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.068
I saw how Lee Mi Ran was alive with my own eyes.

173
00:13:44.068 --> 00:13:47.298
That proves that Bum Joon didn't crash the plane.

174
00:13:47.298 --> 00:13:49.899
Did you see her alive? Did you?

175
00:13:50.369 --> 00:13:53.039
So did Lee Mi Ran tell you...

176
00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:56.039
that it wasn't a suicidal crash?

177
00:13:56.978 --> 00:13:59.649
He must've killed himself because he wanted to...

178
00:13:59.649 --> 00:14:01.249
give you the 3.4 million dollars.

179
00:14:01.678 --> 00:14:03.279
That's what I thought.

180
00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:05.548
You didn't hear her say that.

181
00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:08.318
But why do you...

182
00:14:08.318 --> 00:14:11.228
still have your head up high?

183
00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:13.759
What is it that you know?

184
00:14:18.968 --> 00:14:21.039
You know how much your life is worth now?

185
00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.509
They offered a million dollars.

186
00:14:25.568 --> 00:14:27.509
"They offered a million dollars."

187
00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:28.938
What?

188
00:14:28.938 --> 00:14:30.609
He said someone offered...

189
00:14:30.609 --> 00:14:32.609
a million dollars for Lee Mi Ran's life.

190
00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:35.178
Think about it.

191
00:14:35.678 --> 00:14:38.619
Who can pay a million dollars...

192
00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:39.848
for a person's life?

193
00:14:40.818 --> 00:14:42.088
Juhan Air?

194
00:14:42.088 --> 00:14:43.928
Or Taeyang Insurance?

195
00:14:45.228 --> 00:14:46.359
What?

196
00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:48.859
Do you wish it wasn't Taeyang Insurance?

197
00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:52.869
Do you still want to trust people?

198
00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:55.169
That's why you believed...

199
00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:57.938
that Bum Joon crashed the plane all along.

200
00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:00.438
But I'm not like you.

201
00:15:00.838 --> 00:15:02.478
I don't trust anything.

202
00:15:05.848 --> 00:15:07.218
I don't trust anyone.

203
00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:10.848
If it wasn't Bum Joon's suicidal crash,

204
00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:12.519
do you think you can trust people?

205
00:15:13.688 --> 00:15:17.159
You've never called him as a "brother", have you?

206
00:15:17.728 --> 00:15:19.359
You just asked me this.

207
00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:20.499
"Do you want to believe..."

208
00:15:20.499 --> 00:15:22.598
"that Bum Joon crashed the plane?"

209
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:26.298
No.

210
00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:30.438
You can never trust anyone.

211
00:15:31.068 --> 00:15:33.739
That's who you are.

212
00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:35.509
Look at you.

213
00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:38.178
You aren't here to clear...

214
00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:39.308
your brother's name.

215
00:15:39.308 --> 00:15:42.279
You're only here for yourself.

216
00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.489
So you want to work hard alone...

217
00:15:46.188 --> 00:15:47.759
like you always have.

218
00:15:48.859 --> 00:15:51.428
All right. Mr. Kim Min Joon.

219
00:15:52.428 --> 00:15:54.828
Go ahead and work alone.

220
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:23.259
Are you here to give me medicine?

221
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:24.629
In your dreams.

222
00:16:24.989 --> 00:16:26.088
What's this?

223
00:16:28.558 --> 00:16:30.899
It's the proof we believed it was a suicidal crash.

224
00:16:31.328 --> 00:16:33.468
Watch the final interview.

225
00:16:33.798 --> 00:16:35.499
Why are you giving this to me?

226
00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:38.468
I want to see if you can keep laughing at us...

227
00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:40.239
after watching this.

228
00:16:46.348 --> 00:16:49.348
According to the investigation done...

229
00:16:49.348 --> 00:16:51.289
by the Aviation Accident Investigation Board,

230
00:16:51.348 --> 00:16:52.919
the crash wasn't due to...

231
00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:54.818
any problems in aircraft.

232
00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:56.759
Then was it a man-made disaster?

233
00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:58.558
Was it the pilot's fault?

234
00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.558
Yes, there is a high possibility.

235
00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:04.198
Assistant Pilot Kim Bum Joon...

236
00:17:04.268 --> 00:17:06.369
usually seemed anxious.

237
00:17:07.198 --> 00:17:08.268
Actually,

238
00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:11.069
he had been taking pills regularly.

239
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.339
I asked him about them,

240
00:17:12.738 --> 00:17:14.738
and he told me they were for depression.

241
00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.879
Before landing,

242
00:17:16.978 --> 00:17:19.379
I went to the bathroom.

243
00:17:20.008 --> 00:17:21.478
It wasn't the right time.

244
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:23.948
I felt the plane descending quickly...

245
00:17:25.448 --> 00:17:27.258
when I was in the bathroom.

246
00:17:28.218 --> 00:17:31.228
Kim Bum Joon, that jerk, steered downward.

247
00:17:31.629 --> 00:17:33.159
I tried to stop him,

248
00:17:33.159 --> 00:17:34.728
but he...

249
00:17:34.728 --> 00:17:36.968
struck my head with a fire extinguisher.

250
00:17:37.228 --> 00:17:38.399
Pilot Shin Ji Woong.

251
00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:41.599
Did Assistant Pilot Kim Bum Joon crash the plane?

252
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:43.198
He was pushing it down.

253
00:17:43.639 --> 00:17:47.339
He was pushing the control wheel down.

254
00:17:48.008 --> 00:17:49.909
Kim Bum Joon was...

255
00:17:50.379 --> 00:17:52.549
crashing the plane.

256
00:17:55.778 --> 00:17:56.778
No.

257
00:17:57.748 --> 00:17:58.819
No.

258
00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:02.889
No!

259
00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.218
Kim Bum Joon was...

260
00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.688
crashing...

261
00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:42.599
the plane.

262
00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.968
I can't do this anymore.

263
00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:48.998
November 14, 2015.

264
00:18:48.998 --> 00:18:51.468
Taeyang Insurance, Flight JH 801,

265
00:18:51.468 --> 00:18:53.678
Park Moo Shin, Claims Examination Team Manager.

266
00:18:53.678 --> 00:18:55.339
We'll end the testimony...

267
00:18:55.938 --> 00:18:57.278
of Pilot Shin Ji Woong.

268
00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:03.419
He said someone offered...

269
00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:05.488
a million dollars for Lee Mi Ran's life.

270
00:19:06.589 --> 00:19:09.518
Who can pay a million dollars...

271
00:19:09.518 --> 00:19:10.728
for a person's life?

272
00:19:11.488 --> 00:19:12.958
Juhan Air?

273
00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.758
Or Taeyang Insurance?

274
00:19:19.869 --> 00:19:21.669
(Death due to a vehicle fire)

275
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:24.768
The face and fingerprints aren't recognizable.

276
00:19:25.639 --> 00:19:27.238
We need to run a DNA test,

277
00:19:27.238 --> 00:19:29.139
or check her teeth.

278
00:19:29.478 --> 00:19:31.579
But she doesn't have any dental records.

279
00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:34.419
Didn't you say she had a son?

280
00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:36.549
You can verify whether it's Lee Mi Ran...

281
00:19:36.819 --> 00:19:39.188
by running a DNA test.

282
00:19:39.188 --> 00:19:40.659
I won't get the kid involved.

283
00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:41.688
It's too dangerous.

284
00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:47.299
So the corpse will remain as unidentified then.

285
00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:50.369
Speaking of which,

286
00:19:50.728 --> 00:19:54.069
I've found unidentified DNA of a man as well.

287
00:19:54.339 --> 00:19:56.038
It was found on the body's incisors.

288
00:19:56.038 --> 00:19:59.609
In other words, the inner part of her front teeth.

289
00:19:59.909 --> 00:20:03.139
I assume she bit the man.

290
00:20:12.619 --> 00:20:16.488
Can I get the DNA of that unidentified man?

291
00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:18.458
You think it's him from two years ago?

292
00:20:18.458 --> 00:20:19.889
I think so.

293
00:20:20.329 --> 00:20:24.399
Shall I go fishing in Daejeon after a while?

294
00:20:24.899 --> 00:20:27.399
There's Gapcheon near the southern hospital branch.

295
00:20:28.069 --> 00:20:30.569
The spot has a lot of skygagers.

296
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:34.008
It stinks whenever you reel one up.

297
00:20:34.508 --> 00:20:37.149
What would you use for its bait?

298
00:20:37.349 --> 00:20:39.079
A live bait will do.

299
00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:50.188
(Born in 1981, Entered Juhan Air in 2007)

304
00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:16.018
Find it.

307
00:21:46.448 --> 00:21:49.119
She's pretty. Director Cha Hong Joo.

309

Min Joon is out.

310
00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:36.528
I'm in.

311
00:22:39.268 --> 00:22:41.399
Where will it be?

312
00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:45.438
Let's guess and find out.

313
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:53.278
They all look nice.

314
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:57.518
How fabulous. My goodness.

315
00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:01.589
Bingo.

316
00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:13.069
What is that?

317
00:23:13.069 --> 00:23:15.099
It's the USIM chip that Kim Min Joon threw away.

318
00:23:15.768 --> 00:23:18.609
Ha Ra found it when she found your cellphone.

319
00:23:18.738 --> 00:23:20.038
What's in there?

320
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:21.938
I don't know.

321
00:23:22.278 --> 00:23:24.809
I'll bet your muscles that he deleted...

322
00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:27.319
- everything in here. - You punk.

323
00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:28.879
Why would you bet my muscles?

324
00:23:29.518 --> 00:23:31.518
Here's Ko Jin Chul's DNA.

325
00:23:33.988 --> 00:23:35.159
What about the bait?

326
00:23:39.488 --> 00:23:42.258
Be careful.

327
00:23:45.928 --> 00:23:47.839
- Okay. - Okay.

328
00:23:47.839 --> 00:23:52.139
Now, let's see who finds Ko Jin Chul first.

329
00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:04.889
- What's this? - Min Joon was wearing...

330
00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:06.549
those clothes when Ko Jin Chul attacked him.

331
00:24:06.718 --> 00:24:08.458
There's Ko Jin Chul's DNA on it.

332
00:24:08.619 --> 00:24:09.859
What are you talking about?

333
00:24:09.958 --> 00:24:12.359
The result might say unidentified,

334
00:24:12.428 --> 00:24:13.899
but you'll confirm it's his DNA...

335
00:24:13.899 --> 00:24:15.899
if you compare it with his family.

336
00:24:20.399 --> 00:24:22.738
Good. I'll get it inspected right away.

337
00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:28.238
Hey. Did something happen to you?

338
00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:34.448

The donor's parents called it off.

340
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:41.788
Well, I'm okay,

341
00:24:42.819 --> 00:24:46.129
but I guess it's difficult for my wife.

342
00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:50.299
I'm sorry. Gosh.

343
00:24:50.428 --> 00:24:52.369
I can't believe I'm crying in front of you.

344
00:24:53.738 --> 00:24:55.069
I'm the one who's sorry.

345
00:25:00.379 --> 00:25:01.409
Han Wu.

346
00:25:03.008 --> 00:25:04.208
Actually...

347
00:25:04.809 --> 00:25:05.809
I know.

348
00:25:07.419 --> 00:25:09.178
You plan to kill Ko Jin Chul, right?

349
00:25:09.178 --> 00:25:11.188
You have no intention to make him get punished.

350
00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:13.589
But I'll catch him before you do.

351
00:25:13.718 --> 00:25:15.258
I won't let you become a murderer.

352
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:17.428
So don't even dream about it.

353
00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:21.228
And make sure you survive.

354
00:25:21.629 --> 00:25:23.059
What nonsense are you talking about?

This is from Kwongeun too.

Han Dong Yoon...

360
00:25:42.248 --> 00:25:44.889
It sounds familiar. Where did I hear it?

361
00:25:45.819 --> 00:25:47.419
5.1 million dollars in Yeongwol 2 years ago.

362

The hospital director's name was Han Dong Yoon.

How much is it this time?

364
00:25:55.728 --> 00:25:58.228
I told you not to butt in our company's business.

365

Why are you here again?

366
00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:01.569
Kim Min Joon.

367
00:26:02.498 --> 00:26:06.669
Should I say Jan Gebauer to help you recognize him?

368
00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:09.708
Kim Bum Joon's younger brother has appeared.

369
00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:11.278

He doesn't believe...

372
00:26:17.089 --> 00:26:19.288
Kim Bum Joon caused the JH 801 incident.

373
00:26:20.688 --> 00:26:22.218
What gibberish is that?

374
00:26:22.419 --> 00:26:24.559
I was the manager of the team in charge of it.

375
00:26:25.129 --> 00:26:26.899
It's certain he crashed the plane on purpose.

376
00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:28.099
You accepted it too.

377
00:26:28.698 --> 00:26:29.799
What's this?

378
00:26:31.268 --> 00:26:32.599
Are you denying the fact now?

379
00:26:32.768 --> 00:26:35.869
Ko Jin Chul tried to kill Kim Min Joon.

380
00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:39.309
Why would you bring up his name now?

381
00:26:39.309 --> 00:26:41.609
Isn't this ridiculous? I feel the same.

382
00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:45.708
We'll find out once we catch Ko Jin Chul.

383
00:26:46.409 --> 00:26:48.718
I got his DNA.

384
00:26:49.579 --> 00:26:52.248
I have proof, so I'll catch him myself.

385
00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:55.488
No, you and your entire team, stay out of it.

386
00:26:55.688 --> 00:26:56.859
Don't do anything.

387
00:26:56.859 --> 00:26:57.958
Why?

388
00:27:00.698 --> 00:27:02.698
You aren't the only one who remembers Jae Soo.

389
00:27:03.028 --> 00:27:06.228
I'll make sure to catch him legally myself,

390
00:27:06.528 --> 00:27:08.698
so stay out of it.

391
00:27:14.478 --> 00:27:16.008
I can't believe your words.

392
00:27:16.738 --> 00:27:18.849
I'll work hard. You do your part.

393

The dog has smelled it.

396
00:27:42.139 --> 00:27:45.139
Kang Woo has figured out that much?

397
00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:57.389
You used him, so take care of your man yourself.

398
00:28:08.928 --> 00:28:10.698
He'll leave this country after three hours.

399
00:28:10.698 --> 00:28:13.639
He couldn't finish him, and he left trace too.

400
00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:16.968
He wasn't careful and left trace behind.

401
00:28:16.968 --> 00:28:18.708
We just have to send him away then.

402
00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:19.839
Shall I move up the flight time?

403
00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:21.538
That trace will lead to us.

404
00:28:21.538 --> 00:28:22.978
Come to your senses!

405
00:28:27.678 --> 00:28:28.978
It's going to be a waste.

406
00:28:29.748 --> 00:28:31.488
He's such a useful tool.

407
00:28:31.488 --> 00:28:34.619
You call them useful when you can throw out anytime.

408

Clean up the mess if you want your share.

409
00:28:39.988 --> 00:28:41.659
Okay, okay.

410
00:28:44.698 --> 00:28:46.329

412
00:28:56.478 --> 00:28:58.208
I was about to call you anyway.

414
00:28:59.948 --> 00:29:01.849
Get your work done if you want your money.

415
00:29:02.518 --> 00:29:05.188
What do you mean? You told me to fly off here today.

416
00:29:05.589 --> 00:29:07.059
Situations changed.

417
00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:08.218
Finish your work and leave.

It's not good.

419
00:29:10.758 --> 00:29:12.988
Things become messy if they don't go as planned.

420
00:29:12.988 --> 00:29:15.928
My plan got messed up already because of you.

421
00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:17.799
His life is long, so what do you want me to do?

422
00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.829
Then end his life.

423
00:29:21.438 --> 00:29:22.599
Darn it.

424
00:29:25.309 --> 00:29:27.738
Okay. I'll call you after I'm done.

425
00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:38.589
Sir. Mr. Choi Kang Woo is on his way up to see you.

426
00:29:38.889 --> 00:29:40.149
Should I dismiss him?

427
00:29:40.518 --> 00:29:41.619
Kang Woo is here?

428
00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:45.629
Let him in.

429
00:29:56.169 --> 00:29:58.409
I'm sorry I didn't call before I visited.

430
00:29:58.639 --> 00:29:59.809
I'm glad you're here.

431
00:29:59.809 --> 00:30:01.309
Let me get some help from you.

432
00:30:03.038 --> 00:30:04.508
There are a lot of weeds here,

433
00:30:04.508 --> 00:30:05.978
so I could use some help.

434
00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:22.559
Goodness, this is tough.

435
00:30:25.129 --> 00:30:27.299
Do you eat all right?

436
00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:28.468
You look thin.

437
00:30:28.998 --> 00:30:31.369
You look thinner too, Chairman Cha.

438
00:30:32.268 --> 00:30:33.909
That's what happens to an old man.

439
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:36.948
I don't have much appetite because I got old.

440
00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:39.748
But you, you're still young.

441
00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:41.919
Are you so busy that you can't even eat?

442
00:30:42.518 --> 00:30:44.389
I've been working on an unexpected case.

443
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:47.859
Is this related to my company?

444
00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:49.589
I'm not sure yet.

445
00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:51.659
If we're involved in any way,

446
00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:52.988
let me know whenever you need me.

447
00:30:53.488 --> 00:30:55.228
You won't come back when I ask you to,

448
00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.998
and you don't come around when I call you.

449
00:30:57.198 --> 00:30:59.829
I'll give you whatever you want.

450
00:31:00.238 --> 00:31:02.369
You're like one of my own.

451
00:31:16.649 --> 00:31:17.748
When did you arrive?

452
00:31:17.748 --> 00:31:18.948
Five minutes ago.

453
00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:20.218
Where was he before this?

454
00:31:20.218 --> 00:31:22.218
He was at a hair salon for over two hours.

455
00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:31.329
Mr. Kim, looking sharp.

456
00:31:41.038 --> 00:31:42.208
Did he just bump his wrist?

457
00:31:42.208 --> 00:31:43.948
What's he doing?

458
00:31:45.178 --> 00:31:46.609
Darn it.

459
00:31:54.518 --> 00:31:55.889
Are you hurt?

460
00:31:56.589 --> 00:31:58.228
A bit, I guess.

461
00:31:58.829 --> 00:32:00.458
I have a dash cam in my car.

462
00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:01.799
Do you want to watch it?

463
00:32:01.829 --> 00:32:03.228
Why would I want to watch that?

464
00:32:03.428 --> 00:32:06.099
Do you think I bumped into your car on purpose?

465
00:32:06.099 --> 00:32:07.268
Didn't you?

466
00:32:10.238 --> 00:32:11.938

(Cha Hong Joo, Executive Director)

469
00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:21.518
This is great.

470
00:32:21.819 --> 00:32:23.748
Since you're a director of an insurance company,

471
00:32:24.288 --> 00:32:25.389
you would know what this is.

472
00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.889
I'll treat the wrist myself.

473
00:32:30.859 --> 00:32:32.329
Just fix this for me.

474
00:32:32.589 --> 00:32:34.359
Wait, what are you doing?

475
00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:36.528
Your mind is all complicated,

476
00:32:36.528 --> 00:32:38.329
wondering if this is real or fake, right?

477
00:32:38.428 --> 00:32:39.998
You should check for yourself.

478
00:32:40.569 --> 00:32:41.738
I'll call you.

479
00:32:42.738 --> 00:32:45.609
That's a precious watch my brother gave me,

480
00:32:45.609 --> 00:32:46.978
so you don't lose it.

481
00:32:48.538 --> 00:32:49.809
Excuse me!

482
00:32:52.649 --> 00:32:54.678
Why is he approaching Director Cha?

483
00:32:54.678 --> 00:32:56.619
We'll find out in time.

484
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:58.349
Don't lose him.

485
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:20.139
This is my daughter,

I'm Cha Hong Joo.

490
00:33:29.649 --> 00:33:31.419
I heard you'll be...

491
00:33:31.419 --> 00:33:33.889
taking care of all of our cases.

492
00:33:34.619 --> 00:33:36.889
She's probably much better than I am.

493
00:33:37.129 --> 00:33:38.559
She'll do a good job.

494
00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:40.859
I'll look forward to it, Director Kwon.

495
00:33:40.859 --> 00:33:42.758
I'm glad to work with you,

496

497
00:33:45.228 --> 00:33:46.399
I'll get going now.

Kwongeun Foundation...

500
00:33:58.978 --> 00:34:01.419
will ask for about two million dollars.

501
00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:03.119
Give it to them without asking questions.

502
00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:06.349
Why? You wanted to know everything.

503
00:34:06.349 --> 00:34:07.659
Don't you want that anymore?

504
00:34:08.658 --> 00:34:09.759
It's not that.

505
00:34:09.759 --> 00:34:12.029
Did you think you can only do the clean things?

506
00:34:12.658 --> 00:34:14.629
You'll have to jump into filthy water...

507
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:16.429
and jump into a pond of mud too.

508
00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.828
I know.

509
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:19.969
I'll process it as you said.

510
00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.339
Hong Joo.

511
00:34:26.408 --> 00:34:28.938
Never mind. Keep it up.

512
00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:34.578
I'll do my best, Chairman Cha.

513
00:34:41.618 --> 00:34:42.618
Hello.

514
00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:46.129
I'm Kim Min Joon,

515
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:47.299
the victim of the minor collision.

516
00:34:47.899 --> 00:34:50.368
I forgot to give you my number.

517
00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:54.598
I made a minor collision in the parking lot.

518
00:34:54.598 --> 00:34:55.868
Check the dash cam,

519
00:34:55.868 --> 00:34:58.138
and let Claims Examination Team take the case.

520
00:34:58.239 --> 00:34:59.239
Yes, Director Cha.

521
00:35:05.009 --> 00:35:06.049
(Taeyang Damage Insurance)

522
00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:07.078
(We received your claims request.)

523
00:35:07.348 --> 00:35:08.879
Gosh, I told her that it was a precious watch.

524
00:35:09.949 --> 00:35:12.049
You disappoint me, Ms. Cha.

525
00:35:34.908 --> 00:35:36.308
Mr. Kim is going in.

526
00:36:15.478 --> 00:36:17.149
Director Cha's room?

527
00:36:17.649 --> 00:36:19.149
You came all the way here.

528
00:36:19.149 --> 00:36:21.188
I told you that it was a precious watch.

529
00:36:21.188 --> 00:36:22.618
I was disappointed you treated it that way.

530
00:36:23.529 --> 00:36:24.859
Where's my watch?

531
00:36:32.629 --> 00:36:35.268
The investigation team said it was genuine.

532
00:36:35.598 --> 00:36:36.908
I told you.

533
00:36:36.908 --> 00:36:38.339
I don't lie.

534
00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:40.638
Not something who fakes a collision should say.

535
00:36:40.638 --> 00:36:42.609
Do you have proof that I did it on purpose?

536
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:44.708
An executive director...

537
00:36:44.708 --> 00:36:46.179
of a huge company like Taeyang Insurance...

538
00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:49.049
shouldn't frame an innocent man.

539
00:36:49.978 --> 00:36:51.348
This is why people speak ill...

540
00:36:51.348 --> 00:36:52.489
of insurance companies.

541
00:36:54.489 --> 00:36:55.888
Let's end this quickly.

542
00:36:55.888 --> 00:36:57.058
How much do you want?

543
00:36:57.058 --> 00:36:58.489
I need to see 3.4 million dollars...

544
00:36:58.859 --> 00:36:59.888
What did you say?

545
00:36:59.888 --> 00:37:02.728
worth of the originals of the insurance policy.

546
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:06.598
Tae...

547
00:37:08.038 --> 00:37:09.239
yang...

548
00:37:11.138 --> 00:37:14.408
Insurance.

549
00:37:20.049 --> 00:37:22.748
Insurance...

550
00:37:23.348 --> 00:37:26.049
policy.

551
00:37:27.158 --> 00:37:28.589
Originals.

552
00:37:29.688 --> 00:37:30.828
Find it.

553
00:37:32.828 --> 00:37:34.299
I need to see the originals...

554
00:37:34.299 --> 00:37:36.228
of Kim Bum Joon's insurance policies.

555
00:37:36.868 --> 00:37:37.868
You are...

556
00:37:37.868 --> 00:37:39.969
I'm Kim Bum Joon's brother, Jan Gebauer,

557
00:37:39.969 --> 00:37:41.169
Kim Min Joon.

558
00:37:43.038 --> 00:37:45.708
I heard Contract Screening Team keeps the originals.

559
00:37:46.708 --> 00:37:48.078
You'll need more than a minute, right?

560
00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:49.938
How about five minutes?

561
00:37:51.408 --> 00:37:52.908
How would I know...

562
00:37:52.908 --> 00:37:55.078
if you're really Jan Gebauer?

563
00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:12.868
Even if you're his brother and the beneficiary,

564
00:38:12.868 --> 00:38:14.438
you cannot view the originals...

565
00:38:14.438 --> 00:38:16.498
without the permission of the insured.

566
00:38:16.768 --> 00:38:19.538
And the insured, Kim Bum Joon is dead.

567
00:38:20.408 --> 00:38:23.208
Exactly. And you are...

568
00:38:23.408 --> 00:38:25.179
indebted to me.

569
00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:26.549
And you can pay me back now.

570
00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:28.149
May I pay you back...

571
00:38:28.149 --> 00:38:29.219
with my car insurance?

572
00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:31.449
Isn't it easier to just show me the originals?

573
00:38:31.848 --> 00:38:34.158
You already paid the compensation in full,

574
00:38:34.158 --> 00:38:35.719
and I don't think Taeyang Insurance...

575
00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:37.359
will lose anything from showing me those.

576
00:38:40.089 --> 00:38:43.098
Is there a reason why you can't show me?

577
00:38:43.098 --> 00:38:45.169
Then why would you need to see the originals...

578
00:38:45.169 --> 00:38:46.629
when the compensation was already paid?

579
00:38:46.629 --> 00:38:48.938
I'll tell you if you show me.

580
00:38:52.538 --> 00:38:54.978
Put me through to Contract Screening Team.

581
00:38:54.978 --> 00:38:56.078
Yes, ma'am.

582
00:38:56.808 --> 00:38:58.149
Have some coffee.

583
00:38:58.149 --> 00:38:59.179
Thank you.

584
00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:00.719
What's going on?

585
00:39:01.179 --> 00:39:02.618
She told me to let in...

586
00:39:02.618 --> 00:39:03.819
the Contract Screening Team.

587
00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:06.288
Why would that team need to visit her?

588
00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:07.589
You're right.

589
00:39:16.799 --> 00:39:18.469
(Team Manager Park Moo Shin)

590
00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:21.268
Yes.

591
00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:24.239
Why would she ask?

592
00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:27.739
Okay.

593
00:39:29.009 --> 00:39:30.449
Did she say anything else?

594
00:39:30.449 --> 00:39:31.609
No, nothing.

595
00:39:33.779 --> 00:39:34.779
I'm from the Contract Screening Team.

596
00:39:34.779 --> 00:39:36.018
We brought the originals.

597
00:39:36.419 --> 00:39:37.649
You got here fast.

598
00:39:37.649 --> 00:39:38.989
I'll go in with him.

599
00:39:39.819 --> 00:39:41.489
Why do you want to go in, Manager Park?

600
00:39:41.618 --> 00:39:43.288
It's the case that I was in charge of.

601
00:39:43.489 --> 00:39:46.129
The case Moo Shin was in charge of...

602
00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:48.998
801.

603
00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:57.609
Manager Park, why are you here?

604
00:39:57.609 --> 00:40:00.208
I was in charge of the case. Is there a problem?

605
00:40:04.848 --> 00:40:07.649
Long time no see, Manager Park.

606
00:40:07.848 --> 00:40:09.248
Jan Gebauer?

607
00:40:12.248 --> 00:40:14.888
(Insurance Contract)

608
00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:18.089
It's complicated. Shall I explain it to you?

609
00:40:18.388 --> 00:40:20.799
March of 2008. June of 2008.

610
00:40:20.799 --> 00:40:22.629
February and September of 2009.

611
00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:25.228
January, 2010. April, 2010.

612
00:40:25.868 --> 00:40:27.699
The insurance taken out before the revision...

613
00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:29.299
includes suicide in the policy,

614
00:40:29.299 --> 00:40:31.808
so 3.4 million-dollar payout was possible.

615
00:40:31.808 --> 00:40:32.839
I know that.

616
00:40:33.308 --> 00:40:34.779
I heard the explanation two years ago.

617
00:40:35.408 --> 00:40:38.549
Now tell me why you have to see these.

618
00:40:38.549 --> 00:40:41.018
What do you think? It's because of money.

619
00:40:41.879 --> 00:40:43.179
What are you...

620
00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:44.989
What if it was an accident, not a suicide?

621
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:47.989
Wouldn’t I be able to receive the money for...

622
00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.658
the two other insurances as the special treaty...

623
00:40:49.658 --> 00:40:51.728
regardless of revision?

624
00:40:52.029 --> 00:40:53.029
If it was an accident,

625
00:40:53.029 --> 00:40:54.029
then it's considered an industrial accident.

626
00:40:54.529 --> 00:40:55.629
Also...

627
00:40:57.328 --> 00:40:59.899
this coverage he got in July of 2015.

628
00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:01.469
It's 100,000 for natural death...

629
00:41:01.469 --> 00:41:02.938
and 300,000 for accidental death.

630
00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:06.268
Mr. Gebauer. Are you here to claim more?

631
00:41:07.179 --> 00:41:08.808
Is that why you don't want it to be a suicide?

632
00:41:08.808 --> 00:41:10.038
Is that wrong?

633
00:41:12.279 --> 00:41:13.549
You're done here, right?

634
00:41:13.549 --> 00:41:15.819
Give me a copy of these contracts.

635
00:41:15.819 --> 00:41:17.719
No, we can't. It's against the policy.

636
00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:19.688
- No, go ahead. - Director Cha.

637
00:41:19.688 --> 00:41:21.319
It has been paid out already.

638
00:41:23.219 --> 00:41:26.259
Ms. Jang. Please make a copy of these documents.

639
00:41:29.058 --> 00:41:31.029
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

640
00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:37.438
Goodbye, Mr. Jan Gebauer.

641
00:41:41.138 --> 00:41:43.478
See you again, Manager Park.

642
00:41:51.748 --> 00:41:53.788
(Life Insurance Policy)

643
00:41:56.288 --> 00:41:57.489
How did you get this?

644
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:59.658
I asked Ms. Jang for extra copies.

645
00:42:00.228 --> 00:42:01.399
Nice.

646
00:42:01.699 --> 00:42:05.728
Why did he go that far to get this?

647
00:42:06.268 --> 00:42:08.638
Min Joon and Bum Joon aren't family by law.

648
00:42:08.739 --> 00:42:12.638
It must've been hard to get it reissued.

649
00:42:12.638 --> 00:42:14.038
Why?

650
00:42:14.038 --> 00:42:16.949
Is there a reason why it had to be the original?

651
00:42:17.478 --> 00:42:18.578
Mr. Choi!

652
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:20.379
I found Ko Jin Chul!

653
00:42:49.408 --> 00:42:50.978
It's Park Moo Shin from Taeyang Insurance.

654
00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:53.208
I have to talk to you about the insurance.

655
00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:56.779
Let's meet at midnight. 273-5 Sangam-dong, Paju.

656
00:44:23.268 --> 00:44:24.609
Manager Park?

657
00:44:35.449 --> 00:44:39.049
Hey, Min Joon. Stitches won't do this time.

658
00:44:45.759 --> 00:44:47.299
Good to see you, Jin Chul.

659
00:44:47.958 --> 00:44:49.328
What's all this?

660
00:44:51.929 --> 00:44:53.739
You got a text from Moo Shin, right?

661
00:44:54.739 --> 00:44:56.799
Did you check if it was from Moo Shin?

662
00:44:57.868 --> 00:44:59.339
Did you use me as a bait?

663
00:45:05.449 --> 00:45:07.518
You're the insurance guy from two years ago.

664
00:45:08.449 --> 00:45:11.549
You said that your friend died, right?

665
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:14.859
He's not your friend. His name is Park Jae Soo.

666
00:45:14.989 --> 00:45:16.118
Park Jae Soo.

667
00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:21.058
So are you here for a revenge?

668
00:45:23.058 --> 00:45:24.268
We're here to have a talk.

669
00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:28.399
Jin Chul. Tell us.

670
00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:30.368
Who offered a million dollars...

671
00:45:30.368 --> 00:45:32.009
for Lee Mi Ran's life?

672
00:45:35.138 --> 00:45:36.739
I don't know what you're saying.

673
00:45:36.908 --> 00:45:38.379
When you killed Lee Mi Ran,

674
00:45:39.908 --> 00:45:41.149
she bit you.

675
00:45:42.649 --> 00:45:45.248
Your DNA was found between her teeth.

676
00:45:45.649 --> 00:45:47.618
I spread the word around.

677
00:45:47.989 --> 00:45:49.788
Otherwise you would've...

678
00:45:49.788 --> 00:45:51.759
ran away to China or elsewhere.

679
00:45:52.529 --> 00:45:53.759
Who got you?

680
00:45:56.969 --> 00:46:00.199
After killing Min Joon, it would've been you.

681
00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:01.969
Who got you?

682
00:46:02.138 --> 00:46:04.038
Why should I tell you that?

683
00:46:04.038 --> 00:46:06.169
You have only two choices.

684
00:46:06.538 --> 00:46:10.109
Die in my hands without telling me,

685
00:46:10.808 --> 00:46:12.408
or tell me and pay for your crimes.

686
00:46:12.949 --> 00:46:14.018
If you tell me,

687
00:46:14.018 --> 00:46:15.719
I'll let you live and send you to jail.

688
00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:21.188
Don't I have another choice?

689
00:46:21.259 --> 00:46:22.259
What?

690
00:46:22.259 --> 00:46:23.529
Paying for the sin without telling.

691
00:46:33.098 --> 00:46:36.268
Is this the police? I want to turn myself in.

692
00:46:38.038 --> 00:46:39.509
I killed a person.

693
00:46:39.509 --> 00:46:40.679
Ko Jin Chul.

694
00:46:43.078 --> 00:46:45.308
Hey, are you having fun?

695
00:46:46.708 --> 00:46:47.848
Stop it.

696
00:46:47.848 --> 00:46:48.978
Let me go.

697
00:46:49.618 --> 00:46:53.188
If he dies, we can't find out nothing.

698
00:47:00.859 --> 00:47:04.029
I wanted to say goodbye with a smile.

699
00:47:05.699 --> 00:47:07.438
But you aren't here, Dad.

700
00:47:09.669 --> 00:47:13.069
So why were you angry all your life?

701
00:47:24.188 --> 00:47:26.018
(Lee Young Ho, Legal Affairs Manager)

702
00:47:28.158 --> 00:47:29.558
If Taeyang transferred 10 million dollars,

703
00:47:29.558 --> 00:47:30.859
release the obituary.

704
00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:47.509
His life is long, so what do you want me to do?

705
00:47:47.679 --> 00:47:49.808
Then just end it.

706
00:48:01.719 --> 00:48:02.859
Gosh.

707
00:48:05.489 --> 00:48:06.859
The recording was taken as...

708
00:48:06.859 --> 00:48:09.529
a false confession under a threat.

709
00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:11.328
Just admit to assaulting the German.

710
00:48:11.699 --> 00:48:13.228
Both parties will be at fault.

711
00:48:13.228 --> 00:48:15.098
I heard he got my DNA.

712
00:48:15.098 --> 00:48:16.239
We took care of it.

713
00:48:16.868 --> 00:48:18.509
And the money we promised...

714
00:48:18.509 --> 00:48:20.239
It's okay. I won't take it.

715
00:48:20.839 --> 00:48:23.779
Hey, Mr. Lawyer. Tell him...

716
00:48:24.679 --> 00:48:27.719
that I'll leave Korea after getting out of jail.

717
00:48:28.419 --> 00:48:30.589
I recorded it because Hyun Ki was acting weird.

718
00:48:30.719 --> 00:48:33.188
It'll never happen again.

719
00:48:36.688 --> 00:48:37.929
I'll tell him.

720
00:49:06.188 --> 00:49:07.759
Let me use the bathroom.

721
00:49:08.919 --> 00:49:10.118
What a nuisance.

722
00:50:44.649 --> 00:50:46.919
Okay, so the suspect...

723
00:50:47.259 --> 00:50:49.688
tried to kill Jan Gebauer.

724
00:50:49.688 --> 00:50:51.388
And you, Mr. Choi Kang Woo,

725
00:50:51.388 --> 00:50:54.429
acted excessively in order to stop him?

726
00:50:54.629 --> 00:50:55.828
It was self-defense?

727
00:50:55.828 --> 00:50:58.268
Should I say so?

728
00:50:58.268 --> 00:50:59.268
Why this little...

729
00:51:00.868 --> 00:51:01.998
Or not.

730
00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:03.469
What do you mean?

731
00:51:03.469 --> 00:51:04.938
It's either right or wrong.

732
00:51:04.938 --> 00:51:06.978
What are you two doing right now?

733
00:51:06.978 --> 00:51:09.438
Should I charge him for attempted murder?

734
00:51:09.438 --> 00:51:11.708
I'd like to,

735
00:51:11.708 --> 00:51:13.549
but it's certain he did it out of self-defense.

736
00:51:15.848 --> 00:51:17.489
I knew that'd happen.

737
00:51:17.819 --> 00:51:19.419
Who brought him to the toilet?

738
00:51:19.419 --> 00:51:20.759
What's going on?

739
00:51:20.759 --> 00:51:21.919
Ko Jin Chul hanged himself.

740
00:51:21.919 --> 00:51:22.958
What?

741
00:51:30.998 --> 00:51:32.699
- Gosh. - Hurry and get him.

742
00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:34.469
Hurry.

743
00:51:34.469 --> 00:51:35.538
Move him.

744
00:51:39.969 --> 00:51:41.638
Please hold on.

745
00:51:41.638 --> 00:51:42.708
What are you doing?

746
00:51:42.708 --> 00:51:44.009
Who are you?

747
00:51:48.819 --> 00:51:50.049
What's wrong with him?

748
00:52:21.379 --> 00:52:23.549
Lee Mi Ran and Ko Jin Chul.

749
00:52:23.888 --> 00:52:25.649
Two people died already, right?

750
00:52:25.649 --> 00:52:28.489
Are we doing the right thing?

751
00:52:28.989 --> 00:52:30.629
Can we go on like this?

752
00:52:30.828 --> 00:52:32.029
Then should we stop here?

753
00:52:32.529 --> 00:52:33.958
We'll just go on.

754
00:52:34.529 --> 00:52:36.299
We'll find ourselves somewhere later.

755
00:52:36.299 --> 00:52:37.799
What if it's where we aren't supposed to go?

756
00:52:37.868 --> 00:52:39.069
Wherever that is,

757
00:52:42.598 --> 00:52:44.739
it won't be worse than where Mr. Choi is now.

760

Ha Ri, let me step out for a while.

761
00:53:36.618 --> 00:53:37.658
Where are you going?

762
00:53:38.859 --> 00:53:39.958
I'll be back.

763
00:53:40.998 --> 00:53:42.158
Wait here.

764
00:53:42.299 --> 00:53:43.458
Shouldn't we go with him?

765
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:45.069
Track his GPS signal.

766
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:46.169
What signal?

767
00:53:46.828 --> 00:53:47.998
What?

768
00:53:48.998 --> 00:53:50.839
What's wrong? What?

769
00:53:56.239 --> 00:53:57.248
What's this?

770
00:53:58.078 --> 00:53:59.279
Gosh.

771
00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:00.949
Do you have my GPS signal too?

772
00:54:01.719 --> 00:54:03.649
I'm not interested in you, Cheetah.

773
00:54:03.649 --> 00:54:04.688
Hey!

774
00:54:05.949 --> 00:54:07.558
Please be interested.

775
00:54:08.118 --> 00:54:10.288
Okay, okay. Please stop! It's disgusting.

You're here.

779
00:54:34.679 --> 00:54:36.179
Did you send me the text?

780
00:54:36.848 --> 00:54:37.888
Yes.

781
00:54:38.489 --> 00:54:41.058
You searched him for the last two years.

782
00:54:44.828 --> 00:54:46.158
What are you doing?

783
00:54:46.158 --> 00:54:48.558
I know. What on earth have I done?

784
00:54:48.558 --> 00:54:50.929
Moo Shin, what's wrong?

785
00:54:53.029 --> 00:54:54.339
His doctor said...

786
00:54:54.768 --> 00:54:56.669
Mr. Shin has been an alcoholic...

787
00:54:56.669 --> 00:54:58.308
for more than three years.

788
00:54:59.908 --> 00:55:01.179
Do you get it?

789
00:55:03.009 --> 00:55:04.708
At that time two years ago,

790
00:55:05.578 --> 00:55:07.219

It means...

793
00:55:16.958 --> 00:55:19.089
he was an alcoholic at that time too.

794
00:55:22.558 --> 00:55:24.268
You're saying that the testimony...

795
00:55:25.669 --> 00:55:28.199
about Bum Joon's suicidal crash...

796
00:55:29.399 --> 00:55:31.009

No, don't lower it. You pulled it up.

817

You pulled it for certain.

You pulled it up.

823
00:57:13.779 --> 00:57:15.739
You tried to fly the plane back up.

824
00:57:15.938 --> 00:57:17.478
You did.

825
00:57:18.009 --> 00:57:19.509
You pulled up...

826
00:57:20.078 --> 00:57:21.478
the control wheel.

827
00:57:22.248 --> 00:57:23.279
And...

828
00:57:24.419 --> 00:57:25.549
Pull up...

829
00:57:26.649 --> 00:57:28.888
Pull up!

830
00:57:28.888 --> 00:57:32.058
Pull up!

What did you mean by that? Tell me one more time.

Tell me again!

He pulled the wheel up.

839

He didn't lower it.

840
00:58:07.458 --> 00:58:08.958

00:58:32.118 --> 00:58:34.188

It's from Kim Min Joon's USIM chip.

00:58:37.288 --> 00:58:38.288
What are these texts?

846
00:58:38.288 --> 00:58:39.288
What?

847
00:58:40.699 --> 00:58:41.899
Min Joon,

848
00:58:41.899 --> 00:58:43.799
it feels so good to text my brother.

849
00:58:44.498 --> 00:58:47.038
Min Joon, let's not part ways ever again.

850
00:58:48.899 --> 00:58:49.899
Min Joon.

851
00:58:50.368 --> 00:58:52.109
Come to Korea. Let's live together.

852
00:58:52.739 --> 00:58:53.739
Min Joon.

853
00:58:54.379 --> 00:58:56.009
I'll really make you happy.

854
00:58:56.609 --> 00:58:58.978
Min Joon, give me your watch.

855
00:59:00.009 --> 00:59:01.618
I bought your watch already...

856
00:59:01.618 --> 00:59:03.348
and put it in the drawer in the living room.

857
00:59:06.388 --> 00:59:07.958
The sky looks so nice and clear today.

858
00:59:08.759 --> 00:59:10.118
Shall we go on a trip together...

859
00:59:10.118 --> 00:59:11.429
after my flight duty this time?

860
00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:17.828
Min Joon.

861
00:59:18.768 --> 00:59:21.699
I love you very much, brother.

862
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:13.388
(Mad Dog)

863
01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:17.629
If Bum Joon didn't plan this accident, then who?

864
01:00:17.828 --> 01:00:20.399
Who made you bear false witness?

865
01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:23.029
Min Joon, why do you want the insurance policy?

866
01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:25.399
His face is awfully familiar.

867
01:00:25.529 --> 01:00:28.469
Then will Mr. Lee return to Taeyang Insurance?

868
01:00:28.768 --> 01:00:31.438
Cha Hong Joo of Taeyang Insurance.

869
01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:34.379
Do not get involved with that man from Juhan Air.

870
01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:36.438
You ended up here because...

871
01:00:36.438 --> 01:00:38.149
you get dragged around with stuff like this.

872
01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:41.219
Do you have anything to say to me?

873
01:00:41.649 --> 01:00:43.049
What do you want?

874
01:00:43.688 --> 01:00:46.518
I want to return to Taeyang Insurance.
