00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.330
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:11.413
Hak Young.

3
00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:15.752
If the verdict...

4
00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:19.593
points me as the murderer,

5
00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:24.292
I'll reveal your secret to the police.

6
00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:30.563
- Do Hak Young. - You wouldn't want that, would you?

7
00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:35.172
So do whatever you can...

8
00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:38.772
to make me innocent.

9
00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:49.683
You know Do Hak Young, don't you?

10
00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.653
You knew him, but you pretended not to, right?

11
00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:54.793
No, I really don't know him.

12
00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:04.063
Let's go. Go turn yourself in,

13
00:01:04.472 --> 00:01:06.073
and I'll quit my post.

14
00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.103
That's what you want, right?

15
00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:15.412
You scumbag! You crazy jerk!

16
00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:18.082
I didn't mean all that.

17
00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:21.483
How could you...

18
00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:24.722
I'm just frustrated, you know.

19
00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:28.022
Just tell me that...

20
00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:29.422
you trust me, can't you?

21
00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:35.232
You're so heartless.

22
00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:38.002
You jerk.

23
00:01:57.993 --> 00:01:58.993
Gosh.

24
00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:02.162
- Please drive faster. - Okay.

25
00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:08.933
That jerk.

26
00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:11.002
He's the culprit.

27
00:02:11.373 --> 00:02:13.173
- Goodness. - What a jerk.

28
00:02:13.173 --> 00:02:14.843
- How could he? - Gosh.

29
00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:18.512
I can't trust you yet.

30
00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:20.412
So tell me.

31
00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:22.743
If I believe you after I hear everything,

32
00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.782
people will also...

33
00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:27.782
believe you.

34
00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:39.692
Woo Tak!

35
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.403
Hey, Hong Joo.

36
00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:44.502
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

37
00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:46.373
Yes, I'm fine.

38
00:02:47.803 --> 00:02:48.803
That's a relief.

39
00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:52.843
See? I told you. I was right.

40
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.482
I told you that man will barge into your place.

41
00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:57.813
Didn't I tell you to lock to door?

42
00:02:58.153 --> 00:03:01.382
Why wouldn't you listen to me? Gosh.

43
00:03:03.423 --> 00:03:04.452
It hurts.

44
00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:08.563
Are you crying?

45
00:03:12.632 --> 00:03:15.632
Yes, I am. You hit me so hard.

46
00:03:15.702 --> 00:03:17.363
It hurts so much that I'm crying.

47
00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:20.773
Woo Tak.

48
00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:29.482
Yes, sir. Do Hak Young is being transported to Hangang Station.

49
00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.882
Why did he suddenly turn himself in?

50
00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.523
- Somebody convinced him to. - Who?

51
00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:41.793
Well, I'll report more on that and tell you later.

52
00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:48.733
You're holding yourself well when you must be really curious.

53
00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:51.772
Are you kidding me? I have so much to ask, but I'm just holding it.

54
00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:54.543
What is it? Are you going to answer my questions? Can I interview you?

55
00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:56.142
No.

56
00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:03.212
How much did you see in the dream?

57
00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:08.423
Do Hak Young went into your house.

58
00:04:09.522 --> 00:04:12.252
He asked you to be on his side because he thinks it's unfair.

59
00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:14.663
That's all?

60
00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:18.132
Yes, that's exactly all.

61
00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.332
Why? Was there something more important after that?

62
00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.502
No, there wasn't. That's all.

63
00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:26.233
Okay.

64
00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:34.613
About today...

65
00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:40.952
Thanks for worrying about me.

66
00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:58.233
He hugged her?

67
00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:02.543
Why wouldn't he hug her to thank her?

68
00:05:02.543 --> 00:05:03.642
Do you hug everyone that you're grateful to?

69
00:05:04.473 --> 00:05:08.582
They can hug if they want like how Americans do.

70
00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:09.983
Americans?

71
00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:13.712
Well, I guess I could hug Hee Min or Ms. Moon if I'm grateful...

72
00:05:14.983 --> 00:05:17.723
That's nonsense! I would never do that.

73
00:05:17.723 --> 00:05:19.822
I wouldn't do that even if someone saved my life or even my country.

74
00:05:19.822 --> 00:05:21.592
Why? Because this is Korea.

75
00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:24.192
Then just think as they hugged because they like each other.

76
00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:25.993
Hey! That can't be happening.

77
00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:27.702
Who are you to decide that?

78
00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.002
That's because...

79
00:05:30.132 --> 00:05:31.132
I'm...

80
00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:42.842
I should stop caring about something so petty.

81
00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:55.462
Darn it.

82
00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:00.462
Since you're here already, have breakfast with me.

83
00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:03.603
It's okay. I had breakfast at your place too often. I'd be too sorry.

84
00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:05.702
Okay then.

85
00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:07.902
Thanks for taking me home. I'll go in.

86
00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:10.642
Hey, Hong Joo.

87
00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:14.813
About today...

88
00:06:19.882 --> 00:06:20.882
Mr. Han Woo Tak!

89
00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:35.563
Are you going to have breakfast?

90
00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:37.163
I'm... I'm also going.

91
00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:38.632
Well...

92
00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:42.243
Did you also think that Do Hak Young...

93
00:06:42.243 --> 00:06:44.313
could be the culprit when you came across this case?

94
00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:49.512
Yes, I'm here early to have breakfast.

95
00:06:50.082 --> 00:06:51.382
Let's go in. I'm hungry.

96
00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:53.252
Okay.

97
00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:00.993
- Over there! - Over there!

98
00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:02.092
- He's here. - He's here.

99
00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:04.262
Please get back!

100
00:07:04.563 --> 00:07:05.592
The car stopped.

101
00:07:06.163 --> 00:07:07.332
- Excuse me! - He's there!

102
00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:09.363
Do you have anything to say to the bereaved family?

103
00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:10.563
How do you feel right now?

104
00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:11.702
Say something.

105
00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:13.502
I didn't kill her!

106
00:07:13.502 --> 00:07:15.072
Why did you kill her?

107
00:07:15.072 --> 00:07:16.303
I feel falsely accused!

108
00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:19.373
Why did you turn yourself in if you don't admit to the charge?

109
00:07:20.342 --> 00:07:21.382
My friend told me...

110
00:07:22.113 --> 00:07:23.842
to turn myself in because the law will protect me.

111
00:07:24.252 --> 00:07:28.283
He told me that the law will prove my innocence!

112
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:32.092
I believed in him, so I turned myself in.

113
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.993
Why is that brat talking so much as if he did something good?

114
00:07:35.592 --> 00:07:39.592
I just went in there and fixed the Internet for her.

115
00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:41.803
I really didn't kill...

116
00:07:41.803 --> 00:07:45.603
Let's turn off the news, and focus on our breakfast.

117
00:07:45.873 --> 00:07:49.873
I'm so glad to have you for our breakfast, Woo Tak.

118
00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:51.973
- Thank you. - Come by often.

119
00:07:51.973 --> 00:07:53.243
It'd be better if you come every day.

120
00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:55.683
Should I talk about the dream or not?

121
00:07:55.813 --> 00:07:57.183
Why am I hesitating so much?

122
00:07:57.913 --> 00:07:59.813
Why isn't he telling me anything?

123
00:08:00.153 --> 00:08:01.183
Jae Chan.

124
00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:03.722
I have something to tell you.

125
00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:06.153
What? Did you just hear me?

126
00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:07.763
Sorry? What are you talking about?

127
00:08:07.893 --> 00:08:10.122
Oh, no, no. It's nothing.

128
00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:11.732
What is it?

129
00:08:13.163 --> 00:08:15.263
Do Hak Young who was just on the news is my friend.

130
00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:17.633
- Your friend? - Oh, my.

131
00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:19.403
We went to high school together,

132
00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.342
and he lived with me until recently.

133
00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.242
Gosh. Goodness, this can't be true.

134
00:08:24.313 --> 00:08:26.813
So the friend who convinced him to turn himself in...

135
00:08:26.813 --> 00:08:30.342
It's me. He came to my house in the early morning, so I talked him...

136
00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.582
into turning himself in.

137
00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:32.683
Oh, my.

138
00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:37.153
His case will be assigned to you.

139
00:08:37.793 --> 00:08:38.852
I saw it in the dream.

140
00:08:39.322 --> 00:08:41.923
- To me? - That's why I convinced him.

141
00:08:43.092 --> 00:08:46.092
I thought you'd be able to prove his innocence.

142
00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.533
How do you know he's innocent?

143
00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:50.232
Did you see that in the dream as well?

144
00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:53.872
I didn't, but I can tell because I've known him for a long time.

145
00:08:54.342 --> 00:08:56.742
- Hak Young would never... - He'd never kill a man?

146
00:09:00.043 --> 00:09:01.143
How can you be so sure?

147
00:09:05.183 --> 00:09:08.322
I mean, I wish I could know someone well like that as an old friend.

148
00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:10.352
Then we won't need to go through trial.

149
00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:13.023
I wish it was simple enough to just settle it among friends and family.

150
00:09:13.393 --> 00:09:15.163
Do you think he's guilty?

151
00:09:15.362 --> 00:09:16.362
No, I don't.

152
00:09:17.763 --> 00:09:19.433
But I also don't think he's innocent.

153
00:09:22.163 --> 00:09:25.102
I can't be sure of anything until I investigate him.

154
00:09:25.903 --> 00:09:27.673
I'll have to see if he's guilty or innocent.

155
00:09:36.913 --> 00:09:38.753
Woo Tak hugged me in your dream?

156
00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:42.322
- Why did he? - He was grateful for your concern.

157
00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:44.322
That's not possible.

158
00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:48.523
Besides, I don't hug anyone just because someone hugs me.

159
00:09:48.523 --> 00:09:50.322
No, you hugged him tight.

160
00:09:50.362 --> 00:09:52.133
Not only did you hug him,

161
00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.332
but you also patted his back. Do you do that to anyone?

162
00:09:54.332 --> 00:09:57.533
- No, I don't. - That means Woo Tak isn't anyone.

163
00:09:57.673 --> 00:09:59.903
What's so special about him? I want to know too.

164
00:10:04.712 --> 00:10:06.543
Just say that he's not special.

165
00:10:06.643 --> 00:10:08.883
I think Mr. Youngdeok Crab is jealous.

166
00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:12.553
You're wrong. I'm not jealous. Don't get me wrong.

167
00:10:12.982 --> 00:10:14.013
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:15.322 --> 00:10:17.553
What was so special about Mr. Han Woo Tak?

169
00:10:19.793 --> 00:10:20.893
Youngdeok crab, my foot.

170
00:10:22.063 --> 00:10:23.362
Is it because of uniforms?

171
00:10:23.692 --> 00:10:24.763
Uniforms?

172
00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:28.732
I'm a little fond of men who wear uniforms...

173
00:10:29.232 --> 00:10:31.832
like police, navy, or pilots.

174
00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:36.202
Sometimes I have a crush on Woo Tak...

175
00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:38.872
when he's in his uniform.

176
00:10:39.942 --> 00:10:41.013
Only sometimes.

177
00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:44.452
Prosecutors wear robes too.

178
00:10:44.513 --> 00:10:46.513
Why were you so indifferent when I was wearing a robe?

179
00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:48.653
Gosh, those robes are nothing.

180
00:10:48.653 --> 00:10:51.553
They make you look like you're in a choir. It's such a turnoff.

181
00:10:52.322 --> 00:10:54.092
A... A choir?

182
00:11:14.942 --> 00:11:17.452
Darn it, I imagined myself in it.

183
00:11:17.653 --> 00:11:19.413
Darn it. Seriously.

184
00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:21.883
I feel it's a little unfair.

185
00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:24.852
Why am I making excuses to you?

186
00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.753
And it didn't even happen yet.

187
00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:28.793
It would have happened if I didn't go out in the morning.

188
00:11:29.192 --> 00:11:30.523
This is not jealousy.

189
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.962
- It's pure curiosity. - Curiosity?

190
00:11:33.962 --> 00:11:35.832
Woo Tak is a friend of the offender.

191
00:11:35.832 --> 00:11:39.102
I'm asking this because I want to know why you're being protective.

192
00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:40.433
I'm asking as a prosecutor.

193
00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:43.372
I'm not on Woo Tak's side.

194
00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.212
I'm also not protecting him.

195
00:11:46.643 --> 00:11:49.413
I'm 100 percent sure that Do Hak Young is guilty.

196
00:11:49.582 --> 00:11:51.653
100 percent? Based on what?

197
00:11:51.683 --> 00:11:54.622
Do Hak Young is the only one who was caught on the CCTV footage.

198
00:11:54.622 --> 00:11:57.322
And it's really suspicious that he fled the police.

199
00:11:58.352 --> 00:11:59.393
Also,

200
00:11:59.722 --> 00:12:01.862
If the verdict points me as the murderer,

201
00:12:02.393 --> 00:12:04.393
I'll reveal your secret to the police.

202
00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.832
Woo Tak only said he trusts that murderer because he's a friend,

203
00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:12.133
not because Woo Tak really thinks he's innocent.

204
00:12:13.102 --> 00:12:14.702
Are you siding with Woo Tak?

205
00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:17.543
Are you kidding me?

206
00:12:18.813 --> 00:12:22.513
If I had to choose, I'd be on your side, not his.

207
00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:25.553
I wish Do Hak Young pays for what he has done,

208
00:12:25.553 --> 00:12:29.082
and I don't wish to see him get released like Kang Dae Hee.

209
00:12:29.952 --> 00:12:32.692
I believe that you'll be able to prove him guilty.

210
00:12:35.092 --> 00:12:36.692
This is not a support, is it?

211
00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:38.492
It's not. It's a threat.

212
00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:42.702
I think I'd be disappointed if you can't prove him guilty.

213
00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:56.043
Is your brother the one who killed my dad?

214
00:12:56.513 --> 00:13:00.482
I didn't know that my brother could do such a thing.

215
00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.232
Hey, where are you going?

216
00:13:19.372 --> 00:13:21.602
Let go! I have something to tell him.

217
00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:24.513
- What are you going to say? - None of your business. Let go!

218
00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:26.173
Let's go together.

219
00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:32.082
I also have something to tell him.

(You killed our national hero.)

222
00:13:52.903 --> 00:13:54.503
People can be so diligent.

223
00:13:55.273 --> 00:13:58.242
They write these every day when we erase them every day.

224
00:13:58.572 --> 00:14:01.712
Ma'am, how about closing the store for a few days?

225
00:14:02.112 --> 00:14:03.883
How about until the trial is over?

226
00:14:04.482 --> 00:14:07.253
Woo Tak, is Hak Young a psycho?

227
00:14:07.952 --> 00:14:09.183
A psychopath.

228
00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:11.622
Psychopaths have no emotions.

229
00:14:11.793 --> 00:14:13.423
How is my son a psychopath?

230
00:14:13.592 --> 00:14:16.523
He cried his heart out when the Little Mermaid became sea foam.

231
00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:17.992
How could he be a psychopath?

232
00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:20.862
I know. It's nonsense.

233
00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:23.903
I know he's not that nice.

234
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.433
He stole your money when you two were little,

235
00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:29.173
and he made me worry so much.

236
00:14:30.342 --> 00:14:33.742
But he's not a total trash to kill a person. Don't you think so?

237
00:14:34.043 --> 00:14:35.043
Of course not.

238
00:14:39.783 --> 00:14:41.153
Those jerks.

239
00:14:47.393 --> 00:14:49.923
It's been a while since Do Hak Young turned himself in.

240
00:14:50.063 --> 00:14:52.362
When are you going to prove him guilty?

241
00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:56.702
Why is that Prosecutor Jung so slow with the case?

242
00:14:59.702 --> 00:15:02.143
He has the least experience in his department.

243
00:15:02.602 --> 00:15:04.273
He's never had such a big case that...

244
00:15:04.273 --> 00:15:06.173
he's investigating it over and over again.

245
00:15:06.442 --> 00:15:08.913
Every day must be a pain for the two of you.

246
00:15:09.482 --> 00:15:10.482
He's not being considerate.

247
00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:15.082
Mr. Lee.

248
00:15:16.452 --> 00:15:17.822
I have pancreatic cancer.

249
00:15:19.722 --> 00:15:21.722
The doctor told me I only have a few days to live.

250
00:15:23.893 --> 00:15:26.092
I must see that jerk, Do Hak Young,

251
00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:30.263
get locked up before I die.

252
00:15:31.503 --> 00:15:32.533
If the law...

253
00:15:33.403 --> 00:15:34.803
lets him walk,

254
00:15:36.503 --> 00:15:37.513
I probably will...

255
00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.653
Don't worry, sir.

256
00:15:46.452 --> 00:15:49.153
I'll make sure to prosecute him within a week.

257
00:15:59.862 --> 00:16:02.862
You didn't take off your watch nor roll a paper today.

258
00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:05.102
- I didn't? - Aren't you going to charge them?

259
00:16:05.102 --> 00:16:08.242
It's all right. I was also a fan of Ms. Yoo Su Kyung.

260
00:16:08.643 --> 00:16:09.903
I'll consider it as paying respect.

261
00:16:10.242 --> 00:16:11.572
You look like you're in a good mood.

262
00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:13.273
Of course I am.

263
00:16:14.513 --> 00:16:17.952
I always had to fight against the law, but this time, I don't have to.

264
00:16:18.112 --> 00:16:19.683
It feels as though I'm a big-time player...

265
00:16:20.653 --> 00:16:23.023
who used to be a small-time player.

266
00:16:25.092 --> 00:16:26.452
Please prepare the complaint file.

267
00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:27.663
Yes, sir.

268
00:16:33.362 --> 00:16:35.703
What's the ring size of your girlfriend?

269
00:16:37.402 --> 00:16:39.902
I'm not really sure of the exact size.

I have such dreams too?

272
00:17:19.243 --> 00:17:20.243
What's wrong with my heart?

273
00:17:21.743 --> 00:17:24.382
Will I die of heart burst?

274
00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:28.122
A ring is too much for me now.

275
00:17:31.193 --> 00:17:33.753
Today's special is Vietnamese!

276
00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:37.733
- Here you go. - Thank you for the food.

Thank you for the food.

Oh, this pho is really good.

279
00:17:43.203 --> 00:17:44.632
Did you run a Vietnamese restaurant before?

280
00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:46.773
Yes, I did about 3 years ago, but it didn't go well.

281
00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.773
There was another Vietnamese restaurant next to mine,

282
00:17:48.773 --> 00:17:50.473
and the chef was from Vietnam.

283
00:17:52.213 --> 00:17:53.342
Do you have fever?

284
00:17:54.813 --> 00:17:56.213
Your face is really red.

285
00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:00.652
It's because I had hot soup.

286
00:18:02.922 --> 00:18:04.693
What time do I have to be at the Prosecutors' Office?

287
00:18:04.753 --> 00:18:06.753
- Come by 2pm. - Why are you going there?

288
00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:07.993
To attend the witness investigation.

289
00:18:08.223 --> 00:18:11.092
You can't take your friend's side, and you have to be honest.

290
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:12.662
Of course.

291
00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:16.602
By the way, can prosecutors tell if a witness...

292
00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.872
- is lying or not? - Yes, of course.

293
00:18:18.872 --> 00:18:22.602
I can't believe this, but he's known to be a human lying detector.

294
00:18:22.773 --> 00:18:24.513
Oh, really?

295
00:18:24.773 --> 00:18:27.412
Policeman Han, how's my breakfast today? Is it good?

296
00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:29.142
Sure, it tastes really good.

297
00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:31.912
Prosecutor Jung, is he telling the truth or not?

298
00:18:32.783 --> 00:18:33.813
He's telling the truth.

299
00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:36.622
Policeman Han, do you think you're handsome?

300
00:18:36.723 --> 00:18:38.023
No, not at all.

301
00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:41.223
- He's lying. - He's being coy.

302
00:18:41.223 --> 00:18:42.493
He's a total liar.

303
00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:44.023
You guys are good.

304
00:18:44.392 --> 00:18:46.463
Lieutenant Han, do you have anyone you like?

305
00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:53.803
Yes, I do like someone.

306
00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:56.842
He's telling the truth.

307
00:18:59.313 --> 00:19:00.412
Is it Hong Joo?

308
00:19:02.112 --> 00:19:03.283
Mom!

309
00:19:03.483 --> 00:19:05.313
It's okay. I'm just teasing him.

310
00:19:05.313 --> 00:19:06.313
Is it Hong Joo?

311
00:19:15.122 --> 00:19:16.162
No, it's not.

312
00:19:22.033 --> 00:19:23.402
He's telling the truth.

313
00:19:25.273 --> 00:19:26.303
You're accurate.

314
00:19:26.872 --> 00:19:28.342
I'll look forward to today's investigation.

315
00:19:29.203 --> 00:19:32.243
Okay. Please be honest like you are now.

316
00:19:33.013 --> 00:19:34.043
Sure.

317
00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:42.223
Work on it. Put on some lipstick as well.

318
00:19:47.723 --> 00:19:48.862
All right. Okay.

319
00:19:49.162 --> 00:19:50.193
You're here.

320
00:19:50.263 --> 00:19:52.563
Hong Joo, don't unpack, and go out now.

321
00:19:52.592 --> 00:19:54.632
- You're in trouble. - What do you mean?

322
00:19:54.703 --> 00:19:57.773
Yoo Su Kyung's family sued Do Hak Young for murdering her.

323
00:19:58.172 --> 00:20:00.943
But he's getting investigated already. Can they sue him again?

324
00:20:00.943 --> 00:20:03.243
They must be frustrated that the prosecution is being slow.

325
00:20:03.342 --> 00:20:06.112
Go and listen to what the proxy of the plaintiff has to say.

326
00:20:06.112 --> 00:20:07.342
Who's the proxy?

327
00:20:07.483 --> 00:20:09.943
It's Lawyer Lee Yu Beom from Haegang. Do you want his number?

328
00:20:12.152 --> 00:20:14.682
It's okay. I have his number.

329
00:20:19.392 --> 00:20:20.422
Woo Tak.

330
00:20:21.993 --> 00:20:23.922
I did everything you told me to do.

331
00:20:24.362 --> 00:20:26.932
I confessed everything to Prosecutor Jung already.

332
00:20:26.932 --> 00:20:28.763
I also went through the lying detector.

333
00:20:31.533 --> 00:20:33.533
But why am I still in here?

334
00:20:36.572 --> 00:20:38.273
It's because Prosecutor Jung is being extra careful.

335
00:20:38.273 --> 00:20:41.842
Him being cautious is going to kill me.

336
00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:44.412
They will only let me have a public defender when I have a trial.

337
00:20:46.352 --> 00:20:47.622
What did the prosecutor say?

338
00:20:48.453 --> 00:20:49.753
Is he looking for the real culprit?

339
00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.223
I'll ask him later.

340
00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:54.023
I'm being investigated as a witness.

341
00:20:54.892 --> 00:20:55.892
Really?

342
00:20:55.892 --> 00:20:58.862
When I was in a police academy, I was the top for criminal law.

343
00:20:59.233 --> 00:21:03.303
I'll try my best and defend you when you go on a trial.

344
00:21:03.803 --> 00:21:04.832
Okay.

345
00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:09.402
Okay, thank you so much.

346
00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:12.912
I... I really...

347
00:21:13.543 --> 00:21:15.713
have no one else but you.

348
00:21:21.723 --> 00:21:22.822
All right, brat.

349
00:21:33.332 --> 00:21:36.362
Hey, Woo Tak. Have you gone to see my mom?

350
00:21:37.973 --> 00:21:39.672
Is she doing well?

351
00:21:42.142 --> 00:21:43.473
She's holding up well.

352
00:21:44.243 --> 00:21:45.642
You should be doing the same as well.

353
00:21:51.152 --> 00:21:53.513
(Police Station)

354
00:21:53.783 --> 00:21:56.322
That restaurant serves the best buckwheat noodle.

355
00:21:56.322 --> 00:21:58.392
Sir, let's shift. You should go for lunch.

356
00:21:58.392 --> 00:21:59.493
Okay.

357
00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:02.223
By the way, where's Lieutenant Han?

358
00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:04.332
He went to the Prosecutors' Office for investigation...

359
00:22:04.332 --> 00:22:05.463
as a witness for Do Hak Young case.

360
00:22:06.132 --> 00:22:07.463
Woo Tak is weak-hearted.

361
00:22:07.703 --> 00:22:09.332
He should stand strong against the prosecutors unlike...

362
00:22:09.332 --> 00:22:10.803
how you did.

363
00:22:11.033 --> 00:22:12.203
Woo Tak...

364
00:22:12.902 --> 00:22:15.072
is different from me.

365
00:22:15.072 --> 00:22:17.943
He's smart because he finished police academy. He's also brave.

366
00:22:17.943 --> 00:22:20.243
He's not the type of person to be scared of prosecutors.

367
00:22:23.582 --> 00:22:26.013
I'm not saying that I'm not smart,

368
00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:28.152
but he's just a little smarter than me.

369
00:22:28.152 --> 00:22:29.822
I'm also not saying that I'm a coward,

370
00:22:29.882 --> 00:22:33.152
but he's just unbelievably brave.

371
00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:34.963
Go for lunch. I know what you mean.

372
00:22:35.493 --> 00:22:36.993
I'm also a big man.

373
00:22:37.632 --> 00:22:39.892
That's not something to brag about. Go for lunch now.

374
00:22:43.432 --> 00:22:47.803
Gosh, I heard that Han Woo Tak has outstanding background.

375
00:22:47.872 --> 00:22:50.402
He graduated from police academy with high grades.

376
00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:52.743
He also received an award from prime minister when he graduated.

377
00:22:53.443 --> 00:22:54.983
I talked with him briefly earlier,

378
00:22:55.713 --> 00:22:57.342
and he's really eloquent.

379
00:22:57.852 --> 00:23:00.382
He might win over us if we don't focus.

380
00:23:01.953 --> 00:23:04.723
Goodness, burned food is not good for your health.

381
00:23:06.723 --> 00:23:07.763
Mr. Choi.

382
00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:10.293
What will happen if I can't prosecute this case?

383
00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:11.693
You'll be in big trouble.

384
00:23:11.793 --> 00:23:15.362
You'll be blamed by the chief, I mean, by the whole nation.

385
00:23:16.963 --> 00:23:19.973
What's wrong? Are you not confident?

386
00:23:20.303 --> 00:23:21.973
No, it's not like that.

387
00:23:23.243 --> 00:23:25.543
Mr. Choi, I have something to ask you.

388
00:23:34.822 --> 00:23:36.622
Hyang Mi, what are you up to?

389
00:23:37.652 --> 00:23:38.852
I'm just aging.

390
00:23:39.322 --> 00:23:42.122
There are 7,000 pages of Do Hak Young's case.

391
00:23:42.122 --> 00:23:46.693
The chief said he'll double check, so there are 14,000 pages in total.

392
00:23:46.993 --> 00:23:50.463
I copied them, punched holes in them, and stapled them.

393
00:23:50.463 --> 00:23:52.072
That's why I'm just aging here.

394
00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:55.943
What's this?

395
00:23:55.973 --> 00:23:57.243
We bought it because it's pretty.

396
00:23:57.443 --> 00:23:59.443
For the past few days, the spring flowers have been blossoming.

397
00:23:59.443 --> 00:24:00.473
Really?

398
00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:03.213
I couldn't even see flowers because of Do Hak Young.

399
00:24:03.213 --> 00:24:05.953
I haven't seen spring coming.

400
00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:07.553
There are many days left.

401
00:24:07.553 --> 00:24:08.822
When can I see it?

402
00:24:09.023 --> 00:24:12.523
These papers won't be gone any time soon. When can I go?

403
00:24:16.293 --> 00:24:17.322
Come in.

404
00:24:20.932 --> 00:24:22.602
Is Prosecutor Jung here?

405
00:24:24.332 --> 00:24:25.773
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

406
00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:27.803
Nice.

407
00:24:35.082 --> 00:24:37.182
Who are you?

408
00:24:37.313 --> 00:24:39.882
My name is Han Woo Tak, and I'm here to answer questions as a witness.

409
00:24:39.882 --> 00:24:43.322
Oh, right. Mr. Han Woo Tak. You can just wait over there.

410
00:24:43.953 --> 00:24:44.953
This way.

411
00:24:46.922 --> 00:24:48.493
Do you have perfume?

412
00:24:48.493 --> 00:24:50.362
- I don't have one now. - What should I do?

413
00:24:52.592 --> 00:24:53.932
It's here.

414
00:24:54.763 --> 00:24:56.033
Her spring is here.

415
00:24:56.832 --> 00:24:58.533
(Lawyer Lee Yu Beom)

416
00:25:03.803 --> 00:25:05.213
Goodness, I'm disappointed.

417
00:25:05.543 --> 00:25:08.943
I called you first among all reporters because we have history.

418
00:25:08.943 --> 00:25:11.182
Thank you. I'm really honored.

419
00:25:12.382 --> 00:25:13.412
You're still the same.

420
00:25:13.483 --> 00:25:14.822
What would you like to drink?

421
00:25:14.922 --> 00:25:17.082
Please give me a cold glass of Coke.

422
00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:18.122
Sure.

423
00:25:19.322 --> 00:25:21.463
Having a proxy for a plaintiff is quite unusual.

424
00:25:21.463 --> 00:25:22.563
What do you do as a plaintiff?

425
00:25:24.763 --> 00:25:26.533
You know Prosecutor Jung well, don't you?

426
00:25:28.503 --> 00:25:31.932
He's a newbie, so he's really slow. And he's stubborn as well.

427
00:25:31.932 --> 00:25:34.003
He's following his beliefs and being careful.

428
00:25:34.003 --> 00:25:36.203
Evidence gets polluted and even disappears if Jae Chan...

429
00:25:36.203 --> 00:25:38.412
keeps listening to what the suspect has to say...

430
00:25:38.473 --> 00:25:40.072
and tolerate the suspect's right to remain silent.

431
00:25:40.072 --> 00:25:43.112
Is gossiping about a prosecutor your job as a proxy?

432
00:25:43.112 --> 00:25:46.213
What if we lose the culprit? The family will be devastated.

433
00:25:46.783 --> 00:25:50.723
That's why I'm here to sue him on behalf of the family.

434
00:25:53.293 --> 00:25:56.763
Lawyer Lee Yu Beom. What are you trying to say?

435
00:25:59.293 --> 00:26:01.003
Don't you get what I'm saying?

436
00:26:02.763 --> 00:26:06.102
Jae Chan isn't going to win the case with the evidence he has now.

437
00:26:06.503 --> 00:26:10.243
Do Hak Young will not be prosecuted, and he can walk free.

438
00:26:10.743 --> 00:26:13.043
This means the prosecutor in charge will get all the blame.

439
00:26:13.473 --> 00:26:15.182
And I'm here to stop that from happening.

440
00:26:17.553 --> 00:26:21.382
I'll be on Jae Chan's side this time round.

441
00:26:26.693 --> 00:26:29.493
So you can help me too, right?

442
00:26:37.973 --> 00:26:40.172
Senior Shin, can you take a look at my investigation?

443
00:26:40.172 --> 00:26:41.172
I don't want to make a mistake.

444
00:26:42.973 --> 00:26:45.912
Of course, I shall take a look when my junior asks.

445
00:26:47.813 --> 00:26:49.743
- Senior Lee. - What is it?

446
00:26:51.253 --> 00:26:52.283
Senior Son.

447
00:26:54.882 --> 00:26:57.553
Chief, we are starting the witness investigation now. Could you join?

448
00:26:57.553 --> 00:27:01.263
Sure, it's the most important case in our department. I have to watch.

449
00:27:02.862 --> 00:27:07.703
Goodness, since when did the police uniform look so fine?

450
00:27:07.703 --> 00:27:10.203
A rarely handsome man for a policeman.

451
00:27:10.533 --> 00:27:11.572
I couldn't agree more.

452
00:27:11.572 --> 00:27:14.033
Why don't prosecutors look handsome like he does?

453
00:27:14.033 --> 00:27:16.102
Prosecutor Jung is handsome.

454
00:27:16.773 --> 00:27:18.142
Didn't you say you liked him?

455
00:27:18.142 --> 00:27:21.243
Gosh. For a very short time only. Really shortly.

456
00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:24.682
You have to read his e-mails. He's a really boring type.

457
00:27:24.682 --> 00:27:28.253
In fact, he's nothing without his job as a prosecutor.

458
00:27:30.223 --> 00:27:31.622
A handsome face and height, maybe?

459
00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:39.332
Did he hear what I said the entire time?

460
00:27:39.332 --> 00:27:42.132
Yes, from the beginning to the end.

461
00:27:42.132 --> 00:27:44.203
Goodness, what have I done?

462
00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:45.533
Oh, he's here.

463
00:27:46.003 --> 00:27:47.033
You're here.

464
00:27:49.543 --> 00:27:52.172
You are early. Did you have lunch?

465
00:27:52.273 --> 00:27:53.813
Yes, I did.

466
00:27:55.412 --> 00:27:58.182
There are other prosecutors on the other side too, right?

467
00:28:01.382 --> 00:28:02.422
Can he see us?

468
00:28:03.382 --> 00:28:04.622
Do you think he can?

469
00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:08.963
That guy is who made Do Hak Young to confess, right?

470
00:28:09.162 --> 00:28:12.832
Yes, sir. I hope he does not make Prosecutor Jung to fall for him.

471
00:28:13.092 --> 00:28:17.003
This case is too much for a junior like Prosecutor Jung.

472
00:28:17.632 --> 00:28:20.773
Don't call him a junior here.

473
00:28:21.203 --> 00:28:24.443
Prosecutor Jung looks more reliable...

474
00:28:24.443 --> 00:28:26.072
than someone like you who skipped the autopsy.

475
00:28:26.973 --> 00:28:30.983
We can't let this case be like Kang's in which he was...

476
00:28:31.612 --> 00:28:34.223
found innocent. And who fixed all your mistakes in the end?

477
00:28:34.453 --> 00:28:37.122
Who brought Kang Dae Hee back to prosecution after he walked free?

478
00:28:37.122 --> 00:28:39.053
- Prosecutor Jung. - Prosecutor Jung, sir.

479
00:28:39.053 --> 00:28:41.463
You still think he can't handle it?

480
00:28:41.463 --> 00:28:43.122
- No. - No, sir.

481
00:28:44.963 --> 00:28:47.432
This reminds me of Kang's case in many ways.

482
00:28:47.533 --> 00:28:51.273
He sure is the culprit, but there is only indirect evidence.

483
00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:53.233
I believe in Prosecutor Jung.

484
00:28:53.602 --> 00:28:57.203
He will find one crucial and direct evidence from today's investigation.

485
00:28:57.943 --> 00:28:59.713
- Let's get this! - Let's do this!

486
00:29:02.112 --> 00:29:03.743
How are you related to Do Hak Young?

487
00:29:04.043 --> 00:29:05.553
