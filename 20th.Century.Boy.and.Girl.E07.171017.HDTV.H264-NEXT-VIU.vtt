1
00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:10.024
Lower your right shoulder, and lift your chin a little.

2
00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:11.953
Smile a bit.

3
00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:16.594
That's great. 1, 2, 3.

4
00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:20.633
Is she done? Let's go.

5
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.004
All right.

6
00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.504
I told you to hurry!

7
00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:28.574
I want tteokbokki. I might die of starvation.

8
00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:30.304
I'm dying.

9
00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.944
Didn't you say you used up all your pocket money...

10
00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:35.243
to buy this? Do you have money?

11
00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:36.344
We have yours.

12
00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.683
I bought this yesterday.

13
00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:43.624
No, I need to buy "Highteen".

14
00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:48.164
I can't use my money. Anthony is on the cover this month.

15
00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:49.594
- Jin Jin. - Jin Jin.

16
00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:51.094
- Please buy us tteokbokki. - I can't.

17
00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:53.264
There are seven photos of Anthony in it.

18
00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:56.603
Do you want your friend to die of starvation?

19
00:00:56.603 --> 00:00:58.804
- You won't die. - Is Anthony more important than us?

20
00:00:58.804 --> 00:00:59.804
Yes.

21
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.503
How much is it?

22
00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:03.844
Do you want me to give it to you for free?

23
00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:06.243
- What? - Really? For real?

24
00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:08.644
- But I have a favor to ask. - What is it?

25
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.414
You know the photo in front of the store...

26
00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:13.713
- It's her sister, Ho Sung. - Yes.

27
00:01:26.694 --> 00:01:27.963
Oh, my.

28
00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:34.804
Sir, who's the girl in the photo at the front?

29
00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:37.174
What photo are you talking about?

30
00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:39.814
The high school student. She has an aura.

31
00:01:40.013 --> 00:01:41.713
Oh, that one.

32
00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:45.713
Yes, yes. Thank you.

33
00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:18.114
Ji Won.

34
00:02:19.213 --> 00:02:20.313
All right.

35
00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:40.674
Ji Won left Hangeum-dong.

36
00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:45.843
He disappeared without even saying goodbye.

37
00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:47.443
(The fourth story)

38
00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:51.384
He left on a summer day when we were 18 years old.

39
00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.484
(Christmas in August)

40
00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:14.973
(Episode 7)

41
00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:53.213
She's cheating, cheating for real

42
00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:58.683
- She's cheating, cheating for real - She's cheating, cheating for real

43
00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:03.424
- She's cheating, cheating for real - She's cheating, cheating for real

44
00:04:03.484 --> 00:04:05.753
- She's cheating, cheating for real - She's cheating, cheating for real

45
00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:07.123
Hey, you!

46
00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:09.463
- Let's run! - Let's run!

47
00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:17.363
She's cheating, cheating for real

48
00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:19.334
He came again.

49
00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:20.533
You should go closer to him.

50
00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:22.874
- Go see him. - He watches you from faraway.

51
00:04:22.874 --> 00:04:24.173
Go closer to him.

52
00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:26.374
- We don't have time. Let's go. - You should talk to him.

53
00:04:26.514 --> 00:04:28.413
- He never comes near you. - I know.

54
00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:29.843
Gosh.

55
00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:32.954
- Let's get the blue one. - This is really delicious.

56
00:04:32.954 --> 00:04:35.423
- The blue one is the best. - I need to go on a diet.

57
00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:47.764
Did you watch a movie?

58
00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:50.103
- Yes. - Alone?

59
00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:52.504
Yes.

60
00:04:54.303 --> 00:04:57.613
That's great. I was going to get some udon.

61
00:04:57.973 --> 00:04:59.473
Do you want to go to eat at a street stall?

62
00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:01.644
I don't want to. I'm busy.

63
00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:05.913
It's 2am.

64
00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:12.694
- Are you angry? - No.

65
00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:16.894
You acted like this when you told me we weren't going to be friends.

66
00:05:16.994 --> 00:05:19.293
That was when I recorded Shin Hae Chul's song...

67
00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:20.863
on Anthony's tape.

68
00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:28.074
Did I do something wrong?

69
00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:30.574
- No. - It's not me, right?

70
00:05:30.944 --> 00:05:33.113
I'm happy to see you again after such a long time.

71
00:05:35.613 --> 00:05:37.483
Where have you been?

72
00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:40.314
I texted you to explain everything.

73
00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:43.553
I couldn't see it. My phone is broken.

74
00:05:44.024 --> 00:05:45.093
Right.

75
00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:48.524
I have a lot of things I want to talk to you about,

76
00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:51.293
and there's someone I want to introduce to you.

77
00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:54.093
It's been a while since I last saw Ah Reum and Young Shim.

78
00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:02.274
(Sa Min Ho)

79
00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:07.944
- Hello? - Are you the "Ugly Sister"?

80
00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:10.184
What?

81
00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:16.824
(Hangeum Police Station)

82
00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:22.324
You should stay here.

83
00:06:23.093 --> 00:06:24.934
People might spread rumors if they see you here.

84
00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:26.934
It's all right.

85
00:06:28.134 --> 00:06:29.233
Stay here.

86
00:06:31.973 --> 00:06:33.074
I'll be back.

87
00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:42.884
- Why me? - Thank you.

88
00:06:42.884 --> 00:06:45.283
- What did I do wrong? - Gosh.

89
00:06:45.283 --> 00:06:47.954
- Let me go! - Come here.

90
00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:55.524
I was supposed to be hired.

91
00:07:00.163 --> 00:07:03.064
They know who they're going to employ.

92
00:07:03.303 --> 00:07:05.634
I shouldn't have believed him.

93
00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:08.673
It's all right. Let's go.

94
00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:13.213
- Gosh. - Gosh.

95
00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:14.814
Let's go.

96
00:07:16.584 --> 00:07:21.223
Pick me, pick me, pick me up Pick me, pick me, pick me up

97
00:07:21.384 --> 00:07:23.983
Pick me, pick me, pick me

98
00:07:24.153 --> 00:07:27.423
I want you to pick me up

99
00:07:28.593 --> 00:07:30.663
- Hey. - Who are you?

100
00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:34.934
Are you upset again?

101
00:07:35.134 --> 00:07:37.834
I know her, my second big sister.

102
00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:39.134
How can I not?

103
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:42.374
She's the ugliest girl in the whole universe.

104
00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:44.973
Not only is she ugly, but she also has a bad temper.

105
00:07:44.973 --> 00:07:48.584
Not only does she have a bad temper, but she also never washes at home.

106
00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:52.783
But outside, she acts like she's the prettiest person.

107
00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:56.084
- Watch it. - Jin Jin.

108
00:07:56.553 --> 00:07:58.494
Recently, I've been thinking...

109
00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:02.163
you look more like a guy than a girl.

110
00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.524
Hey!

111
00:08:21.913 --> 00:08:23.084
Do you remember?

112
00:08:24.283 --> 00:08:26.014
It was before he started school.

113
00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:29.684
He got beaten up by some other kids in the playground.

114
00:08:30.454 --> 00:08:31.694
That happened a lot.

115
00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:33.693
He was left out for not having a brother.

116
00:08:33.693 --> 00:08:36.724
I showed up one day and put everyone in line.

117
00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:39.964
"If you touch Min Ho again, I'll beat you up."

118
00:08:39.964 --> 00:08:41.303
"Don't you dare."

119
00:08:42.163 --> 00:08:45.004
That is what I'd love to be able to say happened,

120
00:08:45.004 --> 00:08:47.374
but I got beaten up by a sixth-grader myself.

121
00:08:49.104 --> 00:08:50.974
I was a bit short then.

122
00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:55.083
Min Ho still said he liked me the most.

123
00:08:55.214 --> 00:08:57.453
He always said he wanted to swap...

124
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.354
his two sisters for me.

125
00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:04.254
Thanks.

126
00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:10.024
For that day and today.

127
00:09:12.894 --> 00:09:14.234
And at the airport.

128
00:09:17.403 --> 00:09:21.004
We met once more after that.

129
00:09:30.953 --> 00:09:31.984
My passport?

130
00:09:32.354 --> 00:09:34.724
I haven't unpacked my stuff from Hong Kong.

131
00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:38.153
I found it.

132
00:09:51.504 --> 00:09:55.073
We met once more after that.

133
00:10:16.823 --> 00:10:20.063
Could you give this back to Sa Jin Jin, please?

134
00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:21.533
She's staying here, I believe.

135
00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:23.764
- Sure, my pleasure. - Thank you.

136
00:10:36.744 --> 00:10:39.083
When was this taken?

137
00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:41.884
That's when she was in school.

138
00:10:44.193 --> 00:10:47.494
No, no, it was taken that day.

139
00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:49.024
Ji Won's dad.

140
00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.734
You're right. It was around this time of the year.

141
00:10:56.004 --> 00:10:57.673
It's a few days from now.

142
00:11:00.274 --> 00:11:02.443
I wonder what he's up to now.

143
00:11:02.504 --> 00:11:05.474
Didn't someone see him a few years ago?

144
00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:07.714
In Yangpyeong's bus terminal.

145
00:11:07.844 --> 00:11:09.943
I hope he's okay.

146
00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:13.453
Mom, did you see my photos? I had them laid out.

147
00:11:13.653 --> 00:11:15.153
That's the one.

148
00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:16.524
- This? - Yes.

149
00:11:17.653 --> 00:11:20.653
- What are these for? - I have to give it to the magazine.

150
00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:23.094
We took a trip down memory lane.

151
00:11:23.094 --> 00:11:24.563
Look at this one.

152
00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:26.563
You're so tiny.

153
00:11:30.903 --> 00:11:32.803
You don't remember that day, do you?

154
00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:34.673
What? No.

155
00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:39.744
You were too young. Where are you going?

156
00:11:39.744 --> 00:11:42.614
To my agency to drop these off. See you.

157
00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:43.913
Okay, bye.

158
00:11:46.653 --> 00:11:48.423
Wasn't I adorable?

159
00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.083
I dreamed of...

160
00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:53.323
eating a ham sandwich here with Anthony.

161
00:11:53.323 --> 00:11:56.323
You're acting like you don't want to now.

162
00:11:56.323 --> 00:11:58.063
How did you know that?

163
00:11:59.364 --> 00:12:01.533
Do you know that you become...

164
00:12:01.533 --> 00:12:04.774
a different person when you talk about Anthony?

165
00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:08.104
Look at you in this one.

166
00:12:08.673 --> 00:12:11.413
You were a homebody, but you were always out here.

167
00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:12.844
Does that make sense?

168
00:12:13.114 --> 00:12:14.884
Did your efforts pay off?

169
00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:18.783
Real fans never gain anything.

170
00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:22.024
I went there more often than I studied, but I never saw him.

171
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.453
You'd have gone to a top university if you'd studied that hard.

172
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.693
I would have.

173
00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:29.423
Do you know how many ham sandwiches I had there?

174
00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.864
That's why I can't stand them now.

175
00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:37.104
I might be able to eat one if I were with Anthony.

176
00:12:39.274 --> 00:12:41.974
You said you ordered food. Where is it? I'm hungry.

177
00:12:45.774 --> 00:12:46.913
Hong Hee.

178
00:12:48.283 --> 00:12:49.583
Is this it?

179
00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:53.413
Eat this.

180
00:12:53.413 --> 00:12:57.124
It has two slices of cheese and bacon.

181
00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.624
- You're so witty. - Thank you.

182
00:13:02.563 --> 00:13:05.663
So what are you up to at home?

183
00:13:05.894 --> 00:13:06.964
Nothing.

184
00:13:08.264 --> 00:13:10.433
Enjoy that life while you still can.

185
00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:12.833
We're getting a lot of offers,

186
00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:14.443
but nothing's worthwhile.

187
00:13:15.203 --> 00:13:17.144
- Director Shin... - He'll call one day.

188
00:13:18.573 --> 00:13:19.974
How about "We Got Married"?

189
00:13:20.543 --> 00:13:23.214
- They're calling nonstop. - The variety show?

190
00:13:23.783 --> 00:13:24.813
It's over.

191
00:13:25.553 --> 00:13:27.413
They're coming back with a fifth season.

192
00:13:27.783 --> 00:13:29.224
Everyone knows you never dated.

193
00:13:29.423 --> 00:13:31.953
They want you to have your first relationship on camera.

194
00:13:31.953 --> 00:13:34.264
That's just as ludicrous as Socrates eating rice in soup.

195
00:13:34.923 --> 00:13:37.833
Should she just do variety shows? Is she an entertainer?

196
00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:39.234
She's an actress.

197
00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:41.833
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:43.933
Don't take it out on him!

199
00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:46.234
- Hong Hee, eat up. - Okay.

200
00:13:57.453 --> 00:13:59.884
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

201
00:14:09.193 --> 00:14:11.163
(Mom)

202
00:14:20.104 --> 00:14:21.644
The receiver cannot be reached...

203
00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:24.104
Why is this fool not picking up?

204
00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:26.014
He's so useless.

205
00:14:30.514 --> 00:14:34.153
- Oh, dear. I'll... - Let me help.

206
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:39.354
- It's me, ma'am. - Isn't it?

207
00:14:40.423 --> 00:14:42.663
My goodness. Ji Won.

208
00:14:42.663 --> 00:14:45.063
- How have you been? - Oh, dear.

209
00:14:45.764 --> 00:14:48.303
You're Ji Won, aren't you? I don't believe this.

210
00:14:48.303 --> 00:14:49.663
I live on the 13th floor.

211
00:14:49.663 --> 00:14:51.903
I wanted to say hi, but it got delayed.

212
00:14:51.903 --> 00:14:54.943
- I'm sorry. - Don't be. I'm glad you're back.

213
00:14:55.004 --> 00:14:58.274
The nights were getting longer, and I thought of you.

214
00:14:58.644 --> 00:15:02.443
Ji Won, it's so good to see you're back.

215
00:15:02.783 --> 00:15:05.214
What about your mom? Where is she?

216
00:15:08.224 --> 00:15:09.624
How could you?

217
00:15:09.823 --> 00:15:13.124
Kwang Hee, you're so heartless.

218
00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:15.224
Why didn't you tell us before?

219
00:15:16.394 --> 00:15:17.494
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:18.594 --> 00:15:20.663
Because of my Ho Sung...

221
00:15:23.104 --> 00:15:25.303
So how have you been?

222
00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:28.673
How was life? Did you live okay?

223
00:15:28.874 --> 00:15:31.774
Mi Kyung, actually, I...

224
00:15:36.913 --> 00:15:38.783
I talked to Mi Kyung.

225
00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:40.283
Did you cry?

226
00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:43.384
Anything will get the waterworks going at my age.

227
00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:46.724
Will you come over on Thursday?

228
00:15:48.394 --> 00:15:50.094
- Yes. - My goodness.

229
00:15:50.094 --> 00:15:53.433
I'll finally get to see my son. Did you have dinner?

230
00:15:55.134 --> 00:15:56.403
I will now.

231
00:16:08.514 --> 00:16:10.183
- Ta-da. - Gosh.

232
00:16:11.014 --> 00:16:15.823
Mom said you can't have jjajangmyeon.

233
00:16:15.823 --> 00:16:16.984
Don't tell Mom.

234
00:16:18.354 --> 00:16:20.724
It's our secret. Sealed.

235
00:16:21.894 --> 00:16:23.063
Watch carefully, Ji Won.

236
00:16:24.134 --> 00:16:27.634
This is the tastiest way to eat this.

237
00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:38.374
Here you go.

238
00:16:45.514 --> 00:16:48.653
You won't forget this, will you?

239
00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:49.683
No.

240
00:16:52.724 --> 00:16:55.193
- Even after I'm gone? - Yes.

241

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

242
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:39.774
Good morning.

243
00:17:48.684 --> 00:17:49.783
I'm sorry for being late.

244
00:17:55.754 --> 00:17:57.654
- Lawyer Jang. - Yes.

245
00:17:57.793 --> 00:18:00.593
Did you do the research for recent decisions made for...

246
00:18:00.593 --> 00:18:03.323
- the university student protesters? - Yes, one minute, please.

247
00:18:11.704 --> 00:18:12.833
Analyze those.

248
00:18:12.904 --> 00:18:15.204
Then write up a petition to turn in to the commission on human rights.

249
00:18:15.543 --> 00:18:16.573
Oh, all right.

250
00:18:17.073 --> 00:18:18.514
- And... - Yes?

251
00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:21.184
what about the victims of habitual violence in Hanguk University?

252
00:18:21.484 --> 00:18:23.543
I talked to them and left a record.

253
00:18:23.543 --> 00:18:25.914
Check if there are more victims.

254
00:18:26.014 --> 00:18:27.014
Yes, sir.

255
00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:32.893
Lawyer Kang, you must be very busy.

256
00:18:34.863 --> 00:18:36.764
Ma'am, should we grab a cup of coffee?

257
00:18:36.764 --> 00:18:39.063
Of course, thank you.

258
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.404
Oh, I'll get it.

259
00:18:42.803 --> 00:18:44.004
How did you know?

260
00:18:44.004 --> 00:18:46.103
I prefer coffee made by you.

261
00:18:50.573 --> 00:18:53.573
Goodness, look at your desk.

262
00:18:53.573 --> 00:18:55.343
Your desk is a mess.

263
00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.883
Goodness, this is like a pigpen.

264
00:18:57.883 --> 00:19:00.053
Oh, you can leave that. I'll clean it up...

265
00:19:00.053 --> 00:19:02.883
Look at this, you don't even separate your trash.

266
00:19:02.883 --> 00:19:05.053
You're giving me a lot of work.

267
00:19:05.053 --> 00:19:08.393
Oh, I'll do it myself. Give me one second.

268
00:19:08.964 --> 00:19:12.063
Goodness, you're dripping coffee all over the garbage can.

269
00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:14.633
How much mess are you making for a cup of coffee?

270
00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:17.063
You really don't have a way with chores.

271
00:19:17.204 --> 00:19:18.504
You're of no use.

272
00:19:18.974 --> 00:19:20.504
There was a spoon right there.

273
00:19:20.504 --> 00:19:22.143
Why would you use the packet?

274
00:19:22.373 --> 00:19:24.744
- I'm sorry. - You're making my life hard.

275
00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:27.414
Some people only make a mess, while other only clean up.

276
00:19:44.633 --> 00:19:47.533
- Do you want a hotteok? - Sure, sounds great.

277
00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.504
Could you hurry?

278
00:19:49.934 --> 00:19:51.974
- That looks great. - This one is for you.

279
00:20:00.984 --> 00:20:01.984
(The Four Bongos)

280
00:20:01.984 --> 00:20:03.714
Hey, hotteok lover, what are you up to?

281
00:20:04.014 --> 00:20:05.853
The hotteok lady is out. Do you want to come out?

282
00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:10.994
I'm eating dinner with people from work. I'll be late.

283
00:20:12.024 --> 00:20:14.724
It's the hotteok lover's D-day.

284
00:20:17.024 --> 00:20:18.434
Oh, is this your first day of dating?

285
00:20:19.694 --> 00:20:21.033
Bingo!

286
00:20:26.474 --> 00:20:29.043
Ah Reum. Han Ah Reum.

287
00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:39.414
Mom, what is it?

288
00:20:40.214 --> 00:20:43.583
Over here. Can you take this?

289
00:20:46.293 --> 00:20:47.393
And this one.

290
00:20:49.293 --> 00:20:50.793
What's all this?

291
00:20:53.734 --> 00:20:54.904
Can't you tell?

292
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:56.833
These are the things...

293
00:20:56.833 --> 00:20:58.904
I stocked up to give you if and when you get married.

294
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:02.904
I can't believe I went through all this trouble.

295
00:21:03.404 --> 00:21:06.073
- Why did you bring them down? - Why do you ask?

296
00:21:06.143 --> 00:21:08.343
I can't leave them to rot forever...

297
00:21:08.613 --> 00:21:10.914
up in the cupboard.

298
00:21:11.714 --> 00:21:14.754
I'm giving them to your youngest aunt. She recently bought a house.

299
00:21:15.123 --> 00:21:17.754
No, put them back. Put them back in there.

300
00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:20.424
Goodness, you're so greedy.

301
00:21:20.424 --> 00:21:21.764
No.

302
00:21:22.224 --> 00:21:24.893
Mom, I'll get married soon.

303
00:21:27.063 --> 00:21:30.404
I'm running out of breath from badmouthing you.

304
00:21:31.073 --> 00:21:33.674
Give me three more months, Mom.

305
00:21:34.073 --> 00:21:36.103
I'll bring a guy home soon,

306
00:21:36.103 --> 00:21:37.944
so you can get washed up,

307
00:21:37.944 --> 00:21:40.043
and be ready to greet him.

308
00:21:40.373 --> 00:21:42.414
Let's continue after you bring home a guy.

309
00:21:42.783 --> 00:21:45.553
Mom, I'm on my way out to meet a man.

310
00:21:45.754 --> 00:21:47.484
Gosh, did you pour a bottle of perfume on yourself?

311
00:21:47.484 --> 00:21:49.524
Go and clean up your room.

312
00:21:49.524 --> 00:21:51.954
Your room is such a mess.

313
00:21:52.254 --> 00:21:53.494
That hurts.

314
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.934
Where are you? I got here already.

315
00:22:04.934 --> 00:22:07.404
(Co-pilot Lee Dong Hoon, Where are you? I got here already.)

316
00:22:07.404 --> 00:22:09.803
I'm almost there. I'll see you soon.

317
00:22:27.623 --> 00:22:30.664
- Ms. Han. - Oh, hey. You're here.

318
00:22:34.434 --> 00:22:37.033
- The co-pilot is almost here. - Really?

319
00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:41.643
Hey, you look prettier.

320
00:22:41.774 --> 00:22:44.004
- Is there a happy occasion? - No, not really.

321
00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:47.343
Right, Ms. Han. Take this.

322
00:22:48.113 --> 00:22:49.184
What is this?

323
00:22:49.244 --> 00:22:51.853
You said it was pretty in Vietnam, so I got that in Itaewon.

324
00:22:51.853 --> 00:22:55.053
Goodness, you have such a great sense.

325
00:22:55.283 --> 00:22:57.254
How did you remember?

326
00:22:57.524 --> 00:22:59.694
My gosh, you're so smart.

327
00:23:03.063 --> 00:23:04.093
Isn't it pretty?

328
00:23:04.563 --> 00:23:08.303
Yes, it is. It's so pretty. Thank you so much.

329
00:23:12.904 --> 00:23:13.974
Hello.

330
00:23:26.184 --> 00:23:30.024
Right, he should sit across from me to get a better look at my face.

331
00:23:30.383 --> 00:23:33.293
He's sitting at a 45-degree angle. This is great.

332
00:23:33.823 --> 00:23:35.823
Mr. Lee, was the traffic bad?

333
00:23:35.994 --> 00:23:38.164
- I'm a bit late. - No, don't worry.

334
00:23:38.164 --> 00:23:41.164
My teammates aren't here either. Where are they?

335
00:23:41.404 --> 00:23:43.333
- Cheers! - Cheers!

336
00:24:09.563 --> 00:24:10.694
- Hee Jin. - Yes.

337
00:24:10.694 --> 00:24:13.764
I thought you wouldn't like a place like this.

338
00:24:13.764 --> 00:24:17.573
I love it, but no one would ask me to go.

339
00:24:17.573 --> 00:24:18.734
- Hee Jin. - Yes.

340
00:24:18.734 --> 00:24:21.904
Do you know what I think whenever I see you?

341
00:24:21.904 --> 00:24:23.174
What do you think?

342
00:24:23.543 --> 00:24:25.113
There's an angel in front of me.

343
00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:31.313
- Cheers! - Cheers!

344
00:24:31.313 --> 00:24:32.754
- All right. - Bottoms up.

345
00:24:32.754 --> 00:24:33.813
All right.

346
00:24:39.724 --> 00:24:40.863
This is great.

347
00:24:41.464 --> 00:24:42.494
Ms. Han.

348
00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:47.803
- Mr. Lee, how old are you? - I'm 28.

349
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:50.563
Do you have a girlfriend?

350
00:24:51.774 --> 00:24:53.573
There's someone I like.

351
00:24:54.444 --> 00:24:56.174
That means you don't have a girlfriend.

352
00:24:56.603 --> 00:24:58.113
Who's your type?

353
00:24:58.514 --> 00:25:00.744
To be honest, you're just my type,

354
00:25:00.744 --> 00:25:02.283
but I'm five years older than you.

355
00:25:03.414 --> 00:25:04.984
Gosh, how disappointing.

356
00:25:04.984 --> 00:25:07.454
- Age isn't important. - Exactly.

357
00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:10.654
- I don't care about her age. - A 50 percent chance.

358
00:25:10.994 --> 00:25:13.093
- I like someone who's bright. - 75 percent.

359
00:25:13.393 --> 00:25:15.964
- Someone who's cheerful. - 90 percent.

360
00:25:15.964 --> 00:25:18.363
You know, someone who makes you happy when you're with them.

361
00:25:19.063 --> 00:25:20.363
A happy virus.

362
00:25:22.664 --> 00:25:24.573
This sounds exactly like...

363
00:25:25.434 --> 00:25:26.774
100 percent.

364
00:25:27.004 --> 00:25:28.904
Ji Hye.

365
00:25:29.573 --> 00:25:31.143
No way.

366
00:25:31.543 --> 00:25:33.744
- No, stop it. - Stop saying that.

367
00:25:33.744 --> 00:25:36.214
- I mean it, no way. - My gosh.

368
00:25:37.184 --> 00:25:39.754
- Oh, don't be shy. - Come on, don't say that.

369
00:25:40.613 --> 00:25:42.724
- Order more meat. - Okay.

370
00:25:43.654 --> 00:25:45.954
- Excuse me. - Yes?

371
00:25:45.954 --> 00:25:48.494
- We'll take two more orders each. - Okay.

372
00:25:51.464 --> 00:25:52.563
My goodness.

373
00:25:53.964 --> 00:25:55.833
I told you to come upstairs to join us for dinner.

374
00:25:55.904 --> 00:25:57.033
Oh, right.

375
00:25:58.704 --> 00:25:59.934
Goodbye.

376
00:26:08.783 --> 00:26:10.613
- Do you eat kimchi now? - Yes.

377
00:26:11.514 --> 00:26:13.684
- Tell me if you need more. - Okay.

378
00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:16.524
- Goodbye. - Bye.

379
00:26:22.363 --> 00:26:23.664
You need to eat breakfast.

380
00:26:24.793 --> 00:26:27.704
This is made with red beans, so keep it in the fridge.

381
00:26:27.704 --> 00:26:29.803
- Okay. - Okay, goodbye.

382
00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:32.603
- Do you have a microwave? - Yes.

383
00:26:32.603 --> 00:26:34.204
Three minutes in the microwave.

384
00:26:34.774 --> 00:26:36.274
- Three minutes? - Yes.

385
00:26:40.014 --> 00:26:41.113
Three minutes.

386
00:26:52.024 --> 00:26:53.323
Where did she go?

387
00:26:53.754 --> 00:26:56.623
She went to the restroom. She felt like throwing up.

388
00:26:56.623 --> 00:26:57.863
She wasn't there.

389
00:26:58.833 --> 00:26:59.994
Why didn't you follow her?

390
00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:03.603
She told me to stay because I was drunker than she was.

391
00:27:05.774 --> 00:27:08.004
- Where's Mr. Lee? - No idea.

392
00:27:10.704 --> 00:27:12.343
What's going on?

393
00:27:14.444 --> 00:27:16.643
Ji Hye. Ji Hye...

394
00:27:17.514 --> 00:27:18.613
Ji Hye.

395
00:27:20.684 --> 00:27:22.184
Where did she go?

396
00:27:38.033 --> 00:27:39.234
Ji Hye.

397
00:27:50.444 --> 00:27:51.714
Where did she go?

398
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:53.613
Ji Hye.

399
00:28:00.593 --> 00:28:01.664
Hey, Ji Hye.

400
00:28:11.033 --> 00:28:13.603
- Ji Hye, are you all right? - I don't know.

401
00:28:13.974 --> 00:28:15.073
Drink this.

402
00:28:24.714 --> 00:28:28.323
I really like this song.

403
00:28:29.853 --> 00:28:31.494
You shouldn't like sad songs...

404
00:28:31.724 --> 00:28:33.853
because you'll probably never be sad again.

405
00:28:35.494 --> 00:28:37.533
- Cheers. - Cheers.

406
00:28:56.014 --> 00:28:58.313
- Do you like grapes? - Yes, I do.

407
00:29:23.543 --> 00:29:26.244
What's wrong? Why aren't you saying anything? It's been a few days.

408
00:29:26.774 --> 00:29:29.283
- What? - About the co-pilot. What happened?

409
00:29:30.214 --> 00:29:33.214
Oh, him? I don't like him anymore.

410
00:29:38.593 --> 00:29:40.524
I saw him that day...

411
00:29:40.524 --> 00:29:43.494
and found out he had bad skin and a big face.

412
00:29:43.494 --> 00:29:46.033
I didn't know this when he was sitting down, but he has long waist.

413
00:29:46.033 --> 00:29:47.464
He has yellow teeth too.

414
00:29:47.464 --> 00:29:49.363
Goodness.

415
00:29:51.404 --> 00:29:53.803
He's just a kid. A kid.

416
00:29:56.474 --> 00:29:59.543
And the most important thing is, he's not funny at all.

417
00:29:59.543 --> 00:30:01.613
He's so boring. No, thank you.

418
00:30:01.613 --> 00:30:03.043
He's so boring.

419
00:30:05.184 --> 00:30:06.514
And he's dating Ji Hye.

420
00:30:06.714 --> 00:30:08.123
- What? - She must be crazy.

421
00:30:08.123 --> 00:30:10.954
Give me her number. How dare she get your man?

422
00:30:11.024 --> 00:30:12.154
She must be out of her mind.

423
00:30:12.154 --> 00:30:14.563
She's not just out of her mind. She must be a crazy scum.

424
00:30:14.623 --> 00:30:15.764
Give me her number now.

425
00:30:15.764 --> 00:30:18.934
Gosh, she's not a bad person. She's really nice.

426
00:30:21.363 --> 00:30:23.004
You're too nice.

427
00:30:23.563 --> 00:30:26.404
- Gosh. - Gosh, it was so embarrassing.

428
00:30:27.234 --> 00:30:29.274
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

429
00:30:29.274 --> 00:30:31.714
It doesn't get embarrassing after a few tries.

430
00:30:31.714 --> 00:30:34.143
Yes. And today, you can do anything you want.

431
00:30:34.143 --> 00:30:37.043
- Forget about it. - That'd be great.

432
00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:41.053
This is why I can never leave you.

433
00:30:43.184 --> 00:30:44.224
- It's cold. - Are you cold?

434
00:30:44.224 --> 00:30:46.123
- Do you want a blanket? - Yes, please.

435
00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:50.194
It used to be so hot, but now fall must be coming.

436
00:30:53.533 --> 00:30:54.904
The season of Gong Ji Won.

437
00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:58.533
- It used to remind me of Ji Won. - Why?

438
00:30:59.073 --> 00:31:01.873
You know about Ji Won's father. It happened around this time.

439
00:31:02.204 --> 00:31:05.643
It happened between summer and fall, in a weather like this.

440
00:31:07.414 --> 00:31:08.684
The weather feels like...

441
00:31:09.184 --> 00:31:12.414
a person's heart when they lose their interest in someone...

442
00:31:12.414 --> 00:31:13.813
after being in passionate love.

443
00:31:14.323 --> 00:31:15.783
Do you even know what love is?

444
00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:17.893
I read it on a script. Do you have a problem with that?

445
00:31:21.063 --> 00:31:22.823
Isn't it strange, though?

446
00:31:23.764 --> 00:31:25.734
We can remember that day so clearly.

447
00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:26.964
Right.

448
00:31:27.434 --> 00:31:31.234
Wasn't it on August 25 when Ji Won's dad passed away?

449
00:31:31.303 --> 00:31:32.333
Yes.

450
00:31:33.103 --> 00:31:34.774
Christmas in August.

451
00:32:04.533 --> 00:32:06.333
("Universal Emotions")

452
00:32:06.803 --> 00:32:07.873
That's you, right?

453
00:32:09.873 --> 00:32:11.774
- Yes. - I knew it.

454
00:32:12.043 --> 00:32:15.444
I saw my brother reading this and found you here.

455
00:32:15.843 --> 00:32:18.113
Gosh, this definitely proves it.

456
00:32:18.254 --> 00:32:20.684
Why? Did you think I was lying to you?

457
00:32:20.984 --> 00:32:23.484
No, I just envy you.

458
00:32:24.754 --> 00:32:27.964
But why are you wearing a short sleeved shirt? Look at the date.

459
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:29.893
Christmas in August?

460
00:32:32.434 --> 00:32:34.164
You don't need to know.

461
00:32:37.674 --> 00:32:40.674
Ji Won, can I ask you for advice?

462
00:32:41.444 --> 00:32:42.873
There are two things.

463
00:32:43.143 --> 00:32:46.343
There's one big trouble and another really big trouble.

464
00:32:47.744 --> 00:32:48.984
What should I start with?

465
00:32:49.184 --> 00:32:50.813
The lighter one.

466
00:32:51.684 --> 00:32:54.583
Li Ka Shing is coming to Korea next week.

467
00:32:56.024 --> 00:32:57.083
Really?

468
00:32:57.924 --> 00:32:59.853
Gosh, we'd have a lot of things to prepare.

469
00:32:59.924 --> 00:33:02.823
Do we need merger and acquisition project plan for National Chemicals?

470
00:33:02.823 --> 00:33:06.264
We would need to reexamine the business plan...

471
00:33:06.533 --> 00:33:09.633
- and the organization plan. - All right.

472
00:33:09.633 --> 00:33:12.434
Next, what's your bigger problem?

473
00:33:14.543 --> 00:33:16.204
I think I need to get married.

474
00:33:18.174 --> 00:33:19.774
I'm serious.

475
00:33:20.343 --> 00:33:21.883
I'm an eighth-generation only son.

476
00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:23.984
And my father becomes 80 next year.

477
00:33:24.514 --> 00:33:26.254
I think he's just fine,

478
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.883
but he keeps saying he could die any day now.

479
00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:31.224
He wants me to bring someone within this month.

480
00:33:31.224 --> 00:33:33.293
I really don't want to get married.

481
00:33:33.424 --> 00:33:36.063
- It does sound like a big problem. - I know, right?

482
00:33:37.123 --> 00:33:38.593
Don't your parents nag you?

483
00:33:40.234 --> 00:33:42.803
My father really...

484
00:33:43.603 --> 00:33:45.234
drives me crazy.

485
00:33:45.303 --> 00:33:48.504
He says that his wish is to have a grandson before he dies.

486
00:33:49.944 --> 00:33:53.514
He calls me every day to tell me that.

487
00:33:58.353 --> 00:33:59.914
It's a cake.

488
00:34:00.514 --> 00:34:02.254
Is it your birthday today, Dad?

489
00:34:03.454 --> 00:34:04.494
No.

490
00:34:05.623 --> 00:34:07.194
I like cakes,

491
00:34:08.063 --> 00:34:09.464
so Mom bought it for me.

492
00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:14.034
Let's make a wish before we blow out the candles.

493
00:34:14.034 --> 00:34:15.063
All right.

494
00:34:23.304 --> 00:34:25.774
Let's blow out the candles.

495
00:34:25.973 --> 00:34:31.013
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

496
00:34:36.924 --> 00:34:39.654
Did you make a wish, Ji Won?

497
00:34:40.254 --> 00:34:41.793
What was it about?

498
00:34:47.763 --> 00:34:49.504
Did you wish for a police car?

499
00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:50.603
No.

500
00:34:51.734 --> 00:34:53.504
Then was it for a fire engine?

501
00:34:54.404 --> 00:34:57.043
- A bus? - No.

502
00:34:57.513 --> 00:35:00.844
Really? Then what was it about? Is it a secret?

503
00:35:01.083 --> 00:35:02.143
No.

504
00:35:02.944 --> 00:35:04.554
Then what is it?

505
00:35:08.524 --> 00:35:10.853
I wished that you would both live...

506
00:35:12.754 --> 00:35:15.123
until you're 100 years old.

507
00:35:26.404 --> 00:35:27.973
Come here, Ji Won.

508
00:35:27.973 --> 00:35:29.143
Dad.

509
00:35:33.043 --> 00:35:36.083
How about you, Dad? What was your wish?

510
00:35:38.813 --> 00:35:40.413
I wished that I could live to see...

511
00:35:41.824 --> 00:35:43.683
you go to school.

512
00:35:48.324 --> 00:35:50.493
Just that, nothing more.

513
00:36:01.795 --> 00:36:04.995
(Episode 8 will air shortly.)
