1
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.710
From now on, you'll be a mother

2
00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:12.210
A mother?

3
00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:14.410
What do you mean?

4
00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:17.750
To be exact, you'll be a mother
in the future,

5
00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:20.520
A mother in the future?

6
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:23.590
What do you mean by that?

7
00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:24.950
In life,

8
00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.100
(Episode 18)

9
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.820
you need to experience things
in advance,

10
00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.940
You need to experience things
that will happen to you,,,

11
00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.700
in the near future,

12
00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:41.100
To put it simply, it's a white lie
that will keep the family together,

13
00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:45.140
A white lie?

14
00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:58.690
Even if I move out with Yeon Ju,

15
00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.260
I'll prove to you
that we can live happily,

16
00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:06.980
Move out? Who says I'll allow that?

17
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.600
Who would allow that?

18
00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:13.200
Gosh, do you think my daughter will
leave me and follow you? Gosh,

19
00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:15.590
Can you taste this
soy sauce marinated crab?

20
00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:17.790
Throw this away,
You're so slow-witted,

21
00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:21.390
Gosh, So Won knows how tasty
these are,,,

22
00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:24.900
and can eat anything with these,

23
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.680
but he's not a part of this family
anymore, Throw it away!

24
00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:36.890
That was when
he opened the hospital,

25
00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:41.200
It was splendid then,

26
00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:46.720
People would tell me about
how great my son-in-law was,

27
00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:48.640
"You have a great son-in-law,"

28
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.040
It made me feel so proud,

29
00:01:54.397 --> 00:01:57.450
Gosh, all these years
I've been proud of him,,,

30
00:01:58.502 --> 00:02:00.280
were all a fraud,

31
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.050
It's such a waste,

32
00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:08.190
To be honest, your daughter idled
away too much when she was young,

33
00:02:08.612 --> 00:02:10.610
I never thought she would
get her life together,

34
00:02:10.614 --> 00:02:13.260
That party girl fell so
in love with him,

35
00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:15.360
She got her act together
and married him,

36
00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:20.140
She won't be able to meet
a decent guy like him,

37
00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:22.450
You witch, Shut your mouth,

38
00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.820
You've been here long enough
to talk back to me,

39
00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.660
Every girl ought to have
some fun before marriage,

40
00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:31.130
Should they be prudes
and sleep all day?

41
00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:32.960
Let me warn you,
You'd better keep your mouth shut,

42
00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.870
Watch your tongue, and
don't overstep your boundary,

43
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:36.700
Remember who signs your paycheck,

44
00:02:36.706 --> 00:02:39.540
My perfect daughter,,,

45
00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:41.670
is about to get a divorce
after being conned,

46
00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:44.260
Are you trying to add
fuel to the fire or something?

47
00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:45.760
I'm sorry,

48
00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:49.030
Throw out the soy sauce marinated
crabs, I don't want to see them!

49
00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:51.930
Thank you, I'll get going now,

50
00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:00.340
How did it go?

51
00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:03.900
I asked my friend and got it,

52
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.880
This is great news,
The universe is on our side,

53
00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:12.020
All right, All there's left
is some smooth acting,

54
00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:13.890
Can you do it?

55
00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:17.540
- What about you?
- Me?

56
00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:21.260
I've been ready my whole life,

57
00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:24.200
My nickname is Ready Man,

58
00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.740
But shouldn't we at least
tell So Won about it?

59
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:31.560
He must be getting ready
to move out of the house,

60
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:32.690
Leave him alone,

61
00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:36.280
He might be against it
as he's a bit rigid in his thinking,

62
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.830
After we make this work,

63
00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:42.380
we should tell him then, Okay?

64
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.520
Calm down, Everything is
going to be all right,

65
00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.980
If I do the night surgeries,

66
00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.980
I'll be able to renegotiate
my annual salary, right?

67
00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.800
What on earth happened?
Since when did you care about money?

68
00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:02.520
I have my reasons,
Well, is that a possibility?

69
00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:04.090
What's going on?

70
00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:07.330
I heard your clinic is packed with
customers after starring on a show,

71
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.580
Did something happen
with your clinic?

72
00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:11.050
Was there medical malpractice?

73
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:12.900
Come on, You know me
better than that,

74
00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:14.620
Then what is it?

75
00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.650
You were always popular among girls,

76
00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:21.770
Did you get kicked out for having
an affair or something?

77
00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:24.560
I will explain it later, Let's just
talk about my salary for now,

78
00:04:25.382 --> 00:04:27.150
Can I renegotiate my salary?

79
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.750
Gosh, if you can do the night
surgeries, I'd be happy,

80
00:04:29.753 --> 00:04:31.300
When can you start?

81
00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:33.450
I can start next month,

82
00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.790
Can you commute from Seoul to Suwon?

83
00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:38.810
No, I'm going to move
to Suwon with my wife,

84
00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:42.030
The number you have dialed
is not available at the moment,

85
00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.060
You'll be connected
to the voicemail box,

86
00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:46.560
There will be charges
after the beep,

87
00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.370
Gosh, why isn't she
answering her phone?

88
00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.120
Where has she been all day?

89
00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:55.260
She has to sign
the divorce paper today,

90
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.710
Mom, did you call me?

91
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.380
My goodness, my precious daughter,

92
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:06.120
Why didn't you answer my calls?
Where have you been all day?

93
00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:08.750
We have to go
to the lawyer's office today,

94
00:05:08.758 --> 00:05:10.320
Well,,,

95
00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:11.740
Hello,

96
00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:13.880
How have you been, Mrs, Yang?

97
00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:15.440
What?

98
00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:18.310
Why are you in my house?

99
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:22.130
We already settled
the matter ages ago,

100
00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:25.050
Mrs, Yang, I,,,

101
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:26.370
I'm in trouble,

102
00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:27.920
What is it this time?

103
00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:30.860
Mrs, Yang,

104
00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:33.760
Why don't we talk
in somewhere quiet?

105
00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:35.430
With me?

106
00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:37.570
Yes,

107
00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:42.370
What is it that
you want to talk about?

108
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.810
Hey, Yeon Ju,
Is your mouth glued or something?

109
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.480
Why are you studying my face?
Why can't you talk?

110
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.050
What kind of trouble are you in?
Just fess up already,

111
00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:03.510
I'm sorry, Mom,

112
00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:07.380
Seriously? You need to
be more elaborate than that,

113
00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:09.610
How bad could it be?

114
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.130
You need to explain yourself better,

115
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.070
Well,,,

116
00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.240
What is this?

117
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.380
That's the ultrasound
image of a baby,

118
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.830
I know that,

119
00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:29.250
But why are you showing this to me?

120
00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:32.420
That's my baby, Mom,

121
00:06:35.512 --> 00:06:36.570
What did you say?

122
00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.640
I'm pregnant, I'm four weeks in,

123
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.250
You're pregnant? You?

124
00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:45.750
And she went to the OBGYN today,

125
00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:48.390
- She had the ultrasound,,,
- Hey, be quiet,

126
00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:51.370
Stop talking, Be quiet,
Don't say a word,

127
00:06:51.895 --> 00:06:55.930
Wait, your OBGYN said
that you're sterile,

128
00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:59.330
She said to conceive, you needed to
get inseminated or something,

129
00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:03.700
And you're always fighting
with Dr, Lee,

130
00:07:03.706 --> 00:07:07.570
Dr, Lee sleeps at his studio,
and you sleep at my house,

131
00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:09.810
When did you meet?
When did you get pregnant?

132
00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:11.380
It's not like you lay eggs
like flies,

133
00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:13.180
Please calm down,

134
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:15.880
Since they're still married, there's
nothing wrong with being pregnant,

135
00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:18.520
- It doesn't take long,,,
- I said to be quiet,

136
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.620
- Stop it, Why do you talk so much?
- Okay, okay, I will stop,

137
00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:23.020
- Stop talking,
- Okay,

138
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.620
- You're giving me a headache,
- I understand,

139
00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:27.810
Hold on, What should we do?

140
00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:30.260
You were about
to sign the divorce papers,

141
00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:32.260
How could you get pregnant now?

142
00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:35.420
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm not going to have this child,

143
00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:38.870
I don't want a child
of a selfish man,,,

144
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.560
who wants to separate you and me,

145
00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:45.780
Stop, Yeon Ju, you and I
can talk about that later,

146
00:07:45.782 --> 00:07:47.000
Hold on,

147
00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:53.380
But how did you know about this
to have come to my house?

148
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:57.240
I had a dream last night,

149
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:01.060
In the middle of night, Yeon Ju,,,

150
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:04.980
brought a big egg
to my house in my dream,

151
00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:08.630
- A big egg?
- Yes,

152
00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:10.440
A big egg?

153
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.990
That's right, That's it,

154
00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:15.810
So the moment,,,

155
00:08:15.812 --> 00:08:18.810
I tapped the egg,

156
00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:21.510
the egg cracked,

157
00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:24.670
and a dragon shot up to the sky,

158
00:08:25.388 --> 00:08:31.010
Out of nowhere,
the dragon bit Yeon Ju's hand,

159
00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:33.440
This is a dream
of forthcoming conception,

160
00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:36.950
It's not just an ordinary dream,

161
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.300
I think this dream is
very similar,,,

162
00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:43.070
to the dream a mother of a general
had before giving birth,

163
00:08:43.072 --> 00:08:44.540
So what happened?

164
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:48.710
At that moment, blood started to,,,

165
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:51.710
gush out from Yeon Ju's hand,

166
00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:54.900
The moment I screamed like this,

167
00:08:55.084 --> 00:08:59.330
the phone rang,
and I answered the call,

168
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.740
That's when I told him,,,

169
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.960
that I was pregnant,

170
00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.640
That's right, So this is
how it happened,

171
00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:12.580
Oh, my goodness,
What are we going to do?

172
00:09:13.036 --> 00:09:16.430
I don't know if this is
a happy or unfortunate occasion,

173
00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:20.340
I'm going crazy, Nothing like this
has happened to me in my life,

174
00:09:20.343 --> 00:09:23.310
How can this,,, I mean,,,

175
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:26.180
the importance
of one's timing in birth,,,

176
00:09:26.182 --> 00:09:29.550
applies to people, animals,
and nature,

177
00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.530
This is one bad timing,

178
00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:34.100
What should I do, Mom?

179
00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:38.870
But I heard getting
an abortion is illegal,

180
00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.040
Hey, don't you worry,

181
00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:45.110
Your marriage is over anyway,

182
00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:47.150
A baby can't make it worse
than it already is,

183
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:51.090
Raising one more child
won't be a problem,

184
00:09:51.574 --> 00:09:53.350
Give birth to the baby,
and let me raise the baby,

185
00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:54.720
We can raise the baby,

186
00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:58.240
Mr, Lee, Excuse me, Mr, Lee,

187
00:09:58.247 --> 00:10:01.830
Don't worry, I'll do my best
to raise the baby,

188
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:05.280
And please expedite the paper work,

189
00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:07.450
- Wait, Hold on,
- That's all right,

190
00:10:07.457 --> 00:10:09.820
- Mr, Lee, I will,,,
- There's no need,

191
00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:11.790
- Let's talk a bit more,
- Please sit down,

192
00:10:11.794 --> 00:10:14.060
- Let's talk for five more minutes,
- No, please don't get up,

193
00:10:14.063 --> 00:10:15.560
- Wait, that's not it,
- That's all right,

194
00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:16.960
- You don't need to walk me out,
- Wait, Mr, Lee,

195
00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:19.650
- You can't leave like this,
- That's not necessary,

196
00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:21.200
- Mr, Lee,
- That's all right,

197
00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.600
You can't leave like this,

198
00:10:23.606 --> 00:10:26.850
Please let me go,
I already made my decision,

199
00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:29.740
My son was so selfish
to ask to move out of here,

200
00:10:29.746 --> 00:10:31.610
so please let him leave
this house as soon as he can,

201
00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:34.350
- Wait, Hold on a second,
- There's no need,

202
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.910
No, that's okay, Please let me go,

203
00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:38.130
Take care then,

204
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.010
My gosh, what am I going to do?

205
00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:48.140
I don't know what to do,
What am I supposed to do now?

206
00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:51.860
Is the tasting for the managers
coming along nicely?

207
00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:54.380
Yes, All we need to prepare
are the drinks, right?

208
00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:58.020
Manager Jung is going to personally
prepare the new dish,

209
00:10:58.341 --> 00:11:01.520
Right, Please set up
a sign at the entrance,

210
00:11:01.544 --> 00:11:02.840
It's already done,

211
00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:04.860
- Thank you, Good job,
- Thank you,

212
00:11:07.316 --> 00:11:09.280
Did you take photos
of the seating arrangement?

213
00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:11.270
Yes, I did,

214
00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:14.370
Let's get going, The meeting is
about to start, We must hurry,

215
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:25.280
It smells like acacia,

216
00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:33.290
We have to catch that,

217
00:11:33.743 --> 00:11:35.860
Stop! Stop it!

218
00:11:36.312 --> 00:11:38.390
Come on! Stop the bus! Stop!

219
00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:41.000
Gosh, we missed it,

220
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.500
Darn, If only I weren't
wearing heels,,,

221
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.100
Gosh, my feet,

222
00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:47.500
Goodness, my feet hurt,

223
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:50.910
My feet hurt so much,

224
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.160
Goodness, what are you doing?
Let go of my feet,

225
00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:59.200
You must've gone crazy,
What are you doing?

226
00:11:59.202 --> 00:12:02.450
What is it? Why are you making
me wear your sneakers?

227
00:12:02.605 --> 00:12:06.340
You'd better let go of me now,
Let go of me! I said let go! Shoot,

228
00:12:06.342 --> 00:12:07.590
Hey!

229
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:10.360
Why are you doing this to me?

230
00:12:10.613 --> 00:12:12.630
Are you a pervert
that likes women's shoes?

231
00:12:13.282 --> 00:12:14.500
If you're not, what is it?

232
00:12:14.584 --> 00:12:15.900
You want me to
buy something from you?

233
00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:18.270
Who are you?

234
00:12:19.922 --> 00:12:21.240
Are you a ghost or something?

235
00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.540
Why won't you say anything?

236
00:12:23.593 --> 00:12:26.370
You got everything from me,
Even my hat and shoes,

237
00:12:26.696 --> 00:12:28.340
Why are you doing this to me?

238
00:12:28.431 --> 00:12:29.830
What did I do wrong?

239
00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.580
If you have a mouth, talk,

240
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:33.430
You're so pretty,

241
00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:35.200
I can't hear you, Speak louder,

242
00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:36.720
Why are you doing this to me?

243
00:12:37.206 --> 00:12:39.520
You're so,,,

244
00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:40.810
What?

245
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.390
You're so pretty!

246
00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:54.470
Pretty? I'm pretty?

247
00:12:56.492 --> 00:12:59.370
I've never heard that in my life,

248
00:13:16.946 --> 00:13:19.890
Are those two kids
the only children you have?

249
00:13:20.116 --> 00:13:21.600
Of,,, Of course,

250
00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.400
I only have two children,

251
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.870
Why do you ask?

252
00:13:27.156 --> 00:13:28.370
I just wanted to make sure,

253
00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:31.610
You wanted to have a child then,

254
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.620
Dad,

255
00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:52.910
Are you looking at that again?

256
00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.810
Yes, I was just thinking about
the old days,

257
00:13:55.818 --> 00:13:57.270
You should throw it away,

258
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.550
It's time you admit
there's no one in this world,,,

259
00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:03.040
with your lineage,

260
00:14:03.359 --> 00:14:06.640
All right, That's why you should
get married,,,

261
00:14:06.696 --> 00:14:08.880
and make me a family,

262
00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:10.780
Don't worry,

263
00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:14.480
I went to Tae Yang's home last night
and met his parents,

264
00:14:15.404 --> 00:14:16.780
How was it like?

265
00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:18.850
His mother is beautiful,

266
00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.120
She's a sports dancer,

267
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.860
She's living happily with a husband
who is 10 years younger than her,

268
00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.030
Really?

269
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:27.760
She's so lucky,

270
00:14:29.252 --> 00:14:30.360
I know,

271
00:14:31.821 --> 00:14:35.870
By the way, when will Lee Ru Ri
become a full-time employee?

272
00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:40.910
Tae Yang compliments her so much,
I think it'll be around next week,

273
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.680
You should delay it a little,

274
00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:46.480
I think she lacks the capacity,

275
00:14:46.702 --> 00:14:47.880
Really?

276
00:14:49.906 --> 00:14:53.250
You're not jealous of her, are you?

277
00:14:53.943 --> 00:14:55.260
Come on, Dad,

278
00:14:55.711 --> 00:14:57.630
I'm changing,

279
00:14:58.614 --> 00:15:01.000
You'll know
when you taste the food today,

280
00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:12.010
You know that there will be a new
menu tasting at 6pm today, right?

281
00:15:12.228 --> 00:15:14.740
Yes, I just checked the venue,

282
00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:17.880
Ms, Lee Ru Ri, how are
the ingredients going?

283
00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:22.520
I've made an order for 20 people
to arrive at 3pm promptly,

284
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.350
Can you add two more servings?

285
00:15:27.743 --> 00:15:30.160
Yes, we have more time,
It's possible,

286
00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:31.960
Add two more then,

287
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:35.000
You know how important
this is, right?

288
00:15:35.484 --> 00:15:37.700
The honor of our team
relies on this,

289
00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:39.620
Let's not make any mistakes,

290
00:15:39.622 --> 00:15:41.140
- Yes, Manager Jung,
- Yes, Manager Jung,

291
00:15:57.673 --> 00:16:00.490
Okay, Lee Ru Ri, Enjoy all you want,

292
00:16:03.012 --> 00:16:05.130
(Ingredients and amount)

293
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.740
(The order has been completed,)

294
00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:18.770
I ordered more ingredients,

295
00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.410
Shall I help with sauce preparation?

296
00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:24.850
Let's eat,

297
00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:26.480
Come here and taste this,

298
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.020
I think this is a little salty,

299
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:31.590
This is important,
You need to do your best,

300
00:16:32.641 --> 00:16:34.070
Oh, my, This is good,

301
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.260
- Is it?
- Does it taste okay?

302
00:16:35.344 --> 00:16:36.810
I knew Myung Rang could do this,

303
00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:39.380
Gosh, you can cook so well
by just looking at the recipe,

304
00:16:39.382 --> 00:16:40.480
I'm good,

305
00:16:40.483 --> 00:16:41.710
She's talented,

306
00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:42.860
Have some more,

307
00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:44.550
Spoon?

308
00:16:44.553 --> 00:16:46.370
- Yes,
- Give me one spoon,

309
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.200
(Ingredient orders for 2 people)

310
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.140
Don't put in too much,

311
00:16:54.196 --> 00:16:55.640
(Ingredient orders for 2 people)

312
00:16:55.965 --> 00:16:57.210
(The order has been completed,)

313
00:17:01.203 --> 00:17:03.700
What are you doing?
I saw him wash his hands,

314
00:17:03.706 --> 00:17:06.240
- Did you wash your hands?
- I did in the morning,

315
00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:09.120
Why are you pasting this mayonnaise?
This is not some clay toy,

316
00:17:13.716 --> 00:17:17.110
Grandma, is this Grandpa's?

317
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.500
Yes, how did you know?

318
00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:22.270
It's really big,

319
00:17:22.525 --> 00:17:24.590
But why are there so many?

320
00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:28.980
I bought a lot, so that
he could wear them for a long time,

321
00:17:29.365 --> 00:17:32.550
You don't even like Grandpa,

322
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:35.050
Why do you buy him a lot of clothes?

323
00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:42.490
There's something called attachment,

324
00:17:43.712 --> 00:17:47.500
Even when I'm far away from him,
I don't want to see him,,,

325
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.730
looking all scruffy,

326
00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:53.730
Young Hye! Young Hye!

327
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.650
Come here, Come here for a moment,
Hurry,

328
00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.010
Come here, Come,

329
00:17:58.594 --> 00:17:59.810
What is it?

330
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.310
I think you married really well,

331
00:18:03.699 --> 00:18:07.650
You must have saved a country in
your previous life to have met me,

332
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.250
What are you talking about?

333
00:18:09.472 --> 00:18:12.250
We don't need to worry from now on,

334
00:18:12.641 --> 00:18:15.940
If you wait a little,
Mrs, Yang will come,,,

335
00:18:15.945 --> 00:18:18.560
and take So Won back home,
You can look forward to it,

336
00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:20.730
How about me?

337
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.250
You should go too,

338
00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:24.670
It's 1 plus 1,

339
00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:28.550
What are you talking about?

340
00:18:28.557 --> 00:18:31.720
You left early in the morning,
What have you been up to?

341
00:18:31.727 --> 00:18:34.410
You're annoying me again,

342
00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:37.800
I've spent the whole day
running around,,,

343
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.350
just so that I can save my son,

344
00:18:39.502 --> 00:18:41.550
So what have really you done?

345
00:18:41.904 --> 00:18:43.020
Don't be surprised,

346
00:18:44.173 --> 00:18:46.690
I just told Yeon Ju,,,

347
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.000
I made Yeon Ju pregnant,

348
00:19:00.256 --> 00:19:01.440
What?

349
00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:05.170
I'm pregnant, Mom,

350
00:19:08.631 --> 00:19:10.010
Gosh,

351
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.410
Gosh, now I understand why people
say you can laugh,

352
00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:15.250
but be sad at the same time,

353
00:19:16.105 --> 00:19:18.250
Gosh, it's driving me crazy,

354
00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:21.340
Gosh, how can the sky be so cruel?

355
00:19:21.343 --> 00:19:23.790
This is such a bad timing,

356
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.930
Hey! Hey!

357
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:30.200
Yes, ma'am, Did you call me?

358
00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:33.570
I need the
soy sauce marinated crab again,

359
00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:35.600
I'm going to call Dr, Lee
this evening,

360
00:19:36.025 --> 00:19:40.240
Cook some radish soup for me,
You're good at it, Put some oysters,

361
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:45.050
He's my grandchild's father,
I need to think about it again,

362
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:48.320
Gosh, it's nice to hear
you've changed your thought,

363
00:19:48.904 --> 00:19:52.200
In seven months,
the child will be born,

364
00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:53.690
They can't get separated,

365
00:19:53.709 --> 00:19:55.320
What are you talking about?

366
00:19:55.878 --> 00:19:58.430
Yeon Ju said she's been pregnant
for four weeks,

367
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:01.680
No, when I was four months pregnant
with my daughter,

368
00:20:01.684 --> 00:20:03.550
I could only see a dot,

369
00:20:03.552 --> 00:20:05.400
This one has arms and legs,

370
00:20:06.922 --> 00:20:09.400
- Are you sure?
- It's true,

371
00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:11.670
This is a photo of a baby
that's three months old,

372
00:20:18.734 --> 00:20:20.480
Darn this girl,

373
00:20:23.939 --> 00:20:26.790
So Won, it's all solved now,

374
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.710
We don't need to get separated,

375
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:30.560
we don't need to move out
of Mom's house,

376
00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:33.330
and we can live with Han Gyul,

377
00:20:34.016 --> 00:20:36.000
It's all thanks to your father,

378
00:20:42.358 --> 00:20:43.900
What are you doing?

379
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:46.160
Gosh, why are you kissing,,,

380
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:48.990
your husband's photo?
What's the happy occasion?

381
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.280
Don't you know?

382
00:20:50.432 --> 00:20:52.000
I'm educating the baby,

383
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.780
I want a baby that looks like him,

384
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.470
You're kissing his photo
because you're pregnant?

385
00:20:58.474 --> 00:20:59.950
Stop saying things like that,

386
00:21:00.142 --> 00:21:02.020
You should talk nicely to me
as I'm pregnant,

387
00:21:02.278 --> 00:21:05.610
Gosh, you've nearly become
a swindler yourself,

388
00:21:05.614 --> 00:21:07.490
Tell me, Who's the culprit?

389
00:21:07.883 --> 00:21:11.500
Was it you, your father-in-law,
or Dr, Lee? Say it,

390
00:21:11.754 --> 00:21:13.780
What do you mean a culprit?

391
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:18.420
Who's the person that brought me
someone else's photo of a baby,,,

392
00:21:18.427 --> 00:21:20.890
that's three months old to trick me?

393
00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:23.140
Who's the culprit?

394
00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:24.310
Mom,

395
00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.750
Tell me, Who was it?

396
00:21:26.802 --> 00:21:28.200
Mom, I'm sorry,

397
00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:31.550
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry,

398
00:21:31.607 --> 00:21:33.970
I didn't mean to,
but Father told me,,,

399
00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:36.970
Father told me
that it's a white lie,

400
00:21:36.979 --> 00:21:39.980
What? A white lie?

401
00:21:39.982 --> 00:21:42.160
A white lie?

402
00:21:42.451 --> 00:21:44.770
Gosh, that man,

403
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.150
As if it wasn't enough
that he tricked me all these years,

404
00:21:48.157 --> 00:21:50.620
he's using his brain to make you
pretend like you're pregnant?

405
00:21:50.626 --> 00:21:51.790
Darn it,

406
00:21:51.794 --> 00:21:54.910
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- Darn it,

407
00:21:56.965 --> 00:21:58.910
Darn that family,

408
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:01.320
Gosh, Your crazy father-in-law

409
00:22:01.503 --> 00:22:05.920
My daughter is torn up
because of his son,

410
00:22:05.941 --> 00:22:08.840
How could he lie
that you're pregnant?

411
00:22:08.844 --> 00:22:12.410
If he wasn't your father-in-law,

412
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:16.780
I would have already
chewed him to death,

413
00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:18.620
Mom, it's my fault,

414
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.350
- What did I do to deserve this?
- Mom,

415
00:22:22.358 --> 00:22:25.590
Call the moving company!

416
00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:29.830
I'm sick of that family,
I'm really going to end this,

417
00:22:29.832 --> 00:22:33.050
Completely end it,

418
00:22:33.302 --> 00:22:36.470
I'm so angry,

419
00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:38.750
Oh, my,

420
00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:47.430
It's strange,

421
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:53.070
She should have called to cancel
the divorce by now,

422
00:22:53.756 --> 00:22:56.000
Why is she so unresponsive?

423
00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:59.090
Can you stay still?

424
00:22:59.094 --> 00:23:02.240
You're confusing me because
you're moving around so much,

425
00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:03.810
Be quiet!

426
00:23:04.099 --> 00:23:06.530
I'm already upset, You don't have
to make me more upset,

427
00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:10.050
Can't I walk with my own feet
in my own house?

428
00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.250
Why are you upset?

429
00:23:12.741 --> 00:23:15.410
Why? It's all because of you,

430
00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:17.540
What did I do?

431
00:23:17.546 --> 00:23:18.940
Don't you know?

432
00:23:18.947 --> 00:23:21.930
My family is in trouble
because you appeared out of nowhere,

433
00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:24.750
Why are you staring at me like that?

434
00:23:24.753 --> 00:23:26.950
You're the loudest here,

435
00:23:26.955 --> 00:23:29.120
You're always yelling,

436
00:23:29.124 --> 00:23:32.020
You're always mad at Grandma
and Aunt Ru Ri,

437
00:23:32.027 --> 00:23:34.240
I can't stand it because
you're so loud,

438
00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:38.450
You punk, When did I ever yell?

439
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.870
My voice is naturally loud,

440
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.700
If you do that one more time,,,

441
00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:47.220
You're so loud, Be quiet,
It's an order,

442
00:23:48.911 --> 00:23:50.460
Gosh,

443
00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:52.190
Honey,

444
00:23:52.781 --> 00:23:55.330
Something happened, Please come out,

445
00:23:55.717 --> 00:23:57.330
What happened?

446
00:23:57.719 --> 00:23:59.520
Just come out, Hurry,

447
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:00.600
What?

448
00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:07.440
Mrs, Yang must have called,

449
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.010
Oh, my,

450
00:24:14.803 --> 00:24:16.680
What are these?

451
00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:18.900
These are from Cheongdam-dong,

452
00:24:18.907 --> 00:24:21.790
These are So Won's stuff,
Mrs, Yang sent them,

453
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.560
What?

454
00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:25.760
These are So Won's?

455
00:24:25.981 --> 00:24:29.900
Does she want them to get divorced?

456
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.770
Oh, my, My head aches,

457
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.070
Honey, are you okay?

458
00:24:41.196 --> 00:24:43.380
Where is So Won?

459
00:24:46.168 --> 00:24:47.750
Where is he right now?

460
00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:56.420
We barely paid back
the loan for this month too,

461
00:24:57.746 --> 00:25:00.480
Oh, right, Why didn't you pay for
the living expenses for this month?

462
00:25:00.482 --> 00:25:02.600
Can I pass for this month?

463
00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:05.800
Most of the students quit
because the weather got cold,

464
00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:09.740
You know what the advantage
of being older, right?

465
00:25:10.626 --> 00:25:12.070
You're a capable older woman,

466
00:25:12.294 --> 00:25:15.460
I'm sorry, Beauty is
the only thing I have,

467
00:25:15.464 --> 00:25:16.580
Gosh,

468
00:25:17.966 --> 00:25:20.160
Mom, just wait for a little while,

469
00:25:20.168 --> 00:25:22.230
I'm going to earn a lot of money
and give all of it to you,

470
00:25:22.237 --> 00:25:24.280
Really? How will you do that?

471
00:25:26.041 --> 00:25:27.290
I'm home,

472
00:25:29.545 --> 00:25:30.720
Oh, my,

473
00:25:30.979 --> 00:25:32.090
Gosh,

474
00:25:33.949 --> 00:25:35.450
Do you understand now?

475
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.550
I'm going to make Woo Joo a star
and make a fortune,

476
00:25:38.554 --> 00:25:41.650
Is that why you asked
me to change my hairstyle?

477
00:25:41.657 --> 00:25:43.220
Yes, didn't you know?

478
00:25:43.225 --> 00:25:45.010
You punk,

479
00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:53.550
Yes, Mi Joo,

480
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:56.550
What?

481
00:25:57.105 --> 00:26:01.020
Yes, okay, Thank you,

482
00:26:02.711 --> 00:26:06.030
Honey, I need to go
to the bookstore,

483
00:26:06.281 --> 00:26:07.760
Why do you have to go
to the bookstore so suddenly?

484
00:26:08.784 --> 00:26:10.100
I think she found my sister,

485
00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:12.100
Really?

486
00:26:18.226 --> 00:26:20.310
This is Sarah Kang,
Jung Hwa Young's sister,

487
00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:23.780
She was a professor at the Seattle
Dance Academy, but she quit,

488
00:26:25.133 --> 00:26:28.220
What does she do to make it
this hard to find her?

489
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.720
Ma'am, We just got a call
from the US,

490
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.690
We finally found the criminal record
of Jung Hwa Young,

491
00:26:37.879 --> 00:26:38.960
Really?

492
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.640
Attempted murder?

493
00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:53.310
She failed to murder
her husband, Jay, 30 years ago,

494
00:26:53.962 --> 00:26:55.480
She was put on the wanted list,

495
00:26:56.164 --> 00:26:58.000
Her whereabouts were unknown
after that,

496
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.700
so it became a cold case,

497
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:02.030
(Cold case: A case that's been left
unsolved for a long time,)

498
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:06.240
My son is living with a woman,,,

499
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:09.420
who is a criminal that
attempted to kill her husband?

500
00:27:11.613 --> 00:27:12.760
I can't believe this,

501
00:27:21.356 --> 00:27:23.070
I found it, Here,

502
00:27:25.694 --> 00:27:27.740
She said that she was in
the performance news section,

503
00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:29.240
Give it to me,

504
00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:39.090
(Sarah Kang,
Tokyo Dance Academy professor)

505
00:27:41.476 --> 00:27:43.660
Is this your sister?

506
00:27:46.281 --> 00:27:48.400
(Sarah Kang,
Tokyo Dance Academy professor)

507
00:27:50.786 --> 00:27:51.970
Is it her?

508
00:27:55.657 --> 00:27:58.240
I'm scared to actually meet her,

509
00:27:58.727 --> 00:28:00.290
It's been 30 years,

510
00:28:00.295 --> 00:28:02.040
Will she recognize me?

511
00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.280
Of course,

512
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.210
She would have thought
about you every day,

513
00:28:07.235 --> 00:28:09.320
I really want to meet my sister,

514
00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:15.690
I'm so nervous,

515
00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:18.640
The tasting has to be successful,

516
00:28:18.647 --> 00:28:20.910
You don't have to be nervous,

517
00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:22.800
Just do it like you usually do,

518
00:28:25.053 --> 00:28:28.120
Yes, everyone is talking about
how good the new menus are,

519
00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:30.340
Don't worry, Do your best,

520
00:28:33.862 --> 00:28:34.910
Ru Ri,

521
00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:37.280
Why is she so kind to you?

522
00:28:37.766 --> 00:28:40.250
They say that if one doesn't act
like usual, they'll die soon,

523
00:28:40.302 --> 00:28:41.520
I don't know,

524
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.270
Myung Rang, I can't make
a mistake today,

525
00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:46.740
I need to make this to become
a regular employee,

526
00:28:46.742 --> 00:28:49.190
Please help me
not to make a mistake,

527
00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:52.530
Don't worry, I'll help
you with all my might,

528
00:28:53.081 --> 00:28:54.950
Okay, let's wish
ourselves good luck,

529
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.500
Okay, 1, 2, 3, let's do it!

530
00:28:58.053 --> 00:29:00.250
- That went all right,
- Let's go,

531
00:29:00.255 --> 00:29:01.250
Shall we do it one more time?

532
00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:02.900
1, 2, 3, let's do it,

533
00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.270
We can do it,

534
00:29:09.698 --> 00:29:11.080
They can dream as much as they want,

535
00:29:11.767 --> 00:29:13.050
A regular employee?

536
00:29:15.237 --> 00:29:18.750
Lee Ru Ri, this will be
the end for you,

537
00:29:22.277 --> 00:29:24.990
Did they only send one box?

538
00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:27.590
I was about to check too because
it seemed strange,

539
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:29.650
They only gave us ingredients enough
for two servings,,,

540
00:29:29.651 --> 00:29:32.100
when there are 22 people,

541
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:37.440
Ru Ri!

542
00:29:38.727 --> 00:29:39.760
Yes?

543
00:29:39.761 --> 00:29:41.270
Did you order correctly?

544
00:29:41.496 --> 00:29:44.240
Of course, I ordered ingredients
enough for 22 people,

545
00:29:49.971 --> 00:29:52.640
Is this Fresh Distribution?
This is SC Food and Beverage,

546
00:29:52.641 --> 00:29:54.520
I'd like to check our order
for today,

547
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:57.920
Are you sure?

548
00:29:58.213 --> 00:30:00.430
Can we order additionally right now?

549
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.600
Really? Okay,

550
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.200
Why? Is there something wrong?

551
00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:10.350
They said that we only
ordered two servings,

552
00:30:10.358 --> 00:30:11.720
We can't order more,

553
00:30:11.726 --> 00:30:14.060
What? That's not possible,

554
00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:16.240
I certainly ordered for 22 people,

555
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.350
Manager Jung, look at this,

556
00:30:25.507 --> 00:30:28.140
(2 servings of ingredients)

557
00:30:28.143 --> 00:30:31.270
Oh, my, Ru Ri, what happened?

558
00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:33.690
You must have written
2 instead of 22,

559
00:30:36.484 --> 00:30:37.700
I didn't,

560
00:30:37.886 --> 00:30:40.020
I really ordered for 22 people,

561
00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:41.450
Manager Jung, I really did,

562
00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:43.070
That's not important right now,

563
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:46.310
The guests will come soon,
Let's get the ingredients first,

564
00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:49.080
I know a good supplier,

565
00:30:49.831 --> 00:30:52.410
Let's go together, I need to check
them out with my own eyes,

566
00:30:52.701 --> 00:30:53.750
Okay,

567
00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:03.540
Gosh, This is really strange,

568
00:31:03.545 --> 00:31:05.930
I really ordered for 22 people,

569
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:09.260
It already happened,
Let's just make the sauce first,

570
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:15.770
Sung Tan, let's do it together,

571
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.540
(2 servings of ingredients)

572
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.120
Is that enough?

573
00:31:30.472 --> 00:31:31.940
The color of the fat
isn't clear enough,

574
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.040
Can we look at some meat
with better quality?

575
00:31:34.042 --> 00:31:35.740
Okay, Please wait for a minute,

576
00:31:35.744 --> 00:31:37.370
Did you say you needed 22 servings?

577
00:31:37.379 --> 00:31:40.260
Yes, We don't have much time,
so please hurry,

578
00:31:40.448 --> 00:31:41.490
Okay,

579
00:31:43.551 --> 00:31:45.870
How could this happen
on an important day like this?

580
00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.840
Don't be too anxious,

581
00:31:55.196 --> 00:31:56.740
We still have some time,

582
00:31:57.699 --> 00:32:00.550
Everything will be okay,

583
00:32:00.902 --> 00:32:03.180
Your menu is amazing,

584
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.420
Thank you,

585
00:32:06.675 --> 00:32:08.460
You saved me,

586
00:32:08.643 --> 00:32:09.760
Really?

587
00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.530
I'm glad to hear that,

588
00:32:13.448 --> 00:32:16.200
I wanted to help you,,,

589
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:18.800
to make up for what I did,

590
00:32:19.254 --> 00:32:21.700
Let's forget about the past,

591
00:32:21.957 --> 00:32:23.070
Thank you,

592
00:32:45.613 --> 00:32:48.160
Why doesn't he respond?

593
00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:50.830
Is he still looking for
the ingredients?

594
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.000
Goodness,

595
00:32:55.924 --> 00:32:57.400
I'm such an idiot,

596
00:32:57.792 --> 00:33:01.020
I can't face him again
if I ruin this,

597
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:02.480
Such an idiot,

598
00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:20.260
I've never told you this before,
have I?

599
00:33:21.016 --> 00:33:22.400
Yeon Ju, I love you,

600
00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:25.770
Let's not break up,

601
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:46.290
I'm sorry, Mom,

602
00:33:52.414 --> 00:33:54.990
Ma'am, Ma'am?

603
00:33:56.751 --> 00:33:57.930
Did you call for me?

604
00:33:58.553 --> 00:34:01.120
How's Mom?

605
00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:02.570
Is she still upset?

606
00:34:02.724 --> 00:34:06.640
Not at all,
She's actually relieved,,,

607
00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:08.480
that nothing's on her way now,

608
00:34:09.764 --> 00:34:12.450
Can you do me a favor?

609
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.490
I can't believe it,

610
00:34:23.845 --> 00:34:25.890
How can you eat in this situation?

611
00:34:26.381 --> 00:34:28.060
What kind of situation is this?

612
00:34:28.516 --> 00:34:31.150
Your son's about to get divorced,,,

613
00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:33.150
because of your shallow trick,

614
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:35.820
Watch your mouth, It's not shallow,

615
00:34:35.824 --> 00:34:38.810
I'm only trying what's best
for my son,

616
00:34:39.094 --> 00:34:41.140
It's only best for you,

617
00:34:41.763 --> 00:34:45.630
To them, you're being
shameless and rude,

618
00:34:45.633 --> 00:34:48.310
Be quiet, Whose side are you on?

619
00:34:48.803 --> 00:34:52.720
Even if he committed
an unforgivable crime,

620
00:34:52.974 --> 00:34:55.390
you should always be on his side
as his parent,

621
00:34:56.611 --> 00:35:00.490
Especially when it's
not So Won's fault,

622
00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:03.500
we should help him together
as his parents,

623
00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:06.670
Please stop thinking about
something stupid,

624
00:35:07.155 --> 00:35:08.970
Everything's over already,

625
00:35:09.224 --> 00:35:12.640
The more you act up,
the uglier you get,

626
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.240
What? What did you just say?

627
00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:19.680
Who said it's over?

628
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:23.850
So Won went to see Mrs, Yang,
It's not going to end now,

629
00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:25.120
Never,

630
00:35:27.842 --> 00:35:30.060
(Yeon Ju)

631
00:35:45.994 --> 00:35:47.270
What are you doing, Mom?

632
00:35:47.328 --> 00:35:50.480
Good, I'm glad you're here
just on time,

633
00:35:50.765 --> 00:35:53.010
You look worried,

634
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:56.470
so I came up with a good idea,

635
00:35:56.471 --> 00:35:57.620
Look,

636
00:36:01.676 --> 00:36:04.160
Are you going to renovate the house?

637
00:36:04.179 --> 00:36:05.530
Of course,

638
00:36:05.713 --> 00:36:07.680
New wine in a new bottle,

639
00:36:07.682 --> 00:36:10.780
I'm going to erase the trace
of your ex-husband,,,

640
00:36:10.785 --> 00:36:13.330
in this house completely,

641
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.970
You don't need to worry
about a thing,

642
00:36:16.991 --> 00:36:20.860
When you come back from
a European cruise for two months,

643
00:36:20.862 --> 00:36:22.780
the house will be ready,

644
00:36:22.864 --> 00:36:27.200
Then let's begin a new life,,,

645
00:36:27.202 --> 00:36:29.720
in a new house with a new mind,
Okay?

646
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.890
Who's that?

647
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:37.360
Oh, my,

648
00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:41.790
What's this for?

649
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:46.220
I'm going to treat you today,

650
00:36:46.221 --> 00:36:49.840
My goodness, I can't believe it,

651
00:36:49.991 --> 00:36:51.420
My gosh, I can't believe it,

652
00:36:51.426 --> 00:36:53.910
My daughter's going to wash my feet,

653
00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:56.310
I didn't expect this,

654
00:36:58.199 --> 00:37:00.310
Goodness,

655
00:37:03.538 --> 00:37:05.080
Very nice,

656
00:37:06.674 --> 00:37:09.840
You need to experience a breakup,,,

657
00:37:09.844 --> 00:37:12.530
in order to become an adult,

658
00:37:12.714 --> 00:37:14.060
It's nice,

659
00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:16.830
My goodness, I'm very happy,

660
00:37:30.365 --> 00:37:31.580
Where's Yeon Ju?

661
00:37:31.866 --> 00:37:33.180
In the master bedroom,

662
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.290
It's nice,

663
00:37:44.245 --> 00:37:45.390
Goodness,

664
00:37:46.514 --> 00:37:50.660
Yeon Ju, Stop frowning,

665
00:37:51.286 --> 00:37:52.600
Smile,

666
00:37:55.423 --> 00:37:57.770
The world doesn't end,,,

667
00:37:57.925 --> 00:38:00.970
because you broke up with a man,

668
00:38:01.095 --> 00:38:04.140
It's not worth looking back when
you're not meant to be together,

669
00:38:04.499 --> 00:38:07.680
With your look, your fortune,

670
00:38:07.902 --> 00:38:09.620
and your personality,

671
00:38:09.771 --> 00:38:12.350
as long as you get back to yourself,

672
00:38:12.573 --> 00:38:14.470
I can always,,,

673
00:38:14.475 --> 00:38:17.520
make guys hotter than him,,,

674
00:38:17.745 --> 00:38:19.990
line up for you,

675
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:24.930
Mom,

676
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.970
Do you remember the time I went to
LA for study when I was 20?

677
00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:33.470
How could I forget it?
Of course I do,

678
00:38:33.861 --> 00:38:36.410
How did you endure it?

679
00:38:36.531 --> 00:38:38.580
We were separated
for the first time,

680
00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:42.080
I don't even want to think about it,

681
00:38:42.303 --> 00:38:46.070
I couldn't eat anything for a week,

682
00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:47.540
I couldn't sleep,

683
00:38:47.542 --> 00:38:50.610
I even lost 3kg,

684
00:38:50.611 --> 00:38:52.020
I was like a skeleton,

685
00:38:54.015 --> 00:38:57.200
So how did you endure it?

686
00:38:57.552 --> 00:39:00.320
My friends thought,,,

687
00:39:00.321 --> 00:39:02.970
I was going to die,

688
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:05.710
so they took me out for golf,

689
00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:10.760
I walked and hit the ball
over and over again for 18 holes,

690
00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:12.950
After a week of playing golf,

691
00:39:13.034 --> 00:39:17.080
I missed you a tiny bit less,

692
00:39:19.073 --> 00:39:20.720
- I see,
- Yes,

693
00:39:23.811 --> 00:39:25.160
Then,,,

694
00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.390
you should start playing golf again,

695
00:39:28.883 --> 00:39:30.900
Why? Are you planning to
go somewhere?

696
00:39:31.419 --> 00:39:34.450
You dummy, You're not even smart,

697
00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:36.140
You're only wasting money,

698
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.710
Where are you going?

699
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:48.820
Hold on,

700
00:39:50.271 --> 00:39:53.190
Gosh, No way,

701
00:39:53.841 --> 00:39:56.990
Yeon Ju, You're not,,,

702
00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:01.830
No, you're not, Are you?

703
00:40:02.049 --> 00:40:04.160
No, Yeon Ju, No way,

704
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.600
I'm sorry, Mom,

705
00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:14.210
I'm going to go with So Won,

706
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:16.680
My goodness,

707
00:40:17.098 --> 00:40:20.550
- If you accept the kid,,,
- Shut your mouth,

708
00:40:21.869 --> 00:40:23.250
Let me ask you,

709
00:40:23.805 --> 00:40:25.790
Tell me again,

710
00:40:26.908 --> 00:40:29.220
Do you really mean
what you just said?

711
00:40:31.245 --> 00:40:33.890
My goodness,
What am I going to do now?

712
00:40:34.115 --> 00:40:38.360
You're going to abandon your
old mother with a heart disease,,,

713
00:40:38.786 --> 00:40:40.330
and follow him?

714
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:43.340
I'm sorry, Mom,

715
00:40:43.925 --> 00:40:46.140
Look at me, Yeon Ju,

716
00:40:46.594 --> 00:40:49.980
You're not yourself right now,,,

717
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.010
because of him,

718
00:40:52.133 --> 00:40:54.950
but I know you, Yeon Ju,

719
00:40:55.136 --> 00:40:57.620
You can never raise
someone else's kid,

720
00:40:57.672 --> 00:41:00.120
Are you going to suffer
with no money?

721
00:41:01.742 --> 00:41:03.260
Mom, please,

722
00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:07.660
Even if you beg me,,,

723
00:41:08.015 --> 00:41:10.830
after a few months,

724
00:41:11.018 --> 00:41:12.870
I won't accept you,

725
00:41:13.287 --> 00:41:16.100
Are you still going to leave me?

726
00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:19.320
Don't be like this, Mom,

727
00:41:19.327 --> 00:41:22.780
My goodness, This isn't right,

728
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.100
Get a grip, Yeon Ju,
This isn't right,

729
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.950
Are you going to abandon
your mom over a man?

730
00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:32.120
Please say no, Yeon Ju,

731
00:41:32.306 --> 00:41:35.450
No, No, This isn't right,

732
00:41:35.476 --> 00:41:39.180
No, My daughter
would never do this, No,

733
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.280
I'm sorry, Mom,

734
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:43.330
No, This isn't right,

735
00:41:43.718 --> 00:41:45.060
Yeon Ju,

736
00:41:45.386 --> 00:41:47.970
Yeon Ju, My goodness,

737
00:41:48.122 --> 00:41:51.140
You're what I lived for,

738
00:41:51.325 --> 00:41:52.870
This can't happen,

739
00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:55.810
What has he done to you?

740
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.680
Gosh,

741
00:41:58.866 --> 00:42:01.680
Yeon Ju,

742
00:42:02.136 --> 00:42:03.950
- Yeon Ju,
- I'm sorry, Mom,

743
00:42:19.387 --> 00:42:20.470
Yeon Ju,

744
00:42:22.156 --> 00:42:23.700
Do you now know,,,

745
00:42:24.158 --> 00:42:26.710
what I gave up to choose you?

746
00:42:28.596 --> 00:42:32.180
We have to live
happily because of this,

747
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.210
We have to be happy at all costs,

748
00:42:35.703 --> 00:42:37.120
Can you do that?

749
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.780
You know how important
this is, right?

750
00:43:12.406 --> 00:43:14.720
The honor of our team
relies on this,

751
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:16.660
Let's not make any mistakes,

752
00:43:22.883 --> 00:43:24.510
Ru Ri, what are you doing?

753
00:43:24.518 --> 00:43:26.720
They're evaluating the tasting,
You need to go there,

754
00:43:26.721 --> 00:43:28.700
How can I go there?

755
00:43:28.923 --> 00:43:31.470
I almost ruined everything,

756
00:43:31.759 --> 00:43:34.760
Hey, No one is perfect,

757
00:43:34.762 --> 00:43:37.910
Especially for us, Our looks and
ability are below average,

758
00:43:38.633 --> 00:43:41.450
Just rely on your personality
in times like this,

759
00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:43.700
Be a brave, amiable,

760
00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:45.890
and shameless cartoon character,

761
00:43:47.074 --> 00:43:51.560
I won't cry
Even if I'm lonely and sad

762
00:43:52.113 --> 00:43:53.730
Let's go, Be thick-skinned about it,

763
00:43:54.115 --> 00:43:56.430
I don't want to, I can't go,

764
00:44:07.194 --> 00:44:08.690
Ask the Menu Development Team
to come here,

765
00:44:08.696 --> 00:44:09.780
Yes, sir,

766
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.260
What are your impressions
after the tasting?

767
00:44:15.269 --> 00:44:17.470
This is the first ambitious work
of our Menu Development Team,

768
00:44:17.471 --> 00:44:20.020
The idea is pretty fresh,

769
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:22.410
I think it's competitive,,,

770
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.740
because the dish is quite plentiful,

771
00:44:23.744 --> 00:44:25.340
It's light and tender,

772
00:44:25.346 --> 00:44:28.560
It's perfect for the elders because
the sauce tastes like Korean sauce,

773
00:44:29.784 --> 00:44:31.560
Sir, how was it for you?

774
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.320
I think it will be perfect,,,

775
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:37.100
if we change the presentation
to fit our image,

776
00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:42.760
Did you ask for us, sir?

777
00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:44.130
They're here,

778
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:46.850
These are the people
who made these menus,

779
00:44:51.739 --> 00:44:52.970
I really liked the sauce,

780
00:44:52.973 --> 00:44:54.290
It was delicious,

781
00:44:54.742 --> 00:44:57.060
Manager Jung, you did a great job,

782
00:44:57.344 --> 00:44:59.010
Everyone is making
favorable comments,

783
00:44:59.013 --> 00:45:00.260
Thank you, sir,

784
00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:03.500
I heard that a female worker made
the sauce,

785
00:45:03.551 --> 00:45:05.430
That's really amazing,

786
00:45:08.055 --> 00:45:11.640
Look at her, She's taking
credit for you,

787
00:45:11.926 --> 00:45:13.410
She has a complete dual personality,

788
00:45:16.263 --> 00:45:19.150
No, I didn't make it,

789
00:45:19.867 --> 00:45:21.680
Someone else developed the sauce,

790
00:45:22.036 --> 00:45:23.350
Please hold on,

791
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.970
She's the one who made the sauce,

792
00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:45.540
Oh, my,

793
00:45:48.195 --> 00:45:49.930
The sauce was really amazing,

794
00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:51.190
I'm looking forward to it,

795
00:45:51.198 --> 00:45:52.240
Thank you,

796
00:45:59.473 --> 00:46:00.850
She's such a shrewd,

797
00:46:01.408 --> 00:46:03.220
Did she really mend her ways?

798
00:46:08.082 --> 00:46:10.400
I'm completely relieved after today,

799
00:46:11.051 --> 00:46:14.320
I can finally trust you after seeing
you defended for Ru Ri,

800
00:46:14.321 --> 00:46:15.940
I still have a long way to go,

801
00:46:16.891 --> 00:46:19.490
I need to treat her better
to make up for,,,

802
00:46:19.493 --> 00:46:20.740
being mean to her in the past,

803
00:46:24.365 --> 00:46:25.810
- Excuse me,
- Okay,

804
00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:28.510
Yes?

805
00:46:30.805 --> 00:46:32.020
No,

806
00:46:33.174 --> 00:46:36.760
I'll pay it from my own pocket
since it was a mistake,

807
00:46:38.112 --> 00:46:40.930
Yes, please send me the bill,

808
00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:42.800
Okay,

809
00:46:44.785 --> 00:46:47.970
What are you talking about?
Why would you pay for that?

810
00:46:48.455 --> 00:46:50.270
Dad, just pretend
that you don't know about this,

811
00:46:51.325 --> 00:46:54.710
Actually, there was
a little incident today,

812
00:46:55.262 --> 00:46:57.860
Ru Ri made a wrong order,

813
00:46:57.865 --> 00:46:59.750
The tasting was almost cancelled,

814
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.850
What?

815
00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:05.350
Is that why you wanted to take
some time to observe her?

816
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.290
Yes,

817
00:47:07.975 --> 00:47:10.060
I'm doing my best to teach her well,

818
00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:11.560
but she's a little bit too much
for me,

819
00:47:12.346 --> 00:47:13.760
Really?

820
00:47:14.615 --> 00:47:17.100
I thought she was good with work,
but I'm disappointed,

821
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:20.970
Come in,

822
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.190
Did you ask for me, sir?

823
00:47:26.193 --> 00:47:27.410
Welcome, Take a seat,

824
00:47:37.304 --> 00:47:38.720
You two are nice to look at,

825
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.620
especially when you were cooking
with each other earlier,

826
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.660
You're a perfect match,

827
00:47:45.012 --> 00:47:48.010
Dad, don't go too fast,

828
00:47:48.015 --> 00:47:49.380
You're going to make Tae Yang
feel uncomfortable,

829
00:47:49.383 --> 00:47:51.100
Why would he be uncomfortable?

830
00:47:52.152 --> 00:47:54.470
I want you as a son-in-law,

831
00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:56.600
What do you think about my daughter?

832
00:47:57.157 --> 00:47:58.200
I'm sorry,

833
00:47:58.726 --> 00:48:00.220
She's just a good colleague,

834
00:48:00.227 --> 00:48:01.370
See?

835
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:04.640
I'm embarrassed,

836
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:09.250
You don't know what will happen
between a man and a woman,

837
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:11.620
Anyway,

838
00:48:12.172 --> 00:48:15.220
just take good care of Ae Ri
like today,

839
00:48:25.286 --> 00:48:26.700
(Order Sheet)

840
00:48:48.909 --> 00:48:50.160
You're still here,

841
00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:52.830
I can even see your cavities,

842
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.060
I don't have any cavities, Look,

843
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.770
Why didn't you go home yet?

844
00:49:02.323 --> 00:49:04.200
Are you reflecting
over today's mistake?

845
00:49:07.227 --> 00:49:09.310
I just can't forgive myself,

846
00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:12.440
It was such an important
day for you,

847
00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:14.450
I can't believe that I made
a ridiculous mistake like this,

848
00:49:15.469 --> 00:49:17.450
It's okay to make
mistakes sometimes,

849
00:49:18.973 --> 00:49:21.520
You're improving without my nagging,

850
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:27.930
Anyway, I'm really sorry for today,

851
00:49:28.248 --> 00:49:30.650
I'll check more carefully,,,

852
00:49:30.651 --> 00:49:32.200
and do my best,

853
00:49:45.032 --> 00:49:47.950
Isn't it really cold at night
these days?

854
00:50:00.714 --> 00:50:01.930
Why are you looking at me like that?

855
00:50:02.649 --> 00:50:04.100
Ru Ri, don't be surprised,

856
00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:06.770
I'm going to come out
at work tomorrow,

857
00:50:07.454 --> 00:50:08.830
Come out?

858
00:50:11.592 --> 00:50:15.040
Is it the one
that I'm thinking about?

859
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:19.080
Yes, the one you're thinking about,

860
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.910
Exactly this,

861
00:50:22.636 --> 00:50:23.850
Why so suddenly?

862
00:50:25.372 --> 00:50:27.520
I'm scared that someone might take
you because you're so pretty,

863
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:32.990
Don't laugh, I'm serious,

864
00:50:33.514 --> 00:50:35.430
It's my first time hearing
something like this,

865
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:39.360
Don't worry,

866
00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.720
You're the only one who'd take me,

867
00:50:42.723 --> 00:50:46.270
You'll also be the only one
to take me in the future,

868
00:50:49.763 --> 00:50:50.880
And,,,

869
00:50:51.265 --> 00:50:54.080
I completely disagree
with you coming out,

870
00:50:55.903 --> 00:50:59.020
If people knew about us,

871
00:50:59.173 --> 00:51:00.900
we would've been in trouble
because they would think,,,

872
00:51:00.908 --> 00:51:02.890
that we made a mistake
and were not careful,

873
00:51:04.711 --> 00:51:09.330
I don't want my love,,,

874
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:12.330
to cause trouble for you
or my career,

875
00:51:12.719 --> 00:51:14.220
I want to do it because I'm anxious,

876
00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:15.470
Why are you anxious?

877
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.370
There won't be any problem,,,

878
00:51:18.592 --> 00:51:21.140
if we don't change,

879
00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:23.540
Are you confident?

880
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:29.720
Manager Jung, aren't you confident?

881
00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:41.560
I'm confident,

882
00:51:50.057 --> 00:51:52.240
I like you,

883
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.290
(Smart massage bed)

884
00:52:08.976 --> 00:52:10.660
My body aches,

885
00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.830
Oh, it's nice,

886
00:52:14.515 --> 00:52:16.700
I'm falling asleep,

887
00:52:17.017 --> 00:52:21.380
Excuse me, You've been coming every
day for two weeks in a row now,

888
00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:24.870
You're not just going to
take off, are you?

889
00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:27.990
Who do you think we are?

890
00:52:27.995 --> 00:52:30.640
I told you I'm buying a gift
for my mom,

891
00:52:31.498 --> 00:52:34.300
Then you should bring your mother
with you here,

892
00:52:34.301 --> 00:52:37.170
It's going to be a surprise,
Surprise,

893
00:52:37.171 --> 00:52:39.220
A surprise gift on her birthday,

894
00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:41.220
Surprise?

895
00:52:45.112 --> 00:52:47.990
Okay then,
Enjoy as much as you want,

896
00:52:50.651 --> 00:52:52.360
Hey, I'm embarrassed,

897
00:52:52.452 --> 00:52:53.700
Let's stop coming here now,

898
00:52:53.887 --> 00:52:55.000
Wait,

899
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:01.540
I've got an idea to
get rid of this picture,

900
00:53:02.863 --> 00:53:05.460
Let's just ask Tae Yang,,,

901
00:53:05.465 --> 00:53:06.580
who he is,

902
00:53:07.301 --> 00:53:10.720
Right, He'll probably recognize him
since they work at the same company,

903
00:53:11.138 --> 00:53:12.450
- I know, right?
- Yes,

904
00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:21.830
Have you seen this, sir?

905
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:23.700
What's this?

906
00:53:24.151 --> 00:53:25.950
("Sarah Kang's Special
Latin Dance Workshop")

907
00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:28.200
That's her, Right?

908
00:53:28.722 --> 00:53:29.940
Anna Kang's sister,

909
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.370
The name's right,

910
00:53:32.359 --> 00:53:34.110
but it's been so long
that I can't recognize her,

911
00:53:35.963 --> 00:53:37.040
Hold on,

912
00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:47.520
What do you think?
Do you think it's her?

913
00:53:51.078 --> 00:53:54.830
Yes, I'm sure it's her,

914
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:57.830
The workshop's on today,

915
00:54:02.923 --> 00:54:05.270
(Tokyo Dance Academy professor,
Sarah Kang)

916
00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:10.280
She used to be very pretty,
but she's gotten old now,

917
00:54:11.598 --> 00:54:13.180
It's been a long time,

918
00:54:14.034 --> 00:54:16.350
She's my only family,

919
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:20.120
We had to part
because of what I did,

920
00:54:21.141 --> 00:54:22.550
Every time I think about it,

921
00:54:23.443 --> 00:54:25.760
I can't stop blaming
Tae Yang's father,

922
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.330
We decided to forget about it,

923
00:54:27.714 --> 00:54:30.000
Talk about the good things
when you meet your sister,

924
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.600
Will she recognize me?

925
00:54:36.423 --> 00:54:37.540
Of course,

926
00:54:37.924 --> 00:54:42.240
You're too beautiful to forget,

927
00:54:45.799 --> 00:54:48.350
I'm happy to have you beside me,

928
00:54:49.803 --> 00:54:50.950
Thank you,

929
00:55:08.422 --> 00:55:12.200
Sarah Kang probably knows the truth,

930
00:55:13.093 --> 00:55:17.310
Whether my child exists or not,

931
00:55:21.034 --> 00:55:24.250
1, 1, 1, 1, 2,

932
00:55:24.671 --> 00:55:27.840
Turn back, 1, 1, 1, 2,

933
00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:31.560
Turn back, 1, 1, That's it,

934
00:55:33.747 --> 00:55:37.150
- Turn back, 1, 1, 1,,,
- Is that her?

935
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:39.500
2, 3, 4, 1, 1,,,

936
00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.370
Yes, I think so,

937
00:55:41.655 --> 00:55:42.980
Did you all watch it?

938
00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:44.490
Did you see how they sensed,,,

939
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:47.610
their space as they cross?

940
00:55:47.961 --> 00:55:50.960
- Thank you,
- Thank you,

941
00:55:50.964 --> 00:55:53.650
Thank you, Good job,

942
00:55:59.573 --> 00:56:01.020
What brings you here?

943
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:04.060
Are you Sarah Kang?

944
00:56:05.178 --> 00:56:07.290
Yes, I am, Who are you?

945
00:56:13.553 --> 00:56:16.770
It's me, Can't you tell?

946
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:33.390
Are you Anna?

947
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:40.290
My gosh, You were alive,

948
00:56:41.114 --> 00:56:42.560
You were alive,

949
00:56:43.049 --> 00:56:44.700
It's been so long,

950
00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:48.570
My goodness, My sister,

951
00:56:50.824 --> 00:56:52.140
Sarah,

952
00:56:54.594 --> 00:56:57.410
Sarah, Sarah,

953
00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:15.830
What is the chairman doing here?

954
00:57:40.407 --> 00:57:41.520
A son?

955
00:57:42.442 --> 00:57:43.890
He's already 30,

956
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:48.260
Right, That's about right since you
were pregnant with him back then,

957
00:57:48.448 --> 00:57:51.710
I always wondered
what happened to him,

958
00:57:51.718 --> 00:57:53.880
I actually told him to come here,

959
00:57:53.887 --> 00:57:55.070
You can meet him in person,

960
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:57.270
You have no idea how handsome he is,

961
00:57:58.225 --> 00:58:01.410
He looks like me since he's my son,

962
00:58:04.531 --> 00:58:06.580
My sister must be thirsty, honey,

963
00:58:06.633 --> 00:58:09.080
Okay, I'll bring water right away,

964
00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:15.720
I'm glad you met someone nice,

965
00:58:25.719 --> 00:58:29.470
Where did I see him?

966
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.110
Who's this?

967
00:58:35.161 --> 00:58:37.580
He's Tae Yang's birth father,

968
00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:01.770
Excuse me, Where's Professor
Sarah Kang's classroom?

969
00:59:02.822 --> 00:59:05.270
You'll find the practice room
over there,

970
00:59:05.492 --> 00:59:06.610
Thank you,

971
00:59:07.594 --> 00:59:08.740
Let's go,

972
00:59:13.099 --> 00:59:17.020
Why does he want to meet Sarah Kang?

973
00:59:23.343 --> 00:59:24.460
Oh, right,

974
00:59:25.245 --> 00:59:26.320
Tae Yang,

975
00:59:29.883 --> 00:59:31.760
(Sarah Kang's special Latin dance
workshop)

976
00:59:46.399 --> 00:59:48.180
(Sarah Kang's special Latin dance
workshop)

977
00:59:50.704 --> 00:59:52.320
What does your son do?

978
00:59:52.806 --> 00:59:55.450
- He's a professional chef,
- My goodness,

979
00:59:55.842 --> 00:59:57.340
I guess you can't fool the gene,

980
00:59:57.344 --> 01:00:00.160
Hey, Don't say that,

981
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.690
I hate hearing that the most,

982
01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:06.870
I can't imagine my son,,,

983
01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:08.600
resembling him even by little,

984
01:00:08.888 --> 01:00:10.840
I feel pity for him,

985
01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:15.110
He doesn't even know
his son's alive,

986
01:00:15.328 --> 01:00:17.640
Wait, I'll show you the picture,

987
01:00:21.601 --> 01:00:24.950
I know you hate to hear this,
but he looks just like his father,

988
01:00:25.271 --> 01:00:28.290
His eyes, lips and even the shape
of his face,

989
01:00:33.246 --> 01:00:34.390
What's wrong?

990
01:00:51.765 --> 01:00:53.130
What are you doing?

991
01:00:53.133 --> 01:00:54.300
Be quiet,

992
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.450
Mom said there's someone I must see,
What's going on?

993
01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.980
I'll explain later,
Just go home for now,

994
01:01:00.173 --> 01:01:01.450
What are you talking about?

995
01:01:01.675 --> 01:01:03.220
Where's mom?

996
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:05.790
Don't ask anything, Just go home,

997
01:01:12.952 --> 01:01:14.100
Give it to me!

998
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:25.380
Unlock it,

999
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.950
Unlock it!

1000
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.750
What are you doing here?

1001
01:01:32.405 --> 01:01:33.790
Show me my son,

1002
01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:42.430
What? Are you crazy?

1003
01:01:43.049 --> 01:01:46.010
Son? You don't have a son,

1004
01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:48.600
Don't be like this, I heard
everything, You just said it,

1005
01:01:48.922 --> 01:01:51.640
You said I don't even know
I have a son,

1006
01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:55.040
Show me, Please,

1007
01:01:55.495 --> 01:01:57.080
What are you talking about?

1008
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.910
You don't have a son,

1009
01:01:59.265 --> 01:02:01.580
All you did was abusing her
when you were together,

1010
01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:04.350
Not only that, but you also
made her run away,

1011
01:02:05.171 --> 01:02:07.020
What more do you need from her?

1012
01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:08.590
Please,

1013
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.470
I regret what I've done to you,

1014
01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:14.660
I really do, so please
tell me the truth,

1015
01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:17.650
I can do everything for my son,

1016
01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:20.320
so please tell me,

1017
01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.870
I'm about to go crazy,
Tell me the truth for the last time,

1018
01:02:23.423 --> 01:02:25.490
I said there's no truth,

1019
01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:28.770
We don't want anything to do with
you anymore, so please stop,

1020
01:02:29.362 --> 01:02:31.140
- Let's go,
- Then what is this?

1021
01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:41.590
What is this that you left
in your luggage?

1022
01:02:52.118 --> 01:02:55.200
You have no idea
what I went through,

1023
01:02:56.055 --> 01:02:57.270
I wandered my whole life,,,

1024
01:02:58.224 --> 01:03:00.000
with no family,

1025
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.530
Please help me make it up to my son,

1026
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.940
I'll be no harm to him,

1027
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.950
Please, I beg you,

1028
01:03:16.509 --> 01:03:17.560
Tell me,

1029
01:03:18.745 --> 01:03:20.160
What is the truth?

1030
01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:27.670
The truth?

1031
01:03:29.489 --> 01:03:31.100
I'll tell you if you want it
so badly,

1032
01:03:36.262 --> 01:03:38.040
I've never had,,,

1033
01:03:38.598 --> 01:03:41.180
or gave birth to your son,

1034
01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:44.530
Even if I did, do you think
I could keep him?

1035
01:03:44.537 --> 01:03:46.580
When his dad is a piece of garbage
like you?

1036
01:03:48.675 --> 01:03:50.150
Is it clear now?

1037
01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.390
I hope we never
see each other again,

1038
01:04:09.128 --> 01:04:10.170
(Book on podiatry)

1039
01:04:15.869 --> 01:04:18.680
Are you tired, Grandma?

1040
01:04:19.239 --> 01:04:21.440
No, I'm okay,

1041
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:24.790
Have a seat here, Han Gyul,
if you're tired,

1042
01:04:27.247 --> 01:04:30.760
Is this Dad's, Grandma?

1043
01:04:31.017 --> 01:04:34.200
Is Dad moving into our house?

1044
01:04:35.388 --> 01:04:36.470
Yes,

1045
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:40.740
You'll get to see Dad every day now,

1046
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.770
Yes! That's great!

1047
01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:47.510
What are you doing?

1048
01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.350
Can't you see?

1049
01:04:49.903 --> 01:04:52.020
I'm unpacking So Won's stuff,

1050
01:04:52.572 --> 01:04:55.120
Stop it now!

1051
01:04:55.575 --> 01:04:56.700
Gosh,

1052
01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:59.310
Who said you can let So Won in?

1053
01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:03.560
He's about to get divorced,
We can't let him live alone,

1054
01:05:03.783 --> 01:05:05.910
He had enough already
that he looks so weary,

1055
01:05:05.919 --> 01:05:08.700
That's why we should send him
back to his house,

1056
01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.370
Can't you tell after
all you went through?

1057
01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.410
They sent So Won's stuff,
It's over now,

1058
01:05:16.262 --> 01:05:18.380
You've done enough,

1059
01:05:18.531 --> 01:05:21.760
so stop being so dirty, Please!

1060
01:05:21.768 --> 01:05:24.170
That's what you think,

1061
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:27.300
I can't let my child get divorced,,,

1062
01:05:27.307 --> 01:05:29.200
and come home empty-handed,

1063
01:05:29.208 --> 01:05:31.510
I'm going to turn this back
to normal,,,

1064
01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:33.730
as soon as he comes back,

1065
01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:38.450
Grandma, Dad's here,

1066
01:05:38.451 --> 01:05:39.760
So Won,

1067
01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:42.670
Oh, great, Nice timing,

1068
01:05:42.822 --> 01:05:44.040
Let's go,

1069
01:05:44.924 --> 01:05:46.000
To where?

1070
01:05:46.059 --> 01:05:48.140
What do you mean where?

1071
01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:51.880
We should beg Mrs, Yang,

1072
01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:55.450
It's over, Father,

1073
01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:58.170
If that would make her change
her mind,

1074
01:05:58.171 --> 01:05:59.780
she wouldn't have sent my stuff
in the first place,

1075
01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:01.620
What?

1076
01:06:01.908 --> 01:06:04.960
Are you going to give up like this?

1077
01:06:05.511 --> 01:06:07.330
I'm never going back to her house,

1078
01:06:08.247 --> 01:06:09.630
I'm going to work at
a new hospital too,

1079
01:06:09.949 --> 01:06:12.460
What? Look at you,

1080
01:06:12.618 --> 01:06:15.370
Mom, You don't need to unpack
my stuff,

1081
01:06:15.655 --> 01:06:17.870
Send them back to me when I give you
the address later,

1082
01:06:18.825 --> 01:06:21.540
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

1083
01:06:21.961 --> 01:06:24.580
I decided to work as a pay doctor
at my friend's hospital in Suwon,

1084
01:06:24.864 --> 01:06:27.100
I'm going to look for
a new house too,

1085
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.860
Hey, hey, So Won,

1086
01:06:29.869 --> 01:06:33.680
How could you let me down like this?

1087
01:06:33.973 --> 01:06:37.570
You should be at your peak now,

1088
01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:39.110
You can't start over from scratch,

1089
01:06:39.112 --> 01:06:41.110
throwing everything
you've accomplished,

1090
01:06:41.114 --> 01:06:42.880
and as a divorced man
with a daughter?

1091
01:06:42.882 --> 01:06:46.510
No, Never, I can't forgive you,

1092
01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:48.420
No, I won't let you,

1093
01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.150
Go, Let's go,

1094
01:06:50.156 --> 01:06:51.270
Father,

1095
01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:53.590
I know it'll be hard,

1096
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:55.990
but I can work hard to
stand on my feet again,

1097
01:06:55.995 --> 01:06:59.280
Hey, hey, Come on!

1098
01:06:59.532 --> 01:07:01.580
That's not as easy as you think,

1099
01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.560
Let's go, Go now,

1100
01:07:03.569 --> 01:07:05.250
Please stop!

1101
01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:16.140
So Won, Then don't move out,

1102
01:07:16.149 --> 01:07:17.830
Commute to work from here,

1103
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.430
You have Han Gyul here too,

1104
01:07:19.719 --> 01:07:21.270
Han Gyul's coming with me,

1105
01:07:22.889 --> 01:07:24.320
What do you mean?

1106
01:07:24.323 --> 01:07:26.640
How are you going to
take care of her alone?

1107
01:07:26.759 --> 01:07:28.260
I'm not raising her alone,

1108
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:30.730
Who else is going to raise her then?

1109
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:33.630
Are you going to hire a nanny
when you have nothing?

1110
01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:34.810
No,

1111
01:07:35.902 --> 01:07:38.720
Yeon Ju and I will raise her
together,

1112
01:07:41.074 --> 01:07:44.390
What? Hold on,

1113
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.520
What do you mean?

1114
01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.300
You're going to raise Han Gyul
with Yeon Ju?

1115
01:07:51.884 --> 01:07:53.000
Did,,,

1116
01:07:53.886 --> 01:07:56.870
Yeon Ju decide to move out?

1117
01:07:57.090 --> 01:07:59.540
Yes, she did,

1118
01:08:07.633 --> 01:08:08.750
So Won,

1119
01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:14.490
I'm really sorry to Mrs, Yang,

1120
01:08:16.075 --> 01:08:17.290
but I'm glad she did,

1121
01:08:18.111 --> 01:08:19.390
I'm glad,

1122
01:08:22.548 --> 01:08:26.400
Well, it worked out well,

1123
01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:31.140
It's best for the child to live
with her parents,

1124
01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:35.070
You can see Dad every day now,

1125
01:08:35.228 --> 01:08:36.870
Han Gyul,

1126
01:08:42.001 --> 01:08:43.680
- Are you happy?
- Yes,

1127
01:08:44.937 --> 01:08:47.470
My goodness,

1128
01:08:47.473 --> 01:08:49.670
She always snapped at me,

1129
01:08:49.675 --> 01:08:53.060
She's so clingy to her father,

1130
01:08:54.413 --> 01:08:56.190
I was right,

1131
01:08:57.150 --> 01:09:01.030
Grandpa, Dad, Grandma, and Han Gyul,

1132
01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:04.940
Right, You're the best,

1133
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:08.140
Mom, I'm hungry, Give me some food,

1134
01:09:09.061 --> 01:09:11.180
Okay, Hold on a second,

1135
01:09:16.802 --> 01:09:17.850
Hey,

1136
01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:20.520
Listen to me,

1137
01:09:20.973 --> 01:09:23.640
I'm going to get him a loan,,,

1138
01:09:23.643 --> 01:09:26.870
with this house tomorrow and help
him with him opening a new clinic,

1139
01:09:26.879 --> 01:09:29.330
Get ready to teach Yeon Ju,,,

1140
01:09:29.849 --> 01:09:31.800
house chores,

1141
01:09:33.519 --> 01:09:34.670
What?

1142
01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.790
That old woman,

1143
01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:42.060
I'm going to show her how
I'm happy with her daughter,

1144
01:09:42.061 --> 01:09:45.930
She can be lonely
with all her money,

1145
01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:47.960
That shameless woman,

1146
01:09:47.967 --> 01:09:50.680
She's so cheap,

1147
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.520
Gosh,

1148
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.430
Are you packing already?

1149
01:10:03.049 --> 01:10:04.480
Are you going to leave?

1150
01:10:04.483 --> 01:10:06.710
If you accept that child,,,

1151
01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:08.530
That will never happen,

1152
01:10:09.522 --> 01:10:11.600
I'll ask you for one last time,

1153
01:10:11.924 --> 01:10:13.800
Are you really going to leave
this house?

1154
01:10:14.527 --> 01:10:17.830
Are you going to abandon your mother
and raise someone else's child?

1155
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:20.650
This is why I have no other choice
but to move out,

1156
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.260
Then leave everything I bought
for you,

1157
01:10:23.269 --> 01:10:25.120
Every one of them,

1158
01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:27.180
That's real independence,

1159
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.390
Where are you going this early?

1160
01:10:32.144 --> 01:10:33.560
Don't you worry about me!

1161
01:10:34.347 --> 01:10:36.330
I can go on without you,

1162
01:10:46.592 --> 01:10:49.210
Are you going to work, Doctor?

1163
01:10:49.929 --> 01:10:52.030
Yes, Have a good day,

1164
01:10:52.031 --> 01:10:53.110
Wait,

1165
01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.180
I heard you're closing the clinic,

1166
01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:01.520
The chairwoman already put it
on the market that buyers came by,

1167
01:11:01.874 --> 01:11:03.720
They're going to open
a new hospital,

1168
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:08.130
Yes, Thank you for all your help,

1169
01:11:17.089 --> 01:11:18.240
Mother,

1170
01:11:19.158 --> 01:11:20.710
What are you doing here?

1171
01:11:23.162 --> 01:11:27.040
I wanted to talk to you
for the last time,

1172
01:11:32.305 --> 01:11:33.520
What do you want to talk about?

1173
01:11:54.293 --> 01:11:57.380
This looks like you
when you were young,

1174
01:11:58.964 --> 01:12:00.640
Who's this kid?

1175
01:12:01.634 --> 01:12:03.050
My son,

1176
01:12:03.936 --> 01:12:05.680
His name is Ha Eun Kyo,

1177
01:12:15.014 --> 01:12:16.210
What are you doing?

1178
01:12:16.215 --> 01:12:17.500
Don't you dare laugh,

1179
01:12:18.851 --> 01:12:22.070
The moment I screamed,
the phone rang,

1180
01:12:29.862 --> 01:12:32.280
Goodness, Mi Sook, it must
be hard to act with him,

1181
01:12:32.832 --> 01:12:34.930
Pretty? I'm pretty?

1182
01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.260
Does he have bad eyesight?

1183
01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:37.670
He told me that I'm pretty!

1184
01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:38.780
Whom are you talking to?

1185
01:12:39.839 --> 01:12:42.300
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1186
01:12:42.308 --> 01:12:46.140
She doesn't have it in her
to raise someone else's child,

1187
01:12:46.145 --> 01:12:49.380
You must cook and
do the laundry for Yeon Ju,

1188
01:12:49.382 --> 01:12:50.440
I must end it,

1189
01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:52.050
Didn't Ru Ri hand over this draft?

1190
01:12:52.051 --> 01:12:55.380
We put it up at every branch,
I'm getting countless complaints,

1191
01:12:55.388 --> 01:12:56.880
I like you, Manager Jung,

1192
01:12:56.889 --> 01:12:59.050
It'd be better if I quit now,

1193
01:12:59.058 --> 01:13:00.720
Where is he?

1194
01:13:00.726 --> 01:13:03.390
Let's tell Tae Yang that
his birth father is alive,

1195
01:13:03.396 --> 01:13:06.340
Then Kevin is
Jung Hwa Young's ex-husband?
