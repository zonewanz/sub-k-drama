00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.310
(Episode 8)

4
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:17.451
Hello, Mr. Kim Min Joon.

5
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.010
I'm the manager of Claims Examination Team,

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.751
Choi Kang Woo.

7
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:31.990
I asked what you are doing here.

8
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.101
What would I do here as the manager of this team?

9
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.300
Of course I'd examine insurance claims.

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.361
Examine insurance claims?

11
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:38.200
You said someone told you to look for...

12
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.601
the insurance policy of Taeyang Insurance.

13
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:42.700
(Claims Examination Team Manager Choi Kang Woo)

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.410
My goodness.

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.480
Taeyang Insurance must trust you a lot...

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.921
for them to take you back without hesitance.

17
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.650
I'm not sure.

18
00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.590
Do they trust me?

19
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.220
Shall I also give my trust to Taeyang Insurance?

20
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.560
Kim Min Joon.

21
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.260
What are you up to?

22
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:10.831
Stay under the radar.

23
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:11.931
Don't let people notice you.

24
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:13.301
To give you my utmost trust,

25
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:15.071
I need people to notice me.

26
00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:16.870
If you get caught again,

27
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.810
no one can save you.

28
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.510
Mr. Choi, are you concerned about me?

29
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.310
Why would I be concerned about a fraud?

30
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:25.650
I'm telling you to not ruin my plan.

31
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.750
My service to you.

32
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.860
Gosh, that idiot.

33
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.301
The extraordinary general meeting is next Monday.

34
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.631
Then next week,

35
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:47.000
will you be Chairman Joo Hyun Ki?

36
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:50.571
It's all thanks to you, Chairman Cha.

37
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.670
When's Jung Pil's funeral?

38
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.681
I'm thinking this Friday.

39
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.081
Can you make it?

40
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.250
Everyone in the politics and the business know...

41
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.321
that you two were the closest friends.

42
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.750
You need to come and shed some tears of sadness.

43
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.051
Don't worry about it.

44
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.691
Hyun Ki, don't overdo anything just because...

45
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.221
your dad has passed away.

46
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:10.631
Don't cause any trouble...

47
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:11.930
until the general meeting is over.

48
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.631
Don't worry about it.

49
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.330
It took two years...

50
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.800
to finally let my father go.

51
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.740
He collapsed here after the JH 801 accident...

52
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.740
and never gained back consciousness.

53
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.210
Right?

54
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.651
By the way, you still have it, don't you?

55
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.180
801.

56
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:35.251
That thing.

57
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:40.360
What about you?

58
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.420
Of course I do.

59
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:43.661
Because of that...

60
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:45.791
you helped me with the succession of management.

61
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.501
Bring it to me...

62
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.161
after the meeting as promised.

63
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.071
I'll return yours then.

64
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.430
Hong Joo...

65
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.501
shouldn't know about our secret until the end.

66
00:02:58.841 --> 00:03:00.640
I just feel bad for you two...

67
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.080
for having too many secrets.

68
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.811
People might think...

69
00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:05.710
that you and I are father and son.

70
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.180
Do you have more nonsense to blabber about?

71
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.351
No, I'm done.

72
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.661
Dad, Kang Woo...

73
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.360
Hi, Director Cha.

74
00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:18.791
Why do you look so pale?

75
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.990
Is something wrong?

76
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.260
You should go.

77
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.270
I want to know what you two will talk about.

78
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.240
But you won't let me join in.

79
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:42.621
Why did you hire Kang Woo back?

80
00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:43.950
I didn't.

81
00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:45.751
He crawled back in.

82
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.191
He did?

83
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:50.291
Still, why did you take him back?

84
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.230
We have the worst detection rate.

85
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.971
You said Moo Shin wasn't good enough.

86
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.270
You were looking for a new manager, weren't you?

87
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.471
With Kang Woo, we were always number one...

88
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.670
in our field for 10 years.

89
00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:06.911
It wouldn't look good to reject him...

90
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:08.240
when he wanted to come back.

91
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.080
If you're concerned about that...

92
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.651
I'll take care of...

93
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.281
Don't try too hard, Hong Joo.

94
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:15.580
You know...

95
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.750
Kang Woo was after Lee Mi Ran until recently.

96
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.661
Hong Joo, why are you so concerned?

97
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:25.930
Is it something to do with the plane crash?

98
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.961
I don't think it is.

99
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.161
Am I right?

100
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.201
- Dad. - Keep this in mind.

101
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.841
If it's not in our memory,

102
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.570
then it isn't true.

103
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:43.651
We just have to make that not true.

104
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:45.610
Are you still at it?

105
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.420
Is that why you need Kang Woo?

106
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:53.451
If you give him what he wants...

107
00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:55.761
and leave him alone, he'll go fetch it.

108
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.630
He's talented in that way.

109
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.630
What will he fetch you?

110
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.761
Don't ask anything...

111
00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:04.570
that you wouldn't be able to forget later.

112
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.471
You just get ready to kill the dog.

113
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.471
This time, you should give it a go.

114
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:11.711
Are you telling me to...

115
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.810
Director Cha of Taeyang Insurance.

116
00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:17.911
Will you stay as Kang Woo's junior forever?

117
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.221
Aren't you going to take this place?

118
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.951
Make a choice, Hong Joo.

119
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:35.000
This seat will be empty soon.

120
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.831
After you leave this seat,

121
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.331
where will you go?

122
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.800
To JH?

123
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.870
I said...

124
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.670
don't ask anything...

125
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:48.980
that you wouldn't be able to forget later.

126
00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:00.721
Did you see the HR notice?

127
00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:03.021
Manager Choi Kang Woo is back after two years.

128
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:05.490
The mad dog has returned.

129
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:07.901
The detection rate will rise up.

130
00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:10.430
- It will. - He's legendary.

131
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.031
Choi Kang Woo.

132
00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:13.971
Dad, Kang Woo...

133
00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:16.841
Kang Woo.

134
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.570
Hi, Kang Woo.

135
00:06:20.141 --> 00:06:22.511
Hong Joo, where are you going? I'm still talking!

136
00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:26.781
He's the one who made...

137
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.420
Hong Joo smile.

138
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.521
He's back after two years?

139
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:35.320
After two years?

140
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.091
After that phone call...

141
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.130
with the question I couldn't understand,

142
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.461
how could you do this without telling me?

143
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.230
Between you and I...

144
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.670
I mean,

145
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.901
if you were considerate of me as your superior,

146
00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:50.511
you should've told me in advance.

147
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.810
I'm sorry, Director Cha.

148
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.980
Director Cha? Kang Woo, please...

149
00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:01.920
Let me ask you one thing.

150
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.151
Don't answer me as my employee,

151
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:06.820
but as you.

152
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:08.021
What is it, Hong Joo?

153
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.201
Be honest with me.

154
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.730
Why have you returned?

155
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.031
Because I wanted to.

156
00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:20.440
You asked me to join Mad Dog...

157
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.570
not too long ago.

158
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:24.870
But why did you want to come back so suddenly?

159
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:26.980
There's no reason to run Mad Dog anymore.

160
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.750
Ko Jin Chul is dead.

161
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.021
Didn't you know?

162
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.581
How could I know...

163
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:38.420
Does my dad...

164
00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:40.190
know about this?

165
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.690
I no longer have...

166
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.190
the reason to keep Mad Dog.

167
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.161
So I told him I wanted to return to Taeyang.

168
00:07:47.761 --> 00:07:50.471
I think I'll be more useful in Taeyang.

169
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.670
"More useful in Taeyang"?

170
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.411
You have the lowest detection rate.

171
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.440
I'll raise it.

172
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:00.841
Is that the reason?

173
00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:04.380
Is that all?

174
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.011
No, it's not all.

175
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:07.980
You told me...

176
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.851
to live my life, Choi Kang Woo's life.

177
00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:12.951
You said there was no such thing.

178
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.021
Yes, there is.

179
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.490
It's at an unexpected place.

180
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.930
I realized it only now.

181
00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:25.000
Where is that place?

182
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.670
Here.

183
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:28.341
Taeyang Insurance.

184
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.940
Is that so?

185
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:34.180
Is it here?

186
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:38.350
Yes, I think it's here.

187
00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:41.320
This is like my hometown.

188
00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:46.521
Isn't it?

189
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.090
You didn't have kimchi jjigae, and you are...

190
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.661
having triangle gimbap again?

191
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:51.930
You said you had it every day...

192
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.131
when you were in Yongsan.

193
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:54.261
Aren't you sick of it?

194
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:56.430
Why would I be sick of it? It's a new flavor.

195
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.800
It's crab meat.

196
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.970
You should eat something healthy.

197
00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:03.771
You're finally home.

198
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.970
How was your meal?

199
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.041
What's he doing there?

200
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:10.680
He comes and leaves like this is his house.

201
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.080
Hey, Dr. Kim.

202
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.251
Get out of Mr. Choi's chair.

203
00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:16.450
Pentium, you should stop...

204
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.720
putting trackers and wiretaps on my things.

205
00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:21.991
Can you still not trust me?

206
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.291
That's because you aren't trustworthy at all.

207
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.761
Trustworthy?

208
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.761
I think...

209
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.470
you should worry about Choi Kang Woo, not me.

210
00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:36.901
You're all waiting for Choi Kang Woo here.

211
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.840
Will Taeyang Insurance believe...

212
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.340
that he closed Mad Dog down or not?

213
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:44.411
You're telling us to close the office.

214
00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:45.550
Right, Kim Min Joon?

215
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.420
That's right, Jang Ha Ri.

216
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.090
(Mad Dog has closed. Thank you for your patronage.)

217
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.560
What are you doing here?

218
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.930
You told us to close our office.

219
00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.901
So why are you here?

220
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:06.570
Mr. Kim Min Joon, our landlord.

221
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.901
You didn't give us our key money back.

222
00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:15.940
All you have is beer.

223
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.350
Don't you have soju?

224
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.011
I don't like beer because it's too weak.

225
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.420
Give me your account number now.

226
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.680
It'll cost us a fortune...

227
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.251
to move again...

228
00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:25.751
and re-install the internet line.

229
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.460
Your phone is gold.

230
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:30.830
It's stylish.

231
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.391
Gold and black.

232
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:33.901
Did you get it to match your outfit?

233
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.300
Let's ask him to pay for the internet line.

234
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.600
How much was it?

235
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.170
Because it took a lot of work...

236
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.840
and stuff...

237
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.611
- 100,000 dollars. - What?

238
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.840
Get off it!

239
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.151
What is he saying?

240
00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.550
Get off it right now!

241
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.881
What? Why?

242
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:56.751
Didn't you put it here...

243
00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:58.720
so you can ride it when you're bored?

244

246
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.031

247
00:11:04.991 --> 00:11:07.060

250
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.720
met up in a hotel in the morning.

251
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.590
It was a hotel restaurant.

252
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.420
You make it sound weird.

253
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.861
All right.

254
00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:35.960
They met at a hotel restaurant...

255
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.291
and had a chat in the morning.

256
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:39.491
Right.

258
00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:43.031
Did you hear what they were talking about?

259
00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:44.430
Nothing at all.

260
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.570
Someone called me...

261
00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:49.371
when I was about to eavesdrop.

262
00:11:49.371 --> 00:11:51.940
You should thank me for saving your life.

263
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:57.550
Mad Dog is concerned about my life...

264
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.381
which I don't even worry about.

265
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.981
Gosh.

266
00:12:03.381 --> 00:12:04.820
Do you like me that much?

267
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:08.621
Yes, very much.

268
00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.991
I like you so much that I want to strangle you.

269
00:12:11.991 --> 00:12:13.031
What?

270
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.031
That means I'll get killed anyway.

271
00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:16.800
Whether I get killed by Young Ho...

272

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.381
Didn't he want to have some fun?

287
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:04.111
It's the legal affairs team of JH Group.

But no single voice of his remains in the recording.

as an executive officer,

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.690
now that all of you are worried about me.

342
00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:37.830
Just worry about Choi Kang Woo...

343
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.631
like you always have.

344
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:44.011
I wonder if he's doing well in Taeyang.

345
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.381
Here's the intranet access code.

346
00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:55.881
It should work now.

347
00:15:56.251 --> 00:15:57.291
Thanks.

348
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.291
Is it all set, sir?

349
00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:03.161
Why would you call me like that?

350
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:04.361
Don't.

351
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.391
We're in the company, so I should be polite to you.

352
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.100
Shall I just be not?

353
00:16:08.161 --> 00:16:10.371
(Contractor: Kim Bum Joon)

354
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.570
You memorize his social security number?

355
00:16:14.771 --> 00:16:16.901
I can never forget it even if I want to.

356
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:20.840
(Social Security Number)

357
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840
(Life Insurance)

358
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.981
Why are both you and Kim Min Joon...

359
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:25.281
looking for this?

360
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.180
Before Lee Mi Ran died, she told Kim Min Joon...

361
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.050
to find the original insurance policy.

362
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.090
Lee Mi Ran did?

363
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.090
Did she see something when she had it?

364
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:36.920
What do you mean?

365
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.190
Well...

366
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.491
Right after an article about her being...

367
00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:41.531
the insurance planner of Kim Bum Joon got released,

368
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.401
I got quite a lot of calls from her customers.

369
00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:46.670
They wanted to retrieve their policies from her.

370
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.440
She kept her customers' insurance policies?

371
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.111
My wife left hers with Lee Mi Ran too.

372
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.570
She did it...

373
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.340
because she was worried I might scold her again.

374
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.151
You have the retrieved policies, right?

375
00:16:58.151 --> 00:16:59.151
Let me take a look at them.

376
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.151
(Contractor: Park Moo Shin)

377
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.600
Did we use random papers for printing?

378
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600
I thought...

379
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.441
we used the same product of a designated company.

380
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:22.900
Why? Is it different?

381
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.110
Professor Byeon.

382
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.310
Do you know anyone who's good at analyzing...

383
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.711
Yes, I know someone.

384
00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:30.181
He's our member called Papyrus,

385
00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:33.550
and he runs a private analyzing company.

386
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.961
This sheet of paper wasn't produced in 2008.

387
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:52.031
This kind of natural paper product...

388
00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:54.340
was first developed in this industry...

389
00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:56.171
in 2010.

390
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.271
They produced and placed it on the market...

391
00:17:58.271 --> 00:17:59.610
starting from July.

392
00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:02.380
These were signed in 2008...

393
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.211
and 2009.

394
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.221
This one was signed in January, 2010.

395
00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:09.620
There's no way they can be original.

396
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.350
Because the paper was yet to be produced.

397
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.350
Exactly.

398
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.160
So...

399
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.721
among Kim Bum Joon's eight insurance policies,

400
00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.590
5 of them which were signed before 2010...

401
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.860
aren't original?

402
00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:21.931
Exactly.

403
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.830
Those from 2008 to January, 2010 aren't.

404
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.671
He signed this on March 29, 2008.

405
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:32.041
This one on June 18, 2008.

406
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:33.910
This one on February 18, 2009.

407
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.810
This one on September 2, 2009.

408
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.011
This one was signed on January 22, 2010.

409
00:18:41.451 --> 00:18:44.951
What's the case that shook the industry in 2010?

410
00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:47.721
In 2010...

411
00:18:48.221 --> 00:18:50.120
The change in the policy regarding suicide deaths.

412
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:53.390
Suicide deaths.

413
00:18:53.531 --> 00:18:54.531
Right.

414
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:57.830
The policy about suicide deaths was changed.

415
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.471
What are you talking about?

416
00:19:00.471 --> 00:19:03.140
Life insurances sold before 2010...

417
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.410
had a policy that approved suicide as an accident.

418
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.741
If it was approved,

419
00:19:08.181 --> 00:19:10.511
would the insured get paid a special benefit...

420
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.681
in addition to their general death benefit?

421
00:19:12.681 --> 00:19:14.650
The amount varied depending on the cases.

422
00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:17.451
If all these five insurances...

423
00:19:17.451 --> 00:19:20.090
were taken out after 2010,

424
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.320
he wouldn't have been able to get the money.

425
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.991
So they increased the amount?

426
00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:26.560
To make people believe it was a suicide case?

427
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.501
We need evidence, not suspicion.

428
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.201
Where would the original insurance policies be?

429
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:34.140
We sent all the data about the JH 801 case...

430
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.840
down to the depository in the basement.

431
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.810
We might have to search there...

432
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.380
if we want to find at least some kind of trace.

433
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.241
Depository?

434
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.481
After your retirement,

435
00:19:44.481 --> 00:19:46.580
the company system got changed to keep...

436
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.421
important and classified documents...

437
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:50.080
in the basement depository.

438
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.050
Not anyone can go in there, though.

439
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.390
We can go in there...

440
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.160
only to put documents...

441
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.060
after dealing with a huge or sensitive case.

442
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160
Is that so?

443
00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.660
What are you doing, sitting here idly?

444
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.731
Go settle a case...

445
00:20:03.731 --> 00:20:05.800
that's huge or sensitive.

446
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.070
Right.

447
00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:09.640
Let's go work, Mr. Park.

448
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.410
Yes, sir.

449
00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:17.310
Joo Hyun Ki, 36 years old.

450
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.781
He's the vice president of JH Group.

451
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.650
His grandfather founded the group,

452
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.981
so he's the grandson of the conglomerate.

453
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.921
The company employees...

454
00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:26.491
call him HK, the initials for his first name.

455
00:20:26.691 --> 00:20:30.191
He was notorious for having way too many women.

456
00:20:30.491 --> 00:20:32.031
He married a top star...

457
00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:33.431
and got divorced only after a year.

458
00:20:33.491 --> 00:20:34.800
He's now a divorced single,

459
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.130
but he's being unexpectedly quiet.

460
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.300
Hold them higher.

461
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:38.471
Yes, sir.

462
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.150
Lee Young Ho is passing.

463
00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:02.320
You can't hide me with that small body of yours.

464
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.830
At least pretend.

465
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:06.531
Goodness, it's humiliating.

466
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.031
Please send an email to Reporter Bang, Noo Ri.

467
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.271
Write him to come to the lobby...

468
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:15.541
in the JH Group building by 3pm tomorrow.

469
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.870
Make the sender's name as Jang Ha Ri.

470
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.711
What are you doing?

471
00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:21.910
Don't pester me.

472
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.711
Don't forget to come here at 3pm tomorrow.

473
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.660
Hold it.

474
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.941
You think I want to appreciate your face?

475
00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:54.181
Hold it higher.

476
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.150
Higher.

477
00:22:06.021 --> 00:22:07.491
It's not bad.

478
00:22:08.691 --> 00:22:10.390
But it's not perfect.

479
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.630
Shall I send it back?

480
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.660
Will you be responsible if its cost goes up?

481
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.171
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:19.630
Why are you sorry? You always say that.

483
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.711
Don't say a word.

484
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:34.451
Why aren't you leaving?

485
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.160
Goodnight, Vice President Joo.

486
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:19.390
So he takes important documents...

487
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.100
and other things back home.

488
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.300
Does he have some kind of a vault there?

489
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.201
If I ask his secretary, will he spill the beans?

490
00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:42.951
(Original jokbal)

491
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:48.320
The smallest one is 29 dollars.

492
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.130
Excuse me, I'll take soup and a bottle of soju.

493
00:24:01.501 --> 00:24:02.840
Joo Hyun Ki, that jerk.

494
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.870
That crazy scum.

495
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.781
Tomorrow, I'll make sure...

496
00:24:15.751 --> 00:24:17.050
I turn in my resignation.

497
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.691
I will.

498
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:44.681
I'm all by myself, but I ordered too much food.

499
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.451
It's all right.

500
00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:47.481
Have some.

501
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:50.521
I can't finish it anyway. Let's not waste it.

502
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.961
Then I'll take it since I really like jokbal.

503
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:56.860
Thank you.

504
00:25:13.171 --> 00:25:14.781
Goodnight.

505
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.981
Thanks for the food.

506
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:29.791
Was jokbal delicious?

507
00:25:29.791 --> 00:25:31.431
Yes, it was.

508
00:25:31.691 --> 00:25:33.330
What did you find out...

509
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.800
after sharing a delicious dish of jokbal?

510
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.201
What?

511
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:39.330
The guy who just left is...

512
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.471
Vice President Joo's secretary.

513
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.410
Mr. Kim.

514
00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:46.410
Share your big picture with me.

515
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.941
My big picture? I don't have such a thing.

516
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.781
You don't? That makes no sense.

517
00:25:58.791 --> 00:25:59.850
Ms. Jang.

518
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.521
To you, I'm not a human but a con man, right?

519
00:26:04.761 --> 00:26:06.731
A con man who's....

520
00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:08.330
always thinking about ways...

521
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.130
he can prey on people.

522
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:14.300
You're right. That's who I am.

523
00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:18.771
But...

524
00:26:19.471 --> 00:26:20.681
you know,

525
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.211
there's no need...

526
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:27.451
to push someone who looks as if...

527
00:26:27.721 --> 00:26:29.181
he's standing on an edge of a cliff.

528
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.120
So what?

529
00:26:32.191 --> 00:26:34.060
You didn't ask him anything?

530
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:35.521
Is that wrong?

531
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.491
You didn't do anything wrong.

532
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.560
It's not like you.

533
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.630
Right?

534
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.501
Why did I do that? That's so not like me.

535
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:48.870
I commend you, Mr. Kim.

536
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.810
It looks like you might become a human after all.

537
00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.880
I can't become a human.

538
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.281
I was looking forward to the day...

539
00:26:57.281 --> 00:26:59.580
when you'll get a hold of me to expose...

540
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.620
who I really am.

541
00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.320
You'll never become a human.

542
00:27:04.451 --> 00:27:06.850
Once a beast, forever a beast.

543
00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.860
Right? Don't you think so?

544
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.130
In that case, let's party like beasts tomorrow.

545
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.191
Bye.

546
00:27:14.961 --> 00:27:16.261
That crazy idiot.

547
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.001
Are you insane, Ha Ri?

548
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.461
Reporter Bang is in. Where are you, Mr. Kim?

549
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:46.731
Stop calling me, Ms. Jang.

550
00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:48.300
You're bothering me.

551
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.360
What?

552
00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:11.090
Are you the person who emailed me yesterday?

553
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.521
Oh, right.

554
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:16.620
- I emailed you because... - Yes?

555
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.431
Cheetah, to your right.

556
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:21.461
Yes, sir.

557
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.031
Mr. Kim is headed toward Lee Young Ho.

558
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.711
How did the agreement ceremony go,

559
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.840
Legal Affairs Manager Lee Young Ho?

560
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.610
I'm sorry, but who are you?

561
00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:39.751
Don't you recognize me?

562
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.890
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

563
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.951
Assistant Pilot Kim Bum Joon,

564
00:28:45.951 --> 00:28:49.060
who flew JH 801 which crashed two years ago.

565
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:52.491
I'm his brother, Jan Gebauer.

566
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.211
Excuse me, right behind you.

567
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.441
Darn it.

568
00:29:06.441 --> 00:29:08.310
Is it okay to leave Mr. Kim like that?

569
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.410
Reporter Bang.

570
00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.050
Please move aside.

571
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.380
Mr. Jan Gebauer.

572
00:29:14.681 --> 00:29:16.481
I heard you went back to Germany.

573
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.390
Have you returned?

574
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.691
I gave this some thought in Germany.

575
00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:23.461
If my brother, Kim Bum Joon...

576
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.261
crashed that flight because of depression,

577
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.300
I thought I need to hold you responsible.

578
00:29:27.701 --> 00:29:29.330
- Responsible? - Yes!

579
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.731
Yes, I'd like to hold Juhan Air responsible.

580
00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:34.971
I'll report Juhan Air to this world...

581
00:29:34.971 --> 00:29:37.041
for the depression, suicide, and...

582
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:39.041
industrial accident of my brother.

583
00:29:39.041 --> 00:29:40.110
- Report? - Industrial accident?

584
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.910
Doesn't he think about the people he killed?

585
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.310
Where's his conscience?

586
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.310
So annoying.

587
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.910
That's nonsense.

588
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.080
What's he talking about?

589
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.981
He already killed so many people.

590
00:29:48.981 --> 00:29:50.650
So many people died from the accident.

It's on.

(Jang Ha Ri)

594
00:30:22.981 --> 00:30:25.721
I told you to stop calling and bothering me.

595
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.191
Where are you right now?

596
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.721
In a meeting room on the 10th floor of JH.

597
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:32.191
We told you to stay under the radar,

598
00:30:32.191 --> 00:30:34.201
but you went out and exposed yourself.

599
00:30:34.501 --> 00:30:36.431
Great job, Mr. Kim.

600
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:41.070
Right. Did Reporter Bang get everything on video?

601
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.140
What?

602
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.011
I'll report Juhan Air to this world...

603
00:30:45.171 --> 00:30:47.541
for the depression, suicide, and...

604
00:30:47.541 --> 00:30:50.011
industrial accident of my brother.

605
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.850
Did you make a scene to be caught on video?

606
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.580
Let me know as soon as Reporter Bang uploads...

607
00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.021
the video on his blog.

608
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.590
The legal affairs manager is coming in.

609
00:31:00.721 --> 00:31:03.120
Yes, I'll call you later, Lawyer Jang.

610
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:08.160
Do you have a lawyer already?

611
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:11.531
I'm just a citizen... I'm just a foreigner,

612
00:31:11.671 --> 00:31:13.870
and JH is a huge corporate...

613
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.300
with a big name airline like Juhan Air.

614
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.511
So I should be thoroughly ready.

615
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.281
I'm glad you said that.

616
00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.350
Mr. Jan Gebauer, you are a citizen of Germany.

617
00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:29.050
You might be blood-related with...

618
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.350
the deceased, Mr. Kim Bum Joon,

619
00:31:31.991 --> 00:31:34.860
but legally speaking, you aren't his family.

620
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.590
Therefore, there is no way you'll get the pension...

621
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.090
which the family of the deceased gets...

622
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.001
after one dies from an industrial accident.

623
00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:43.100
Goodness, did I say...

624
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.100
I wanted the pension?

625
00:31:46.931 --> 00:31:48.671
I said I'll report Juhan Air...

626
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:50.910
to the world for the industrial accident.

627

The brother of a pilot, who crashed a plane...

628
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.511
which had 190 people on board,

629
00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.620
wishes to claim the accident was...

630
00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.421
an industrial accident to report JH Group?

631
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:05.120
That would cause a bit of trouble.

632
00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:07.090
I'm not sure.

633
00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:09.261
Our legal team is rather talented,

634
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:12.261
so I doubt there will be any trouble at all.

635

(Jang Ha Ri)

636
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.241
The video is up.

637
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:26.541
I think it's already causing trouble.

638
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:30.310
Yes, I'd like to hold Juhan Air responsible.

639
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.481
I'll report Juhan Air to this world...

640
00:32:33.481 --> 00:32:35.580
for the depression, suicide, and...

641

642
00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:39.521
Please call me...

645
00:33:00.271 --> 00:33:02.110

646
00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.281
Get rid of that video.

647
00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.681
Nothing...

has to happen until next week.

Yes, I'd like to hold Juhan Air responsible.

659
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.830

00:34:02.671 --> 00:34:04.910
I don't want to die either.

663
00:34:05.471 --> 00:34:07.110
If I reveal myself,

664

it'll be hard for them to do anything to me.

665

So you're getting stoned by the whole country...

666
00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:14.751
to stop Juhan Air from doing anything to you?

667
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:18.051
You're getting horrible comments.

668

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:34.341
Isn't that great?

676
00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:37.341
How is it great?

677
00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.740
Did he do that on purpose...

678
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.711
to be all over the media in case he gets...

679
00:34:44.711 --> 00:34:46.051
He's mad.

680
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.551
Mr. Choi told him to stay low.

681
00:34:49.551 --> 00:34:50.691
If he finds out,

682
00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:51.990
it'll cause a huge ruckus.

683
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:54.490
Dr. Kim will answer to that.

684
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.930
(Manager Choi Kang Woo)

685
00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:08.901
These are written stress disorder diagnosis...

686
00:35:09.271 --> 00:35:11.470
submitted by men in their mid 20's.

687
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.211
- Is this everything? - No.

688
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.381
There are over 100 more.

689
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.711
100?

690
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:22.450
"Stress disorder"?

691
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.291
August 2, 2017.

692
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:26.251
"Injury from training."

693
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.620
June 28, 2017.

694
00:35:28.821 --> 00:35:30.631
This person also got injured from training.

695
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.591
They are all from special forces.

696
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.131
How much would it be in total?

697
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.970
There are 100 more, so...

698
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.071
it'll be at least 5 million dollars.

699
00:35:40.301 --> 00:35:41.370
There must be more.

700
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.171
The key term is...

701
00:35:43.171 --> 00:35:44.441
special forces training stress disorder.

702
00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.180
Collect every case.

703
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.280
Yes, sir.

704
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.780
Has the special forces insurance scammer...

705
00:35:57.051 --> 00:35:58.120
from three years ago been released from jail?

706
00:35:58.291 --> 00:35:59.591
Yes, on July 21.

707
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:01.191
Gosh.

708
00:36:01.421 --> 00:36:03.691
Have you been following the ones you put in jail?

709
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.660
Have you ever seen...

710
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.530
a reformed scammer?

711
00:36:08.301 --> 00:36:09.560
Let's get the 5 million dollars...

712
00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.870
and go into the depository.

713
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.030
Okay.

714
00:36:15.401 --> 00:36:18.810
Yes, I'd like to hold Juhan Air responsible.

715
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.041
I'll report Juhan Air to this world...

716
00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:23.950
- for the depression... - Isn't that Kim Min Joon?

717
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.510
Gosh, I told him to stay low.

718
00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:32.321
(Mad Dog, At a Fishing Spot)

719
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.760
The whole country knows your face now.

720
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:44.271
Do you really have to...

721
00:36:44.271 --> 00:36:45.600
drink beer in public?

722
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:47.801
Long time no see, Mr. Choi.

723
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:50.041
Please sit down.

724
00:36:51.171 --> 00:36:53.740
You're going to have a long life.

725
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.810
Why?

726
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.481
Because people are cussing at me?

727
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.280
Are you okay?

728
00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:03.691
For two years, my brother has been...

729
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:05.720
falsely accused of crashing a plane.

730
00:37:06.321 --> 00:37:07.921
I don't care if I have to face worse things.

731
00:37:09.591 --> 00:37:10.760
Take it easy.

732
00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:12.890
You might really get killed.

733
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.001
Then I'll just get killed.

734
00:37:14.001 --> 00:37:15.961
- Hey, Kim Min Joon. - Do you want some?

735
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:17.870
No, thanks.

736
00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:21.200
Ju Won used to like that.

737
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.740
I...

738
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.010
got kicked out by my adoptive parents...

739
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.280
when I was 17.

740
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:38.620
Why did you get kicked out?

741
00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.490
Well...

742
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.990
What do you call that in Korea?

743
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.160
They had their real child at an old age.

744
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.401
They gave me a beat-up car...

745
00:37:49.401 --> 00:37:50.901
and told me to leave.

746
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.240
I starved for a few days after I left.

747
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.470
I parked my car...

748
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.171
to get some sleep at night.

749
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.441
The place I parked the car...

750
00:38:00.441 --> 00:38:02.810
was in front of an ice cream shop.

751
00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:05.810
Light was shining...

752
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.881
on the display window.

753
00:38:08.051 --> 00:38:10.691
Gosh, the ice cream looked delicious.

754
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.291
But I didn't have any money.

755
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.131
That was the first time I begged in my life.

756
00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.930
With the money I made,

757
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.060
I ran into the ice cream shop.

758
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:26.131
I bought an ice cream and walked out.

759
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.501
But this time,

760
00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:29.171
I didn't see the car that was coming at me.

761
00:38:29.901 --> 00:38:32.841
I dropped the ice cream on the ground.

762
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.841
That time, I felt...

763
00:38:40.821 --> 00:38:42.051
I picked it up and ate it.

764
00:38:45.651 --> 00:38:47.361
After eating that,

765
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.021
I cried for the first time.

766
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.961
I realized then...

767
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.260
that I was abandoned and alone.

768
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.700
A piece of ice as cold as that ice cream...

769
00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.470
pierced my heart.

770
00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:04.310
Do you know...

771
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:08.041
when that piece of ice started to melt?

772
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.551
October 11, 2015.

773
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.350
When my brother said...

774
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.220
"Next time, call me your brother."

775
00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.091
That was when.

776
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.131
Next time, call me your brother,

777
00:39:25.291 --> 00:39:26.291
okay?

778
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.801
For the first time, I hesitated...

779
00:39:29.361 --> 00:39:31.370
whether I should call him my brother or not.

780
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:34.600
I thought I'd call him my brother...

781
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.171
after he came back from his flight.

782
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:40.981
But I never got to.

783
00:39:43.651 --> 00:39:44.680
If...

784
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.910
I could put everyone in jail,

785
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:50.251
the ones who killed my brother,

786
00:39:52.021 --> 00:39:53.760
I'd be okay with dying.

787
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.421
Why would you die?

788
00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.160
They are the ones that have to die.

789
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.260
Right?

790
00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:04.370
It should be that way.

791
00:40:08.001 --> 00:40:09.001
You punk.

792
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:17.551
So...

793
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.850
show me...

794
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.321
what you have been doing.

795
00:40:22.321 --> 00:40:25.151
The dash cam recording you sent...

796
00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:27.160
was fabricated.

797
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.620
Lee Mi Ran was wanted for a million dollars.

798
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:32.030
I think...

799
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.361
the ones who killed my brother...

800
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:37.330
are very powerful people in Korea.

801
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:39.001
So you've been...

802
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:41.600
using your brain.

803
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.271
All I learned is stealing.

804
00:40:44.841 --> 00:40:48.841
I stole a bug from Pentium and planted it...

805
00:40:48.841 --> 00:40:51.211
in a JH meeting room.

806
00:40:51.211 --> 00:40:52.981
Goodness. Noo Ri...

807
00:40:53.211 --> 00:40:55.220
hates when someone touches his things.

808
00:40:55.821 --> 00:40:56.821
Then...

809
00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.521
be my accomplice. Deal?

810
00:41:09.631 --> 00:41:11.571
Legal Affairs Manager Lee Young Ho.

811
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.041
What's going on?

812
00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.410
Why is...

813
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.810
Kim Bum Joon's brother alive and causing trouble?

814
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:23.680
I'm not sure what you're saying.

815
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.251
"I'm not sure what you're saying"?

816
00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:30.350
Okay. Fine.

817
00:41:30.691 --> 00:41:32.220
That's none of my business.

818
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.521
Last time, you told me...

819
00:41:36.521 --> 00:41:38.361
you belong to JH, right?

820
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:40.191
Yes, sir.

821
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.631
Actually, I don't believe that.

822
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.771
Trust doesn't mean anything.

823
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.801
Everything moves according to the needs.

824
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:50.001
Isn't that right?

825
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:54.180
It's next week.

826
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.381
Until then, please let's stay quiet.

827
00:41:59.381 --> 00:42:01.180
Otherwise Chairman Cha...

828
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.521
won't be able to have it back forever.

829
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:05.950
Why?

830
00:42:07.021 --> 00:42:10.191
Because I might hold onto it forever.

831
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.930
You know, I have nowhere else to fall back.

832
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.501
I'm not afraid of anything.

833
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:24.671
Joo Hyun Ki has Chairman Cha's thing?

834
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.680
I'm not sure what that is,

835
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.711
but don't you think it's pretty important?

836
00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:35.251
Hey, this isn't original.

837
00:42:38.051 --> 00:42:39.051
(Life Insurance)

838
00:42:39.051 --> 00:42:41.620
All the insurances that he took out before 2010...

839
00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.091
were re-made after 2010.

840
00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:45.591
What are you talking about?

841
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:47.231
I think they fabricated...

842
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.530
the dates your brother signed the insurances.

843
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.700
Who? Why?

844
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.171
To increase the benefit up to 3.4 million dollars.

845
00:42:56.041 --> 00:42:57.441
If the price was high,

846
00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.510
it'd be easier for people to believe it was suicide.

847
00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.680
That's why Lee Mi Ran...

848
00:43:02.611 --> 00:43:04.410
told me to find the original policies.

849
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:08.151
If the original policies aren't...

850
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.220
in the depository of Taeyang Insurance...

851
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.191
Joo Hyun Ki...

852
00:43:15.191 --> 00:43:16.521
could have them.

853
00:43:18.961 --> 00:43:20.260
If Joo Hyun Ki has...

854
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.600
the original insurance policies,

855
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.131
where would he keep them?

856
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.530
It seemed like his secretary...

857
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:28.600
was moving some important documents...

858
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.571
to his house.

859
00:43:31.571 --> 00:43:34.240
Maybe he has a vault in his house.

860
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.481
Don't you think so?

861
00:43:36.481 --> 00:43:39.410
It means that we have to break into his house.

862
00:43:39.711 --> 00:43:42.080
What's his interest lately?

863
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:46.620
("JH Group Supports 2017 Korean Art Fair")

864
00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:48.821
Art?

865
00:43:49.521 --> 00:43:51.390
He's been very much...

866
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:53.731
interested in arts lately.

867
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.461
Is that right?

868
00:43:55.631 --> 00:43:56.700
Mr. Kim.

869
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.571
Do you know anything about art?

870
00:43:58.571 --> 00:43:59.600
A little bit.

871
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.271
It doesn't look like a piece of artwork at all.

872
00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:04.140
You have bad eyes for arts.

873
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.341
Let's see how good Mr. Kim...

874
00:44:06.341 --> 00:44:07.740
with a discerning eye is.

875
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.211
Goodness, Mad Dog.

876
00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:11.651
You really can't survive without me, can you?

877
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.551
All right, let's call this operation as...

878
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.591
"Open Sesame".

879
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:20.490
- Open what? - What does it mean?

880
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.791
My private curator told me...

881
00:44:23.091 --> 00:44:24.890
that Mr. Joo is coming tomorrow...

882
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:27.861
to buy another piece of arts...

883
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:29.131
for his collection.

884
00:44:29.131 --> 00:44:30.330
To where?

885
00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:33.271
Hello.

886
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.970
I'm Jan Gebauer, Kim Bum Joon's brother.

887
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.510
Is this Mr. Lee Young Ho?

888
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:38.970
Why would you call him?

889
00:44:40.881 --> 00:44:44.410
You said you'd call me after clear your head.

890
00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.551
But you didn't.

891
00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:48.620
If you're okay with it,

892
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.591
I'd like to visit JH Group once again...

893
00:44:50.591 --> 00:44:53.191
and talk to Vice President Joo Hyun Ki in person.

894
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.660
Gosh, this punk.

895
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:56.821
Does he have time tomorrow afternoon?

896
00:44:56.821 --> 00:44:59.231
He has no appointment in the afternoon tomorrow.

897
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:00.660
That's great.

898
00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.470
It's because I want to settle this quietly.

899
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.401
I'll ask him first and call you later.

900
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.410
All right, we knocked the door.

901
00:45:12.171 --> 00:45:14.981
Shall we open the gate of Joo Hyun Ki's house?

902
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.481
You have a bait?

903
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.450
I'll invest a piece...

904
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.350
called "By the Fishing Spot"...

905
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.850
from my precious art collection.

906
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:25.220
Good luck with your fishing.

907
00:45:25.591 --> 00:45:26.620
Guys.

908
00:45:27.461 --> 00:45:29.120
I'm sorry that I can't be out in the field with you.

909
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.231
I miss you guys.

910
00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:33.830
Don't worry about us, Mr. Choi.

911
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.461
Finish your business at ease...

912
00:45:36.461 --> 00:45:37.530
and come back to us.

913
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.200
Cheetah will protect Mad Dog until then.

914
00:45:41.541 --> 00:45:43.541
Call us if you need anything.

915
00:45:44.571 --> 00:45:45.611
Goodnight.

916
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.140
Mr. Choi.

917
00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.381
Don't stay out for too long and hurry back.

918
00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:51.981
I want to get rid of them from my house quickly.

919
00:45:51.981 --> 00:45:53.510
They're so noisy and annoying.

920
00:46:02.091 --> 00:46:04.560
That small fry is after Hyun Ki?

921
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:06.291
How shall I deal with it?

922
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.330
Do as he wants.

923
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.100
Let's sit back and enjoy the ride.

924
00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:16.901
Hold on.

925
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.341
You...

926
00:46:18.941 --> 00:46:20.341
Didn't you quit smoking?

927
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.410
You have breath refresher? Can you give me one?

928
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.780
Breath refresher?

929
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.501
(Taeyang Insurance)

930
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.501
What's this?

931
00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:46.470
You returned to Taeyang?

932
00:46:46.571 --> 00:46:47.801
Do you remember...

933
00:46:47.801 --> 00:46:49.671
the ex-special forces whom we caught three years ago?

934
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.771
It's five million dollars this time.

935
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.640
I might make some good results,

936
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.981
thanks to my good friend.

937
00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:57.051
Thanks.

938
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.711
Hey, what's up with your attitude?

939
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.551
Why are you so sarcastic?

940
00:47:01.551 --> 00:47:03.151
It's because I'm worried about you.

941
00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:06.321
You went after Lee Mi Ran and Ko Jin Chul recently.

942
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.260
What are you trying to do in that company now?

943
00:47:08.591 --> 00:47:09.890
Ko Jin Chul's death...

944
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.060
will be settled as suicide, right?

945
00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.961
I think so.

946
00:47:16.731 --> 00:47:18.600
They kill people and cover it so easily.

947
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.740
How impressive.

948
00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.240
Don't worry, I'll chase them until the end.

949
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.171
Don't. I will do it.

950
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.841
Just arrest the broker for me.

951
00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:29.510
I won't call you from now on.

952
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:30.611
Why wouldn't you?

953
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:32.111
Stay out of this.

954
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.381
I'll be too ashamed to see your family...

955
00:47:35.421 --> 00:47:37.251
if something happens to you because of me.

956
00:47:37.251 --> 00:47:38.350
Kang Woo.

957
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:40.760
Thanks.

958
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:42.620
Hey.

959
00:47:43.321 --> 00:47:44.461
Kang Woo.

960
00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.830
"By the Fishing Spot".

961
00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.530
You sure this is a renowned piece?

962
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.901
The world's famous art collector,

963
00:47:56.901 --> 00:47:59.441
Chairman Jan Borgia, recently bought the piece.

964
00:47:59.611 --> 00:48:01.381
We're getting a lot of inquiries...

965
00:48:01.381 --> 00:48:03.280
from Museum of Islamic Art in Doha as well.

966
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.080
Jan Borgia.

967
00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.251
How much will it cost?

968
00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:08.881
We can't simply put a price...

969
00:48:08.881 --> 00:48:10.990
on the value of this piece.

970
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.321
How else can you pay for its worth...

971
00:48:12.321 --> 00:48:14.060
if not with money?

972
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:16.660
Forget it. I get it,

973
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.791
so pack this for me.

974
00:48:17.791 --> 00:48:19.231
I'll hang it in my office.

975
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.001
I'm sorry,

976
00:48:21.001 --> 00:48:25.030
but may I know your company name?

977
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.470
- What? - The artist...

978
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.711
doesn't sell his pieces to just anyone.

979
00:48:30.711 --> 00:48:31.771
What?

980
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.140
I'm not just anyone.

981
00:48:34.881 --> 00:48:36.640
Are you kidding me?

982
00:48:37.551 --> 00:48:39.751
Where's the person in charge?

983
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.390
Oh, gosh.

984
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:51.660
Hello, Vice President Joo.

985
00:48:56.461 --> 00:48:57.930
Do you know me?

986
00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.301
Of course I do.

987
00:48:59.301 --> 00:49:01.571
You're Vice President Joo Hyun Ki.

988
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.740
You're one of the best art collectors.

989
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:07.611
"By the Fishing Spot".

990
00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.580
I'd like to add this piece in my collection.

991
00:49:12.111 --> 00:49:13.310
Will it be possible?

992
00:49:19.551 --> 00:49:20.791
I'll make sure...

993
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.060
to deliver it to your house this afternoon.

994
00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.461
In the afternoon? Okay.

995
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:26.160
Thanks in advance.

996
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.631
Goodbye.

997
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.751
He took the bait.

998
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.981
It's time to reel out a line.

999
00:49:49.651 --> 00:49:50.720
Hello.

1000
00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:52.350
Hello.

1001
00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:54.890
I'm here to take the piece I bought last time.

1002
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.791
Which one in specific?

1003
00:49:56.791 --> 00:49:58.330
"By the Fishing Spot".

1004
00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:01.430
Ex-special forces...

1005
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:02.961
recommended their juniors...

1006
00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:04.600
to take out an insurance.

1007
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.001
Then they faked the medical diagnosis,

1008
00:50:06.001 --> 00:50:08.171
taking their injuries from training as a cause.

1009
00:50:08.301 --> 00:50:10.941
Their insurance claims went up...

1010
00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.271
to 5 million dollars in 3 months?

1011
00:50:13.271 --> 00:50:14.711
We noticed them that we'd halt the payment.

1012
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:17.280
And we requested an investigation to...

1013
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.080
Daemyeong Police Station. They'll be arrested soon.

1014
00:50:19.651 --> 00:50:22.350
It's been only a few days since you returned.

1015
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:23.890
But you already stopped five-million-dollar loss.

1016
00:50:24.151 --> 00:50:25.751
Good job, Mr. Choi.

1017
00:50:26.921 --> 00:50:28.160
I'll organize the files...

1018
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.160
and store them in the depository.

1019
00:50:30.191 --> 00:50:32.430
Hand them to me after organizing them.

1020

1021
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.771

Pardon?

1023
00:50:40.231 --> 00:50:42.801
He'll deal with big cases as well in the future.

1024
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:44.640
It'll be a hassle to get permission every time.

1025

Hello?

1029
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:03.890
Vice President Joo has an appointment,

1030
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.361
so he can talk only for 10 minutes from 3pm.

1031
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.560
That's more than enough.

1032
00:51:09.001 --> 00:51:10.131
I'll see you soon.

1033
00:51:24.611 --> 00:51:25.611
Let's go.

1034
00:51:26.051 --> 00:51:27.151
All right.

1035
00:51:39.131 --> 00:51:40.330
Who's this?

1036
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.801
I'm here for a delivery from Haesum Gallery.

1037
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.171
Okay, she has entered his house.

1038
00:51:49.171 --> 00:51:52.370
Is the vice president on his way for his meeting?

1039
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:55.640
Well...

1040
00:51:59.611 --> 00:52:02.680
He's on his way to the meeting place.

1041
00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:08.021
I'm going back to the office.

1042
00:52:08.021 --> 00:52:10.060
You have a short meeting at 3pm.

1043
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:11.530
With whom?

1044
00:52:11.731 --> 00:52:14.731
The brother of Assistant Pilot Kim Bum Joon,

1045
00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:15.901
Jan Gebauer.

1046
00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.801
What? You idiot...

1047
00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:18.930
If you want to deal with this quietly,

1048
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.671
you'd better meet him.

1049
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.010
Fine.

1050
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.850
Why does Jan Gebauer suddenly want to meet?

1051
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.981
And 3pm today of all days?

1052
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.151
I'll make sure...

1053
00:52:37.151 --> 00:52:39.751
to deliver it to your house this afternoon.

1054
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.691
Mr. Han, turn the car and go back home.

1055
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:44.030
Call my house. Tell them to not let anyone in.

1056
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.131
Turn the car, and make the call!

1057
00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:47.160
Yes, Vice President Joo.

1058
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.470
Why is he suddenly making a U-turn?

1059
00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:01.381
I think you can just leave it here.

1060
00:53:02.041 --> 00:53:04.450
The artist is very sensitive about his work.

1061
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:05.981
He told us to take a picture of...

1062
00:53:05.981 --> 00:53:07.850
where his piece will be placed.

1063
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:14.091
Ma'am, I'm a bit thirsty.

1064

How much time do I have?

1074
00:54:32.501 --> 00:54:33.941
He's stepping on it.

1075
00:54:33.941 --> 00:54:35.401
Less than five minutes.
