00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:13.943
Who are you looking for?

2
00:00:15.013 --> 00:00:16.043
Hello.

3
00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:19.014
Is the owner of this shop around?

4
00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:21.854
Oh, you're looking for Princess.

5
00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:22.923
Princess?

6
00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.993
She's pretty like a princess, so we call her Princess.

7
00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.594
Aren't you Mr. Ko from the drama?

8
00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:32.393
You are. My gosh, I don't believe it.

9
00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:34.133
Yes.

10
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.804
Anyway, where can we find the owner of this shop?

11
00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:38.073
We are in a rush looking for her.

12
00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:41.304
It's been a month since she left this village.

13
00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:44.344
She left? To where? Do you know where she went to?

14
00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:47.584
I'm not sure. Somewhere near her husband's hometown.

15
00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.253
Aren't you Sa Jin Jin?

16
00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.213
My goodness, I need to get your autographs.

17
00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.124
Do you have any paper on you?

18
00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:57.054
My gosh.

19
00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.253
Goodness.

20
00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.464
I'm done with your left side. Now, the right side.

21
00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:09.134
U.

22
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:14.544
It's really cloudy as if I'm seeing through a thick fog.

23
00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:16.913
It's just because you're getting old.

24
00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:19.613
It's nothing, right?

25
00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.384
Her eyesight is the same.

26
00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:24.053
I think you'd better visit an optometrist.

27
00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:25.283
An optometrist?

28
00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:29.524
You don't need a doctor. It's all because you're aging.

29
00:01:40.703 --> 00:01:41.904
I see.

30
00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:44.404
You had a sister like that.

31
00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:46.673
When she first left,

32
00:01:48.143 --> 00:01:50.244
I despised her...

33
00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:51.714
thinking that she's crazy.

34
00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:54.413
After some time passed,

35
00:01:55.044 --> 00:01:56.854
I decided to try to understand her.

36
00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:02.524
And now, I hope she's happy.

37
00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.294
If she's unhappy,

38
00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:09.924
it would make my parents even more pitiful.

39
00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:16.304
All we did was fight each other. Because she ripped your poster,

40
00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:19.174
because we wanted to use the bed, because her body touched mine,

41
00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.674
and telling each other to turn off the lights.

42
00:02:23.513 --> 00:02:24.913
But why do I miss her?

43
00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.413
Because she's family.

44
00:02:29.043 --> 00:02:30.214
I envy you.

45
00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:34.524
At least you have some hope.

46
00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:37.154
You might be able to meet her if you wait.

47
00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:39.793
But I don't have a chance even if I decide to wait.

48
00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:44.494
My mom is over on the other side.

49
00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.073
She's probably keeping her eyes on you.

50
00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:57.473
When you eat, sleep, work,

51
00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:59.744
and even skipping work like today.

52
00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:02.084
I'm sure she's watching your every move.

53
00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:05.813
I see.

54
00:03:07.184 --> 00:03:09.954
That means she's probably watching me as well.

55
00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:19.733
I'm sure your sister is keeping her eyes on you too.

56
00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:23.033
You're a superstar.

57
00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:25.804
She'll probably see me too.

58
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:27.603
I hope she likes me.

59
00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:31.043
She won't. She hates everything that I like.

60
00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:32.374
She's mean like that.

61
00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.253
Thank you...

62
00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:41.124
for spending time with me.

63
00:03:42.654 --> 00:03:44.293
I apologize for...

64
00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:46.554
letting my emotions take over...

65
00:03:46.554 --> 00:03:48.594
and ruining our workday.

66
00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:51.594
Thanks to you, we got some time to ourselves.

67
00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.374
Over here.

68
00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:01.874
Over here.

69
00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:10.253
To Anthony and Jin Jin's happy wedded life.

70
00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:12.184
- Cheers. - Cheers.

71
00:04:12.983 --> 00:04:15.154
Wait, wait, wait.

72
00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:19.524
- Let's have some before we start. - What's that?

73
00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:23.834
We're promoting this. It prevents hangovers.

74
00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:25.933
Let's take the leftovers.

75
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:28.233
It'll be better than nothing.

76
00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.774
You two are on fire.

77
00:04:37.074 --> 00:04:39.814
- What? - You're so popular.

78
00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:44.754
I've been with the show for 10 years since the beginning.

79
00:04:44.754 --> 00:04:46.454
You're the hottest couple we had.

80
00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:48.283
That's all thanks to Jin Jin.

81
00:04:48.283 --> 00:04:51.053
No, there's a reason you have great chemistry.

82
00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:53.663
You are the perfect couple.

83
00:04:53.663 --> 00:04:54.723
It's fate.

84
00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:56.964
From what I've seen so far,

85
00:04:56.964 --> 00:05:00.163
you two will make it to the 10th season.

86
00:05:00.803 --> 00:05:03.873
- What? - You must watch out for one thing.

87
00:05:03.873 --> 00:05:06.173
Scandals. Those are a no-no.

88
00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:09.504
If there are any, they should be about you two.

89
00:05:10.514 --> 00:05:12.344
We didn't sign a contract about it,

90
00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:15.314
but if a rumor starts about either of you,

91
00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.553
it'll ruin your reputation and our show's.

92
00:05:17.553 --> 00:05:19.454
Don't worry. That won't happen.

93
00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:22.553
I'm not worried. Why would I be? Now eat up.

94
00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:25.254
- You caught the fish. - Right.

95
00:05:36.404 --> 00:05:39.933
Do you want something hot? Don't you feel cold?

96
00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:44.214
Spicy fish soup. This place cooks a mean fish soup.

97
00:05:44.214 --> 00:05:45.413
I'd like that.

98
00:05:45.873 --> 00:05:48.584
Can we have some fish soup?

99
00:05:48.683 --> 00:05:49.714
Sure.

100
00:05:54.983 --> 00:05:57.094
That tastes amazing.

101
00:05:57.853 --> 00:05:59.853
- Try some, Jin Jin. - Okay.

102
00:06:21.344 --> 00:06:23.243
Our honeymoon is over.

103
00:06:23.913 --> 00:06:26.483
It is. Thank you.

104
00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:31.353
- You're leaving early tomorrow? - Yes.

105
00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:32.923
I have afternoon plans.

106
00:06:33.824 --> 00:06:35.793
You'll stay a bit longer?

107
00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:37.433
Yes.

108
00:06:40.603 --> 00:06:42.803
Shall I walk you to your room?

109
00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:45.204
Go on inside.

110
00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:52.043
Jin Jin.

111
00:06:54.344 --> 00:06:57.683
- See you in Seoul. - Of course. We must.

112
00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:01.954
I have something to say.

113
00:07:03.754 --> 00:07:04.754
Okay.

114
00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:06.524
Go on.

115
00:07:42.293 --> 00:07:43.423
Are you tired?

116
00:07:43.423 --> 00:07:46.293
I'll drop by the convenience store.

117
00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:49.163
- Okay, see you tomorrow. - Goodnight. See you.

118
00:07:49.163 --> 00:07:50.233
Bye.

119
00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:54.873
Sorry. We don't have that medicine.

120
00:07:56.814 --> 00:07:59.973
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

121
00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:03.384
All the ones nearby are closed now.

122
00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:05.084
There are some in town,

123
00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.923
but that's an hour by car at least.

124
00:08:10.394 --> 00:08:11.954
That's too bad.

125
00:08:29.344 --> 00:08:31.613
Do you feel unwell?

126
00:08:32.574 --> 00:08:34.684
- What? - Are you sick?

127
00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:38.253
No, well...

128
00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:39.883
Did you...

129
00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.924
eat shrimp?

130
00:08:46.454 --> 00:08:48.263
Why did you eat that?

131
00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:51.094
I thought a little wouldn't hurt.

132
00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:54.034
Let me see.

133
00:08:58.674 --> 00:09:01.674
That's not a little. It'll get worse.

134
00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:05.444
- Fever? - Not yet.

135
00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.883
- Nausea? - A bit.

136
00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:10.214
- Itchiness? - A lot.

137
00:09:11.253 --> 00:09:13.454
I'll get my car. Wait here.

138
00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:15.223
Let's get some medicine.

139
00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:34.304
- Hello. - Hello.

140
00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:35.903
24 Sangsu-dong, please.

141
00:09:35.903 --> 00:09:38.214
Sure thing. Let me see...

142
00:09:38.473 --> 00:09:42.143
Sorry, but can you drive me into the alley?

143
00:09:42.143 --> 00:09:43.284
I will.

144
00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:47.653
A pretty lady like you should be careful at night.

145
00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:50.824
Right. Thank you.

146
00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.023
Isn't it hard to get a taxi there?

147
00:09:56.294 --> 00:09:59.534
It is. I almost reported a few drivers for refusing to take me.

148
00:09:59.534 --> 00:10:02.934
I was going to drive on as well.

149
00:10:03.304 --> 00:10:06.574
I have a thing for ladies with pretty ankles.

150
00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:10.844
I noticed yours from a distance.

151
00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:13.143
- Don't you get that a lot? - I don't.

152
00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:16.814
Women look prettier with their ankles on display.

153
00:10:16.814 --> 00:10:18.853
Women these days show their thighs...

154
00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:21.123
as if they're begging for attention.

155
00:10:21.123 --> 00:10:23.924
Men can look. Sometimes, they can touch.

156
00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:26.723
Women get so riled up about that.

157
00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:29.763
- I like that. - The next headline.

158
00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:32.094
The government...

159
00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:34.464
laid out plans to increase full-time employment,

160
00:10:34.464 --> 00:10:36.363
but clashes and conflicts...

161
00:10:36.363 --> 00:10:38.074
(Please charge)

162
00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:41.473
A member of the Ministry of Employment...

163
00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:43.743
and Labor announced they'll...

164
00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.314
hold a meeting next month.

165
00:10:47.784 --> 00:10:49.814
The female university student...

166
00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:52.184
who'd gone missing in Chuncheon on the 20th...

167
00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.383
was found dead today.

168
00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:58.153
Her body was found four days after she was reported missing.

169
00:10:58.153 --> 00:11:02.164
The public, especially young women, are feeling increasingly afraid.

170
00:11:02.164 --> 00:11:03.664
(Obey signals)

171
00:11:29.023 --> 00:11:31.794
(Pharmacy)

172
00:11:56.084 --> 00:11:57.714
I'm so sorry.

173
00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.893
- Thank you. - What do you need?

174
00:12:03.893 --> 00:12:06.253
- Do you have any antihistamines? - Yes.

175
00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:23.544
You'll be okay now.

176
00:12:24.914 --> 00:12:27.214
- Okay. - Take a shower,

177
00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:29.883
and take one more before bed. Don't forget.

178
00:12:30.414 --> 00:12:31.483
Okay.

179
00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:42.493
I'll get out here.

180
00:12:42.694 --> 00:12:45.664
We have to go into the alley. To number 24.

181
00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:47.664
It's fine. Stop here, please.

182
00:12:47.664 --> 00:12:49.534
We're nearly there.

183
00:13:58.434 --> 00:13:59.473
(Bombed Jung Woo Sung)

184
00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:05.844
What should I do? I'm so scared.

185
00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:09.143
Right outside... What should I do?

186
00:14:18.653 --> 00:14:21.694
Mr. Kang, hadn't you gone home?

187
00:14:22.263 --> 00:14:23.633
I left some papers.

188
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.273
Good luck on your first court case.

189
00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:40.143
It's always good to win.

190
00:14:41.344 --> 00:14:44.284
End it before your hands get sweaty or you feel thirsty.

191
00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:46.824
Okay, thanks.

192
00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:48.853
- See you. - Bye.

193
00:14:49.353 --> 00:14:50.454
Mr. Kang.

194
00:14:51.393 --> 00:14:54.294
Didn't you say you came for some papers?

195

196
00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:12.844
Who are you?

197
00:15:21.824 --> 00:15:24.253
Stay where you are. I called the cops.

198
00:15:24.554 --> 00:15:25.653
Come at me.

199
00:15:25.653 --> 00:15:28.794
- What rotten luck. - Come on, let's fight.

200
00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:43.574
Ah Reum, Han Ah Reum.

201
00:15:44.814 --> 00:15:46.814
Are you home? It's Woo Sung.

202
00:15:48.143 --> 00:15:49.414
Ah Reum, are you okay?

203
00:15:50.214 --> 00:15:51.914
Ah Reum, Han Ah Reum.

204
00:15:54.084 --> 00:15:56.653
Ah Reum, it's me, Woo Sung.

205
00:16:01.064 --> 00:16:02.223
Are you okay?

206
00:16:12.733 --> 00:16:14.204
Were you scared?

207
00:16:16.103 --> 00:16:18.814
It's okay. You're safe now.

208
00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:24.013
You're okay now.

209
00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.403
Are you carsick?

210
00:16:42.564 --> 00:16:43.834
Am I a mess?

211
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.733
Don't say that.

212
00:16:45.903 --> 00:16:47.903
Antihistamines make you carsick.

213
00:16:49.603 --> 00:16:51.113
Let's get some air.

214
00:17:07.663 --> 00:17:08.693
It's cold.

215
00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:14.504
Come on, it's cold.

216
00:17:14.504 --> 00:17:15.564
Don't.

217
00:17:18.734 --> 00:17:19.873
What's wrong?

218
00:17:21.304 --> 00:17:22.673
Don't you get it?

219
00:17:24.113 --> 00:17:25.443
Am I a pushover?

220
00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:29.613
You don't have the guts to ignore me. You see me suffer,

221
00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:32.584
so you get me medicine and keep me warm out of guilt?

222
00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:35.353
That'll make you a good person.

223
00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:37.324
And you'll feel fine.

224
00:17:38.653 --> 00:17:39.994
Just stop it.

225
00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:43.794
Stop being way too nice, confusing and toying with me,

226
00:17:43.794 --> 00:17:45.334
then walking off.

227
00:17:49.363 --> 00:17:50.703
I'll stop too.

228
00:17:51.903 --> 00:17:54.103
You made me feel both happy and sad.

229
00:17:54.203 --> 00:17:57.544
Wasting my energy on you, wasting time waiting on you.

230
00:18:01.784 --> 00:18:04.953
You left without a word 17 years ago, and I expected news.

231
00:18:05.613 --> 00:18:07.054
I waited for years.

232
00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:10.153
I expected you to come see me at the hospital.

233
00:18:10.554 --> 00:18:11.824
I waited for you.

234
00:18:14.024 --> 00:18:15.423
I regret it all.

235
00:18:16.363 --> 00:18:18.433
- Sa Jin Jin. - Don't you get it?

236
00:18:18.693 --> 00:18:20.463
I'm sick of it.

237
00:18:21.504 --> 00:18:23.163
You're driving me crazy.

238
00:19:10.084 --> 00:19:12.254
(Antihistamine)

239
00:19:52.554 --> 00:19:55.264
- Jin Jin. - The weather's amazing.

240
00:19:55.264 --> 00:19:56.994
Let's ride a kayak.

241
00:19:57.294 --> 00:19:59.193
That's for couples.

242
00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:00.834
How about a quad bike?

243
00:20:01.564 --> 00:20:03.163
You drive all day.

244
00:20:03.163 --> 00:20:04.673
- Aren't you sick of it? - No.

245
00:20:04.673 --> 00:20:08.103
Shall we go paragliding? Let's get rid of some stress.

246
00:20:08.103 --> 00:20:10.913
Shall we go hiking? Up a mountain.

247
00:20:11.314 --> 00:20:13.943
We could take photos to post on social media.

248
00:20:13.943 --> 00:20:16.683
"I'm here too. Life's good."

249
00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:18.014
Aren't you tired?

250
00:20:18.014 --> 00:20:20.183
- It'll be fun. - I'm just fine.

251
00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:21.584
You're in your 20s.

252
00:20:22.324 --> 00:20:23.794
I'm not like you.

253
00:20:23.853 --> 00:20:26.724
You go have fun. I'll stay at the hotel.

254
00:20:26.824 --> 00:20:28.724
I have homework to do.

255
00:20:29.564 --> 00:20:32.294
I never was good in school, but homework must be done.

256
00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:44.873
Running in fury.

257
00:20:46.643 --> 00:20:48.413
Do you run when you're hung over?

258
00:20:49.744 --> 00:20:52.784
I heard you drank all the alcohol on the island last night.

259
00:20:54.054 --> 00:20:56.453
Why? Is something wrong?

260
00:20:56.994 --> 00:20:58.594
- Yes. - Really?

261
00:20:58.893 --> 00:20:59.994
What's wrong?

262
00:21:02.994 --> 00:21:04.064
(Chairman)

263
00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:06.693
Hello, sir.

264
00:21:09.133 --> 00:21:11.734
Yes, I'm still on the island.

265
00:21:14.244 --> 00:21:16.974
Yes, Uncle. I just reached the cafe.

266
00:21:17.373 --> 00:21:20.213
A blind date on Jeju Island. That's a first.

267
00:21:20.784 --> 00:21:22.984
What's his name?

268
00:21:23.853 --> 00:21:25.213
What Ji Won?

269
00:21:26.514 --> 00:21:29.584
Gong Ji Won? Okay.

270
00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:31.994
I'll show you the way.

271
00:22:03.994 --> 00:22:06.453
- I'm Gong Ji Won. - I'm Kim Ji Yeon.

272
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.564
Aren't you Sa Jin Jin?

273
00:22:11.834 --> 00:22:15.564
I'm a huge fan. Could you take a selfie with us?

274
00:22:15.564 --> 00:22:17.734
- Sure. - Thank you.

275
00:22:17.734 --> 00:22:18.873
Just a moment.

276
00:22:20.403 --> 00:22:24.713
My uncle praised you so much. I wondered what you were like.

277
00:22:25.074 --> 00:22:27.713
I was going to call you when I got to Seoul.

278
00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.383
It's great to meet you sooner.

279
00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.713
I happened to come here to play golf.

280
00:22:32.754 --> 00:22:35.653
The chairman strongly urged me to meet you.

281
00:22:36.353 --> 00:22:39.423
I didn't dare say no to his face.

282
00:22:40.824 --> 00:22:41.863
I'm not...

283
00:22:42.693 --> 00:22:45.264
ready to meet anyone just yet.

284
00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:48.504
I was going to tell you in Seoul through the phone.

285
00:22:48.504 --> 00:22:51.633
I didn't think I'd get to meet you here.

286
00:22:53.603 --> 00:22:54.673
I see.

287
00:23:16.623 --> 00:23:18.234
It was an excuse.

288
00:23:19.294 --> 00:23:20.363
Sorry?

289
00:23:22.304 --> 00:23:25.774
I'm done making excuses. I'm done making her wait.

290
00:23:25.774 --> 00:23:28.344
I have to go. I'm very sorry.

291
00:23:40.123 --> 00:23:42.853
Sa Jin Jin. Jin Jin.

292
00:23:47.963 --> 00:23:49.064
Sa Jin Jin.

293
00:23:50.064 --> 00:23:52.633
We need to talk. Hey, we have to talk.

294
00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:54.403
- I don't have anything to say. - I do.

295
00:23:54.403 --> 00:23:56.403
Are you doing this because you know you're my weak spot?

296
00:23:57.103 --> 00:23:59.103
Do you think I'll do anything if you ask me to?

297
00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:01.744
- Don't be delusional. - Please hear me out.

298
00:24:01.744 --> 00:24:04.074
No. I don't want to.

299
00:24:04.413 --> 00:24:06.443
I said I don't want to be heartbroken again.

300
00:24:06.713 --> 00:24:10.084
- I don't want to wait for you. - I don't either.

301
00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:15.724
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

302
00:24:19.254 --> 00:24:23.094
I was at the hospital when you had collapsed.

303
00:24:24.393 --> 00:24:26.834
I saw you lying there in the emergency room,

304
00:24:27.403 --> 00:24:28.764
and I saw Chul Min there.

305
00:24:30.173 --> 00:24:31.734
The fact that he was there...

306
00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:38.443
I wasn't expecting to see him there with you, so I left.

307
00:24:38.943 --> 00:24:41.584
I thought I had no choice but to turn back.

308
00:24:42.344 --> 00:24:44.213
That's what I said to myself to comfort me.

309
00:24:47.683 --> 00:24:49.754
But it was all but an excuse. I was delusional.

310
00:24:52.353 --> 00:24:54.324
I was the one who had a problem.

311
00:24:55.693 --> 00:24:56.863
I had been...

312
00:24:58.863 --> 00:25:00.363
holding myself back.

313
00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:07.373
I was afraid you'd leave me.

314
00:25:10.113 --> 00:25:12.274
Because everyone that I love always leaves me.

315
00:25:14.314 --> 00:25:15.814
I was afraid you'd do the same.

316
00:25:20.453 --> 00:25:22.024
Let's stop...

317
00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:25.353
being friends.
