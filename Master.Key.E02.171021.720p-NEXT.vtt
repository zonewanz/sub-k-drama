00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.209
Welcome to Master Village.

2
00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.109
(A Guide to Players)

3
00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.710
We are the members of 2nd season.

4
00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.480
Did Hyun Moo quit?

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.289
Didn't you know I was coming today?

6
00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.789
You should be here earlier
than others.

7
00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.019
- You look so old.
- Well...

8
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.629
- I am from City Council.
- Okay.

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.829
- Welcome.
- Hello.

10
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.359
They were the members of I.O.I.

11
00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.600
- Yes.
- They missed each other.

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.899
- Good.
- She sings well.

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.629
Aren't you an actress now?

14
00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:35.769
You're making me blush.

15
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.469
- Don't mention it.
- You're an actress now.

16
00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.469
- She's a good actress as well.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.079
You've been busy lately.

18
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.310
(A Healing Master, Chae Yeon)

19
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.210
- You have to dance like this.
- Oh, I see.

20
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.520
- It's a rabbit dance.
- It is.

21
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.619
We had to dance like this back then.

22
00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.390
The rabbit dance looks
more relaxed now.

23
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.219
She's so busy these days.
She's on many commercials as well.

24
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.659
Reporting for duty. Salute!

25
00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.590
(It's his first comeback show after
he was discharged from the army.)

26
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.060
As you all know,
I was discharged from the army.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.700
- What else do I have to say?
- Why is he struggling to talk?

28
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.270
You should mention
Super Junior's return.

29
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.799
You should sing for us then.

30
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.939
He is actually in charge of dancing
in his team.

31
00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.109
(He dances awkwardly.)

32
00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:18.849
It's so embarrassing. I just hope
that Super Junior will do well.

33
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.879
- We hope that too.
- Yes.

34
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.049
- It's going to be fun today.
- Hello.

35
00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.620
Nice to meet you all.

36
00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.390
I am Hong Gi from FTIsland.

37
00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:30.390
- He's handsome.
- I was talking to him earlier,

38
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.489
- and he hopes that...
- I hope I sing well.

39
00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:33.790
he sings well for his new album.

40
00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.659
I'm currently preparing
for a musical at the moment.

41
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.269
I'm Sung Jong from Infinite.
Nice to meet you all.

42
00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:42.439
(A Lemon Candy Master, Sung Jong)

43
00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.939
He barely goes out.

44
00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.810
- I haven't been outside.
- Is that why you look so pale?

45
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.939
I don't have any work to do
these days.

46
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.849
Hello.

47
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.180
I am Bobby, and I'm currently
staying in Yeonnam-dong.

48
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.590
I like his voice.

49
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.549
- He said he lives in Yeonnam-dong.
- Yeonnam-dong?

50
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.019
Come on, Bobby.

51
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.290
(Show us your moves.)

52
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.799
(The dance battle continues.)

53
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.699
(An Award Winner, Jong Min)

54
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.069
- He's still good.
- Hello, I'm Shownu of Monsta X.

55
00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.610
(A Powerful Master, Shownu)

56
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.580
Hello everyone, I'm Henry.
I will do well today.

57
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.389
Please find a key to enter...

58
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.689
Room of Fate.

59
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.360
- Players, start searching.
- Where do I find the key?

60
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.900
What do I do? I'm so bad at this
kind of games.

61
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.770
Where do I find the key?

62
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.270
Gosh.

63
00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.699
Oh, it's here!

64
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.169
I found it.

65
00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.479
(Chae Yeon found the key.)

66
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.849
It's here! It's in a black box.

67
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.750
Finally.

68
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.819
- I found one.
- It's in a box.

69
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.930
- Many of us found the keys.
- Sung Jong found one as well.

70
00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.860
What do we do with this key?

71
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.159
You have to trick others.

72
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.560
You should not tell others that
you have the Master Key.

73
00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.770
(Players can find the real
Master Key in Room of Fate.)

74
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.800
This place looks amazing.

75
00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.770
You have to control
your face expressions.

76
00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.969
The door is closing.

77
00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.439
(Players entered.)

78
00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.810
- I love this place.
- It's like an amusement park.

79
00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.810
- This is amazing.
- He's here.

80
00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.349
Players, you all did a good job
on finding the keys.

81
00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.689
- Thank you.
- You're in...

82
00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.120
Room of Fate
which will determine...

83
00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.590
the fate of your keys
in Master Village.

84
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.199
I will now tell you how the keys
you're holding will...

85
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.370
affect your fate on this show
in detail.

86
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.810
Please open the lid of the podium
placed in front of you.

87
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.639
- What's this?
- Look at this.

88
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.409
Among 12 keys,

89
00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.750
there are only two Master Keys
that can open the box.

90
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.289
We have to guess two people who
have the Master Keys accurately.

91
00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.889
That's how we'll win
the prize money. Also, the person...

92
00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.430
with a Master Key who finds
another person with a Master Key...

93
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.529
without getting caught,
that person will win the prize.

94
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.100
We won't know
who has the Master Key.

95
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.769
People who have the keys
must give each other signals.

96
00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.740
- Okay?
- The important thing is that...

97
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.569
whoever has a Master Key only has to
find another player with the key.

98
00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.610
That's how you will have higher
possibility of winning.

99
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.870
Do all of you understand the rules?

100
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.379
- Yes.
- All right.

101
00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.279
Whose keys are the Master Keys?

102
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.850
- Do we put this around our neck?
- From now,

103
00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.350
I will inform you how to check
if your keys are Master Keys.

104
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.149
- Put it around your neck.
- First,

105
00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:51.160
place your keys
on the counter.

106
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.529
And ask this question,
"Is this key the Master Key?"

107
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.899
When you do, the counter will
give you the answer.

108
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.000
It's now time to open the counter.

109
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.899
I will check it first.

110
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.740
This is what you have to do.
Place your key on the counter...

111
00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.110
All right.

112
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.550
Is this the Master Key?

113
00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.819
(He will find out his fate
with his own eyes.)

114
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.560
Just don't let the people
beside you see it.

115
00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.000
- You have to...
- All right.

116
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.600
(What does his smile mean?)

117
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.040
Why are you trying to smile?

118
00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.939
- Are you doing it on purpose?
- He's done.

119
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.939
He hesitated for a while.

120
00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.910
No. He doesn't have the Master Key.

121
00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.410
- He doesn't have it.
- He doesn't.

122
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.910
This is what you have to do, okay?

123
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.149
- All right. Next is Chan Sung.
- Okay.

124
00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:50.649
We won't know if a person is
pretending or not.

125
00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:52.819
- Even if it's not the Master Key.
- Hong Gi, you know how to act.

126
00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.019
"Magic Kid, Masuri".

127
00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.889
Don't talk about it. You're mean.

128
00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.990
Gosh.

129
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.990
Hong Gi looks like a magician too.
I'm sure he will act well.

130
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.199
- I wasn't the magician.
- He acted for quite long.

131
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.730
Do I place it here?

132
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.329
Is this the Master Key?

133
00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:12.269
- Let's check his face.
- Yes.

134
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.740
- It's not saying anything.
- Just keep looking at it.

135
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.680
It's on.

136
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.610
It's on.

137
00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.019
(What?)

138
00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:26.389
He has the Master Key.

139
00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.759
- He looks so surprised.
- His ears are blushing.

140
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:30.860
His ears are.

141
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.360
- Look at his ears.
- His ears are red.

142
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.790
(His ears tuned red.)

143
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.889
Do you really have the Master Key?

144
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.529
It's just because I'm getting
so much attention all of a sudden.

145
00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.269
Did you see O or X on the screen?

146
00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:40.430
I don't know.

147
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.439
We just have to find one more player
with the Master Key then.

148
00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.800
(Chan Sung proved it
with his body language.)

149
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.069
We've found one already.

150
00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.339
- He looked quite surprised earlier.
- Why are you sweating?

151
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.939
- He definitely has the Master Key.
- All right. Next is Se Jeong.

152
00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:52.709
She's good at acting.

153
00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.350
Gosh. This is nerve-wracking.

154
00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.550
It's really hard to tell...

155
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.290
if the person
always has a smile on.

156
00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:04.720
Is this the Master Key?

157
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.199
We have to check her face.

158
00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.500
(She keeps her smile.)

159
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.829
- Did you check the answer?
- She is smiling.

160
00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:14.899
Yes.

161
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.870
You see, we won't know anything
if she keeps smiling like that.

162
00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:21.310
- No one knows it yet.
- We don't.

163
00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.110
All right. Hong Gi's turn.

164
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.480
Okay.

165
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.949
- Magic Kid, action.
- Stop it.

166
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.120
He's a senior actor.

167
00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.050
- He is.
- Is this the Master Key?

168
00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:35.259
Let's find out.

169
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.660
You can act as well.

170
00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:41.160
Hong Gi is thorough.

171
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.100
He will hide it well.

172
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.199
- His acting is good.
- Look at him smiling.

173
00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.970
(Twitching)

174
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.639
He looked weird.

175
00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.399
You looked funny.

176
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.370
His facial expression didn't
look natural.

177
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.040
It's written with small letters.

178
00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.180
Was something written on it?

179
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.180
(Letters?)

180
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.279
He has the Master Key then.

181
00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.850
- There are some letters.
- There are some letters.

182
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.550
We're asking him random questions.

183
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.149
Why are you smiling?

184
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:07.389
- What are you talking about?
- This is a fun game.

185
00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:08.959
- It is.
- Yes, it is.

186
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.589
I like it.

187
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.529
Chae Yeon might have the Master Key.

188
00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:14.990
She's bad at lying as well.

189
00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:19.100
Is this key the Master Key?

190
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.069
(Question of Fate,
"Is this key the Master Key?")

191
00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:25.040
(How will she react?)

192
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.410
(She just smiles brightly.)

193
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.610
- Gosh. This is hard.
- I wonder why she is smiling.

194
00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:36.250
- She doesn't know how to act.
- Exactly.

195
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.220
She didn't know what to do.

196
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.649
She would've stayed still
if there was an X.

197
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:40.850
She looks so surprised.

198
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.789
- "What do I do?"
- That's not it.

199
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.990
- She didn't know what to do.
- It took time to show on screen.

200
00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:46.690
She said it took some time to
show on screen.

201
00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:48.399
- Jong Min.
- Yes?

202
00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:50.129
Is that authentic leather?

203
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.200
Let's test it with a lighter.

204
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.470
"Let's test it with a lighter."

205
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.799
Why do you want to test it?

206
00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:58.240
(No. This is my favorite jacket.)

207
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.870
- "Let's test it with a lighter."
- I'm sure one of them has the key.

208
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.039
- I could smell the fake leather.
- I did as well.

209
00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.250
Is this key the Master Key?

210
00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.019
I can't tell
because of his small eyes.

211
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.220
I don't think he has the Master Key.

212
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.159
Is this key the Master Key?

213
00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.159
Hey.

214
00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.830
- Show us your face.
- I can only see his hair.

215
00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:25.169
He doesn't have it.

216
00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:26.830
He doesn't have it.

217
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.399
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

218
00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.840
That was so old-fashioned.

219
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.570
But he always acts the same
even when he gets O...

220
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.240
or X. We can't tell.

221
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.409
- Really?
- He's good at tricking people.

222
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.840
He's always like that.

223
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.480
Shall I check mine now?
I also have experience in acting.

224
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.580
Which one were you on?

225
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.149
- It's called "Lemon Candy".
- "Lemon Candy".

226
00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:46.250
I've seen it as well.

227
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:47.419
Tell us more about it

228
00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:50.220
(Legendary footage)

229
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.659
It's called bad acting.

230
00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:55.629
It was one of the worst.

231
00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:58.230
"When you have a lot on your mind,
have a lemon candy."

232
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.899
(When you have a lot on your mind,
have a lemon candy.)

233
00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:03.440
- His acting is better now.
- My goodness.

234
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.070
What are you saying?

235
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.570
Do you really think
his acting has gotten better?

236
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.039
- Let's see.
- I will check it now.

237
00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:09.409
(What will be his fate?)

238
00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:11.309
You have to answer
with the voice you just did.

239
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.250
Is this key the Master Key?

240
00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:17.649
I want to see it.

241
00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.220
He's checking it now.

242
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.059
Yes.

243
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.659
(He answers randomly.)

244
00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:28.159
(His acting skills never
let us down.)

245
00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.100
- That was my acting.
- "Is this key the Master Key?"

246
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.799
- He answered his question.
- "Yes."

247
00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:34.529
Are you saying your key is
the Master Key?

248
00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:36.740
- Next is Bobby.
- Is it my turn now?

249
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.139
I will check it now.

250
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.169
Please. I beg you.

251
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.580
- Okay. Show me.
- Come on.

252
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.639
Is this key the Master Key?

253
00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.450
Look at his eyes.

254
00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:51.750
Bobby and Shownu both have
small eyes.

255
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.960
(Laughing)

256
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.320
He checked it again.

257
00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.789
When someone checks it again...

258
00:10:58.789 --> 00:11:00.429
Check it again.

259
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.299
(He laughs again.)

260
00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:03.629
He was acting when he checked it
for the first time.

261
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:05.330
I don't know if he was acting when
he checked it for the second time.

262
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.070
I think he was really checking it
again to make sure.

263
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.799
- You're right.
- Henry, it's your turn.

264
00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.639
Is this key the Master Key?

265
00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:14.110
(Question of Fate,
Is this key the Master Key?)

266
00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:19.750
- He doesn't have it.
- He's not it.

267
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.379
- Oh my gosh.
- Whatever.

268
00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:23.950
- Wow.
- Yes, whatever.

269
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.990
Okay. Whatever.

270
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.950
(Judge for yourself.)

271
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.389
- Next is Eun Hyuk.
- Okay.

272
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:30.690
Henry is lying.

273
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.659
Eun Hyuk is so bad at lying.

274
00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.559
He can't control
his facial expression.

275
00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:35.629
This is similar to the mafia game.

276
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:42.269
What if he shows a serious face
after he checks the answer?

277
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.539
Is this key the Master Key?

278
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.509
He's bad at lying.

279
00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:50.340
- He saw something.
- Show us your face.

280
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.809
Because the viewers can also
guess together while they watch.

281
00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.679
- He's overreacting.
- His key is not the Master Key.

282
00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.889
- Gosh.
- He's so innocent.

283
00:11:59.889 --> 00:12:01.490
- I'm sure he doesn't have it.
- He's disappointed.

284
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.490
He's overreacting.

285
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.659
I did the same on the first episode.

286
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.899
(He can't stop laughing.)

287
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.830
(He looks like he's overreacting
somehow.)

288
00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.539
(What?)

289
00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:20.440
(Wait)

290
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.250
(Laughing)

291
00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.950
(He's acting strange.
Is his key really the Master Key?)

292
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.919
(He's surely acting strange.
Let's find out now.)

293
00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:38.429
No pressure. Check it comfortably.

294
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.090
We will wait and
check your reaction.

295
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.830
Is this key the Master Key?

296
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.830
(Is this key the Master Key?)

297
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.370
(He has the Master Key.)

298
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.240
(Gosh. I don't know what to do.)

299
00:12:58.809 --> 00:12:59.980
He doesn't have the Master Key.

300
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.049
(All the players were tricked
by his overreaction.)

301
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.919
- He did well.
- He's trying so hard.

302
00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:07.789
(He closes it
so that no one can see the result.)

303
00:13:07.789 --> 00:13:11.019
(He's feeling the weight
of Master Key.)

304
00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:15.960
(Stay calm.)

305
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.429
You did well.

306
00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:19.970
You were overreacting.

307
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.370
(Confusing)

308
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.840
I don't think he has the Master Key.

309
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.539
- This is hard.
- Stop lying.

310
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:30.309
(If I have one of the Master Keys,)

311
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:33.450
(I have to look for another
player with the Master Key.)

312
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.679
(Who had the strangest reaction?)

313
00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:41.919
(Who had the strangest reaction?)

314
00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:44.389
- You don't have the Master Key.
- Let's go.

315
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.490
Okay. This is going to be fun.

316
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.759
- Su Geun, you can't use them all.
- Gosh.

317
00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:50.330
(He observes Su Geun more carefully
than the other players.)

318
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.529
Is this key the Master Key?

319
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.840
Look at Su Geun's lips.

320
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.039
- Yes!
- Okay.

321
00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:01.840
His acting never gets better.

322
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.340
- He doesn't have it.
- Gosh.

323
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.649
- His acting is so bad.
- He doesn't have the Master Key.

324
00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.679
It shouldn't be like this.

325
00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:09.779
- I don't think he has one.
- Your acting is so bad.

326
00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:10.980
It's been a month already.

327
00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:16.190
Shall we guess
who has the Master keys?

328
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.759
- I think...
- I'm sure Bobby has one.

329
00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:19.090
Really?

330
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.129
He looked quite flustered.

331
00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:22.759
I think Chae Yeon and Bobby
have the Master Keys.

332
00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:24.029
- I think Bobby has the key.
- I think so too.

333
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.399
I think Bobby and Chan Sung
have the Master Keys.

334
00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:28.769
Chan Sung?
I think it's a good guess.

335
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.899
His ears were so red.

336
00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.240
They were.

337
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.009
- I think Eun Hyuk has one too.
- That's right.

338
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:35.940
- No way.
- Eun Hyuk?

339
00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:37.679
I think Hong Gi has one.

340
00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:38.750
Why?

341
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.710
He started throwing out the names
straight after Su Geun asked.

342
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.279
I can assure you that I have
the Master Key.

343
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.419
Did you see? As soon I said it,
the bell started ringing.

344
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.690
The bell agrees.

345
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.789
All right. Now, every player
has finished checking the keys.

346
00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:54.889
First, all the players must go to
the locker-room...

347
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:58.600
to get changed into
different outfits.

348
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.070
- Let's go.
- This is fun.

349
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.629
Do we leave this place?

350
00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.700
Here is the hat.

351
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.799
- Thank you.
- Move.

352
00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:05.870
- Henry.
- Yes?

353
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.909
You don't have the key.

354
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.440
You don't have the key, right?

355
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.450
I'm sure you don't have the key.
Hong Gi doesn't have it either.

356
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.610
I don't have it.

357
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.779
- Sung Jong doesn't have it.
- You don't have one either.

358
00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:17.879
I think he has one.

359
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.019
I have a slight feeling that
Chan Sung has the key.

360
00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:23.059
- That's possible.
- Where are the costumes?

361
00:15:23.059 --> 00:15:24.559
Why did you take so long?

362
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.289
Can't I hide the camera?
I'm a little embarrassed.

363
00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:29.700
Who do you think have
the Master Keys?

364
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.399
I definitely don't think
Henry has one.

365
00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:32.570
- No, he doesn't.
- No.

366
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.629
Let's find out.

367
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:35.840
I think Se Jeong has one.

368
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.840
Her facial expression changed.

369
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.539
- Her eyes look different.
- They do.

370
00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.240
- Gosh.
- I can tell.

371
00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:44.210
You did get surprised when
you saw O on the screen, right?

372
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.250
Gosh. No.

373
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.049
It might be Chae Yeon.
We never know.

374
00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:48.519
She's not saying anything.

375
00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:50.320
- Exactly.
- No.

376
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.690
I don't lie to people.

377
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.389
But...

378
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:55.220
- You're lying now.
- How long have you been on TV?

379
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.259
Yes. I'm not lying.

380
00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:58.059
- I will trust you.
- No. Don't trust me.

381
00:15:58.059 --> 00:15:59.330
I think Eun Hyuk has one.

382
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.659
- Eun Hyuk?
- Why?

383
00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:04.129
He looked very relaxed.

384
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.730
(Did Eun Hyuk look relaxed?)

385
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.129
It's because he has it.

386
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:08.840
I was just observing others.

387
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.240
I have to stay relaxed...

388
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.070
to calm you down a little.

389
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.539
(He's talking gibberish.)

390
00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.879
That's why I'm keeping myself calm.

391
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.809
It might be me though.

392
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.279
What is he saying?

393
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.049
You're irritated that
no one is giving you attention.

394
00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:28.690
- You want attention.
- No one cares about me.

395
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.990
Why isn't anyone suspicious of me?

396
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.690
Hong Gi is acting strange too.

397
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.789
No. It's not me.

398
00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:36.529
No, it's not Hong Gi.
I think Bobby has one.

399
00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:38.029
(Which player has
the other Master Key?)

400
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.610
Let's go.

401
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.909
Bruno Mars.

402
00:16:47.909 --> 00:16:48.980
(They enter the search-room.)

403
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.909
This is how heavy
the Master Key is.

404
00:16:51.909 --> 00:16:54.580
This is how heavy
the Master Key weighs.

405
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.779
- You're back is bending.
- No.

406
00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:59.590
- Stand in orders.
- Stand next to your team members.

407
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.720
Let's name our teams.

408
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.090
We just went with
Team Su Geun and Team Hyun Moo.

409
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.129
- It was like a sports day.
- It was.

410
00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:06.590
Shall we name our team
as Team Handsome?

411
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.460
- Good.
- It's a great idea.

412
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.200
It's a great idea.
We will go with Team Handsome.

413
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.099
You shouldn't compare our looks.

414
00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.269
Jong Min is ruining it.

415
00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:18.099
Bobby isn't good looking either.

416
00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.240
What are you talking about?

417
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.710
- Su Geun, that was a harsh comment.
- What are you talking about?

418
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.609
You're not handsome.
You just look unique.

419
00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.009
- He looks similar to me.
- That's right.

420
00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:26.579
Look. He admits it.

421
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.880
I don't think he does.

422
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.779
I like looking unique
than looking handsome.

423
00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:31.819
- Being unique is better.
- Of course.

424
00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:33.450
This can be childish.

425
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.059
Let's play a small game.
Se Jeong and Chae Yeon...

426
00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:38.160
Chae Yeon, who is your type?

427
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.490
- This is for fun.
- This is for fun.

428
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.589
Choose one person.

429
00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:43.630
Someone close to your type.

430
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.569
- She has someone on her mind.
- She's thinking hard.

431
00:17:45.569 --> 00:17:46.970
- There are two guys.
- Are there?

432
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.799
- Okay.
- Who are they?

433
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.269
I'm curious.

434
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.309
- Those two are out already.
- Right?

435
00:17:52.309 --> 00:17:54.240
Please look at us as well.

436
00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.240
She's not even looking at you.

437
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.710
This is unfair for Bobby.

438
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.849
- She might choose Bobby though.
- Are you okay?

439
00:18:00.849 --> 00:18:02.950
- It's okay.
- I'm okay.

440
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.390
- What do you think of Jong Min?
- And Bobby?

441
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.750
He's kind.

442
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.259
(She ends the conversation.)

443
00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:11.220
She drew the line.

444
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.529
- She doesn't like him.
- She's blocking him.

445
00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:14.529
She is.

446
00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:15.960
- She's blocking him.
- She is.

447
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.759
- She put a wall between them.
- She didn't even say he's cute.

448
00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.799
She just said I'm kind.

449
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.369
I'm not kind at all.

450
00:18:21.369 --> 00:18:23.170
Okay. Let's all...

451
00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:26.170
Every player should put away
their keys in their team's box.

452
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.940
Every key that you have
around your neck.

453
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.539
- It's over there.
- I see.

454
00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:31.809
Do we write our names on it?

455
00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:33.180
(Who holds the Master Key?)

456
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.180
(Key Guide)

457
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.079
It worked last week.

458
00:18:36.079 --> 00:18:37.549
If you look at the guide,

459
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:41.089
you will find the reasons
why you have to win the games.

460
00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:43.789
As you all know,
there is an individual game...

461
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.329
at the end.

462
00:18:45.329 --> 00:18:48.759
But first, you have to
support your team to win...

463
00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:51.000
- in order to receive the hints.
- Really?

464
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.529
Let's have a look.

465
00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:55.599
If you win a game, you'll get a
chance to win one of the Key Guides.

466
00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:57.099
We have to do well.

467
00:18:57.099 --> 00:18:59.039
"We can find out if the other team
has the Master Key."

468
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.640
We can find out if they have one.

469
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.450
"We can find out if the other team
has the Master Key."

470
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.650
Isn't this a really big hint?

471
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.680
No. No.

472
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.880
- It is.
- What about our members?

473
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.450
We might have two players
with the Master Keys.

474
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.019
"We give one of our keys,"

475
00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.319
"then we can check
one of their keys."

476
00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:17.089
- This one is great.
- I like this one.

477
00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:19.329
We might choose Chae Yeon's...

478
00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:20.759
- Or Chan Sung's.
- And...

479
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:22.500
- I'd like to check Hong Gi's.
- Hong Gi?

480
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.500
I think this is better,
but this isn't that good, is it?

481
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.769
- I agree.
- "Reading their minds with eyes."

482
00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:27.799
How could we figure them out?

483
00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:28.900
- This...
- They'll certainly figure you out.

484
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.970
(They can choose 1 player and
read his or her mind with eyes.)

485
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.539
- They actually might.
- Exactly.

486
00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:32.569
I won't be able to keep it together.

487
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.740
- This one is good too.
- All right.

488
00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:37.740
- Okay. Let's start.
- Let's get the first Key Guide.

489
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.380
This segment deeply hurt me.

490
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.049
- This is such a cruel segment.
- Well...

491
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:43.920
The player with the most
votes online...

492
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.349
by the Watchers will receive
the Gold Chance Card.

493
00:19:46.349 --> 00:19:48.859
They release the rankings from the
players with most and least votes.

494
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.089
- That's harsh.
- It'll give you an idea to survive.

495
00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:52.529
- What if I'm voted the least?
- You're the last.

496
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:56.160
- Hyun Moo was ranked last.
- He got the least number of votes.

497
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.299
What if he's ranked last again?

498
00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:58.400
- I have a confession...
- Again?

499
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.069
- to make.
- That'd hurt him a lot.

500
00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:01.170
(Hyun Moo makes a confession.)

501
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.869
I voted this week.

502
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.609
- Seriously?
- He's serious.

503
00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:08.609
- You didn't tell me I couldn't.
- Did you really vote?

504
00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:10.140
I participated
in the voting process.

505
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.279
- Okay.
- I logged in to the website.

506
00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:13.480
I haven't used my username
for the SBS website in ages.

507
00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:16.950
- Okay then.
- Please reveal the player...

508
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.589
- Watchers supported the most.
- I hope he or she is from our team.

509
00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:21.720
- The player must be from our team.
- He or she must be in our team.

510
00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:24.289
- In the world...
- It could be Chae Yeon.

511
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.630
- Chan Sung is pretty popular.
- I wish it's a player of our team.

512
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.890
- All right. Here we go!
- I think it might be.

513
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.630
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

514
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.829
- Show us!
- Who is it?

515
00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:33.130
(Eun Hyuk)

516
00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:34.970
(Eun Hyuk gets the most votes.)

517
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.039
Really?

518
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.700
Is this true?

519
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.569
- Is this real?
- The soldiers have come together.

520
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.809
This is amazing.

521
00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.710
(He salutes to the Watchers
who supported him.)

522
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.650
- Thank you.
- Eun Hyuk takes the first place.

523
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.920
All right. Please tell us the player
with the least votes.

524
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.849
- We're going at it right away.
- Among 12 players,

525
00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:54.049
- this player was the least popular.
- Hey, don't say that.

526
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:56.390
- The least popular player is...
- It's Jong Min.

527
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.990
(Which player will have the honor
of taking the last place?)

528
00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.559
(Jun Hyun Moo)

529
00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:05.170
It's Jong Min.

530
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.430
(Jun Hyun Moo is ranked 12th.)

531
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.630
- Goodness.
- It's you again, Hyun Moo.

532
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.670
Hey, let's get rid of this segment.

533
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.700
- Oh, my.
- Get away from me.

534
00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.869
- Are you okay?
- I mean...

535
00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:16.410
- Please don't get the wrong idea.
- Hey, this isn't everything.

536
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.210
I'm ranked last even
with the vote I cast for myself?

537
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.549
- Hey.
- Get back to your spot.

538
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:21.480
Don't be disheartened.
Popularity comes and goes.

539
00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:25.720
- I wish it'd come even for a bit.
- It never comes to him.

540
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.420
- All right. Eun Hyuk.
- Yes.

541
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.890
- You may pick 1 of the 2 envelopes.
- Thank you.

542
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.529
- I'm so envious.
- Thank you.

543
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.400
- The wrong one will enlist you.
- How do I...

544
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.329
I see. Just like this?
I should read it like this?

545
00:21:39.329 --> 00:21:40.470
You should read it by yourself.

546
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.240
(The winner can pick 1 of 2 Gold
Chance Cards and use it whenever.)

547
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.869
I don't think he knows
which one is helpful yet.

548
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.380
You cannot tell us what it is.

549
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.579
(It's a strong Chance Card that
can turn the table around.)

550
00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:53.650
I've never seen someone taking
that long to understand a card.

551
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:57.480
(As he's holding the Master Key,
things have gotten better for him.)

552
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.059
(Eun Hyuk, the owner of the Master
Key, won the Gold Chance Card.)

553
00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:09.029
(What will his move be to figure out
the other owner of the Master Key?)

554
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.269
- Tell us the first game.
- MVP. Let's go.

555
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:14.670
- It's Group Pictionary.
- Group Pictionary.

556
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:15.670
- I see.
- Pictionary.

557
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.069
This is very simple.

558
00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:19.309
Five of us will draw
a picture together...

559
00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:22.380
and the remaining player will
have to guess what it is,

560
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.009
but the five of us will draw
with specially-made pens.

561
00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:27.680
- The pens have strings on them.
- Right.

562
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.880
- So all of us must draw together.
- We have to draw together.

563
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.990
- Like as a group?
- Goodness.

564
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.089
You guys are mean.

565
00:22:34.289 --> 00:22:37.490
It's a success when the team
guesses 3 questions in 100 seconds.

566
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.490
Let's do it until we get it right.

567
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.730
It's very straightforward. Everyone
is going to be logical, right?

568
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.730
- Hyun Moo, I'm good at guessing.
- No, no. You can't.

569
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.400
- Hyun Moo. No, no.
- You can't be the one guessing.

570
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.329
- No way.
- That's all right.

571
00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:47.470
- I'm really good at it.
- You cannot be good at it.

572
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.140
- You always say nonsense.
- I am very imaginative.

573
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.970
- Oh, my goodness.
- I bet he'll say something weird.

574
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:52.970
Hold on.

575
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.210
- Henry, you can't.
- No, I can.

576
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:56.740
You tend to say weird things.

577
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.240
- I'm really good.
- But the thing is...

578
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.950
I don't think he'll be good
at drawing the picture as a group.

579
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.079
- He won't be good at that.
- He won't be.

580
00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:05.049
It might be better
if he guesses the pictures.

581
00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:06.289
Hey, look.

582
00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:08.789
- Let me help you guys out.
- Okay.

583
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:12.829
It's only fair Eun Hyuk, the most
liked player, guesses the pictures.

584
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.099
- He ought to guess the pictures.
- I recommend Eun Hyuk.

585
00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:17.160
Don't you agree?
Our team would've chosen him.

586
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.769
- Do you want to? Are you good?
- Should we go with Eun Hyuk?

587
00:23:18.769 --> 00:23:20.529
- Well, I'll give it a try.
- All right. It's Eun Hyuk.

588
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.869
- How funny.
- Let's go.

589
00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:24.740
He convinced us.

590
00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.039
(Team Hyun Moo got persuaded
by the opposing team.)

591
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.779
- Okay.
- I'll try to guess the pictures.

592
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.509
- The penalty...
- Wait. What is happening?

593
00:23:31.509 --> 00:23:32.579
What's going on?

594
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.349
- You didn't tell me this. Hold on.
- What is it?

595
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.150
- Hey, Henry.
- That's why I said I'd do it.

596
00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:43.960
- That's whipping cream.
- Gosh, this...

597
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.359
Eun Hyuk. He can't hear us.

598
00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:47.430
(He has the earphones on.)

599
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.000
- I'm worried they won't approve.
- Hey,

600
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.059
- draw a circle. Start.
- It comes from the top.

601
00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:52.630
(This is the podium
for the player who will answer.)

602
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.299
Hey, let's just draw like this.

603
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.640
- Draw it clockwise.
- We are a team. Let's continue.

604
00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.839
Let's keep turning.

605
00:23:58.839 --> 00:24:00.640
(Their level of confidence goes up.)

606
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.910
- Hold on.
- Whatever it is, draw clockwise.

607
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.210
- Okay.
- Ready? Start!

608
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.279
(1st round starts!)

609
00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:08.180
(He must answer 3 questions
in 100 seconds to succeed.)

610
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:11.319
(The teamwork of 5 players
is the key.)

611
00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:12.490
- Get ready.
- Okay.

612
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.019
- Let's win.
- Don't bump into each other.

613
00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:15.660
We are a team.

614
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.789
- This is too easy.
- No, this is hard.

615
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.559
- All right.
- Draw the head from that side.

616
00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.829
(Crocodile)

617
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.569
(No way.)

618
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:30.839
(5 players must draw a crocodile
Eun Hyuk can recognize together.)

619
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.039
- All right.
- Draw the head from that side.

620
00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:36.509
(Let's calm down.)

621
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.480
- Draw the head from that side.
- Good luck.

622
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.579
- Hold on.
- The head.

623
00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:42.319
- Draw the head over there.
- There's nothing to think about.

624
00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:44.319
- Hurry, hurry.
- Hey.

625
00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:45.549
- Push it to my side.
- Wait.

626
00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:47.390
(Struggling)

627
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.259
- Draw the head over there.
- There's nothing to think about.

628
00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:51.220
- A bit more.
- Hurry, hurry.

629
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.359
- Push it to my side.
- Wait. How about zig-zagging?

630
00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:54.529
Let's not argue.

631
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:55.930
- Sung Jong, don't hold that part.
- Hold on a minute.

632
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.329
- Let's be confident and draw it!
- Let's draw it.

633
00:24:58.329 --> 00:24:59.500
You can't hold it like that.

634
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.299
- Just draw something.
- Let's do it!

635
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.000
You can only use one hand.

636
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.900
- Let's do it!
- The mouth.

637
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.039
(The mouth of the crocodile!)

638
00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:08.539
The teeth!
We must draw zig-zag lines.

639
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.980
- Zig-zag lines? How do we draw it?
- Let's...

640
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.849
- draw the head.
- Hey, we must draw the head first.

641
00:25:12.849 --> 00:25:14.579
- The head.
- This is crazy. Wait.

642
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.519
- From there...
- I am not doing anything!

643
00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:17.650
Henry.

644
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.250
Just draw something!

645
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.160
- I don't get what you're saying.
- Draw the head first.

646
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.960
(What's worse is Henry is
in the state of anomie.)

647
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.259
- Just draw the head.
- Right now...

648
00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:29.329
- Wait.
- Not that direction.

649
00:25:29.329 --> 00:25:30.430
Henry, Henry.

650
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.069
Henry, you should draw
the mouth from...

651
00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:35.240
- Why are you lashing out on me?
- No, I am not.

652
00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:37.769
Hold on a second. The leg.

653
00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:38.940
- Hyun Moo.
- Yes?

654
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.210
What's "crocodile" in English?

655
00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:42.839
(What?)

656
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.009
(He's shocked.)

657
00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.309
- Crocodile.
- Crocodile?

658
00:25:45.309 --> 00:25:46.349
Hey, you.

659
00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:47.710
He didn't know.

660
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.119
Hey, please draw the mouth.

661
00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:51.220
What are you doing?

662
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.490
- We should...
- You can only use one hand.

663
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.490
- There we go.
- We did it!

664
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.059
- You can only use one hand.
- There we go.

665
00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:58.319
- We did it.
- Hyun Moo.

666
00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:00.089
- Hyun Moo, use only one hand.
- It's working.

667
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.500
Hey, hold on. Wait!

668
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.529
What is that?

669
00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:05.069
- That's it.
- This is good.

670
00:26:05.069 --> 00:26:06.769
- Henry.
- We're drawing it.

671
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:08.740
- That's it.
- This is good. Henry.

672
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.240
- We're drawing it!
- Hey.

673
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.009
- Let's draw the body.
- Okay. I'll draw the body.

674
00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:14.009
How is this quality "good"?

675
00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:15.680
- Move it to Sung Jong's side.
- Heart.

676
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680
Draw a straight line.

677
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.109
- Move it back. Move it back.
- Over there?

678
00:26:19.109 --> 00:26:21.009
- Move it to Sung Jong's side.
- Heart.

679
00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:22.019
Draw a straight line.

680
00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:23.279
- Heart?
- Okay.

681
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.650
- Heart.
- That's it.

682
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.890
That's good. Nice.

683
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:27.890
Great.

684
00:26:28.589 --> 00:26:30.019
- Wait.
- Okay, okay.

685
00:26:30.019 --> 00:26:31.829
(However, they seem content
with their artwork.)

686
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.130
Great.

687
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.660
- What is that?
- Excellent.

688
00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.400
What is that?

689
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.029
(Their 100 seconds will
be over soon.)

690
00:26:40.529 --> 00:26:41.940
- What is that?
- Henry.

691
00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:45.109
- What's that? Banana!
- Draw a crocodile.

692
00:26:45.869 --> 00:26:47.240
- Banana!
- Okay.

693
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.880
(The time is up, and he's slapped
with whipped cream.)

694
00:26:52.509 --> 00:26:54.480
- Eun Hyuk.
- Poor Eun Hyuk!

695
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.779
- Can't you guess what this is?
- Hey.

696
00:26:55.779 --> 00:26:57.680
- What?
- I can't recognize you now.

697
00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.650
- Oh, no!
- I can't recognize Eun Hyuk now.

698
00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.819
(A man with whipped cream shows up.)

699
00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:01.920
What will you do now?

700
00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:04.119
- Eun Hyuk.
- I feel so bad for him.

701
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.759
I don't think I can do that. No.

702
00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:07.029
- That's unbelievable.
- That's all right.

703
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:08.700
Eun Hyuk, how could you not
figure out what it is?

704
00:27:08.829 --> 00:27:11.160
- Wait.
- How could you not recognize it?

705
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.730
- What on earth is that?
- The silver...

706
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.329
Hey, everyone can guess
this is a crocodile.

707
00:27:14.329 --> 00:27:16.339
- It's a crocodile.
- How can this be a crocodile?

708
00:27:16.339 --> 00:27:17.539
(It's even more surreal
than Picasso's painting.)

709
00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:20.369
- Hey, this is a mouth.
- These are the eyes.

710
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.440
- These are the eyes. Look closely.
- What is this?

711
00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:25.349
- I can't figure that out at all.
- Besides,

712
00:27:25.349 --> 00:27:27.250
Henry was problematic too.

713
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.480
How could you ask what "crocodile"
was in English towards the end?

714
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.519
(He didn't even know
what he was drawing.)

715
00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:32.490
Goodness. He should've
asked earlier.

716
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.750
Are you okay?

717
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.420
- That must be tasty.
- It's cold.

718
00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:38.589
- Isn't that tasty?
- No one can succeed at this.

719
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.160
Answering 3 questions
in 100 seconds is too much.

720
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.630
Hyun Moo, after we saw Team
Dummy getting the penalty...

721
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.369
- What? Team Dummy?
- I'm sorry.

722
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.240
- I'm pretty angry now.
- No one wants to take that role.

723
00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:52.309
We're going to have our own game
to save ourselves from the penalty.

724
00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:53.440
If you're chosen, you must go.

725
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.710
The arrow has to point to us.

726
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.380
- I'll spin it.
- Start.

727
00:27:57.839 --> 00:28:00.079
(Which player will get
to go to the podium?)

728
00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:01.650
Why... Why are you spinning it?

729
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.480
- Why... Why are you spinning it?
- It's a game.

730
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.049
(Hong Gi is chosen.)

731
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:07.720
- It's you, Hong Gi.
- Come on.

732
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.890
- It's Hong Gi.
- Is it you?

733
00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.119
Raise your hands if you think
it points to Hong Gi.

734
00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:11.859
- It's Hong Gi.
- Didn't I tell you?

735
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.390
- Everyone raised their hands.
- It's you.

736
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.430
All right. Let's go.

737
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.630
(They present a united front.)

738
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.700
You can go that way.

739
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.200
- Unbelievable.
- Hong Gi, don't you believe in us?

740
00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:22.539
I can't trust you though.

741
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.210
- Stay there.
- I think there's so much this time.

742
00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:26.839
You're starting now.

743
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.940
- You can practice.
- Let's draw a circle.

744
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.109
- I will pull the string tight.
- That's it.

745
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:33.079
What is that? Let me pull it tight.

746
00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:35.019
- We can make sure the pen stands.
- Right. I will...

747
00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:36.819
You can apply force, okay?

748
00:28:36.819 --> 00:28:40.319
- Just like this.
- Do a triangle. The triangle.

749
00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:41.720
- Get ready.
- This isn't easy.

750
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.519
- Get ready.
- Get set.

751
00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:44.589
- And...
- Lower it.

752
00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:46.289
(Answer 3 questions in 100 seconds.)

753
00:28:47.089 --> 00:28:50.059
(What will Team Su Geun draw
in the 2nd round?)

754
00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:52.130
- Start.
- Gosh, I can't hear a thing.

755
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.500
- Let's do it. Lower it.
- Let's go.

756
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.069
(He instructs his players right away
without getting flustered.)

757
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.240
To go that way, you need to pull.

758
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.309
- Pull it.
- You should just draw the head.

759
00:29:04.339 --> 00:29:06.809
(When one player pushes the pen,)

760
00:29:06.809 --> 00:29:08.349
(the other player pulls it.)

761
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.049
- Then I'll pull next.
- No, no.

762
00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:12.849
I'll pull it. Hold on. Wait.
Go to that side.

763
00:29:12.849 --> 00:29:14.390
That's the spot. Put the pen on it.
That's it.

764
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.390
Let the pen touch the paper.
That's what I'm talking about.

765
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.019
That's it. It's drawing.

766
00:29:18.019 --> 00:29:19.759
There we go.
Send the pen to the bottom.

767
00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.730
We have to get the pen down.
Straight down.

768
00:29:21.829 --> 00:29:23.630
- It has to come to my side.
- But what are we drawing?

769
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.029
We're drawing the leg.

770
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.099
(You should've asked it earlier.)

771
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:28.869
What are we drawing?
I don't know what it is.

772
00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:30.740
- We must draw a dinosaur.
- I know that, but...

773
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.539
- We'll draw the leg. The leg...
- Lift it.

774
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.339
- Draw the line to this side.
- Right. Lift it.

775
00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:38.079
- Let's draw it on this side once.
- What are we going to draw?

776
00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:40.380
- Let's draw a dinosaur.
- What type of a dinosaur?

777
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.049
- Just any dinosaur.
- What is this?

778
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:43.779
- Get the pen up.
- We should finish the leg.

779
00:29:43.849 --> 00:29:45.950
- Let's draw a Tyrannosaurus.
- Let's move it up.

780
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.690
- Hey, let's draw a Tyrannosaurus.
- I said we have to move it down.

781
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:49.990
Hey, don't lift it.
Don't put any force.

782
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.329
- The Tyrannosaurus... Where...
- I told you not to press force!

783
00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.930
(He makes a furious remark.)

784
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.430
Don't put force,
so the pen touches the paper!

785
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.559
- Which way should the pen go?
- So the line can go that way!

786
00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.769
- Which way should the pen go?
- So the line can go that way!

787
00:29:59.769 --> 00:30:00.829
(He's cheating.)

788
00:30:00.829 --> 00:30:02.599
(Come on.)

789
00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.900
- You cheated.
- What was that?

790
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:06.609
We weren't drawing a Tyrannosaurus?

791
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.140
- What did you say?
- Tyrannosaurus.

792
00:30:09.339 --> 00:30:10.910
- You two should draw it.
- Tyrannosaurus.

793
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.650
- Their legs are long.
- This is scary.

794
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.049
Shouldn't the viewers
answer this question?

795
00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:17.880
- Tree!
- Dinosaur.

796
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.650
- That's right. It's a tree.
- I can draw the leg.

797
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.420
- This is so small.
- Finger!

798
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.460
- What did you say?
- Finger!

799
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.759
- He said it's a finger.
- Finger?

800
00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:28.259
(The time is up.)

801
00:30:29.829 --> 00:30:32.299
(His face is covered
with whipped cream.)

802
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400
The game...

803
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.670
(Don't eat whipped cream.
Let your skin enjoy its benefits.)

804
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.039
Look at this. We have to put our
hands on the paper. Watch this.

805
00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:45.150
Our hands must be on the paper.
Just like this.

806
00:30:45.349 --> 00:30:47.779
This is what I meant, but you guys
kept your hands in the air.

807
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.180
- Our hands must be in contact.
- You get it now, don't you?

808
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.289
- We shouldn't let them know more.
- Wait.

809
00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:54.690
- Get away from us.
- You got it, right?

810
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.720
- We can't do that. Use just a hand.
- Everyone.

811
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.289
- Everyone.
- Pay attention to him.

812
00:30:58.289 --> 00:30:59.960
- Hong Gi.
- Hey, Su Geun.

813
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.329
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Pay Hong Gi attention.

814
00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:04.660
- Hong Gi.
- That's all right. I'm okay.

815
00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:06.029
(Even up close...)

816
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:07.569
- This game...
- Hong Gi, wait.

817
00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:09.140
- That's a dinosaur.
- What do you think this is?

818
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.299
- The answer is a dinosaur?
- That was...

819
00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:12.940
- Which part of it is the head?
- Goodness.

820
00:31:13.109 --> 00:31:15.380
- No one could've guessed that.
- We're up next.

821
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.410
Okay, okay. I think
we'll do a good job.

822
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.950
I have a good feeling.

823
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.980
- Eun Hyuk is over there already.
- You're the best, Eun Hyuk.

824
00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:23.220
- We should win.
- I have a good feeling about this.

825
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.980
- Let's go for it.
- We can do it.

826
00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.119
That way is the down.

827
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.150
- It's about food this time.
- Get ready.

828
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.460
It's food.

829
00:31:30.619 --> 00:31:32.690
- What is that?
- All right. Sweet!

830
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.160
- Hey.
- That's great.

831
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.430
- First, let's draw the bread.
- Move the pen up.

832
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.599
- Move it up.
- Move it up. Here it comes.

833
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.230
- Goodness. Going up.
- Moving up.

834
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.500
- Let's do it again.
- Don't use two hands.

835
00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:46.240
- To the left. To the left.
- We can use two hands now.

836
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.940
- We can use two hands now.
- Moving to the left.

837
00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.509
Okay.

838
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.380
- Let's draw the stick.
- Moving to the left.

839
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.049
Okay.

840
00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:55.119
- It's time for the stick.
- We're going down now.

841
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.549
- It's the stick.
- We're moving down now.

842
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:59.150
- The sausage...
- Let's do a bit more.

843
00:31:59.589 --> 00:32:01.119
(He's frustrated.)

844
00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.819
- Why are you happy? That's nothing.
- The sausage...

845
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.920
(Could it be...)

846
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.130
Is that a corn dog?

847
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.529
Is that a corn dog?

848
00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:11.230
- Let's do another one.
- I got it right?

849
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:14.029
(Even he's surprised
that he's right.)

850
00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:16.369
- No way. That's a corn dog?
- Hey, stop it right there.

851
00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:18.839
- That's amazing.
- Next!

852
00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:20.339
- Let's go.
- Next.

853
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.809
Flip the page already.

854
00:32:22.339 --> 00:32:23.740
(They get busier.)

855
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.380
- Wait. First...
- Let's go with this.

856
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.410
- We should draw the top.
- Hey, this...

857
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.980
- It's the steam.
- Make this into a cone.

858
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.180
- This is the corn.
- No, draw a circle there.

859
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.289
- Let's make a cone here.
- Move it down.

860
00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:36.119
Up.

861
00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:38.089
-They're good.
- There you go.

862
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.430
- Let's do a zig-zag line.
- Wait. This part...

863
00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.029
- This should be...
- That's it.

864
00:32:41.089 --> 00:32:43.099
- Gosh, that looks tasty.
- What is that?

865
00:32:43.099 --> 00:32:45.369
- Do the zig-zag line.
- Let's draw a circle.

866
00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:47.369
- Make a horn there.
- Is that a car?

867
00:32:48.329 --> 00:32:49.940
- What's that?
- What is that?

868
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.140
- What's that?
- What is that?

869
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.910
- What is that?
- No, on this side...

870
00:32:56.009 --> 00:32:57.710
- Don't try to overachieve.
- No, no.

871
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:59.809
- What is that?
- Why are you drawing a cherry?

872
00:33:00.109 --> 00:33:02.019
- Hey, stay focused.
- Cherry?

873
00:33:02.349 --> 00:33:05.049
Hey, this kid is so weird.
I won't do this.

874
00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.089
- I...
- He's trying too hard.

875
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.119
- They hit a rough patch.
- They're fighting.

876
00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:11.289
- They're arguing.
- Stop drawing.

877
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:13.130
- What are you doing?
- I can handle this.

878
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.890
- I'll do this quickly.
- Draw a triangle.

879
00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:17.930
- Draw. Just draw something.
- Seriously?

880
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.130
At least draw something.
Draw the figure.

881
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:22.500
- Hey, let's draw poop here.
- Draw poop.

882
00:33:22.599 --> 00:33:23.940
- Poop?
- Yes.

883
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.009
- We can't draw poop there.
- Draw circles.

884
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.009
- Circles? He's weird.
- Just draw something.

885
00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:30.210
No, just go with it.

886
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.480
- How can we explain it?
- Stop talking, and just draw.

887
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.609
- How can we explain it?
- Stop talking, and just draw.

888
00:33:34.609 --> 00:33:36.819
(He's desperate as he experienced
the whipping cream slap.)

889
00:33:36.819 --> 00:33:37.880
Draw!

890
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.920
(The time is up.)

891
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.690
Hey, what's wrong with you?

892
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.660
(The answer is ice cream.)

893
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.490
- Hey.
- How could this...

894
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.259
The answer was ice cream,
and this guy was drawing a cherry.

895
00:33:49.329 --> 00:33:52.200
- I was going to draw circles.
- He wanted to draw poop.

896
00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:54.970
- But it was too hard.
- Why were you only talking?

897
00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.970
- Sung Jong, what were you thinking?
- This is what I wanted to draw.

898
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.970
- With the circle here...
- Why is there a circle there?

899
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.480
And this part looks like this.

900
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.680
- On top of it, I can draw a cherry.
- How can five of us draw that?

901
00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:08.420
- How can five of us draw that?
- From the start...

902
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.250
- Wait.
- How can we draw a cherry?

903
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.450
- From the start, we should've...
- Goodness.

904
00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:14.849
- All of you are bad at drawing.
- The cherry would be here.

905
00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.519
- Hold on.
- How can five of us draw a cherry?

906
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.429
- We could've done that.
- Who eats...

907
00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.159
- ice cream like that?
- Everyone.

908
00:34:21.289 --> 00:34:23.599
You guys can come back
to this later. Let us play our game.

909
00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:26.000
- Move aside.
- Forget about that cherry.

910
00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:27.829
Why were you drawing a cherry there?

911
00:34:28.269 --> 00:34:30.239
- He tried to draw a cherry.
- How could we draw that on there?

912
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.210
- Everyone was weird.
- Hey.

913
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.809
Hong Gi, just say anything.
Say whatever you can think of.

914
00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:38.179
Let's get it.

915
00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.610
- Come on.
- The circle...

916
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.980
- How can we draw a circle?
- Put your hands on the paper.

917
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.250
- Are you ready?
- Say whatever you think of.

918
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.559
(Can he answer 3 questions
in 100 seconds successfully?)

919
00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:50.889
Are you ready?

920
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.289
- Let's go!
- Put it on the paper. It's easy.

921
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:55.300
- It's an easy one, right?
- Okay.

922
00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.500
- Where...
- Draw the lips.

923
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.329
- Draw the oval.
- Draw the tail.

924
00:35:00.469 --> 00:35:02.170
(They move in unison
under Su Geun's order.)

925
00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.469
Okay.

926
00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:05.969
- Draw the tail.
- Okay.

927
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.880
- Eyes.
- Shaver!

928
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.909
(Shaver is incorrect.)

929
00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.809
(Hong Gi is literally
saying anything.)

930
00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:14.980
That looks interesting.

931
00:35:15.719 --> 00:35:17.219
Squid! Octopus!

932
00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:19.150
- Come on.
- Octopus? That was a good answer.

933
00:35:19.289 --> 00:35:21.650
Draw the tail and the fin.

934
00:35:22.159 --> 00:35:24.260
- Kimchi!
- Gosh, that was terrible.

935
00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.860
- How can this look like kimchi?
- Draw the scales.

936
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.059
- Clam!
- The scales.

937
00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:30.230
- Clam.
- Wait, no. Let's draw the mouth.

938
00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:31.829
- The mouth.
- Fish.

939
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.199
- Draw the mouth.
- Fish.

940
00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:34.900
(That was close.)

941
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.900
- Don't look at him. Draw the mouth.
- Boat.

942
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.369
- Spicy fish stew.
- The mouth. Let's draw the mouth.

943
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.139
Fish-shaped bun!

944
00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:44.110
- Fish-shaped bun.
- Goodness.

945
00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:45.610
Next.

946
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.510
- Dumpling.
- Let's draw it vertically.

947
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.679
- Do it vertically.
- Draw a circle right here.

948
00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:51.320
- That's too easy.
- Draw a circle first.

949
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.820
- Draw a circle just like this.
- That's too easy.

950
00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:55.190
- Draw a circle first.
- No,

951
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.760
- draw a rhombus first.
- Hey, this is too easy.

952
00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.489
We're good at drawing.

953
00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:01.730
- That's it. Draw lines here.
- We should add the steam.

954
00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:04.199
- Make it look steamy.
- Clam!

955
00:36:04.199 --> 00:36:06.829
- Add in the steams.
- Why does he like clams so much?

956
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.670
- Clam!
- Why do you say that so often?

957
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.940
- This team is weird too.
- Hey.

958
00:36:12.469 --> 00:36:14.809
- This, this...
- Why do you say that so often?

959
00:36:14.809 --> 00:36:16.409
- Hey, look at this.
- Dumpling!

960
00:36:16.809 --> 00:36:17.940
Dumpling!

961
00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:22.820
- Flip the page quickly.
- Hey.

962
00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.389
- Where?
- Do it vertically.

963
00:36:25.389 --> 00:36:27.119
- Draw a circle with a stick.
- Draw the stick.

964
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:29.019
- The stick.
- Draw the stick.

965
00:36:29.019 --> 00:36:31.190
- To the bottom.
- Where?

966
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.159
- Draw it here on the bottom.
- Draw the stick over there.

967
00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:34.159
Draw it down.

968
00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:36.829
- To the bottom. Right here.
- Draw it to that side.

969
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.599
- Draw the line to that side.
- Add in a circle.

970
00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:40.969
- Draw a circle.
- Draw the twister.

971
00:36:40.969 --> 00:36:42.639
- Don't forget the twister.
- The twister.

972
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.739
- Hey, this is...
- Squid? Fishcake?

973
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.780
Hey, draw it one more.
Draw a circle around it.

974
00:36:49.139 --> 00:36:51.239
No, draw another circle around that.

975
00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:52.510
(What is the answer?)

976
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.750
Hey, you don't know this one?

977
00:36:54.409 --> 00:36:55.619
Why can't you figure this out?

978
00:36:56.719 --> 00:36:59.550
(Hong Gi can't seem to have a clue.)

979
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.690
- Let's draw another one.
- What is that?

980
00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:05.190
- No, draw another circle.
- It's a pumpkin taffy.

981
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.929
- It's a pumpkin taffy.
- You really can't figure it out?

982
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.599
- How could he know that?
- Why not?

983
00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:11.969
- Let's draw a better stick.
- Make the stick look better.

984
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.829
- Rice cake. It's a songpyeon.
- This doesn't look like rice cake.

985
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:15.369
- Make the stick look better.
- Rice cake.

986
00:37:15.769 --> 00:37:17.139
- Rice. That's good.
- This doesn't look like rice cake.

987
00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:19.170
- It's a songpyeon.
- We can't draw it again.

988
00:37:19.269 --> 00:37:22.210
(Will this game present
an element of surprise?)

989
00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.280
(Hong Gi, please get this.)

990
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:28.619
(I don't know the answer.)

991
00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:32.219
- Hey, we drew it so well.
- We did a good job.

992
00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:33.320
(That was close.)

993
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.190
We did such a good job. Hong Gi,
it's candy. You punk!

994
00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:38.789
- Hong Gi.
- But the thing is...

995
00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.630
(He screams out
as he's disappointed.)

996
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.059
- Hong Gi, you could've gotten it.
- But the thing is...

997
00:37:43.059 --> 00:37:45.429
when I thought of candy,
I didn't think of a lollipop.

998
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.829
- I thought of hard candy.
- Hong Gi, you did well.

999
00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.269
It was candy, but you did well.

1000
00:37:49.369 --> 00:37:51.340
Hong Gi, we were so close.

1001
00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:54.570
Hey, let's play rock-paper-scissors.
The loser should take his spot.

1002
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.409
- Okay.
- I can take his spot.

1003
00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:59.010
This time, Hong Gi should lead us
to draw. It's been one-sided.

1004
00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:01.010
It's not fair for just
one person to get the penalty.

1005
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.320
- I can do it. I'd like to try.
- Really?

1006
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.880
- Bobby? Congratulations.
- Yes.

1007
00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:07.289
- I wanted to try this.
- All right.

1008
00:38:07.289 --> 00:38:08.820
- He volunteered, and we can't stop.
- Right.

1009
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.190
- Wear your hat tightly.
- Thank you.

1010
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.690
- We can't beat people who enjoy it.
- Bobby, are you ready?

1011
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.929
- That's right.
- Bobby.

1012
00:38:13.929 --> 00:38:16.000
- This time...
- Just shout out any answer.

1013
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.699
- Just say everything.
- Planes are included too.

1014
00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:21.469
- That's right.
- Just say whatever you know.

1015
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:22.539
- That's right.
- Planes are...

1016
00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:24.800
(Looking determined)

1017
00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.510
- There are cars too.
- Just say whatever you know.

1018
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.440
(Wake up, you are
the connecting link.)

1019
00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.809
- Start.
- Lower it.

1020
00:38:32.949 --> 00:38:35.349
Here we go.
Let's draw a straight line first.

1021
00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:37.420
- The trident will go here.
- The trident.

1022
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.349
- Draw the line here.
- Let's draw it at the bottom.

1023
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:42.760
- Let's do this first.
- The trident goes here.

1024
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.820
- Two.
- Trident.

1025
00:38:44.619 --> 00:38:45.789
The middle, and we're good.

1026
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.260
- Trident.
- Hammer.

1027
00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.260
- All right.
- Fork.

1028
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:51.900
Hurry!

1029
00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:53.599
- Hurry. What are you doing?
- Flip it.

1030
00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:54.670
He's so slow.

1031
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.570
- Draw the circle.
- Two circles.

1032
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.570
- A circle.
- One.

1033
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.809
- To the right.
- Where?

1034
00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:03.010
- 2 circles.
- 2.

1035
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.579
- Draw the chain.
- A straight line.

1036
00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:08.420
- Draw the handle on the top. There.
- Where?

1037
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.219
- Wait, this isn't it.
- The handle.

1038
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.119
- We can go this way.
- Make it straight. Straight.

1039
00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:15.619
The saddle.

1040
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.320
- The saddle.
- The saddle.

1041
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.530
- This is the saddle.
- Bicycle.

1042
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.789
- This is the saddle.
- Bicycle.

1043
00:39:19.789 --> 00:39:20.860
Motorcycle.

1044
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.300
- Next.
- Okay.

1045
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.440
(They all cheer
at the last question.)

1046
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.809
- Flying.
- Flying. Okay.

1047
00:39:31.809 --> 00:39:33.440
- Tail at the bottom.
- Okay.

1048
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.739
Tail at the bottom.

1049
00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.340
(It looks like we'll win.)

1050
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.809
- Tail at the bottom.
- Okay.

1051
00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:39.210
- Tail at the bottom.
- A rock.

1052
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.880
- Draw more.
- A bomb.

1053
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.550
- Tail at the bottom.
- Draw more.

1054
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.579
- Tail at the bottom.
- Pull.

1055
00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:46.389
- In S shape.
- S shape.

1056
00:39:46.389 --> 00:39:47.449
- S.
- Flying.

1057
00:39:47.449 --> 00:39:48.960
In S shape.

1058
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.989
Draw it here too.

1059
00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:51.519
No. There's no time for that.

1060
00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:53.730
Draw S shape after this.

1061
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.030
- S.
- Go S.

1062
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.300
- What is it?
- A candy.

1063
00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.170
(A connection between
a circle and a S shape?)

1064
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.440
- There's no time.
- Draw this,

1065
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.809
- and go S.
- S.

1066
00:40:06.809 --> 00:40:09.480
- A balloon.
- Go S.

1067
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.610
- A balloon.
- Great.

1068
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.610
(Team Su Geun wins
Group Pictionary.)

1069
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.820
- It was so easy.
- We won.

1070
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.949
(They refuse to believe it.)

1071
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.719
(Team Su Geun has a good start.)

1072
00:40:19.719 --> 00:40:21.760
- Bobby.
- It was too easy.

1073
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.590
Great.

1074
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:25.730
We're one.

1075
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.960
(A festival for Team Su Geun)

1076
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.960
It's fine. Cheer up.

1077
00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.130
- We touched gimbap.
- Do you want to switch?

1078
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.670
(Is this why I got myself
covered in whipped cream?)

1079
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:35.400
They've earned gimbap.

1080
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.400
(Team Su Geun earned a Key Guide.)

1081
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.739
Pick one from the Key Guide.

1082
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.610
- What would you like?
- Can we discuss it?

1083
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.139
Sure.

1084
00:40:44.139 --> 00:40:47.110
We can check the suspicious person.

1085
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.550
I'm not suspicious of anyone yet.

1086
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.949
(Eun Hyuk's worried about
what Team Su Geun will pick.)

1087
00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:53.550
Personally, I'd choose this one.

1088
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.960
- We have to reveal ours.
- You know mine.

1089
00:40:56.389 --> 00:40:58.190
I'll reveal mine.

1090
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.789
- Hey.
- Go away.

1091
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.800
(Why is Hong Gi acting
suspicious?)

1092
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.329
What is this?

1093
00:41:06.329 --> 00:41:07.369
You didn't fall for it.

1094
00:41:07.369 --> 00:41:09.500
- Let's go with this.
- This?

1095
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.500
This one? Okay.

1096
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.239
We have one suspect.

1097
00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:13.809
- Who was it?
- Me?

1098
00:41:13.809 --> 00:41:15.409
- Me?
- It's Eun Hyuk.

1099
00:41:15.409 --> 00:41:16.480
- Pardon?
- Are you okay, Eun Hyuk?

1100
00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:23.550
We'll use the chance to see
whether the other team has...

1101
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.420
the Master Key or not.

1102
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.320
- We need to observe him.
- Look at his face.

1103
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.989
Let's scream as soon as we see it.

1104
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.760
Chae Yeon agrees as well.

1105
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.789
Here we go.

1106
00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:38.670
- You should turn around.
- Show us your face.

1107
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.800
Turn around.

1108
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.800
- Turn around.
- What are you doing?

1109
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.599
- I'm sorry.
- Think about the show.

1110
00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:45.110
Turn around. We want to see you.

1111
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.110
What for?

1112
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.739
- We want to see you.
- We need to see your face.

1113
00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:49.440
Fine. Here.

1114
00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.380
We want to see your expression.

1115
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.949
- Fine. You saw it.
- Now.

1116
00:41:52.949 --> 00:41:54.579
- Let's do it, Chae Yeon.
- Yes.

1117
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.519
Does the other team have
the Master Key?

1118
00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.019
(The Judgement Cabinet will tell if
the other team has the Master Key.)

1119
00:42:03.019 --> 00:42:04.789
- I can't see anything.
- It'll appear.

1120
00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:05.960
I can't see it.

1121
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.329
Let's turn around when it appears.

1122
00:42:07.329 --> 00:42:09.230
(Team Hyun Moo carefully
watches them.)

1123
00:42:09.429 --> 00:42:11.530
- Where?
- It'll appear soon.

1124
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.369
(Someone in Team Hyun Moo
has the Master Key.)

1125
00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:20.070
(Play the music!)

1126
00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.280
They must've gotten X.

1127
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.210
They might be acting.

1128
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.610
- They might be acting.
- I think he's right.

1129
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.980
They might be acting.

1130
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.280
It must be X.

1131
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:32.289
- Look at you.
- I think...

1132
00:42:32.289 --> 00:42:34.449
We didn't expect this.

1133
00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:36.190
By looking at your faces,

1134
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.320
"Your faces?"

1135
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.289
By looking at your faces,
the person's in your team.

1136
00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:42.300
After you saw it,

1137
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.860
- you didn't know how to fake it.
- Is it yes or no?

1138
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.800
Just tell me whether it's yes or no.

1139
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.699
- I think it's no.
- It's no.

1140
00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:49.500
- No.
- I think it's no.

1141
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.769
You were right. They were acting.

1142
00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:52.909
He's hiding.

1143
00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:54.739
He doesn't know what to do.

1144
00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:56.340
- He's acting.
- I can tell.

1145
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.309
- They're in panic.
- Goodness.

1146
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:59.710
You're bad actors.

1147
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.650
They don't know what to do.

1148
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.719
They are flustered.

1149
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.090
- Oh, my.
- Is there really one?

1150
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.730
- The second round.
- If we win this,

1151
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.900
- we'll win.
- We'll win for sure.

1152
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.969
Let's win this time.

1153
00:43:19.969 --> 00:43:22.199
I'm going to set a record.

1154
00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:25.039
How much I can lose.

1155
00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:27.309
Does he lose his job as a host?

1156
00:43:27.369 --> 00:43:28.409
I'll try my best.

1157
00:43:28.409 --> 00:43:30.539
- We must win this time.
- We can win.

1158
00:43:30.539 --> 00:43:31.579
The second game.

1159
00:43:31.579 --> 00:43:33.650
Find the bucket with flower petals.

1160
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.780
("Find the bucket
with flower petals")

1161
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.780
If you look in the back,

1162
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.849
- there are 15 buckets.
- Okay.

1163
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.119
You win when you find a bucket
with flower petals.

1164
00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:45.989
There's only one bucket
with flower petals among 15.

1165
00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:47.690
You must win
the 1-on-1 game first...

1166
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:48.960
to choose a bucket.

1167
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.130
If you go first,
you might get a penalty first,

1168
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.670
but you also get more chance to
find the flower petals.

1169
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.139
This ends when you find
the flower petals.

1170
00:43:57.139 --> 00:43:59.570
Then let's play the 1-on-1 game.

1171
00:44:00.039 --> 00:44:01.909
Oh, it's that game.

1172
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.349
I'm pretty confident.

1173
00:44:06.409 --> 00:44:08.820
Pass the tube without using hands.

1174
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.420
The person who passes the tube
on the floor first...

1175
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.820
- without using hands.
- Oh, it's on the floor.

1176
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.590
You must go through the tube
without using your hands.

1177
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:17.719
It's easy.

1178
00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:19.829
- You must be athletic.
- Right.

1179
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:22.699
- You need to be flexible.
- I think a woman should do it.

1180
00:44:22.699 --> 00:44:25.670
Shownu can't do it because of
his wide shoulders.

1181
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:26.969
His shoulders will get stuck,
and my belly will get stuck.

1182
00:44:26.969 --> 00:44:28.030
I think he wants to try it.

1183
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.599
Maybe Se Jeong or Sung Jong.

1184
00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:30.599
- Should I try it?
- Sure.

1185
00:44:30.599 --> 00:44:31.840
- I think you can pull it up now.
- Should I try it?

1186
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.739
We choose Se Jeong.

1187
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:35.539
(Who will be Se Jeong's opponent?)

1188
00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:37.639
We don't have any other choice.

1189
00:44:37.639 --> 00:44:39.179
We choose Bobby.

1190
00:44:39.179 --> 00:44:40.550
Hold on.

1191
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.179
We have no choice.

1192
00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.820
- Bobby's up to compete Se Jeong.
- We'll win.

1193
00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.219
Show me how you're going to do it,
Bobby.

1194
00:44:46.219 --> 00:44:47.619
Show me. Go.

1195
00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:51.119
- Like this.
- Done.

1196
00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:52.230
- Like this.
- Done.

1197
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.690
(It was brilliant for nothing.)

1198
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.559
I thought he was a tuna.

1199
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.929
He was flapping.

1200
00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:00.599
- Show me.
- Show how it's done.

1201
00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:01.769
(Show me what you got, Se Jeong.)

1202
00:45:02.139 --> 00:45:03.469
(Isn't this...)

1203
00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:05.670
(how you go through the tube?)

1204
00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:09.079
(It looks like Se Jeong will win.)

1205
00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:10.239
By looking at the simulation,

1206
00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:12.050
- we were faster.
- He was only flapping.

1207
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:13.480
Be serious, Bobby.

1208
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.679
- Sure.
- Good luck, Se Jeong.

1209
00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:16.519
- Are you ready?
- Good luck.

1210
00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:18.119
- Get ready.
- What am I going to do?

1211
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:19.420
Set.

1212
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.019
Look at Bobby.

1213
00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.860
(Hold it up using a foot.)

1214
00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.059
Go, Bobby. Yes.

1215
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:26.230
Go, Bobby.

1216
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.260
(On the other hand,
Se Jeong won the practice game.)

1217
00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:31.730
(But she failed to hold it up
using her knee.)

1218
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.369
(She rushes.)

1219
00:45:34.769 --> 00:45:36.400
(He's skilled.)

1220
00:45:37.039 --> 00:45:38.139
Go, Bobby. Yes.

1221
00:45:38.139 --> 00:45:39.969
(Bobby the tuna...)

1222
00:45:39.969 --> 00:45:41.679
(is on a roll.)

1223
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.309
Go, Bobby.

1224
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.510
- Bobby.
- Bobby.

1225
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.219
- Bobby.
- I'm sorry.

1226
00:45:49.219 --> 00:45:51.250
- Don't worry about it.
- Bobby.

1227
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.019
(It's Bobby time.)

1228
00:45:53.019 --> 00:45:54.849
Are you a man, Bobby?

1229
00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:55.860
Let's throw this out.

1230
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.590
Are you a man or a woman?

1231
00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:58.929
- I won.
- Are you really a man?

1232
00:45:58.929 --> 00:46:00.590
- I just won.
- You're not a man.

1233
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.829
- Hey, wait.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1234
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:04.800
She's crying. It's fine.

1235
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.369
I know you're my team,
but what was that?

1236
00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:09.869
Then now...

1237
00:46:10.039 --> 00:46:11.840
- choose a number, Bobby.
- We should pick a number.

1238
00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.610
- Pick a number.
- Which number would you like?

1239
00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.380
- Look at the ground.
- Which number?

1240
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.210
(It's one-fifteenth chance.)

1241
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.110
(Among 15 buckets,)

1242
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:24.619
(there's only one bucket
with flower petals.)

1243
00:46:25.389 --> 00:46:27.090
There's a petal on number two.

1244
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.489
- Look at the ground.
- My goodness.

1245
00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:30.320
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

1246
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.829
What are you doing there?

1247
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.360
12.

1248
00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.929
- I think it's number five.
- Go with your sense, Bobby.

1249
00:46:35.929 --> 00:46:37.659
- Trust your senses.
- I choose number three.

1250
00:46:37.659 --> 00:46:39.170
Why do you like number three?

1251
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.570
I always liked three.

1252
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.000
- Okay.
- It doesn't mean anything?

1253
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.769
- No.
- It could end at once.

1254
00:46:43.769 --> 00:46:45.440
- Go for number three.
- You can only choose once.

1255
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.469
It could end at once.

1256
00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:48.110
- I'm confident.
- Sure.

1257
00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.239
Trust your senses.

1258
00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:50.880
Sure. I'll pull now.

1259
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.480
- 1, 2, 3.
- Bobby.

1260
00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.480
(Is it flower petals or a penalty?)

1261
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.190
(Come on,)

1262
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.889
(flower petals.)

1263
00:47:03.889 --> 00:47:05.559
(Water pours.)

1264
00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:08.860
(Congratulations.)

1265
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.429
(It's water.)

1266
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.570
(It's more fun because
they're only watching.)

1267
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.369
(Bobby the Tuna met real water.)

1268
00:47:16.199 --> 00:47:17.969
You look hot.

1269
00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:20.409
(His manly beauty explodes.)

1270
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.579
(It's Bobby time.)

1271
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:28.380
- Bobby.
- Bobby.

1272
00:47:30.519 --> 00:47:32.050
- It was good.
- I'm happy.

1273
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.219
(Bobby failed.)

1274
00:47:33.449 --> 00:47:34.949
It's not always good to win.

1275
00:47:34.949 --> 00:47:37.119
- You get a chance.
- We still picked one.

1276
00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:39.489
We can just watch them getting wet.

1277
00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:41.059
- We can lose.
- Right.

1278
00:47:41.059 --> 00:47:42.329
I think it's better to lose.

1279
00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:43.730
- Okay.
- Try your best.

1280
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.969
- It's our strategy.
- Their strategy is to lose.

1281
00:47:45.969 --> 00:47:48.230
We'll win the last round.

1282
00:47:48.369 --> 00:47:50.469
- We'll win at the crucial moment.
- Reveal the next one.

1283
00:47:50.469 --> 00:47:51.769
We have a choice.

1284
00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:53.409
- What is this?
- What is it?

1285
00:47:53.409 --> 00:47:55.409
Hold one hand,
and take the tail off.

1286
00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:58.179
Hold hands with your opponent,

1287
00:47:58.179 --> 00:48:00.980
and when you pull the towel
on his waist first, you win.

1288
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.079
("Hold one hand,
and take the tail off")

1289
00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:03.880
- You need to be strong.
- Strong?

1290
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.019
Strong Shownu.

1291
00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:06.619
We choose strong Shownu.

1292
00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:09.760
Strong Shownu.

1293
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.460
- Come on.
- Chan Sung should compete.

1294
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.559
- We trust you, Chan Sung.
- Strong Shownu.

1295
00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:14.760
There's no one else.

1296
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.130
- Chan Sung.
- Fine.

1297
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.530
Everyone, come here.

1298
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:20.300
- Am I playing again?
- Of course.

1299
00:48:20.769 --> 00:48:23.599
- They won't know.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1300
00:48:24.139 --> 00:48:25.670
Okay.

1301
00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.840
(The two weakest people lost.)

1302
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.179
Let's make it nice and clean.
Do you want to do it or me?

1303
00:48:31.179 --> 00:48:33.050
You do it to make it nice and clean.

1304
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:34.579
- I can't win Shownu.
- I can never do it either.

1305
00:48:34.579 --> 00:48:35.880
You do it, Su Geun.

1306
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.320
Rock-paper-scissors.

1307
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.650
I never lose rock-paper-scissors.

1308
00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.360
- What's happening?
- I'm scared.

1309
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.489
Jong Min's pretty strong.

1310
00:48:44.489 --> 00:48:46.389
- Jong Min's pretty sexy.
- This is intimidating.

1311
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.869
(He's full of power.)

1312
00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:56.239
(His body is perfect for games.)

1313
00:48:56.239 --> 00:48:58.510
(Shownu with a perfect body.)

1314
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.070
(Let's do this, Jong Min.)

1315
00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.039
(Should I resign?)

1316
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.179
Look at his body.

1317
00:49:06.949 --> 00:49:08.420
Strong Shownu.

1318
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.250
Hold left hands together.

1319
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.250
My goodness.

1320
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:13.250
- He's so strong.
- Strong Shownu.

1321
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.550
Hey, Shownu.

1322
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:16.320
Do you want to hold your left hand
or right hand?

1323
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.489
It doesn't matter.

1324
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.159
I...

1325
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.460
He's so considerate.

1326
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:22.760
He used to wrestle.

1327
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:24.400
- Really?
- Let's go.

1328
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.269
Get ready.

1329
00:49:26.269 --> 00:49:27.829
It hasn't started yet.
Don't waste your energy.

1330
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:29.199
I'm only grabbing his hand.

1331
00:49:29.369 --> 00:49:30.969
Move aside.
You never know where I'll fly to.

1332
00:49:31.039 --> 00:49:32.110
- Okay.
- Good.

1333
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:33.170
- Get ready.
- Ready.

1334
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.210
I'm going to do it for real.

1335
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.679
I have a feeling it will end fast.

1336
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:37.139
If you let go of the hand,
you have to do it again.

1337
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:38.710
Set...

1338
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:40.179
(I can't...)

1339
00:49:40.179 --> 00:49:41.650
(just lose.)

1340
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:42.650
Jong Min.

1341
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.650
- Jong Min.
- Jong Min.

1342
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.980
What?

1343
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.619
(Jong Min's counterattack?)

1344
00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.719
- Be careful.
- His pride is hurt.

1345
00:49:48.989 --> 00:49:51.119
Good luck. Come on.

1346
00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.130
(Get nervous, Shownu.)

1347
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:55.329
(Competition is on.)

1348
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.960
Oh, my goodness.

1349
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.599
You lost so fast.

1350
00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:01.070
It ended so fast.

1351
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:02.739
(As soon as it began,)

1352
00:50:02.739 --> 00:50:04.099
(it was over.)

1353
00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:05.539
See?

1354
00:50:05.539 --> 00:50:07.469
(Like a flash of lightning)

1355
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.949
(Shownu wins as everyone expected.)

1356
00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:13.309
- I can't believe it.
- You're awesome.

1357
00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.909
(No unexpected twist...)

1358
00:50:14.909 --> 00:50:16.750
(is his charm.)

1359
00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.349
- Did you get that filmed?
- They did.

1360
00:50:18.489 --> 00:50:20.449
Why would you worry about that?

1361
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.260
- All the cameras are on.
- He's in 30s.

1362
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.320
It ended so fast.

1363
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.960
(There are 14 buckets left.)

1364
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.460
I'll choose number seven.

1365
00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.059
- 7.
- Why 7?

1366
00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:30.329
Since there are seven members
in my group.

1367
00:50:30.329 --> 00:50:32.329
(He chooses the number of members
in his group.)

1368
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:33.969
Move to number seven.

1369
00:50:33.969 --> 00:50:35.039
(Shownu's lucky number 7)

1370
00:50:35.039 --> 00:50:37.539
- Pull it when you're ready.
- Be confident.

1371
00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:38.739
Your makeup looks great today.

1372
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.409
Say it loud, Shownu.

1373
00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:42.010
1, 2, 3.

1374
00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:45.610
(Flower petals please!)

1375
00:50:47.079 --> 00:50:48.579
(One-fourteenth chance)

1376
00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:50.750
(Flower petals or penalty?)

1377
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:51.989
(Water pours.)

1378
00:50:52.719 --> 00:50:54.289
(Shownu fails.)

1379
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.719
(They feel bad.)

1380
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.219
(He also feels bad.)

1381
00:50:58.219 --> 00:50:59.860
Do it one more time.

1382
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:02.099
- He's sexy.
- You're so sexy.

1383
00:51:02.099 --> 00:51:04.199
(Water pours over
his wide shoulders.)

1384
00:51:04.199 --> 00:51:06.329
(He's taking a photo shoot.)

1385
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.070
Start dancing.

1386
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.070
(Crump is so easy for him.)

1387
00:51:14.369 --> 00:51:16.409
Look at his chest muscles.

1388
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.579
Look at his abs.

1389
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.480
- He aimed for it.
- It worked out nice for him.

1390
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:25.750
(Hong Gi had
a water bucket penalty.)

1391
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:26.980
Everyone's getting wet today.

1392
00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:27.980
This is how it's done.

1393
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.449
I think we should continue to lose.

1394
00:51:30.449 --> 00:51:32.489
- Right. That's our strategy.
- Yes.

1395
00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:34.659
- Without getting wet.
- Yes.

1396
00:51:34.659 --> 00:51:37.230
We'll find it if we keep trying.

1397
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.300
Make it neat.

1398
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.260
- Chae Yeon will pick this time.
- Sure.

1399
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.070
Shall we pick the players first?

1400
00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:44.329
- I'll try this time.
- Sung Jong.

1401
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:46.000
Sung Jong likes to be in the center.

1402
00:51:46.199 --> 00:51:47.969
- Let me try.
- What is it?

1403
00:51:48.239 --> 00:51:50.010
- Race Bingo?
- Race Bingo?

1404
00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:51.909
- Race?
- You're fast.

1405
00:51:51.909 --> 00:51:52.909
You think so?

1406
00:51:53.079 --> 00:51:56.050
Run from the start line,
and put the towel.

1407
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.320
(Run from the start line,
and put the towel in the Bingo map.)

1408
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.750
Whoever makes a bingo first wins.

1409
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:04.760
(They must pass the halfway point,
and make the bingo first to win.)

1410
00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.219
Do you feel confident?
Did you understand the rule?

1411
00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:08.760
- Yes. I understood it.
- Okay.

1412
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.460
Just make a bingo anywhere?

1413
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.530
Yes.

1414
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.000
(We prepared pride for you.)

1415
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.030
Who wants to play?

1416
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.230
Do you want to try Chan Sung?

1417
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:18.400
(They chose Chan Sung because
he looks the fastest.)

1418
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.739
- Let's try it, Chan Sung.
- Can he do it?

1419
00:52:20.739 --> 00:52:21.869
(He looks innocent.)

1420
00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:22.940
My leg hurts.

1421
00:52:23.769 --> 00:52:25.440
It's because you haven't been
outside for a long time.

1422
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.780
It's been a long time.

1423
00:52:27.239 --> 00:52:29.710
Right. It's been a while
since you had fresh air.

1424
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:30.780
I know.

1425
00:52:30.849 --> 00:52:32.820
Chan Sung's known for endurance.

1426
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.750
Sung Jong's known for being quick.

1427
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.349
- Sung Jong's quick.
- He's an original hot guy.

1428
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:38.920
I'm getting nervous.

1429
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.630
- Get ready.
- This is intense.

1430
00:52:44.059 --> 00:52:46.429
- That's it.
- Good job.

1431
00:52:49.929 --> 00:52:52.900
(They both aren't passing
the halfway point.)

1432
00:52:54.199 --> 00:52:55.409
(It doesn't count if they don't
pass the halfway point.)

1433
00:52:55.409 --> 00:52:57.539
- They have to pass it.
- What happens now then?

1434
00:52:57.539 --> 00:52:59.039
- They have to pass it.
- Let's start over.

1435
00:52:59.039 --> 00:53:01.849
- That was a practice.
- They need to pass it,

1436
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:03.449
- but they didn't.
- Let's start over.

1437
00:53:03.449 --> 00:53:05.849
- Okay. You must pass it.
- It was a practice.

1438
00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:08.219
Don't just come and go.
You must pass it.

1439
00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:10.019
- Good job.
- Let's start over.

1440
00:53:10.719 --> 00:53:11.760
We must pass it, right?

1441
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.489
Pass it, and touch yours only.
You can't touch the other person's.

1442
00:53:14.489 --> 00:53:16.260
Even if it's in the same plate,
you can't touch it.

1443
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.059
You must place three first
to move the other person's.

1444
00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:21.300
- Okay.
- You must pass the halfway point.

1445
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.030
- Come on.
- Get ready.

1446
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.099
(The game starts over.)

1447
00:53:25.099 --> 00:53:26.239
I love this team.

1448
00:53:27.769 --> 00:53:28.840
(It's neck and neck.)

1449
00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.440
Sung Jong's pretty fast.

1450
00:53:30.869 --> 00:53:32.079
(The crucial halfway point)

1451
00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:33.280
- Hit his leg.
- What?

1452
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.280
(Sung Jong cheats again.)

1453
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.550
You need to pass it.

1454
00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:40.179
(Why don't you pass
the halfway point?)

1455
00:53:40.179 --> 00:53:41.489
You need to pass it.

1456
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.960
(He doesn't care.)

1457
00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.159
(He said he'll try his best.)

1458
00:53:48.159 --> 00:53:52.929
(He said he understood the rule.)

1459
00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:54.059
- What's this?
- Grab his leg.

1460
00:53:54.059 --> 00:53:55.699
(He forgot to pass
the halfway point.)

1461
00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.039
(Whatever. I'm going to cheat.)

1462
00:53:59.039 --> 00:54:01.469
That's it. Great!
Don't give him a break.

1463
00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:02.909
Don't give him a break.

1464
00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:04.070
(He's hanging.)

1465
00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.179
Grab his butt.

1466
00:54:05.179 --> 00:54:07.239
It's too late now.

1467
00:54:07.239 --> 00:54:08.849
He's so strong.

1468
00:54:08.849 --> 00:54:10.380
(This race won't count again
because of Sung Jong.)

1469
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.019
- You can't win.
- Don't lose.

1470
00:54:13.119 --> 00:54:14.550
- It's obvious that you'll lose.
- Hurry up.

1471
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.050
Sung Jong's so funny.

1472
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.360
He's young.

1473
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.820
(I got you.)

1474
00:54:20.989 --> 00:54:22.989
(Step on me...)

1475
00:54:22.989 --> 00:54:25.559
(if you want to pass.)

1476
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:31.400
(Angry...)

1477
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.500
(takedown)

1478
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.500
(Unexpected wrestling)

1479
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.170
You're not a comedian.

1480
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:37.909
Put one more and move it.

1481
00:54:37.909 --> 00:54:39.739
- Pass the point and move it.
- What are you doing?

1482
00:54:39.739 --> 00:54:41.650
- Come back, and move it.
- Pass it!

1483
00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.909
(Even after the takedown,
he still skips the halfway point.)

1484
00:54:42.909 --> 00:54:44.380
(He's so consistent.)

1485
00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.719
- Pass, then move it.
- Did you pass it?

1486
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.449
- Go pass it.
- Do I have to?

1487
00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:49.449
- Did you pass it?
- You're driving me crazy.

1488
00:54:49.449 --> 00:54:50.650
Pass it. Hurry up.

1489
00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.090
I think we won.

1490
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:54.019
Sung Jong...

1491
00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:56.530
not only played dirty, but he also
didn't understand the game.

1492
00:54:57.289 --> 00:54:59.699
It's been a while since he's out.
Please understand him. Sorry.

1493
00:54:59.699 --> 00:55:02.429
Did you see Chan Sung's face
when he stopped him?

1494
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:05.840
He was looking at him like
"What's wrong with him?"

1495
00:55:06.099 --> 00:55:07.170
(This game is tiring.)

1496
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.769
He already doesn't like him.

1497
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.510
I wasn't sure
what he was trying to do.

1498
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:14.079
Give me one more chance.

1499
00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:15.610
What about Chan Sung?

1500
00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:17.750
- Why does Chan Sung have to do it?
- Please.

1501
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.820
(Come on.)

1502
00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:20.650
I'm sorry, but no.

1503
00:55:21.019 --> 00:55:23.150
Why did you run into him
when you're so weak?

1504
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:24.150
You're out of breath.

1505
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.090
- Your face is so pale.
- I'm fine.

1506
00:55:26.559 --> 00:55:27.690
I have to win.

1507
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:28.829
- Will you be okay?
- I have to win.

1508
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:30.360
I think I'll win.

1509
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.460
- Please don't cheat again.
- I think I'll win.

1510
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.829
- It's fine.
- Sung Jong's funny.

1511
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:36.429
You must pass this halfway point
when you come back.

1512
00:55:36.429 --> 00:55:37.469
(Please don't cheat this time.)

1513
00:55:37.469 --> 00:55:38.769
- Here we go.
- Get ready.

1514
00:55:39.699 --> 00:55:40.800
- You must pass it.
- Hurry.

1515
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:44.469
- Put it down, and pass it.
- Pass it.

1516
00:55:44.469 --> 00:55:46.010
- Yes. That's it.
- Yes. Pass it.

1517
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:48.409
- Yes. That's it.
- Yes. Pass it.

1518
00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:50.909
(They both pass the halfway point.)

1519
00:55:50.909 --> 00:55:52.650
- Good job.
- Good job, Sung Jong.

1520
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.579
- Good job. You're doing great.
- Good.

1521
00:55:54.579 --> 00:55:56.550
(Chan Sung was able to stop him.)

1522
00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:58.460
(They must place their last towel
to move the other person's. towel.)

1523
00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.960
- I must move this.
- No.

1524
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.030
- No.
- Hey.

1525
00:56:02.289 --> 00:56:03.659
- I must move this.
- No.

1526
00:56:03.659 --> 00:56:07.329
(Move aside, black towel.)

1527
00:56:07.329 --> 00:56:09.030
- Hey.
- Hey. Don't do it.

1528
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.800
Hey, stop it.

1529
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:12.969
- Hold on.
- Why don't you understand the game?

1530
00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.099
What did he just do?

1531
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.969
Go rest for a second.

1532
00:56:15.969 --> 00:56:19.179
Chan Sung's dying.

1533
00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:21.409
Hey.

1534
00:56:21.409 --> 00:56:23.510
Relax.

1535
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:25.449
I thought that fell off.

1536
00:56:25.619 --> 00:56:26.980
How many times...

1537
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.889
do I need to explain the rules?

1538
00:56:28.889 --> 00:56:31.190
- Drink some water, Chan Sung.
- Because of you!

1539
00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.489
Then I'll admit it. You won.

1540
00:56:34.489 --> 00:56:36.489
Even if you don't admit it, he won.

1541
00:56:37.059 --> 00:56:39.400
(I'll admit it for you.)

1542
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.099
- Even if you don't, he won.
- Why would you admit it?

1543
00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:43.469
It's over.

1544
00:56:43.469 --> 00:56:45.440
Hey, go get an IV.

1545
00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.500
(This is hilarious.)

1546
00:56:47.269 --> 00:56:49.409
- Chan Sung wins.
- Chan Sung wins.

1547
00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:50.639
(Chan Sung wins
as Sung Jong cheats.)

1548
00:56:50.639 --> 00:56:53.179
How can he not understand the game
three times?

1549
00:56:53.179 --> 00:56:54.380
We can't help him.

1550
00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:55.610
I think I read it wrong.

1551
00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:56.750
Read what wrong?

1552
00:56:56.949 --> 00:56:59.079
Stop stumbling and move aside.

1553
00:57:00.019 --> 00:57:02.019
- Stop stumbling.
- This is so funny.

1554
00:57:02.019 --> 00:57:03.420
Let's finish it, Chan Sung.

1555
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.559
- Try number 8.
- I'd say 2.

1556
00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:06.989
It's 2 for 2PM.

1557
00:57:06.989 --> 00:57:09.329
- 2 for 2PM.
- Go with the number of the members.

1558
00:57:09.329 --> 00:57:11.230
- Can you stay quiet?
- Okay.

1559
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.329
(I'm little sensitive right now.)

1560
00:57:12.329 --> 00:57:14.429
- Hey. He's not in a good mood.
- I'm sorry, Chan Sung.

1561
00:57:14.429 --> 00:57:16.829
He had to do it three times for you.

1562
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:18.469
He doesn't look happy even though
he won.

1563
00:57:18.639 --> 00:57:20.369
- I think Chan Sung's mad.
- I'm sorry.

1564
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.809
- You should be happy.
- What number?

1565
00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:23.809
- Be happy.
- What number?

1566
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:25.280
- What number?
- Walk on the flower bed.

1567
00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.639
- What number?
- Number two.

1568
00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.010
2 for 2PM?

1569
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.780
He's already getting ready.

1570
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.250
(The game was hard,
but I'll pick flower petals.)

1571
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:33.050
- 1, 2, 3.
- Pull it hard.

1572
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.449
(Did Chan Sung pick
the flower petals?)

1573
00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:39.760
- 1, 2, 3.
- Pull it hard.

1574
00:57:40.019 --> 00:57:41.090
(Water pours.)

1575
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:44.590
(We got you cold water...)

1576
00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:46.559
(because you looked pretty tired
from running.)

1577
00:57:46.699 --> 00:57:48.699
It's going as what we planned.

1578
00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:49.800
(I'm sorry. It's my fault.)

1579
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.969
- He's hot.
- Are you okay?

1580
00:57:51.969 --> 00:57:53.039
Will you stay away?

1581
00:57:55.139 --> 00:57:57.269
(Will you stay away from me?)

1582
00:57:57.539 --> 00:57:59.380
(He accepts it.)

1583
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.579
It's fine.

1584
00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:03.110
This is a mind game.

1585
00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.750
- Okay.
- Just follow me.

1586
00:58:06.179 --> 00:58:07.949
- You look hot.
- He's hot.

1587
00:58:08.289 --> 00:58:09.320
(There are 11 buckets left.)

1588
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.989
He didn't get the nickname
for no reason.

1589
00:58:10.989 --> 00:58:12.559
- He's like a beast.
- He's a beast.

1590
00:58:12.719 --> 00:58:14.389
- Sung Jong.
- Yes?

1591
00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:16.489
Pick a game for Chan Sung.

1592
00:58:16.489 --> 00:58:17.559
Okay.

1593
00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:20.500
- "Key Flicking"
- "Key Flicking"

1594
00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:21.670
- "Key Flicking".
- It's "Key Flicking".

1595
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.769
You have to flick the key
on the edge of a table...

1596
00:58:25.099 --> 00:58:27.769
and make it land inside a cup.
The person who gets three in wins.

1597
00:58:28.239 --> 00:58:29.610
I can do that well.

1598
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.639
Isn't it this?

1599
00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.380
- I'm confident to do this well.
- Hong Gi is confident.

1600
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.909
- You should do it then.
- Go, Hong Gi.

1601
00:58:35.909 --> 00:58:36.980
Hong Gi will do it.

1602
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:38.750
Who's playing from your team?

1603
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.719
- Me.
- Henry will play for us.

1604
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:41.949
- Henry.
- Let's go.

1605
00:58:41.949 --> 00:58:43.219
(The best friends will
compete against each other.)

1606
00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.349
They're friends, aren't they?

1607
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:46.190
Why don't you
add another penalty to it?

1608
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.630
The person who loses
will get a flick in the forehead.

1609
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:49.760
- You're friends.
- Come on.

1610
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.099
- You should do it.
- Let's do it.

1611
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:53.300
Of course you should.

1612
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.269
- Okay.
- I am good at this.

1613
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.199
Okay. Let's go.

1614
00:58:57.369 --> 00:58:58.869
It's just like playing
an instrument.

1615
00:58:58.869 --> 00:58:59.869
Ready.

1616
00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.840
(The person who loses
will get double penalties.)

1617
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.869
Ready.

1618
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.380
(As soon as the game begins,
Henry starts to mess it up.)

1619
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.550
Hey.

1620
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:09.880
- He's terrible.
- He's done for.

1621
00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.679
- Keep trying.
- Wait.

1622
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.980
(Hong Gi succeeds
to put a key in a cup.)

1623
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.449
What? What?

1624
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.289
(He did it again.)

1625
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:20.420
- Henry loses completely.
- Wait.

1626
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:21.760
Wait.

1627
00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.230
(You can't do that.)

1628
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:24.860
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on.

1629
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:27.329
- Henry is really terrible at it.
- Concentrate.

1630
00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.329
- Concentrate.
- Hey.

1631
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:31.170
- Don't say anything.
- Flick the bottom.

1632
00:59:31.639 --> 00:59:34.369
- No.
- You mind your own business.

1633
00:59:34.599 --> 00:59:35.869
You should flick the bottom.

1634
00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:38.679
(Hong Gi the Master Key Flicker
is very calm.)

1635
00:59:38.679 --> 00:59:39.909
All right.

1636
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:43.010
(The game is finished.)

1637
00:59:45.019 --> 00:59:46.219
Hong Gi is really good.

1638
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.750
- He's unbelievable.
- He's really good.

1639
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.920
- Flick your finger just once.
- Why?

1640
00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:52.360
- Just once.
- Just once.

1641
00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.090
- Don't flick it too hard.
- Okay.

1642
00:59:54.119 --> 00:59:55.460
What's the point of it
if he won't flick his finger hard?

1643
00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.590
All right. But since you lost,
you should kneel down.

1644
00:59:58.559 --> 00:59:59.630
(His ego is hurt.)

1645
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.500
- Do I have to do it?
- You have to kneel down.

1646
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.269
- He'll be able to do it well then.
- Yes.

1647
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.239
These two are good friends.
Don't be mistaken.

1648
01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:10.869
(Henry, this is just a game.)

1649
01:00:10.869 --> 01:00:12.809
(He's nervous.)

1650
01:00:13.179 --> 01:00:14.909
- Here we go.
- Why cover my eyes?

1651
01:00:14.909 --> 01:00:15.949
(Keep your eyes closed.)

1652
01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:17.050
(He's horrified.)

1653
01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.920
Wait. Don't move.

1654
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.250
- That would hurt more.
- Hey.

1655
01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.449
Stay still. Stay still.

1656
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:23.849
It hurts more if you move.

1657
01:00:23.849 --> 01:00:25.989
(He did it!)

1658
01:00:27.389 --> 01:00:28.429
It hurts more if you move.

1659
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.460
(Was it just a flick
or was it a punch?)

1660
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.869
He's really strong.

1661
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.699
- The sound was unbelievable.
- I think he hit with his fist.

1662
01:00:37.969 --> 01:00:39.969
- My gosh.
- Wasn't it his fist?

1663
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.409
It was the most painful...

1664
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:44.780
- How did you do it?
- It's...

1665
01:00:45.039 --> 01:00:47.280
- It turned red.
- Wait.

1666
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.750
I think he quickly
clenched his fist.

1667
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.679
It felt like being hit with a fist.

1668
01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.090
There was a flick
and something else.

1669
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:58.059
- You're a con artist.
- No, I am not.

1670
01:00:58.059 --> 01:01:00.090
- He's really strong.
- Do you want to play another round?

1671
01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.130
- On the same terms?
- Let's play one more round.

1672
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.389
- You want to do this again.
- You want to do it again.

1673
01:01:03.429 --> 01:01:05.130
- Let's do it with one.
- I am a man.

1674
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.329
Yes, you are a man.

1675
01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.769
- Will you be okay?
- Shouldn't you be sitting down?

1676
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:11.030
Why is my hand shaking?

1677
01:01:11.639 --> 01:01:13.239
Think carefully. You might
get hit again.

1678
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:14.710
Ready.

1679
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.639
(There's no turning back.)

1680
01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:18.880
(Before they're friends,
they are men.)

1681
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.710
(Their ego is on stake.)

1682
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:23.750
He will succeed in one try.

1683
01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:26.849
No! No!

1684
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.219
(It was a clean shot.)

1685
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:32.960
- No! No!
- Poor Henry.

1686
01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:35.989
My goodness.

1687
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:38.300
- Why did you do it again?
- Wait.

1688
01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.199
- Wait. Wait.
- Why did he do it again?

1689
01:01:40.199 --> 01:01:41.730
Let's make a deal.

1690
01:01:42.369 --> 01:01:44.369
Let's play again.

1691
01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:47.769
- If I win, I don't get hit.
- The penalty is gone.

1692
01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:50.309
- If you lose, you get hit twice.
- You get hit twice.

1693
01:01:50.409 --> 01:01:51.840
(If you lose again,
your forehead will burn.)

1694
01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.280
- Just get hit once.
- Yes.

1695
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.949
- Getting hit once is better.
- Poor Henry.

1696
01:01:54.949 --> 01:01:56.750
- My finger hurts.
- Ready.

1697
01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.550
Two.

1698
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:01.449
(It was another strong flick.)

1699
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.789
That was too strong.

1700
01:02:03.889 --> 01:02:05.260
Wait.

1701
01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.420
- How can you hit him with a fist?
- I only flicked my finger.

1702
01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:09.860
- Okay.
- Let's go, Hong Gi.

1703
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:11.760
It's over.

1704
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.730
- You're bad.
- Hong Gi.

1705
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.670
(Hong Gi shouldn't pick
the water bucket this time.)

1706
01:02:15.929 --> 01:02:17.070
Which one would you choose?

1707
01:02:17.469 --> 01:02:19.539
- I want to choose 6.
- Hong Gi, go with 8.

1708
01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.570
Should I choose 11,
the one in the far corner?

1709
01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.440
- They might have hidden it.
- I have a good feeling about it.

1710
01:02:24.469 --> 01:02:25.679
- Or should I go with six?
- All right.

1711
01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:27.809
Pull on the count of three.
I feel good about this.

1712
01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:29.650
I am going to stare at it.

1713
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:31.349
- We can finish the game now.
- You're going to stare at it.

1714
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:33.079
- Are you going to stare at it?
- Are you trying to wash your face?

1715
01:02:33.079 --> 01:02:34.849
Yes. How did you know that?

1716
01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:35.889
Ready.

1717
01:02:35.889 --> 01:02:39.360
(From whipped cream to water,
he got splashed with everything.)

1718
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.460
(Did he choose the flower petals
this time?)

1719
01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.530
2, 3.

1720
01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.159
2, 3.

1721
01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:49.199
(Yes! Here's water.)

1722
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:55.909
(You love water.)

1723
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:59.010
Poor Hong Gi.

1724
01:02:59.579 --> 01:03:01.210
- He's amazing.
- It's too bad.

1725
01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.309
My goodness. It went
inside his nose.

1726
01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.019
It's okay, Hong Gi.

1727
01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.550
- The water went inside his nose.
- It hurts.

1728
01:03:07.679 --> 01:03:10.250
The bucket number 11 had
an unusually large amount of water.

1729
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.820
When he was getting splashed, I
thought he was getting electrocuted.

1730
01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.519
He moved as if he was.

1731
01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:17.489
- My goodness, Hong Gi.
- I don't like this show.

1732
01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:21.130
- Good job.
- You can win now.

1733
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.329
- It's our big picture.
- The real game starts now.

1734
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:28.039
(Now 10 buckets remain.)

1735
01:03:28.039 --> 01:03:29.409
Next game is...

1736
01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:32.309
- "Wind Up a Ribbon Fast".
- "Wind Up a Ribbon Fast".

1737
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.949
The person who winds up
the ribbon first will win.

1738
01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.250
- Like this?
- How?

1739
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:40.250
- I think a girl would do it well.
- Se Jeong.

1740
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.050
- Se Jeong will do it.
- Chae Yeon will play for us.

1741
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:44.719
Come on, Se Jeong,
Chae Yeon.

1742
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.389
You have to follow the ribbon.

1743
01:03:47.389 --> 01:03:48.559
(Jong Min gives her a lesson.)

1744
01:03:48.989 --> 01:03:50.590
- All right.
- Go, girls.

1745
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:52.260
- Go, Chae Yeon!
- You win if you wind it up first.

1746
01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.969
- Ready.
- Go, team!

1747
01:03:55.369 --> 01:03:56.699
Let's go, Chae Yeon!

1748
01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.239
(The game begins.)

1749
01:03:58.239 --> 01:04:01.199
- That's it!
- That's it.

1750
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.309
- Wind it up.
- Do it faster.

1751
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:06.610
- Faster.
- Faster.

1752
01:04:06.679 --> 01:04:08.280
- Come on.
- That's it.

1753
01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:10.380
- That's it.
- Don't strain your muscles.

1754
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.019
- That's it.
- Great.

1755
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.250
Come on, Chae Yeon.

1756
01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:15.090
Come on, Chae Yeon.

1757
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:18.519
(Chae Yeon realizes that
it's not working out for her...)

1758
01:04:18.519 --> 01:04:20.119
(and cheats.)

1759
01:04:20.119 --> 01:04:22.090
You can't do that!

1760
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:23.989
(Se Jeong persistently winds it up
and wins.)

1761
01:04:23.989 --> 01:04:25.800
Just a little bit more.

1762
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.429
- Good job.
- We won.

1763
01:04:27.429 --> 01:04:29.329
- We admit that Se Jeong won.
- She did.

1764
01:04:29.429 --> 01:04:31.469
Se Jeong won.

1765
01:04:31.539 --> 01:04:35.010
- Chae Yeon used her hand.
- We finally won.

1766
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.869
- Great.
- You won't get splashed.

1767
01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:39.940
You're bad.

1768
01:04:40.579 --> 01:04:42.949
- You're bad.
- Now...

1769
01:04:42.949 --> 01:04:45.420
10 buckets remain.
So the chance is 1 out of 10.

1770
01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:49.619
By the way, I thought
Chae Yeon would play fairly.

1771
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.389
- When she saw Se Jeong...
- I was surprised.

1772
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.429
- She used her hand.
- She was impatient.

1773
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:59.960
This is our big picture.
We will start winning now.

1774
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:01.429
Let's choose the flower petals
and end this.

1775
01:05:01.599 --> 01:05:03.670
- Okay?
- We will accept it if you do.

1776
01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.739
- Se Jeong is quite lucky.
- Right.

1777
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.000
Right.

1778
01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:10.940
All right. Do you have
a number in mind?

1779
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:14.139
Since my group name is Gugudan,
I should go with number 9.

1780
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.610
- 9.
- 9.

1781
01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.449
- I think she will get it.
- Stand at nine.

1782
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:18.880
She chose 9 because
her group name is Gugudan.

1783
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.219
I got a feeling.
It's the flower petals.

1784
01:05:21.219 --> 01:05:22.849
- We got it.
- Ready.

1785
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:24.489
- Wait.
- We got it.

1786
01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:27.019
- Please make her glitter.
- 1, 2, 3.

1787
01:05:27.019 --> 01:05:28.059
(It's time for her
to finish the game.)

1788
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:35.969
(While other members chose water,
did she choose the flower petals?)

1789
01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:41.440
(Did she choose the flower petals?)

1790
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:44.070
(She chose water.)

1791
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:45.840
My goodness.

1792
01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.280
She chose the water bucket.

1793
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.409
Flip your hair.

1794
01:05:50.409 --> 01:05:53.820
(Water isn't so bad.)

1795
01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.289
(The water splashes onto everyone.)

1796
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:58.690
That must hurt.

1797
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:02.190
(She shares it with everyone.)

1798
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.829
It must've hurt at the end.

1799
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:07.130
(She glitters even with water.)

1800
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.840
(Now 9 buckets remain.)

1801
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.440
Now...

1802
01:06:13.739 --> 01:06:15.869
it's time to
find the flower petal bucket.

1803
01:06:15.969 --> 01:06:18.179
- Now there's more chance.
- It begins now.

1804
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.239
- The tube game is good.
- Bring it on.

1805
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.280
- The tube.
- My goodness.

1806
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:24.880
- Stop bluffing.
- I am confident.

1807
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.579
I think it's number one.

1808
01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.889
- Hong Gi.
- Is it you again?

1809
01:06:29.889 --> 01:06:31.960
- If you lose, you'll get a flick.
- You will get a flick.

1810
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.889
- Just do it. You promised.
- He promised.

1811
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.559
When?

1812
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:40.500
- Go inside.
- Go inside?

1813
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.769
- You have to go through it.
- You have to go through it...

1814
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:44.900
- without using your hands.
- Like this?

1815
01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.440
You can't put your feet
underneath it.

1816
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.840
Why are there so many rules?

1817
01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.739
A bucket is on stake. Ready.
Don't take out your hands.

1818
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.079
Start.

1819
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:57.710
(Who will smile at the end?)

1820
01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880
Hong Gi.

1821
01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:03.289
(Isn't he a genius?)

1822
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.519
(He put his head in
as soon as the game began.)

1823
01:07:08.159 --> 01:07:09.530
(But he falls.)

1824
01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:11.059
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

1825
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:12.860
- Who does that?
- He did it.

1826
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.199
(Hong Gi uses the chance
to sit down and try it.)

1827
01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.269
- They're close.
- It's nip and tuck.

1828
01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:19.969
(It's a close match.)

1829
01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:25.179
(I can't lose again.)

1830
01:07:25.179 --> 01:07:26.480
He won.

1831
01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.110
(Henry and Hong Gi
are both out.)

1832
01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.349
He won.

1833
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:32.480
(Who won?)

1834
01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:37.619
(Both of them were lying down
trying to get out.)

1835
01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:40.519
(At that moment,)

1836
01:07:40.519 --> 01:07:44.260
(Henry came out first.)

1837
01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.429
- Good job.
- Henry wins.

1838
01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:47.800
(Finally, Henry succeeds
to take the revenge.)

1839
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:49.800
(Henry's trick worked.)

1840
01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.400
- Good job.
- Well done.

1841
01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:52.840
Which one would you choose?

1842
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.440
- Choose the flower petals.
- Should I choose?

1843
01:07:54.469 --> 01:07:56.110
- You get only one chance.
- It'd be bad if they win.

1844
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:58.110
We've been winning all along,
but we might lose now.

1845
01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:00.039
- We have to win.
- I'll go with number four.

1846
01:08:00.679 --> 01:08:02.280
I think it's going to be
number four.

1847
01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.349
- Number 4.
- Number 4, Henry.

1848
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:05.650
- Number 14.
- This?

1849
01:08:06.019 --> 01:08:07.550
Number five? This?

1850
01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.389
- Number 5?
- Henry, go with Number 4.

1851
01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:11.250
- I won't believe you.
- My birthday is April 4.

1852
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.559
- Go with number 4.
- 4?

1853
01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:14.190
- Number 4 feels good.
- Okay.

1854
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.030
- I will believe you.
- I think it's number 14.

1855
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:17.590
- I think it's number 14.
- Ready.

1856
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:18.960
- Hurry up.
- Number five.

1857
01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.030
Okay. Ready.

1858
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:21.030
Number five.

1859
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:23.070
- Shout the number first.
- 1, 2...

1860
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:25.270
- I am confident.
- Be confident.

1861
01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:28.439
1, 2, 3.

1862
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:32.140
(The chance is 1 out of 9.)

1863
01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:35.350
(What will happen to Henry?)

1864
01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.619
(It's the flower petals!)

1865
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:46.420
(Team Hyun Moo wins Round 2.)

1866
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.789
(Team Hyun Moo is thrilled,)

1867
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:52.100
(and Team Su Geun is upset.)

1868
01:08:52.159 --> 01:08:54.600
(We never knew
we'd lose like this.)

1869
01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.670
Let's dance together.

1870
01:08:59.539 --> 01:09:01.670
(He teases Team Su Geun.)

1871
01:09:03.039 --> 01:09:04.439
(I told you I had a good feeling
about number 4.)

1872
01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:05.710
- He's amazing.
- You are good.

1873
01:09:05.710 --> 01:09:08.010
I told you to listen to me.

1874
01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.710
This is Team Hyun Moo's
big picture.

1875
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:12.479
We've been winning all along.

1876
01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:13.520
This is unbelievable.

1877
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.750
This gives me chills.

1878
01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.119
This is how you play a game.

1879
01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:19.060
(One man gets teary eyes.)

1880
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:26.029
(I won all the games.)

1881
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.760
Congratulations.

1882
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.800
(He won all the games...)

1883
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:37.739
(but got splashed with water
many times.)

1884
01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:43.449
(He worked hard for no reason.)

1885
01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.020
(I won't lose...)

1886
01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.090
(the next round.)

1887
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.319
- Let's choose one.
- You do it.

1888
01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:55.890
- It's my first time to hold this.
- He will do it.

1889
01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:57.430
It's my first time to hold it.

1890
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:59.859
- It's my first time.
- Come on.

1891
01:09:59.859 --> 01:10:01.060
Which one should we choose?

1892
01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.470
This or this?

1893
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:04.399
- I think this is the best one.
- This is the best, isn't it?

1894
01:10:04.399 --> 01:10:06.600
We will check the key of someone...

1895
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.939
who is suspicious.

1896
01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:09.310
And I will reveal my key.

1897
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:10.310
That's not a bad idea.

1898
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:12.880
Out of 7 people,
we get to choose 1.

1899
01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.939
It's random.

1900
01:10:13.939 --> 01:10:16.550
Even so, we get to check one key.

1901
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.979
Right.

1902
01:10:17.979 --> 01:10:19.350
Let's go with this one.

1903
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:21.119
We will go with this one.

1904
01:10:21.279 --> 01:10:23.619
We will reveal one of our keys...

1905
01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:25.020
and check one of their keys.

1906
01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.659
- Great.
- Great.

1907
01:10:26.659 --> 01:10:28.359
Whose key should we check?

1908
01:10:28.359 --> 01:10:30.189
Chae Yeon's.

1909
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:32.000
I think it's Chae Yeon.

1910
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.329
Everyone thinks that.

1911
01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:34.829
- What if it's not her?
- What if it's not her?

1912
01:10:34.829 --> 01:10:36.770
- It's her.
- We should check hers anyway.

1913
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:37.829
It's not a bad idea.

1914
01:10:37.829 --> 01:10:40.600
- Should we go with her then?
- We need to guess one more.

1915
01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.770
- There are two.
- Right.

1916
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.869
It's a good idea to check
the suspicious one...

1917
01:10:43.869 --> 01:10:45.140
- and cross her out.
- Right.

1918
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.109
(I made sure they don't find out
that it's me.)

1919
01:10:48.579 --> 01:10:50.510
(From the start,
Chae Yeon has been...)

1920
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:56.289
(looking suspicious.)

1921
01:10:56.789 --> 01:10:59.119
(It's our chance to check
one suspicious person.)

1922
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:01.460
Whose key should we reveal?

1923
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.489
(I have to make sure
they don't choose me.)

1924
01:11:03.489 --> 01:11:04.930
I think...

1925
01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.430
The person who doesn't have
the Master Key should volunteer.

1926
01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:09.529
Should I do it then?

1927
01:11:09.529 --> 01:11:10.899
- Will you be all right to do that?
- Yes.

1928
01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.000
Okay. Let's go with yours.

1929
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.069
We've decided.

1930
01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:16.909
That would make you
feel comfortable.

1931
01:11:16.909 --> 01:11:19.380
Yes. Okay. We've decided.

1932
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.550
(It seems like Shownu
doesn't have the Master Key.)

1933
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:23.850
We want Shownu's.

1934
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:25.479
- Me too.
- We will reveal it to you.

1935
01:11:25.479 --> 01:11:26.779
Thank you.

1936
01:11:26.779 --> 01:11:29.689
We want to see Chae Yeon's key.

1937
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:31.489
Shownu will reveal his key.

1938
01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.560
We will check Shownu's first.

1939
01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.560
(Is there anyone else there...)

1940
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.789
(who also has the Master Key?)

1941
01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.100
(Shownu's key is
on the Judgement Cabinet.)

1942
01:11:40.899 --> 01:11:42.600
- Chae Yeon, say it.
- The bell of truth...

1943
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.899
The bell of truth?

1944
01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:45.439
The bell of truth.

1945
01:11:46.039 --> 01:11:48.710
Is this key the Master Key?

1946
01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:50.109
It's Shownu's key.

1947
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:54.409
(Since he checked his key,)

1948
01:11:54.409 --> 01:11:55.750
He looks disappointed.

1949
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:58.380
(he's been looking mysterious.)

1950
01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:02.949
(Is his key the Master Key?)

1951
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.960
(There's no going back now.)

1952
01:12:09.029 --> 01:12:11.500
(His key is not the Master Key.)

1953
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.930
- Really?
- Really?

1954
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.170
They're ruined.

1955
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:17.869
You're acting strange.

1956
01:12:17.869 --> 01:12:19.840
(With bad acting...)

1957
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.199
(and facial expression,
they try to hide it.)

1958
01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:24.109
- Jong Min...
- The moment he saw it...

1959
01:12:24.109 --> 01:12:26.439
Shownu was smart.

1960
01:12:26.439 --> 01:12:28.149
- I know.
- I didn't see it.

1961
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:30.010
I will tell you.

1962
01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:31.920
(According to their faces,
Shownu's is not the Master Key.)

1963
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.619
Let's check Chae Yeon's key.

1964
01:12:34.619 --> 01:12:36.590
(It's time to check
Chae Yeon's key.)

1965
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:37.649
(Is Chae Yeon's the Master Key?)

1966
01:12:38.289 --> 01:12:40.859
Is this the Master Key?

1967
01:12:41.319 --> 01:12:42.460
Master Key.

1968
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:44.800
(Is Chae Yeon's key
the Master Key?)

1969
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.100
1, 2.

1970
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:52.039
(Team Hyun Moo has been
the most suspicious about her.)

1971
01:12:52.039 --> 01:12:55.640
(And Eun Hyuk is
desperate to find out.)

1972
01:12:55.869 --> 01:12:59.409
(She's been looking
mysterious all along.)

1973
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.409
It's the Master Key.

1974
01:13:02.409 --> 01:13:05.119
- She doesn't know how to react.
- She's flustered.

1975
01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:07.319
She doesn't know
how to react to it.

1976
01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:09.819
(The secret behind her smile...)

1977
01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:14.659
(will be revealed
to Team Hyun Moo.)

1978
01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:17.630
(It's not the Master Key.)

1979
01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.199
(They start acting right away.)

1980
01:13:21.199 --> 01:13:22.199
Really?

1981
01:13:22.199 --> 01:13:23.770
(Whose key is the Master Key then?)

1982
01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:25.300
You are unbelievable.

1983
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.270
(What is that bad acting?)

1984
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.039
- It's not it.
- You are unbelievable.

1985
01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:31.979
- You are the best.
- Sung Jong is...

1986
01:13:31.979 --> 01:13:33.310
- No.
- a terrible actor.

1987
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:34.609
No. No.

1988
01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:36.180
No?

1989
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.850
- Sung Jong.
- Really?

1990
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:39.920
Do you understand the game?

1991
01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.920
Yes. I did.

1992
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:44.819
Okay.

1993
01:13:44.819 --> 01:13:46.060
All right.

1994
01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.229
Thank you for letting us know.

1995
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1996
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:52.699
- This is crazy.
- It's unbelievable.

1997
01:13:52.699 --> 01:13:55.170
- This show is unbelievable.
- All right.

1998
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.930
We are certain about it now.

1999
01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:00.739
We know how many of you
have the Master Key.

2000
01:14:00.739 --> 01:14:02.439
Now we have the advantage.

2001
01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:10.050
This set is amazing.

2002
01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:11.350
I know.

2003
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.750
It's unbelievable.

2004
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:15.250
They spent a lot of effort
into building it.

2005
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:18.789
It feels strange.
There's nothing here.

2006
01:14:18.789 --> 01:14:20.859
- What's this for?
- Water will come out from it.

2007
01:14:20.859 --> 01:14:22.159
Don't lie.

2008
01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:23.430
(It's a lucky day for Hong Gi.)

2009
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:24.659
Stop talking about water.

2010
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.159
Are you supposed to
pull this and sing?

2011
01:14:27.159 --> 01:14:30.930
In the previous episode,
we could make guesses.

2012
01:14:31.029 --> 01:14:33.340
And we had a little bit
of conviction by this time.

2013
01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.369
But today, we won many times,

2014
01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:35.810
- but we have no clue.
- We have no clue.

2015
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:37.140
We can't make a guess.

2016
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:41.380
We are certain that
you have two Master Keys.

2017
01:14:41.579 --> 01:14:43.079
Don't listen to him.

2018
01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:44.149
Right.

2019
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:45.250
He's just bluffing.

2020
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:46.920
I think he's wrong.

2021
01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.850
Eun Hyuk said we're wrong.

2022
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:51.390
You have the Master Key.

2023
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:52.789
Eun Hyuk is suspicious.

2024
01:14:52.859 --> 01:14:55.630
If I have the Master Key,
it would show on my face.

2025
01:14:55.630 --> 01:14:57.630
- It's been showing on your face.
- It's so obvious.

2026
01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:58.930
- Really?
- It shows on his face.

2027
01:14:58.930 --> 01:14:59.930
He can't hide it.

2028
01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:01.869
On the last round,

2029
01:15:01.869 --> 01:15:04.000
you can get crucial hints.

2030
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.640
The last game is
"Don't Show Your Back".

2031
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.970
("Don't Show Your Back")

2032
01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:11.640
The team that comes up
with a word using the letters...

2033
01:15:11.779 --> 01:15:13.409
on the back of the opposing
team players win.

2034
01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.079
You have to pull down
the mic and say the answer.

2035
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:16.579
- Pull this down?
- Yes.

2036
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.050
- What about the short people?
- Wait.

2037
01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:19.319
What if you can't reach it?

2038
01:15:19.319 --> 01:15:20.380
You can jump.

2039
01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:21.720
(The mic is very high.)

2040
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:22.789
What if you can't reach it?

2041
01:15:22.789 --> 01:15:24.220
You can jump. Try it.

2042
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.760
- Can you jump?
- Start.

2043
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.489
- All right.
- I could touch the ceiling.

2044
01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:28.489
Try it. Start.

2045
01:15:28.489 --> 01:15:30.760
- Please touch the ceiling.
- See if you can get the mic.

2046
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.460
- I could hit it with my head too.
- He can hit it with his head.

2047
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.430
- Try it.
- Hit it with your head.

2048
01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.029
- My gosh.
- You can't do it.

2049
01:15:36.029 --> 01:15:37.300
Hit it with your head.

2050
01:15:37.829 --> 01:15:38.869
(Master Key)

2051
01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:40.199
He can't do it.

2052
01:15:40.399 --> 01:15:41.770
His head didn't touch it.

2053
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:43.109
Not even your hair touched it.

2054
01:15:43.109 --> 01:15:44.739
- I'll try one more time.
- Your head didn't touch it.

2055
01:15:44.739 --> 01:15:45.880
Try it again.

2056
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:47.409
(Oh, my gosh)

2057
01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.310
(Did something just pass?)

2058
01:15:51.449 --> 01:15:53.720
(He's too short.)

2059
01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.119
- That was very close.
- You try it.

2060
01:15:55.119 --> 01:15:56.750
- It was so close.
- That was amazing.

2061
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:58.460
You are 167cm tall.
You give it a try.

2062
01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.060
I am taller than you.

2063
01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.029
He can't even jump now.

2064
01:16:02.029 --> 01:16:04.130
Please give us the letters
that will go on our back.

2065
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:05.500
- Okay.
- Come here.

2066
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.859
- Show me your back.
- Okay.

2067
01:16:06.859 --> 01:16:08.569
Come to me.

2068
01:16:08.569 --> 01:16:09.829
(They guard the letters)

2069
01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:12.640
- Got it.
- Got it.

2070
01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:15.739
Let's give an important letter
to a swift person.

2071
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.409
You can take whichever you want.

2072
01:16:18.409 --> 01:16:19.880
- You need to combine the letters.
- That's the right order.

2073
01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.250
These are the most important ones.

2074
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:23.979
These two...

2075
01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:25.449
should be apart from each other.

2076
01:16:25.449 --> 01:16:26.779
I will take one.

2077
01:16:26.779 --> 01:16:28.149
Who's going to take this?

2078
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.390
- What?
- This is too easy.

2079
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:33.060
This is too easy.
When they see this...

2080
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.130
- Do you need me to help you?
- You should help each other.

2081
01:16:36.329 --> 01:16:38.029
Henry. Henry.

2082
01:16:38.029 --> 01:16:39.229
Hey!

2083
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.229
Henry.

2084
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:42.270
Hey!

2085
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:43.270
I saw it.

2086
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.840
One letter is all right.

2087
01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.739
Is Henry their spy?

2088
01:16:46.739 --> 01:16:47.970
Why is he so bad at playing games?

2089
01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.140
Perhaps they planted him here.

2090
01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.069
- My goodness.
- No!

2091
01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:52.109
(Mind your own business.)

2092
01:16:52.109 --> 01:16:53.779
- Come on, Hyun Moo.
- Are you a spy too?

2093
01:16:54.039 --> 01:16:55.109
Did you see it?

2094
01:16:55.109 --> 01:16:57.250
- We're doomed.
- You didn't see it, did you?

2095
01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:58.350
This is for Bobby.

2096
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:59.350
I will put it on your back.

2097
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:00.579
We will try to...

2098
01:17:00.579 --> 01:17:02.449
(Oh, no!)

2099
01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.319
You can't turn back!

2100
01:17:06.359 --> 01:17:07.420
Be careful.

2101
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.329
What's my letter?

2102
01:17:09.329 --> 01:17:11.359
You don't have to know.

2103
01:17:11.729 --> 01:17:13.760
- Here's our plan.
- Okay.

2104
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.170
Your letter won't be
of any use to them.

2105
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.500
Will he march forward?

2106
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.569
You just march forward.
Do you understand?

2107
01:17:19.569 --> 01:17:20.899
Just create chaos.

2108
01:17:20.899 --> 01:17:22.439
They will get flustered,

2109
01:17:22.439 --> 01:17:23.810
and we will check their letters.

2110
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.640
Let's come up with a plan too.

2111
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.010
Just stay where you are.

2112
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:30.350
- Don't do anything.
- Come on, Henry.

2113
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:32.220
- Just stay still.
- It's all right.

2114
01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.579
We need to do one more.

2115
01:17:34.579 --> 01:17:36.949
(The game starts.)

2116
01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.319
(Team Su Geun's strategy
is to defend their letters.)

2117
01:17:40.319 --> 01:17:42.960
(Team Hyun Moo's strategy
is to attack.)

2118
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:50.800
You're scary.

2119
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.140
Grab him.

2120
01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.069
(He moves like a scorpion.)

2121
01:17:55.909 --> 01:17:57.670
(Bobby is isolated
in the enemy camp.)

2122
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:59.739
Move, Bobby.

2123
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.279
Move, Bobby.

2124
01:18:01.279 --> 01:18:02.579
That's a foul.

2125
01:18:02.579 --> 01:18:03.649
(Sung Jong sees Bobby's letter.)

2126
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:06.050
It's "Ui".

2127
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:08.319
(Bobby's letter is "Ui".)

2128
01:18:08.619 --> 01:18:12.560
It's "Ui".

2129
01:18:12.859 --> 01:18:14.789
Come back. You've seen one,
so come back.

2130
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:16.560
Bobby, come back.

2131
01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.029
Come back.

2132
01:18:18.029 --> 01:18:20.430
Jong Min, get him.

2133
01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.029
I saw it!

2134
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:23.829
It's "ik".

2135
01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:25.140
(He thinks it's "ik".)

2136
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.640
"Ik". Bobby's letter is "ik".

2137
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.340
- "Ik".
- Bobby's letter is "ik".

2138
01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.180
"Ik". Bobby's letter is "ik".

2139
01:18:33.279 --> 01:18:34.409
"Ik".

2140
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:35.680
(Did you see my letter?)

2141
01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.979
It's "Ik".

2142
01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:40.149
Wait. It's not ours.

2143
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.789
"Geum".

2144
01:18:42.789 --> 01:18:44.050
"Geum".

2145
01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:46.020
(Each team found one letter.)

2146
01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.359
"Geum".

2147
01:18:47.359 --> 01:18:49.189
Wait.

2148
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:50.229
(Su Geun tries to guess the answer.)

2149
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:52.000
(What's a 6-letter word
that includes "geum"?)

2150
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.260
("Geum")

2151
01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:58.239
I got it!

2152
01:18:58.439 --> 01:19:00.399
I got it!

2153
01:19:00.399 --> 01:19:03.340
(Which answer did Su Geun
come up with?)

2154
01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:04.779
What is it?

2155
01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.109
It's "The Honest Woodman".

2156
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.020
(Is it the answer?)

2157
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.050
That's not it.

2158
01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:15.090
"Ik".

2159
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:16.119
(Sung Jong swiftly
checks Su Geun's letter.)

2160
01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:18.460
(It's "o".)

2161
01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.630
(Now 2 letters of Team Su Geun
are revealed.)

2162
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:23.930
It's "o".

2163
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:25.260
Wait.

2164
01:19:25.899 --> 01:19:28.399
It's "o".

2165
01:19:28.399 --> 01:19:31.399
There's "o".

2166
01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:34.340
I got it.

2167
01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.510
- There's "oh" and "ui".
- "The Big Swindle".

2168
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:36.739
- "Chin".
- Is it the answer?

2169
01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:37.840
No.

2170
01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.210
There's "oh" and "ui".

2171
01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.449
(Bobby checks
Eun Hyuk's letter.)

2172
01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:44.210
It's "chin".

2173
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:46.520
(Now 2 letters are revealed
for each team.)

2174
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.649
What was that?

2175
01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:49.189
We are in trouble.

2176
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:52.489
- It's "yu".
- It's all right.

2177
01:19:52.489 --> 01:19:53.520
(Now that they saw my letter,
I should attack.)

2178
01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.430
I am not an easy opponent.

2179
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:56.460
Come on!

2180
01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:57.689
Oh!

2181
01:19:57.689 --> 01:19:59.159
(Shownu sees
Jong Min's letter, "yu".)

2182
01:19:59.159 --> 01:20:00.430
"Yu".

2183
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:01.930
(They've got "o", "yu"
and "ui" now.)

2184
01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.029
What is it?

2185
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.300
It's "yu".

2186
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.840
- What was it again?
- "chin".

2187
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.010
"Chin".

2188
01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:10.510
- "Jin"?
- "Yu".

2189
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:12.180
- Is it "jin"?
- It's "chin".

2190
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.239
- What is "jin"?
- "Jin"?

2191
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:15.180
(Eun Hyuk enters the enemy camp.)

2192
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.750
- It's "chin".
- What's "jin"?

2193
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:17.909
It's "chin".

2194
01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.479
- "Jin" and...
- "Yu".

2195
01:20:19.479 --> 01:20:21.649
(Shownu presses
from the other side.)

2196
01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.920
(Should we get started?)

2197
01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.560
Is it "jin"? I didn't hear you well.

2198
01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.029
It's "yu".

2199
01:20:28.029 --> 01:20:29.659
- "Geum".
- "Yu".

2200
01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:32.229
(At that time, Hong Gi
turns his head.)

2201
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:33.930
(It's a chance for Eun Hyuk.)

2202
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.270
(3 letters of Team Su Geun
are currently revealed.)

2203
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:36.699
Come here.

2204
01:20:36.699 --> 01:20:38.470
- I...
- Hyun Moo.

2205
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:42.170
("Pe")

2206
01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.270
(What's the 6-letter word
that contains these letters?)

2207
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:46.479
("Pe")

2208
01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.279
("Yu")

2209
01:20:49.779 --> 01:20:51.649
"Yu".

2210
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.050
(I got an idea.)

2211
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:57.850
I got it.

2212
01:20:57.850 --> 01:20:59.359
Who farted?

2213
01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.960
"The Phantom of the Opera".

2214
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:07.029
(Did Eun Hyuk guess it right?)

2215
01:21:09.069 --> 01:21:10.130
"The Phantom of the Opera".

2216
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:12.170
"Lady Vengeance".

2217
01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:13.170
(He got it.)

2218
01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.369
"The Phantom of the Opera".

2219
01:21:14.909 --> 01:21:16.270
"Lady Vengeance".

2220
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:18.310
(It was "The Phantom of the Opera".)

2221
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:21.649
We did it.

2222
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:23.479
We are really good.

2223
01:21:23.579 --> 01:21:24.920
- We got it.
- Good job.

2224
01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.449
- They lost.
- I guessed it right.

2225
01:21:28.449 --> 01:21:29.720
I... Stop it.

2226
01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.460
I accept that we lost.

2227
01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.090
But let's be honest about something.

2228
01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:34.489
Who farted? Raise your hand.

2229
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.659
Who farted?

2230
01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:38.899
I say it when I fart.

2231
01:21:39.029 --> 01:21:40.930
Who is it?

2232
01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:42.630
Hyun Moo, come on.

2233
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:44.770
- I didn't go there.
- It's one of you.

2234
01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:46.539
It must be from your team.
We didn't go to that side.

2235
01:21:46.539 --> 01:21:48.609
- A lot of you came to our side.
- A lot of you came.

2236
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.409
It could have been Henry.

2237
01:21:50.409 --> 01:21:51.939
- Everyone was here at least once.
- If it was me,

2238
01:21:51.939 --> 01:21:53.439
If it was me, I'd say it.

2239
01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.609
- How did you guess it?
- How did you get the answer?

2240
01:21:55.609 --> 01:21:57.810
They saw my letter,

2241
01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:59.380
so I just attacked them.

2242
01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:02.020
When I came here,
they didn't know I was here,

2243
01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.590
and they only cared
about my team on that side.

2244
01:22:04.489 --> 01:22:06.260
(3 minutes ago,
just before the victory)

2245
01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:09.590
(Eun Hyuk seized the opportunity
and entered the enemy camp.)

2246
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:12.460
(He won a victory
on the blind spot.)

2247
01:22:13.699 --> 01:22:15.600
- That's our big picture.
- He's a genius.

2248
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.729
- Everyone was looking that way.
- A soldier is different.

2249
01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640
He was like a soldier
from the infiltration team.

2250
01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.609
I seized the chance
when he was off-guard.

2251
01:22:21.609 --> 01:22:23.369
He's a master.

2252
01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:25.039
You did well stirring them up,

2253
01:22:25.539 --> 01:22:27.609
but I couldn't hear
what you were saying.

2254
01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.880
- I worked really hard.
- You said three letters.

2255
01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.079
- But I didn't hear it.
- "Chin", "Geum", "ja".

2256
01:22:32.079 --> 01:22:33.579
- We could've won.
- That's everything.

2257
01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:34.649
We had all the letters.

2258
01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.020
That's everything we needed.

2259
01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:38.420
- I am sorry, but...
- That's everything.

2260
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:41.319
shouldn't he have guessed it
if he had those letters?

2261
01:22:41.319 --> 01:22:43.329
That wasn't my duty.

2262
01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.859
(He only completes his duty.)

2263
01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:47.000
What? He gave us everything.

2264
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.329
He gave us the letters
so that we could guess it.

2265
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.229
What did you think when
you got those letters?

2266
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:52.539
I thought I should
find out the rest of the letters.

2267
01:22:53.369 --> 01:22:54.369
(He loves Korean language.)

2268
01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:57.539
- You thought you should find more.
- I wanted to help the team.

2269
01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:01.010
He fulfilled his responsibility.

2270
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:02.979
He was really fast.

2271
01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:04.680
- Great job.
- He's a genius.

2272
01:23:07.819 --> 01:23:10.989
Here's the Key Guide.
Let's choose it wisely.

2273
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:12.220
Which ones are remaining?

2274
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.789
Is there anyone in our team
who might have the Master Key?

2275
01:23:15.529 --> 01:23:17.289
I don't have it.

2276
01:23:17.289 --> 01:23:19.029
- I'm suspicious of her.
- Right.

2277
01:23:19.029 --> 01:23:20.600
It's her.

2278
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.029
(Is Se Jeong the other person
with the Master Key?)

2279
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:24.739
Is there anyone
you are suspicious of?

2280
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:28.000
Because it's you, you're
not suspicious of anyone.

2281
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.770
That's not it.

2282
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:31.539
Are you nervous?

2283
01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:33.510
I think there's no one in our team.

2284
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:36.710
Seven people are randomly chosen,
00:25:19.08

2285
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.350
I'll go with this one.

2286
01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:42.149
It won't help them a lot.

2287
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:43.989
- It's easy for Eun Hyuk to guess.
- Yes.

2288
01:23:43.989 --> 01:23:46.159
He's got one.

2289
01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.159
I told you.

2290
01:23:48.159 --> 01:23:50.130
I would say it if I have it.

2291
01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.800
- Hey, you...
- If you find...

2292
01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.460
Eun Hyuk's name in the list,
just choose him.

2293
01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.500
If my name is there,
I will tell you.

2294
01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.699
I know you. You've always
loved gold since you were young.

2295
01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:03.369
That's nonsense. My name
includes the word "silver".

2296
01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.939
I think you stayed
in the army far too long.

2297
01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.140
Your jokes are...

2298
01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.880
- so outdated.
- He's not used to the society.

2299
01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.609
(I'm surrounded by the enemies.)

2300
01:24:10.609 --> 01:24:11.920
Are there anyone you are
suspicious of?

2301
01:24:12.479 --> 01:24:14.180
Let's begin.

2302
01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:17.020
One of these people
has a Master Key.

2303
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.859
(Who are the 7 people
that might have the Master Key?)

2304
01:24:24.289 --> 01:24:25.430
(Sung Jong smiles.)

2305
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:27.199
Why did Eun Hyuk smile?

2306
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:29.229
It's one of them.

2307
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:30.529
- My goodness.
- It's surprising, isn't it?

2308
01:24:30.529 --> 01:24:31.770
- One of them has it?
- This is really surprising.

2309
01:24:31.770 --> 01:24:33.140
This is unbelievable.

2310
01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:34.199
(Eun Hyuk has the Master Key.)

2311
01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:36.510
That reaction is not necessary.

2312
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:37.739
Oh, my gosh.

2313
01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.380
(It means the other 6
don't have the Master Key.)

2314
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:41.350
- Is your name there, Eun Hyuk?
- Who among these...

2315
01:24:41.779 --> 01:24:42.810
- Yes.
- You can't tell him.

2316
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:44.819
- Yes.
- Are you an idiot?

2317
01:24:44.819 --> 01:24:46.550
It's his choice whether to
believe it or not.

2318
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:48.590
- There are many people here.
- Right.

2319
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:51.289
(Eun Hyuk has the Master Key.)

2320
01:24:51.289 --> 01:24:52.619
All right. Eun Hyuk.

2321
01:24:53.159 --> 01:24:55.029
Will you use the Gold Chance Card?

2322
01:24:56.529 --> 01:24:58.159
If you don't use it now,
you won't have time to use it.

2323
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:59.859
I will use it now.

2324
01:24:59.859 --> 01:25:00.859
(Eun Hyuk uses
the Gold Chance Card.)

2325
01:25:00.859 --> 01:25:02.569
I will use it now.

2326
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:08.369
(Eun Hyuk earned the Gold Chance
Card by winning the Watcher vote.)

2327
01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:12.609
I bet he doesn't understand
what's good about it.

2328
01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:19.550
(What does the Gold Chance Card
give him?)

2329
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:23.189
("You may choose 2 people
who might have the Master Key.")

2330
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:31.760
(It's his chance to
confirm his guess.)

2331
01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.300
Wait. The last hint was...

2332
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:37.329
(Soo Geun, Hyun Moo,
Shownu, Chae Yeon,)

2333
01:25:37.329 --> 01:25:41.510
(Sung Jong, and Henry
don't have the Master Key.)

2334
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:46.880
(Jong Min, Bobby, Se Jeong,
Hong Gi, and Chan Sung...)

2335
01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.479
(are the final candidates who
might have the other Master Key.)

2336
01:25:52.479 --> 01:25:54.380
Who are in the other team?

2337
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:55.750
Wait.

2338
01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.590
- What are you doing?
- I forgot who's there.

2339
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:03.930
We've been together for hours.
And you don't know that?

2340
01:26:04.329 --> 01:26:06.800
You are unbelievable.

2341
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.930
(Who has the other Master Key?)

2342
01:26:09.930 --> 01:26:11.939
One of them has it.

2343
01:26:11.939 --> 01:26:13.000
(One of them must have
the Master Key.)

2344
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.170
Yes. Right.

2345
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:19.640
(Who would Eun Hyuk choose?)

2346
01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:23.779
- I think it's Bobby.
- Me?

2347
01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:25.180
- Right?
- Me?

2348
01:26:25.779 --> 01:26:28.119
- I am suspicious of him too.
- I am suspicious of him.

2349
01:26:28.119 --> 01:26:29.390
- Why?
- I am suspicious of Bobby.

2350
01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.760
Bobby might be one.

2351
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.460
He was very aggressive today.

2352
01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:34.789
You saw him dancing.
He tried so hard.

2353
01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:37.859
And he was very aggressive
during the game.

2354
01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.800
I think it was his way of...

2355
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.260
- distracting us.
- I know.

2356
01:26:41.399 --> 01:26:42.699
He's been suspicious.

2357
01:26:42.699 --> 01:26:43.970
I'm suspicious of Bobby.

2358
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:45.470
(Does Bobby really
have the Master Key?)

2359
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:46.470
I suddenly become suspicious of him.

2360
01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.770
Honestly,

2361
01:26:49.409 --> 01:26:51.310
I thought it was either Su Geun...

2362
01:26:51.779 --> 01:26:53.579
or Shownu.

2363
01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:57.449
But their names...

2364
01:26:57.449 --> 01:26:58.880
were in the list
where my name was.

2365
01:26:59.319 --> 01:27:00.550
So now I'm confused.

2366
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:01.649
(He's going through a meltdown.)

2367
01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:05.390
Maybe it's...

2368
01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.359
(Jong Min)

2369
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:13.130
If it's really him,

2370
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.930
he's a genius actor.

2371
01:27:16.369 --> 01:27:18.369
But it might not be him.

2372
01:27:18.369 --> 01:27:22.140
I want to check it.

2373
01:27:23.039 --> 01:27:24.340
(I'm coming to get you.)

2374
01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.680
I think he has the Master Key.

2375
01:27:27.479 --> 01:27:28.579
Let's move back.

2376
01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.119
I am jealous.

2377
01:27:32.119 --> 01:27:33.380
(It's the judgement time.)

2378
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:37.949
(If Jong Min has the Master Key,)

2379
01:27:37.949 --> 01:27:42.489
(Eun Hyuk can write his name
and become the final winner.)

2380
01:27:42.489 --> 01:27:44.930
Are they the ones
that have the Master Key?

2381
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.329
(Bobby, Jong Min, Hong Gi,
Chan Sung, and Se Jeong...)

2382
01:27:50.329 --> 01:27:52.640
(are the strong candidates.)

2383
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.770
(Eun Hyuk chose Jong Min.
Did he make the right guess?)

2384
01:27:56.770 --> 01:28:00.279
(Jong Min does not
have the Master Key.)

2385
01:28:00.279 --> 01:28:01.810
He doesn't know who it is.

2386
01:28:02.579 --> 01:28:04.079
- Isn't that more confusing?
- It's too bad.

2387
01:28:04.649 --> 01:28:07.079
Eun Hyuk only needs to
find one person.

2388
01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.050
Will you not be telling us
what you found out?

2389
01:28:10.449 --> 01:28:11.960
(I already know one person.)

2390
01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:13.220
You can't tell them.

2391
01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:16.090
Nobody understood
the rule perfectly.

2392
01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:23.569
(Master Key candidates are Bobby,
Se Jeong, Chan Sung, and Hong Gi.)

2393
01:28:23.569 --> 01:28:27.369
(Who has the hidden Master Key?)

2394
01:28:28.239 --> 01:28:31.609
(Strong candidates are Bobby,
Se Jeong, Chan Sung, and Hong Gi.)

2395
01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.380
(Room of Fate)

2396
01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.979
- It's difficult today.
- I know who has it.

2397
01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:38.420
(Time for the final judgment)

2398
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:41.989
(Find out who has the Master Key
by taking everything into account.)

2399
01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:45.319
Everyone was clearheaded
when we first came here.

2400
01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.289
(Who has the Master Key?)

2401
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:51.859
It's Chan Sung.

2402
01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.600
Is it Chan Sung?

2403
01:28:55.869 --> 01:28:57.430
I'm too tired to react.

2404
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:59.939
(It gets more confusing.)

2405
01:29:00.199 --> 01:29:01.270
I have it.

2406
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.170
(He confesses out of the blue.)

2407
01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:04.409
I have it too.

2408
01:29:04.779 --> 01:29:05.779
I have it too.

2409
01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.539
My goodness.

2410
01:29:07.779 --> 01:29:11.149
Shownu, it must be confusing
for you.

2411
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:12.579
Gosh, I have no idea.

2412
01:29:12.579 --> 01:29:14.579
Either Chae Yeon, Bobby,
or Chan Sung has it.

2413
01:29:14.579 --> 01:29:16.149
(Who could it be?)

2414
01:29:16.319 --> 01:29:20.159
It's time to determine the winner
of Master Key.

2415
01:29:21.159 --> 01:29:23.789
There's voting paper on the podium.

2416
01:29:23.789 --> 01:29:27.460
Write the name of two people
whom you think has...

2417
01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.529
the Master Key.

2418
01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.430
Submit it in the envelope.

2419
01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:33.039
Gosh, I have no idea.

2420
01:29:33.039 --> 01:29:34.100
(It gets more confusing.)

2421
01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:35.970
I don't know.

2422
01:29:37.869 --> 01:29:39.739
Do the best you can.

2423
01:29:39.739 --> 01:29:42.109
- Write down two names.
- Pardon?

2424
01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:43.449
Shall we write them?

2425
01:29:43.779 --> 01:29:45.420
- In three seconds...
- Write them down.

2426
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.289
(Who will get the most votes?)

2427
01:29:48.619 --> 01:29:53.260
(Will Eun Hyuk remain discreet
and find the other one?)

2428
01:29:55.029 --> 01:29:56.890
- Gosh.
- What's that?

2429
01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:58.800
There he is.

2430
01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:00.800
Here you go.

2431
01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.069
(They can't turn back.)

2432
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.600
(Voting ends.)

2433
01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.640
We can no longer control our fate.

2434
01:30:10.069 --> 01:30:13.409
Wait, I can say this
now that we voted.

2435
01:30:13.409 --> 01:30:14.909
- Okay.
- Right.

2436
01:30:15.479 --> 01:30:18.220
At first, I was certain
that it was Bobby.

2437
01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.220
- Why?
- Don't accuse Bobby.

2438
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.949
I should have voted Bobby.

2439
01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:23.449
It could be Chan Sung.

2440
01:30:23.449 --> 01:30:25.460
That would be surprising.

2441
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.659
We could be completely wrong today.

2442
01:30:27.659 --> 01:30:29.630
- I should have written Bobby.
- Seriously.

2443
01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:31.359
Shall we find out the result?

2444
01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.460
Votes have been counted.

2445
01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:37.600
I will reveal the prize box
that the winner will be taking away.

2446
01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.939
(Here's the prize box.)

2447
01:30:40.039 --> 01:30:41.199
That's amazing.

2448
01:30:41.199 --> 01:30:42.470
(Everyone wants it.)

2449
01:30:43.239 --> 01:30:46.180
(It takes their breath away.)

2450
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.680
My goodness.

2451
01:30:47.739 --> 01:30:51.720
We must find two Master Keys
to open the box.

2452
01:30:52.779 --> 01:30:54.920
Who are the two with the most votes?

2453
01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.590
- They may not have it.
- Who could it be?

2454
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:58.920
- Is it Bobby?
- Let's find out.

2455
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.590
(Who will be the winner?)

2456
01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.159
Here are the voting results.

2457
01:31:04.029 --> 01:31:06.630
(Who were suspected the most?)

2458
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:08.930
- Who got the most votes?
- I'm scared.

2459
01:31:14.739 --> 01:31:16.170
- I'm scared.
- Eun Hyuk.

2460
01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:17.270
It's Eun Hyuk.

2461
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:18.479
(He fails to hide the Master Key.)

2462
01:31:18.479 --> 01:31:19.810
It has to be him.

2463
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.350
(Who else has the most votes?)

2464
01:31:26.479 --> 01:31:28.319
(Was it you?)

2465
01:31:32.989 --> 01:31:34.729
- It's Chan Sung.
- I knew it.

2466
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:36.359
Come out with the key.

2467
01:31:36.359 --> 01:31:37.460
Come to the front.

2468
01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.899
- Goodness.
- Don't tell us yet.

2469
01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:42.229
- Is it Eun Hyuk?
- Please I beg you.

2470
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:43.670
Isn't it Hyun Moo?

2471
01:31:44.029 --> 01:31:45.439
It's definitely not me.

2472
01:31:45.439 --> 01:31:46.800
Hyun Moo has it.

2473
01:31:47.069 --> 01:31:48.770
I hope we're right.

2474
01:31:48.869 --> 01:31:50.939
- Hyun Moo has it.
- No.

2475
01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:53.079
I bet the two have it.

2476
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:56.579
Eun Hyuk and Chan Sung
got the most number of votes.

2477
01:31:56.949 --> 01:31:58.720
Please put in the key.

2478
01:31:58.819 --> 01:31:59.880
I'm nervous.

2479
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:01.550
Why do I feel anxious?

2480
01:32:05.159 --> 01:32:08.130
(It's a success if Chan Sung
has the other Master Key.)

2481
01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:10.060
Do they have the Master Keys?

2482
01:32:12.029 --> 01:32:13.430
If so, that'd be amazing.

2483
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:14.600
The key turned.

2484
01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:17.329
- The key turned.
- What?

2485
01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:20.640
(Does Chan Sung have
the other Master Key?)

2486
01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.369
- Doesn't Chan Sung have it?
- The key went in.

2487
01:32:22.409 --> 01:32:23.670
I don't think it'll open.

2488
01:32:23.670 --> 01:32:28.310
(Is this key the Master Key?)

2489
01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:36.890
It unlocked.

2490
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.819
(Chan Sung has
the Master Key indeed.)

2491
01:32:40.819 --> 01:32:41.859
Was it you?

2492
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:45.029
(Frustrated)

2493
01:32:45.329 --> 01:32:48.829
(It was Chan Sung
who had the other Master Key.)

2494
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:55.239
We can find out one person
who has the Master Key.

2495
01:32:55.239 --> 01:32:56.310
Who could have it?

2496
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:58.579
- How about...
- It could be one of us.

2497
01:32:58.609 --> 01:32:59.609
We have a chance card.

2498
01:32:59.609 --> 01:33:01.079
- It could be one of us.
- We have a chance card.

2499
01:33:01.710 --> 01:33:02.880
(He looks at him.)

2500
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:07.479
- Does the other team have it?
- That's it.

2501
01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.750
(Chan Sung tries to persuade them.)

2502
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:10.250
That's it.

2503
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:11.590
There's one suspicious person.

2504
01:33:11.659 --> 01:33:15.460
Does someone on the other team
have the Master Key or not?

2505
01:33:15.789 --> 01:33:17.789
Is this key the Master Key?

2506
01:33:18.399 --> 01:33:20.699
(In front of the podium
in Room of Fate)

2507
01:33:20.699 --> 01:33:23.500
(He checks if it's the Master Key.)

2508
01:33:26.069 --> 01:33:27.100
It's up.

2509
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:31.779
(He gets surprised by
an unexpected result.)

2510
01:33:33.079 --> 01:33:36.880
(His red ears make it obvious.)

2511
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:39.149
- Do you have it?
- No, I don't.

2512
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:40.279
We guessed one right.

2513
01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:43.050
- Everyone suspected him.
- My goodness.

2514
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:44.649
Those who guessed correctly go up.

2515
01:33:44.649 --> 01:33:46.920
- I will.
- Go up.

2516
01:33:47.289 --> 01:33:48.659
- Did you guess correctly?
- Did you?

2517
01:33:48.659 --> 01:33:49.859
No, I didn't.

2518
01:33:49.859 --> 01:33:51.159
Was Eun Hyuk wrong?

2519
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.199
What happened?

2520
01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.569
- Three of you guessed correctly?
- Eun Hyuk.

2521
01:33:55.569 --> 01:33:57.699
- Wait, time out.
- Come on up, Eun Hyuk.

2522
01:33:57.699 --> 01:34:00.100
- I feel pathetic.
- You knew you had it.

2523
01:34:00.399 --> 01:34:03.909
Those who didn't have the Master Key
have priority.

2524
01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.609
As such, Chan Sung is out.

2525
01:34:06.609 --> 01:34:08.409
He's out.

2526
01:34:08.609 --> 01:34:09.880
Thank you for the prize.

2527
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:11.449
- Thank you.
- Chan Sung.

2528
01:34:11.449 --> 01:34:13.979
Chan Sung couldn't protect his key.

2529
01:34:14.279 --> 01:34:15.819
He's eliminated
because he got caught.

2530
01:34:15.819 --> 01:34:17.189
What do you think of Chan Sung?

2531
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:19.989
For two consecutive weeks,

2532
01:34:19.989 --> 01:34:22.329
he made the other members happy.

2533
01:34:23.359 --> 01:34:24.560
Congratulations.

2534
01:34:24.630 --> 01:34:26.260
Aren't you happy to be on our team?

2535
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.859
- Right?
- Yes.

2536
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:29.670
In 1, 2, 3.

2537
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:31.100
(The winners share the prize.)

2538
01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.699
That's incredible.
They get to share it.

2539
01:34:34.399 --> 01:34:35.439
This is great.

2540
01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.569
- Look at those.
- Really?

2541
01:34:37.710 --> 01:34:39.409
- May I take a look?
- Thank you.

2542
01:34:39.409 --> 01:34:41.010
- May I take a look?
- Go ahead.

2543
01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:43.380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2544
01:34:43.649 --> 01:34:46.250
- Congratulations.
- You're the winner of Master Key.

2545
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:47.350
Congratulations.
