<i>[Episode 5]</i>

3
00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:24.138
What is it?

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.621
Joon! What brings you here?

5
00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.432
Joon, why did you do that?

6
00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.411
Am I that much of a joke to you?

7
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:43.834
Don't my words mean anything to you?

8
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.040
What? You're born again?

9
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.110
You want me to believe
that you've changed?

10
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.712
What a joke.
You haven't changed one bit.

11
00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:53.743
A rude jerk to the bone,
third generation rich guy.

12
00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:56.789
A piece of crap third generation bum!

13
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:05.466
I don't want to see you ever again.

14
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:19.905
I have seven million won
left to give you.

15
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.810
<i>[Mom]</i>

16
00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:42.055
Mom, you no longer have a daughter.

17
00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:44.617
I don't have a mom either,
so don't call me.

18
00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:47.995
Sorry, Mom needed it so urgently
that I had no choice.

19
00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:49.805
Even if you really needed it...

20
00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:51.754
You don't know him,
so why would you accept it?

21
00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:55.213
You should know him before
you just take the money.

22
00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:56.765
Why wouldn't I know him?

23
00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:58.861
I've seen the young man
downstairs for years.

24
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:01.149
That means I know him somewhat.

25
00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:05.359
Wait, Mom...

26
00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.578
Who are you talking about?

27
00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:10.557
Was it you?

28
00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:16.157
That 10 million won...
did you give it to her?

29
00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.844
<i>Since you brought it up...</i>

30
00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:24.905
<i>does he possibly like you?</i>

31
00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.828
He never moves away.

32
00:02:26.828 --> 00:02:29.796
It seems odd that
he's stayed there for years.

33
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.093
Kwon Jae Hoon gave it to her?

34
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.973
That 10 million won?

35
00:02:47.388 --> 00:02:49.899
<i>Yes, I gave it to her.</i>

36
00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:56.144
I gave her that 10 million won, okay?

37
00:02:56.144 --> 00:02:58.090
Why would you?

38
00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.318
- Just because.
- Just because?

39
00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:08.306
Yes, just because.
I was worried, okay?

40
00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:11.555
<i>He was worried about me?</i>

41
00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:19.438
Was it possible that...

42
00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:26.435
you were really worried
about my request, right?

43
00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:27.991
What?

44
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.895
Wow! You truly are my friend.

45
00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.508
I didn't even know
and tried all sorts of things.

46
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:40.406
What is that 10 million won
that it is so hard to get?

47
00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.450
You know, Jae Hoon?

48
00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:46.087
You really are the best.

49
00:03:46.087 --> 00:03:50.186
Thank you so much. Really, my friend.

50
00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:58.950
<i>I'll make sure to pay you back
for that 10 million won.</i>

51
00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:02.948
- How?
- Huh?

52
00:04:02.948 --> 00:04:06.387
You got kicked out of your house and
your mom, Se Na, and brother cut you off.

53
00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:10.367
They've been ordered by the CEO
to completely keep you cut off.

54
00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:14.165
How will you manage
to pay off that 10 million won?

55
00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:16.776
I will worry about that, my friend.

56
00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:21.557
No matter what I have to do,
I just need to pay you back, right?

57
00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:23.187
- Oh yeah?
- Yes, of course.

58
00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:25.637
Then pay me within the month.

59
00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:29.237
Okay.

60
00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:31.896
Within the month? That quickly?

61
00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:36.127
If you can't pay me back,
I'll charge you interest for late days.

62
00:04:36.127 --> 00:04:38.538
<i>What? Interest?</i>

63
00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:40.451
- Did you say interest?
- Yes, interest.

64
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:42.588
You stingy jerk!

65
00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:58.338
Hey, did Joon hear all that?

66
00:04:58.338 --> 00:05:02.428
Didn't she just say "stingy jerk"?

67
00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:05.838
You should pay living expenses too.

68
00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:08.057
For electricity and water too.

69
00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:11.286
Also, you have to pay half the rent.

70
00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:15.439
Why are you suddenly being this way,
like a stingy jerk?

71
00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.867
Because I am a stingy jerk.

72
00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.375
I'm going to take all the payments,
so know that.

73
00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:26.415
What is this?

74
00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.620
Yeah, I thought so.

75
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.040
Kwon Jae Hoon is so selfish.
He would never do something for me.

76
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.992
Interest? What a stingy jerk!

77
00:05:38.992 --> 00:05:40.975
My goodness.

78
00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:07.581
<i>Just endure it even if
you want to spend money.</i>

79
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:09.124
It's not that I want to spend it.

80
00:06:09.124 --> 00:06:10.949
You have to show that you are reflecting.

81
00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.427
Then I have cause to go persuade Father.

82
00:06:14.427 --> 00:06:16.786
I told you I like someone,
so Woo Sung...

83
00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:18.298
I know.

84
00:06:18.298 --> 00:06:21.550
I know. It's very hard, right?

85
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.593
You used to spend tens of million of
won a night, so you must be dying now.

86
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.723
Here's some allowance for you.

87
00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:37.848
I have a lunch appointment,
so I'll get going.

88
00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:40.961
Be good. See you next time.

89
00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.091
This isn't it.

90
00:07:03.447 --> 00:07:07.139
I used to spend
tens of millions of won a night.

91
00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.764
I didn't know it was
so much money back then.

92
00:07:26.242 --> 00:07:29.125
When will I repay all that money?

93
00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:44.067
<i>Go to work at 4:30 a.m.?</i>

94
00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:45.641
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

95
00:08:58.768 --> 00:09:00.572
<i>What is this?</i>

96
00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:03.780
<i>There are so many people
awake at this hour.</i>

97
00:09:19.104 --> 00:09:20.897
Oh, hello.

98
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.148
All right, five people!

99
00:09:29.148 --> 00:09:32.423
Okay! One, two, three...

100
00:09:32.423 --> 00:09:33.466
Hey, be careful.

101
00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:35.154
Four, and five.

102
00:09:35.154 --> 00:09:37.557
That's all. Get going!

103
00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:39.038
Go!

104
00:09:39.038 --> 00:09:42.037
Three people here!

105
00:09:42.037 --> 00:09:45.669
- Me, me!
- I will go!

106
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.618
<i>What is this place?</i>

107
00:09:56.618 --> 00:09:59.817
<i>Is this really the Seoul
I've been living in?</i>

108
00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:03.238
Joon... Joon!

109
00:10:03.238 --> 00:10:04.428
Where is Joon?

110
00:10:04.428 --> 00:10:06.543
Hey, what's your specialty?

111
00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:07.897
What's your skill?

112
00:10:07.897 --> 00:10:10.408
- I don't have anything like that.
- Ah, just miscellaneous?

113
00:10:10.408 --> 00:10:13.225
No, I'm here to find my girlfriend.

114
00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:16.311
Girl? Why? Did she cheat on you?

115
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:17.447
Or did she take your money?

116
00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:18.695
It's not like that.

117
00:10:18.695 --> 00:10:20.528
Oh, she got sold off.

118
00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:23.296
What? Sold off?

119
00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:25.179
There are many people like you.

120
00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:26.591
All right, five people!

121
00:10:26.591 --> 00:10:28.658
- Me, me!
- Me, me, me!

122
00:10:28.658 --> 00:10:32.784
One, two, three, four...
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

123
00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:34.807
Joon, over here.

124
00:10:34.807 --> 00:10:36.509
Hello.

125
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:40.158
- I heard about the job. Where is it?
- Huh?

126
00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:41.967
Mister Kim is talking to the manager.

127
00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:45.628
Even if the daily pay is not high,
we want to do something stable.

128
00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:47.474
It should be about five months.

129
00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:50.073
Yes, so about five months straight.

130
00:11:01.947 --> 00:11:04.423
Hey, what are you doing here?

131
00:11:04.423 --> 00:11:06.283
Joon, you can't.
Don't get in there.

132
00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:07.926
What are you saying,
showing up so suddenly?

133
00:11:07.926 --> 00:11:11.224
I can't let you be sold.
I won't ever allow it.

134
00:11:11.224 --> 00:11:14.486
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me go! Let go!

135
00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:16.121
What's so important about 10 million won?

136
00:11:16.121 --> 00:11:18.207
Don't do this. Don't do it.

137
00:11:18.207 --> 00:11:20.615
Don't ruin your life like this!

138
00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:22.480
Move! Get away from me.

139
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.518
I'll repay it. I'll pay it back for you.

140
00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:27.010
So, Joon... Joon...

141
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.730
What are you two doing?

142
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.035
Are you two filming a movie?

143
00:11:30.035 --> 00:11:32.302
What's the genre? Romance or comedy?

144
00:11:32.302 --> 00:11:35.142
Can't you tell? It's romance.

145
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.181
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?

146
00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:41.928
- You weren't getting sold off?
- Sold?

147
00:11:41.928 --> 00:11:43.071
To whom? Where to? Why?

148
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:45.051
- This man over there said...
- Cut.

149
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:46.751
This isn't romance. It's a documentary.

150
00:11:46.751 --> 00:11:49.414
Catch the girlfriend
who's being sold off.

151
00:11:49.414 --> 00:11:54.043
What is this, so early in the morning?

152
00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:56.364
Gosh.

153
00:11:56.364 --> 00:11:58.644
Take me too if you're going.

154
00:11:58.644 --> 00:12:00.520
Where do you think you're going?

155
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.261
Wherever you're going,
I'm going if you're going.

156
00:12:03.261 --> 00:12:04.432
You'll regret it.

157
00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:07.481
There's no such thing as regret
if I'm with you.

158
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:10.621
This works out since
we were short a member.

159
00:12:10.621 --> 00:12:11.831
No, Madam Ahn.

160
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.962
Hey, now. What do you mean, no?

161
00:12:13.962 --> 00:12:15.792
What do you mean though, Madam Ahn?

162
00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:17.942
We were short one person.

163
00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:21.201
The company wanted five people.

164
00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:25.102
Oh, is that right? That's great.
Three, four, and five including me.

165
00:12:25.102 --> 00:12:26.621
Get out while I'm being nice.

166
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.701
Don't be like that
and let's take him with us, Joon.

167
00:12:28.701 --> 00:12:32.115
No, I got fired from the hotel and
the construction site because of him.

168
00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:35.226
We shouldn't get mixed up with him.

169
00:12:35.226 --> 00:12:37.677
You all saw how I got
kicked out in the nude, right?

170
00:12:37.677 --> 00:12:40.866
I need money. I have to earn on my own.

171
00:12:40.866 --> 00:12:42.557
Please take me.

172
00:12:42.557 --> 00:12:44.596
I told you to get out now.

173
00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:46.317
I said I'm going to go.

174
00:12:46.317 --> 00:12:49.355
Why don't we take a vote, then?

175
00:12:49.355 --> 00:12:50.761
- I say yes.
- Mister Kim!

176
00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:52.214
- Me too.
- Madam Ahn!

177
00:12:52.214 --> 00:12:54.293
- Me too.
- Me too!

178
00:12:54.293 --> 00:12:55.678
That's four votes of "yes".

179
00:12:55.678 --> 00:12:57.740
A "no" wouldn't matter.
That's done.

180
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.562
- Hey!
- Let's go, driver.

181
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.484
Where are we going and what's the job?

182
00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:10.760
Building cleaning.

183
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.447
Building cleaning? Where?

184
00:13:29.554 --> 00:13:30.803
Why here of all places?

185
00:13:30.803 --> 00:13:36.408
Yes, it's here of all places.

186
00:13:36.408 --> 00:13:39.274
We ended up at
a better place than I imagined.

187
00:13:39.274 --> 00:13:42.418
Why? Why? How? For what reason?

188
00:13:42.418 --> 00:13:44.148
We came here through an agency.

189
00:13:44.148 --> 00:13:45.937
We just went where they told us to.

190
00:13:45.937 --> 00:13:49.076
How can that be?
Is this some sort of job fraud?

191
00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:51.357
What? You can't do it?

192
00:13:51.357 --> 00:13:53.736
When did I say I can't do it?

193
00:13:53.736 --> 00:13:58.672
I was just a slightly taken aback
because it's my father's company.

194
00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:01.734
Then how come you can't go in
and you're standing there?

195
00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:05.009
I don't know, Joon.
Why am I like this?

196
00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:07.756
Joon, why am I acting like this?

197
00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:15.129
My name is Kwon Jae Hoon.
Let's work well together.

198
00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:19.418
Let's work well together.

199
00:14:20.376 --> 00:14:23.376
Welcome.

200
00:14:31.525 --> 00:14:34.149
<i>Move into Strategic Planning today.</i>

201
00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:36.212
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

202
00:14:36.212 --> 00:14:39.373
I promised you that.

203
00:14:39.373 --> 00:14:44.304
In return, I need to know what
Managing Director Seol is up to.

204
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:48.600
You understand what I mean, right?

205
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.136
Let's work well together,
Director Seol.

206
00:15:03.863 --> 00:15:06.434
All right, then.
Let's work, everyone.

207
00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:09.326
Goodbye, Director Seol.

208
00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:12.649
- Did he get in through connections?
- Yes, he did.

209
00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:15.043
- He has connections.
- Yes.

210
00:15:15.043 --> 00:15:17.251
What about Section Chief Yang?

211
00:15:32.493 --> 00:15:34.010
What are you going to say?

212
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.041
What is there to say?

213
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.250
What are you doing?
Hurry up and come on out.

214
00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:45.809
This isn't right.

215
00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:47.909
Do I have to wear this?

216
00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:50.206
Why? Are you embarrassed?

217
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.759
I'm not embarrassed.

218
00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:56.649
What if someone recognizes me?

219
00:15:56.649 --> 00:16:00.360
I was someone who took photos
in front of the prosecutor's office.

220
00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:02.995
I am my father's son.

221
00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:04.432
Should we make a bet?

222
00:16:04.432 --> 00:16:08.650
I bet you 10,000 won
that no one recognizes you.

223
00:16:10.294 --> 00:16:11.849
Really.

224
00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.931
Wait up.

225
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:43.350
You see. He recognized me right away.

226
00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:46.418
Yes, it is me.

227
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.505
How unlikely for
a young punk to do this job.

228
00:16:53.883 --> 00:16:57.101
You don't have any sort of
physical defects, do you?

229
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:01.378
Of course not. He is very fit.

230
00:17:02.951 --> 00:17:07.825
I won't say this twice,
so everyone focus and listen.

231
00:17:07.825 --> 00:17:11.019
Get here on time and
if any rascal doesn't work their hours

232
00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:13.308
they'll get demerit points and
it'll affect the next contract.

233
00:17:13.308 --> 00:17:14.873
So, don't complain later.

234
00:17:14.873 --> 00:17:17.428
You'll be in charge of
floors 7, 8, 9, and 10.

235
00:17:17.428 --> 00:17:19.698
Clean the offices, restrooms,
hallways, and so on.

236
00:17:19.698 --> 00:17:22.847
You must take care of it all,
especially the 8th floor men's restroom.

237
00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:25.107
The third stall toilet
clogs easily and overflows

238
00:17:25.107 --> 00:17:27.368
if you don't see to it promptly.

239
00:17:27.368 --> 00:17:28.998
That's all!

240
00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.760
What are you doing?

241
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.364
Why aren't you all
running along to go work?

242
00:17:37.364 --> 00:17:41.845
Excuse me, could you be
careful with your words?

243
00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:46.290
We are employees who provide labor
and get paid fairly for our work.

244
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.193
Using words like "punk"
or "rascal" to describe us...

245
00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:52.650
I would appreciate it
if you refrained from that.

246
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.500
What's with this crazy wench?

247
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.511
I'm not crazy or a wench.

248
00:17:56.511 --> 00:17:58.721
My name is Baek Joon and
I'm this group's team leader.

249
00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:01.856
So, please refer to me as
Team Leader Baek Joon.

250
00:18:01.856 --> 00:18:04.086
That would work for me.

251
00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:06.665
So, we are in charge of
floors 7, 8, 9, and 10.

252
00:18:06.665 --> 00:18:08.978
Let's gather our strength
and go work today.

253
00:18:08.978 --> 00:18:10.507
Let's go!

254
00:18:14.217 --> 00:18:16.672
That... that...

255
00:18:16.672 --> 00:18:18.465
Excuse me.

256
00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:21.434
Do you really not know who I am?

257
00:18:23.057 --> 00:18:24.912
Who are you!

258
00:18:33.439 --> 00:18:36.570
That man probably never watches the news.

259
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.398
Anyone who is cultured and knows
current events would know me, right?

260
00:18:40.398 --> 00:18:42.647
Yes, yes. Sure.

261
00:18:42.647 --> 00:18:44.452
Excuse me!

262
00:18:44.452 --> 00:18:46.262
Yes?

263
00:18:47.721 --> 00:18:51.486
See? Finally, someone recognizes me.

264
00:18:52.586 --> 00:18:53.609
Yes, it's me.

265
00:18:53.609 --> 00:18:55.910
You see these empty cups
in this potted plant?

266
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.931
Please clean them up.

267
00:18:56.931 --> 00:18:59.253
Yes, we will.

268
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.950
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

269
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.109
Someone spilled coffee by the elevator.
Can you clean it up?

270
00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:09.403
We'll take care of it soon.

271
00:19:26.921 --> 00:19:28.358
<i>What is this?</i>

272
00:19:28.358 --> 00:19:32.342
<i>How come no one recognizes me?</i>

273
00:19:38.397 --> 00:19:42.920
<i>It's like we're in the same place,
but I'm in a different dimension.</i>

274
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.346
<i>They are not aware of me.</i>

275
00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:51.355
Once you put on this uniform,
your face disappears.

276
00:19:51.355 --> 00:19:55.644
To put it simply,
it's like an invisibility cloak.

277
00:19:55.644 --> 00:19:56.674
An invisibility cloak?

278
00:19:56.674 --> 00:19:59.445
Why are you acting
as if you never did it?

279
00:19:59.445 --> 00:20:00.928
Follow me.

280
00:20:57.151 --> 00:21:01.409
<i>Now that I was in a different position,
I started to see it.</i>

281
00:21:02.253 --> 00:21:04.396
<i>It wasn't so obvious.</i>

282
00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:08.556
<i>But the discriminatory way people
looked at you definitely existed.</i>

283
00:21:08.556 --> 00:21:11.695
Everyone, come over here. Come here.

284
00:21:11.695 --> 00:21:12.769
All right.

285
00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:16.759
Oh no. You can stay seated.

286
00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:19.930
Hey, that's funny.

287
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.739
- Is that you?
- It is.

288
00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.953
- It's Manager Kim, right?
- Yes, it is.

289
00:21:23.953 --> 00:21:26.166
- How insane.
- What's with you, Manager Kim?

290
00:21:26.166 --> 00:21:28.898
- Who did this?
- It was Sang Hyun.

291
00:21:28.898 --> 00:21:33.497
<i>Only a person being discriminated against
could know this strange alienation.</i>

292
00:21:58.935 --> 00:22:01.107
It is you, Joon.

293
00:22:01.871 --> 00:22:03.751
Hello.

294
00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:06.121
I thought I was mistaken at first.

295
00:22:13.136 --> 00:22:16.317
You were selling smoothies before.
When did you switch to cleaning?

296
00:22:16.317 --> 00:22:20.175
I know. It just worked out that way.

297
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:23.234
Things aren't hard for you?

298
00:22:23.234 --> 00:22:26.578
No, what isn't hard in this world?

299
00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:28.670
We just hold on and do it.

300
00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:35.541
Don't worry too much.
I'm living very well.

301
00:22:37.462 --> 00:22:39.324
All right.

302
00:22:41.888 --> 00:22:45.159
I should get back to work.

303
00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:20.510
Manager Baek.

304
00:23:21.051 --> 00:23:25.467
I'm sorry I could not protect you.

305
00:23:26.123 --> 00:23:28.468
I'm sorry.

306
00:24:45.506 --> 00:24:48.983
Oh, what is this? Oh!

307
00:24:48.983 --> 00:24:51.580
What do I do?

308
00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:56.317
Joon, there's big trouble!

309
00:24:56.317 --> 00:24:59.625
Big trouble! It's an emergency!
An emergency!

310
00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:01.134
Joon... Joon!

311
00:25:01.134 --> 00:25:03.777
Oh, this is insane. What do I do?

312
00:25:03.777 --> 00:25:05.428
- Joon, Joon!
- The pizza is good.

313
00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:08.728
- Yes.
- There are so many people though.

314
00:25:16.537 --> 00:25:18.292
- It's so good.
- Oh, really?

315
00:25:18.292 --> 00:25:20.189
I should go.

316
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.297
What is this smell in here?

317
00:25:29.297 --> 00:25:30.773
It smells like sesame oil.

318
00:25:30.773 --> 00:25:34.709
How insane.
Someone must be eating kimbap in here.

319
00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:57.529
Wasn't she delivering smoothies
a little while ago?

320
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:59.443
Yes, what's she doing here?

321
00:25:59.443 --> 00:26:00.727
I don't know.

322
00:26:02.075 --> 00:26:05.094
Isn't cleaning restrooms a bit too much?

323
00:26:05.094 --> 00:26:07.273
It must pay more.

324
00:26:37.388 --> 00:26:40.988
Hey! Why are you in the women's restroom?

325
00:26:40.988 --> 00:26:42.132
Are you really a pervert?

326
00:26:42.132 --> 00:26:44.003
No, no, no.

327
00:26:44.003 --> 00:26:46.307
I had a reason for coming, Joon.

328
00:26:46.307 --> 00:26:48.885
Reason? What reason is that?

329
00:26:52.925 --> 00:26:55.596
This is the problematic toilet
in the third stall?

330
00:26:55.596 --> 00:26:56.935
What should I do?

331
00:26:56.935 --> 00:26:58.942
Should I bring in a professional?

332
00:26:58.942 --> 00:27:00.750
How about Mister Kim or Mister Lee?

333
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.431
- 100,000 won.
- 100,000 won?

334
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:03.432
For what?

335
00:27:03.432 --> 00:27:05.971
I'll do this for you,
so subtract 100,000 won for me.

336
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:07.675
Subtract 100,000 won? What do you mean?

337
00:27:07.675 --> 00:27:10.314
I already paid back 3 million won
of the 10 million won.

338
00:27:10.314 --> 00:27:13.288
You owe me 5 million won
for the escape from the hotel.

339
00:27:13.288 --> 00:27:15.617
Subtract 100,000 won from the
remaining 2 million won I owe.

340
00:27:15.617 --> 00:27:18.377
You can do this yourself?

341
00:27:41.105 --> 00:27:42.528
I'm going in.

342
00:28:03.875 --> 00:28:06.448
The sound of that flush.

343
00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:09.719
Did you see that?

344
00:28:09.719 --> 00:28:11.887
Push, pop, push, pop, push, push, pop.

345
00:28:11.887 --> 00:28:13.166
Then pop!

346
00:28:24.037 --> 00:28:26.767
You don't need to be good at this.

347
00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:29.577
It just makes my heart ache.

348
00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:32.357
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

349
00:28:32.357 --> 00:28:34.752
Bye, everyone. Goodbye!

350
00:28:34.752 --> 00:28:36.986
Get home safe, everyone. Goodbye.

351
00:28:36.986 --> 00:28:39.061
- Good work.
- Good work, everyone.

352
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:40.846
Good job, everyone.

353
00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:42.914
Bye. Good job.

354
00:28:42.914 --> 00:28:44.935
- Goodbye.
- Good work.

355
00:28:44.935 --> 00:28:47.095
Good job.

356
00:28:47.095 --> 00:28:49.057
- Good job.
- Manager.

357
00:28:49.057 --> 00:28:52.373
See you tomorrow. Thank you.

358
00:28:52.373 --> 00:28:53.869
Thanks.

359
00:28:54.637 --> 00:28:56.997
He's so petty.

360
00:28:56.997 --> 00:28:59.047
So, how was work?

361
00:28:59.047 --> 00:29:02.451
I think it's actually much better here.

362
00:29:02.451 --> 00:29:04.736
It's a hundred and
a thousand times better.

363
00:29:04.736 --> 00:29:06.348
<i>Joon.</i>

364
00:29:07.324 --> 00:29:08.912
<i>Are you really okay?</i>

365
00:29:08.912 --> 00:29:11.390
It's all thanks to Joon.

366
00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:38.884
<i>Are you truly all right?</i>

367
00:29:38.884 --> 00:29:41.493
What I do is not what's important.

368
00:29:41.493 --> 00:29:44.634
Isn't it how I live that's important?

369
00:29:44.634 --> 00:29:47.566
How you live is more important?

370
00:29:47.566 --> 00:29:51.877
It's up to the individual to
find confidence in what they do.

371
00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:57.340
<i>You pretended to be
so strong in your words.</i>

372
00:30:04.884 --> 00:30:08.880
<i>Honestly... it's hard
for you too, isn't it?</i>

373
00:30:28.659 --> 00:30:30.019
<i>He likes you.</i>

374
00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:31.660
Likes me? Who?

375
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.670
That third generation rich punk.

376
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.481
Who does he like?

377
00:30:35.481 --> 00:30:37.928
You, of course.

378
00:30:38.618 --> 00:30:42.009
Ha Yeon Hee,
just eat your spicy rice cakes.

379
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.670
I'm telling you I'm right.

380
00:30:58.694 --> 00:31:01.926
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E05 Revolutionary Love</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

381
00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:11.935
It doesn't make sense, otherwise.

382
00:31:11.935 --> 00:31:14.497
He's the third generation son
of Gangsu Group.

383
00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:16.967
Why would he be doing a job cleaning?

384
00:31:16.967 --> 00:31:19.578
Especially at his company,
near his dad, at that.

385
00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:21.968
I told you that he got kicked out
without any money.

386
00:31:21.968 --> 00:31:23.619
He needs to earn money.

387
00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:26.318
No, it's because he likes you.

388
00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:28.406
I told you that's not why.

389
00:31:28.406 --> 00:31:30.720
Even turning himself into the prosecutor.

390
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.346
That's because he did something wrong.

391
00:31:33.346 --> 00:31:36.066
Then, what about the 10 million won?

392
00:31:38.135 --> 00:31:39.796
Well, that's...

393
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:45.241
He must've felt sorry for me
since he's on an elite level.

394
00:31:47.136 --> 00:31:50.894
"Joon made me into a human being."

395
00:31:51.482 --> 00:31:54.565
You had to see to the look
in his eye at that moment.

396
00:31:56.231 --> 00:31:58.811
I'm going to eat it all if you don't.

397
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:00.291
That's total nonsense.

398
00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:02.405
It does make sense.

399
00:32:04.515 --> 00:32:06.192
By the way...

400
00:32:06.192 --> 00:32:10.074
how is that arrogant jerk
Kwon Jae Hoon doing lately?

401
00:32:10.074 --> 00:32:13.045
He's taking great care
of himself, of course.

402
00:32:13.045 --> 00:32:14.780
He's in the
Strategic Planning department.

403
00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.144
Really?

404
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.194
I guess he's pretty talented.

405
00:32:20.194 --> 00:32:23.922
Well, he seems
to work himself to death.

406
00:32:23.922 --> 00:32:27.292
He would feel very wronged
if he didn't succeed.

407
00:32:27.292 --> 00:32:28.615
Right, Joon?

408
00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:32.967
I guess so.

409
00:33:08.813 --> 00:33:11.372
What is it? Is something going on?

410
00:33:11.372 --> 00:33:14.296
Oh, no. Nothing really.

411
00:33:16.382 --> 00:33:20.903
What do you have to do to
eat in your company's cafeteria?

412
00:33:20.903 --> 00:33:22.265
You need a meal ticket.

413
00:33:22.265 --> 00:33:23.760
A meal ticket?

414
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.311
Where do you get that?

415
00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:27.740
There's a machine that sells them
in front of the cafeteria.

416
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:32.336
Oh, really? It's that simple.

417
00:33:34.085 --> 00:33:35.710
Why are you suddenly asking?

418
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.701
It's nothing really.

419
00:33:39.349 --> 00:33:40.790
Get to work.

420
00:33:42.193 --> 00:33:44.595
Hey, are those my clothes?

421
00:33:49.349 --> 00:33:50.667
Hey!

422
00:33:55.556 --> 00:33:57.619
Hey, you...

423
00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:02.748
Don't use the third stall in the
8th floor restroom if you don't need to.

424
00:34:07.586 --> 00:34:09.315
What's he saying?

425
00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:32.891
What is this? How does this work?

426
00:34:33.523 --> 00:34:36.847
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

427
00:34:36.847 --> 00:34:40.422
I was trying to buy this.
How does it work?

428
00:35:01.628 --> 00:35:03.942
What is this? Why isn't it coming out?

429
00:35:06.518 --> 00:35:09.896
Of course it wouldn't come out.
We're not employees here.

430
00:35:09.896 --> 00:35:11.105
What is that?

431
00:35:11.105 --> 00:35:14.302
We work in this building too.

432
00:35:14.302 --> 00:35:16.932
We are contracted employees.

433
00:35:16.932 --> 00:35:18.701
We don't work for Gangsu Group.

434
00:35:18.701 --> 00:35:24.411
So, only Gangsu Group employees
can eat in the cafeteria.

435
00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:27.811
Only people with a Gangsu Group
ID can buy the meal tickets.

436
00:35:27.811 --> 00:35:29.376
Understand, Young Master?

437
00:35:29.376 --> 00:35:31.061
Oh...

438
00:35:56.639 --> 00:35:58.121
<i>[Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

439
00:36:12.817 --> 00:36:14.047
What are you doing?

440
00:36:14.047 --> 00:36:16.497
What are you doing
with my employee ID?

441
00:36:16.497 --> 00:36:20.167
What would I do with it?
I was just looking at it.

442
00:36:20.167 --> 00:36:24.317
I was curious about what an
employee ID looked like and envied you.

443
00:36:24.317 --> 00:36:25.928
Are you satisfied?

444
00:36:26.689 --> 00:36:28.565
I'm so thirsty.

445
00:36:42.736 --> 00:36:44.575
What are you doing?

446
00:36:46.218 --> 00:36:50.212
Nothing, Jae Hoon. Good night.

447
00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:11.803
Aren't you going to sleep?

448
00:37:13.245 --> 00:37:14.870
Yes.

449
00:37:16.047 --> 00:37:18.513
I just wanted some water, Jae Hoon.

450
00:38:09.672 --> 00:38:12.125
What the heck are you planning to do?

451
00:38:24.437 --> 00:38:26.075
Kwon Jae Hoon!

452
00:38:29.355 --> 00:38:31.549
Are you going to work?

453
00:38:32.509 --> 00:38:34.200
What about Hyuk?

454
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.330
Why do you need Hyuk?

455
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.382
Didn't you know?

456
00:38:36.382 --> 00:38:39.359
We've been going to
work together, cleaning.

457
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.239
You're even cleaning now?

458
00:38:41.239 --> 00:38:43.908
Why do you insist on doing hard jobs?

459
00:38:43.908 --> 00:38:46.643
Why not just stick to
delivering those smoothies?

460
00:38:46.643 --> 00:38:49.980
I couldn't meet the sales quotas
and I got fired.

461
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.082
You ignored me when I needed sales,
so what is this now?

462
00:38:53.082 --> 00:38:56.143
Stop being stubborn
and get a stable job.

463
00:38:56.143 --> 00:38:58.332
Should I look into it for you?

464
00:38:58.332 --> 00:39:00.870
- Stop. That's enough.
- Baek Joon.

465
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:04.232
Whatever the case, thank you.

466
00:39:04.714 --> 00:39:07.183
For the money you gave to my mom...

467
00:39:09.654 --> 00:39:13.029
Even if Hyuk asked you,
that's a lot of money.

468
00:39:13.029 --> 00:39:14.922
You're not usually one to do that.

469
00:39:14.922 --> 00:39:18.098
It's not like Hyuk's in
a position to pay you back now.

470
00:39:19.274 --> 00:39:21.339
He'll probably pay me back
many times over later.

471
00:39:21.339 --> 00:39:25.397
In the long term,
it's not a bad investment.

472
00:39:27.171 --> 00:39:29.152
I suppose so.

473
00:39:29.152 --> 00:39:32.565
Hyuk's father is the group's CEO
and his brother is a chief there.

474
00:39:32.565 --> 00:39:34.480
Hyuk may look like that now.

475
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.254
Someday, he will be
someone big in that company.

476
00:39:38.254 --> 00:39:43.256
Wow, Kwon Jae Hoon,
you really can think ahead.

477
00:39:45.093 --> 00:39:48.870
Byun Hyuk, hey! Hurry up and come out.

478
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:10.812
How is Hyuk doing lately?

479
00:40:10.812 --> 00:40:12.884
Has he contacted you, by chance?

480
00:40:12.884 --> 00:40:15.942
I didn't want to say anything
in case Father worried.

481
00:40:15.942 --> 00:40:18.312
Why? What is it?

482
00:40:18.312 --> 00:40:23.040
Hyuk came to the company recently
and asked me for some money.

483
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.361
So, did you give him some?

484
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:28.002
- Why didn't you give him some?
- Hey!

485
00:40:28.002 --> 00:40:31.098
The one thing he can't
live without is money.

486
00:40:31.098 --> 00:40:33.344
He even went to his
older brother for money.

487
00:40:33.344 --> 00:40:36.080
That must mean he's in
a dire situation, Honey.

488
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.788
I don't think that's it.

489
00:40:37.788 --> 00:40:41.727
It seems he's fallen for some woman
and can't get his head on straight.

490
00:40:41.727 --> 00:40:45.265
What? Hyuk has a new girlfriend?

491
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.647
What kind of woman?

492
00:40:48.647 --> 00:40:49.901
I didn't ask him that.

493
00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:51.330
You should've asked.

494
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.241
What kind of woman, how did they meet,
and what does she look like?

495
00:40:54.241 --> 00:40:55.960
Be quiet.

496
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.671
What a pathetic fellow
to think of girls in this situation.

497
00:41:00.689 --> 00:41:02.658
Father.

498
00:41:02.658 --> 00:41:05.921
I think he needs more time to grow up.

499
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:09.151
Gosh. I just don't know.

500
00:41:24.931 --> 00:41:27.502
Oh, that punk Jae Hoon.

501
00:41:27.502 --> 00:41:29.651
When did he manage to take that out?

502
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:34.049
I just wanted to give Joon
a meal from the cafeteria.

503
00:41:35.732 --> 00:41:37.511
Excuse me!

504
00:41:50.953 --> 00:41:53.480
Today is the day
we shred and discard documents.

505
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.908
Thank you, then.

506
00:42:00.136 --> 00:42:02.263
Wow!

507
00:42:54.714 --> 00:42:56.518
Good work.

508
00:43:03.413 --> 00:43:05.281
Look here, pretty pink lady.

509
00:43:05.281 --> 00:43:08.484
I cleaned up all the documents,
so you can take a look.

510
00:43:08.484 --> 00:43:10.904
Yes, thank you.

511
00:43:24.428 --> 00:43:26.538
What are you doing?

512
00:43:26.538 --> 00:43:30.446
Even if my job makes me
invisible to you...

513
00:43:30.446 --> 00:43:34.841
when you take a person for their work,
you should look them in the face.

514
00:43:34.841 --> 00:43:37.517
That is good manners
and the right thing to do, okay?

515
00:43:37.517 --> 00:43:42.000
You and I are both people
getting paid and doing a job.

516
00:43:42.504 --> 00:43:46.504
Also, you should watch
current events news.

517
00:43:46.504 --> 00:43:48.538
Currents events news.

518
00:43:52.623 --> 00:43:55.196
What is Section Chief Kwon is up to?

519
00:44:02.772 --> 00:44:04.687
Excuse me.

520
00:44:10.149 --> 00:44:12.906
Uh... thank you.

521
00:44:13.457 --> 00:44:15.176
Do you really mean it?

522
00:44:15.176 --> 00:44:17.547
- What?
- Are you really thankful?

523
00:44:17.547 --> 00:44:19.935
Yes, well...

524
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:29.892
Then... please do me a favor.

525
00:44:29.892 --> 00:44:31.348
What?

526
00:44:35.299 --> 00:44:37.011
That.

527
00:44:41.071 --> 00:44:42.301
What are these?

528
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:44.551
Can't you see? Meal tickets.

529
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:46.660
Yes, so what should we do with them?

530
00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.685
What else? We should go eat.

531
00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:51.344
A cafeteria meal. Let's go.

532
00:45:06.343 --> 00:45:08.774
Did Kwon Jae Hoon
give you those meal tickets?

533
00:45:08.774 --> 00:45:14.315
Hey, now. These are sacred meal tickets
that I earned through my hard work.

534
00:45:15.634 --> 00:45:18.243
Still, you didn't need to do this.

535
00:45:18.243 --> 00:45:19.803
Don't worry about it.

536
00:45:19.803 --> 00:45:24.384
We're wearing invisibility cloaks,
so no one can see us, right?

537
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:29.350
You should've gotten some for Madam Ahn,
Mister Kim, and Mister Lee too.

538
00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.111
Ah, I should have.

539
00:45:32.111 --> 00:45:34.705
Nonetheless, I'll enjoy the meal.

540
00:45:54.373 --> 00:45:56.223
Why aren't you eating?

541
00:45:56.223 --> 00:45:59.823
Okay, let's eat. Eat up.

542
00:46:00.636 --> 00:46:02.265
Hey!

543
00:46:03.053 --> 00:46:05.325
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

544
00:46:05.325 --> 00:46:07.837
Manager, what do you think you're doing?

545
00:46:07.837 --> 00:46:09.763
Why are you eating out here?

546
00:46:09.763 --> 00:46:11.886
Service workers are
not allowed in the cafeteria.

547
00:46:11.886 --> 00:46:15.325
What kind of rule is that?
You can eat if you have a meal ticket.

548
00:46:15.325 --> 00:46:17.102
Let go of me and talk.

549
00:46:17.102 --> 00:46:20.547
Joon, don't worry about it, and eat.

550
00:46:20.547 --> 00:46:23.094
Enough of the nonsense.
Get up now unless you want to get fired.

551
00:46:23.094 --> 00:46:26.901
We got so many complaint calls
because of you two.

552
00:46:26.901 --> 00:46:29.268
Complaint calls?

553
00:46:29.268 --> 00:46:32.323
- From whom?
- Joon.

554
00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:35.580
Who complained when
I was just eating my meal?

555
00:46:38.002 --> 00:46:40.044
I told you to do it.

556
00:46:40.044 --> 00:46:43.334
- Really, really?
- Someone believed that?

557
00:46:44.841 --> 00:46:46.855
- That scoundrel.
- It's true.

558
00:46:46.855 --> 00:46:49.835
If only that were true...

559
00:46:53.272 --> 00:46:54.346
What's going on?

560
00:46:54.346 --> 00:46:57.995
Is there a law that cleaning service
employees can't eat in here?

561
00:46:57.995 --> 00:46:59.576
Is it in Gangsu Group's company rules?

562
00:46:59.576 --> 00:47:02.254
Bring it out if it is.

563
00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:06.084
Will you two be held responsible
if our contract is terminated?

564
00:47:08.511 --> 00:47:11.995
A terminated contract
over this? How absurd.

565
00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:14.618
We clean up everything
they make a mess out of.

566
00:47:14.618 --> 00:47:16.288
But they won't eat a meal with us.

567
00:47:16.288 --> 00:47:18.946
Who was it? Huh?

568
00:47:18.946 --> 00:47:21.536
What is all this commotion about?

569
00:47:30.393 --> 00:47:32.116
Father?

570
00:47:40.433 --> 00:47:42.270
Father...

571
00:47:43.379 --> 00:47:44.948
You.

572
00:47:44.948 --> 00:47:48.424
You... you little punk.

573
00:47:48.424 --> 00:47:49.482
What should we do?

574
00:47:49.482 --> 00:47:51.107
Joon.

575
00:47:52.417 --> 00:47:53.642
You punk.

576
00:47:53.642 --> 00:47:55.892
What are you doing here, you punk?

577
00:47:55.892 --> 00:47:56.948
Run!

578
00:47:56.948 --> 00:47:59.908
You punks! Catch them!

579
00:47:59.908 --> 00:48:02.832
Catch that punk right now!

580
00:48:34.435 --> 00:48:36.973
Why are we running anyway?

581
00:48:36.973 --> 00:48:40.357
I don't want you see me
get hit by my father.

582
00:48:43.663 --> 00:48:46.084
This won't do, Joon.
Let's split up.

583
00:48:46.084 --> 00:48:48.647
- What?
- We'll both get caught at this rate.

584
00:48:48.647 --> 00:48:52.303
Let's split up.
You go there. I'll go there.

585
00:48:52.303 --> 00:48:54.372
Let's both survive.

586
00:48:54.372 --> 00:48:55.968
Let's go!

587
00:48:57.627 --> 00:49:00.759
Young Master, Young Master, Young Master!

588
00:49:06.267 --> 00:49:09.497
What? Hyuk is at the company?

589
00:49:09.497 --> 00:49:12.413
Ah, that makes no sense.

590
00:49:12.413 --> 00:49:14.848
Why would Hyuk be a cleaner?

591
00:49:14.848 --> 00:49:16.594
I'm sure you saw wrong,
Sister-in-law.

592
00:49:16.594 --> 00:49:20.913
He got caught by my brother
and he was running away.

593
00:49:20.913 --> 00:49:23.433
The company was like a wasteland.

594
00:49:23.433 --> 00:49:26.334
Oh, how embarrassing.

595
00:49:26.334 --> 00:49:29.739
A household couldn't go
under this much embarrassment.

596
00:49:29.739 --> 00:49:32.741
Oh, Hyuk. What is this all about?

597
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:36.261
So, has he been caught?

598
00:49:36.261 --> 00:49:38.747
My goodness.

599
00:49:39.379 --> 00:49:41.339
That rascal.

600
00:49:41.339 --> 00:49:45.453
Only an ignorant person
would embarrass me like this.

601
00:49:54.388 --> 00:49:58.172
How dare he without my permission?

602
00:50:02.507 --> 00:50:04.558
That little jerk.

603
00:50:04.558 --> 00:50:07.879
How dare he crawl...

604
00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:11.908
into my company.

605
00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:15.629
That punk... that bastard.

606
00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:21.134
Let's wait and see.

607
00:50:24.727 --> 00:50:26.627
What is this?

608
00:50:30.372 --> 00:50:33.129
Huh? Oh my goodness.

609
00:50:33.129 --> 00:50:35.216
Of all things...

610
00:50:44.147 --> 00:50:45.846
<i>Hey.</i>

611
00:50:51.058 --> 00:50:53.451
Who is this playing around?

612
00:50:54.868 --> 00:50:56.977
It's me, Father.

613
00:51:00.297 --> 00:51:02.049
Hyuk, it's you?

614
00:51:02.049 --> 00:51:04.808
Yes, Father.

615
00:51:04.808 --> 00:51:07.450
It's me... Hyuk.

616
00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:10.489
You rascal. What are you doing there?

617
00:51:10.489 --> 00:51:12.589
Please listen to me for now.

618
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:16.256
Then I'll give you
what you desperately need.

619
00:51:16.256 --> 00:51:19.527
I'll give you this toilet paper.

620
00:51:19.527 --> 00:51:21.158
You little...

621
00:51:21.158 --> 00:51:23.167
What is it? Tell me quickly.

622
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:24.997
You said to me, Father...

623
00:51:24.997 --> 00:51:27.507
Live according to my will
and how I want.

624
00:51:27.507 --> 00:51:31.975
You told me to live like I wasn't
CEO Byun Gang Su's son.

625
00:51:31.975 --> 00:51:34.498
<i>That's why I came to work here on my own.</i>

626
00:51:34.498 --> 00:51:37.096
It's the first job I chose to work.

627
00:51:37.096 --> 00:51:40.596
Still, you're going to come
when your father is relieving himself

628
00:51:40.596 --> 00:51:42.056
and deal with me using toilet paper?

629
00:51:42.056 --> 00:51:44.777
You don't have the right
to oppose me on this.

630
00:51:44.777 --> 00:51:46.406
I'm a contract service employee.

631
00:51:46.406 --> 00:51:49.216
You can't fire me...

632
00:51:49.216 --> 00:51:50.366
CEO.

633
00:51:50.366 --> 00:51:54.326
So, you're saying you're
going to keep cleaning?

634
00:51:54.326 --> 00:51:56.948
At my company? In my building?

635
00:51:56.948 --> 00:51:59.754
Yes, I am. I'm going to do it.

636
00:51:59.754 --> 00:52:02.361
You little punk.

637
00:52:02.361 --> 00:52:05.863
All right, all right. I got it.

638
00:52:05.863 --> 00:52:09.006
Just give me that toilet paper.

639
00:52:09.006 --> 00:52:11.272
Then, are you giving me permission?

640
00:52:11.272 --> 00:52:13.971
I said just give me the toilet paper,
you little punk!

641
00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:17.502
Then I'll assume
you've given me permission.

642
00:52:28.223 --> 00:52:30.986
Oh yeah, there's one more thing.

643
00:52:30.986 --> 00:52:32.573
Why, you little!

644
00:52:32.573 --> 00:52:34.832
Let us eat meals in the company.

645
00:52:34.832 --> 00:52:36.328
What?

646
00:52:37.301 --> 00:52:39.113
Meals?

647
00:52:39.113 --> 00:52:41.767
- Yes.
- Gosh.

648
00:52:41.767 --> 00:52:43.364
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

649
00:52:43.364 --> 00:52:45.658
Enjoy your meal.

650
00:53:26.192 --> 00:53:28.995
I gave it to them
just like you taught me.

651
00:53:33.203 --> 00:53:34.808
I did well, right?

652
00:53:34.808 --> 00:53:37.056
It's nice having the support
of a third generation rich guy.

653
00:53:37.056 --> 00:53:40.953
Of course, this is how you
use the connections you have.

654
00:53:41.466 --> 00:53:45.433
I'll be a strong support for you.

655
00:53:45.433 --> 00:53:47.640
Whenever you need.

656
00:53:59.026 --> 00:54:03.408
Everything he's doing is because of you.

657
00:54:12.609 --> 00:54:15.962
I'm certain he likes you.
There's no doubt about it.

658
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:38.105
Oh, that Ha Yeon Hee.
Why did she say that nonsense?

659
00:54:38.105 --> 00:54:39.448
What?

660
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.185
That guy.

661
00:54:53.185 --> 00:54:57.134
Well, I guess I am proud of him.

662
00:55:01.866 --> 00:55:03.911
What do you mean, cleaning service?

663
00:55:03.911 --> 00:55:05.360
You can't allow that.

664
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.730
Hyuk's case is still
under review by prosecutors.

665
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:09.420
There are many people watching.

666
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.855
How will you handle the news
if it leaves the company?

667
00:55:11.855 --> 00:55:14.440
Huh? What?

668
00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.433
Father?

669
00:55:16.433 --> 00:55:18.085
That kid, my goodness.

670
00:55:18.085 --> 00:55:21.514
It's so ridiculous,
the more I think about it.

671
00:55:21.514 --> 00:55:25.485
Hyuk used this toilet paper here

672
00:55:25.485 --> 00:55:29.266
to make a deal with me of all people.

673
00:55:31.862 --> 00:55:35.382
Okay, make sure no one throws
this out and leave it here for now.

674
00:55:35.382 --> 00:55:38.547
Let me see here.
Here we go.

675
00:55:38.547 --> 00:55:41.141
One, two, three.

676
00:55:42.243 --> 00:55:43.772
Hey, get in the picture too.

677
00:55:43.772 --> 00:55:46.128
One, two, three.

678
00:55:46.779 --> 00:55:51.795
I guess that monk wasn't
completely wrong either.

679
00:56:06.735 --> 00:56:08.710
Tell me the truth.

680
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:11.199
Did you know or not?

681
00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:13.587
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

682
00:56:14.685 --> 00:56:16.951
There's nothing more to say.

683
00:56:16.951 --> 00:56:19.322
Get rid of Hyuk
from the company right now.

684
00:56:19.322 --> 00:56:23.063
Put pressure on the cleaning company
or terminate the contract now!

685
00:56:25.072 --> 00:56:26.998
I will do as you order.

686
00:56:30.212 --> 00:56:34.402
However, if you want to know
what the CEO is thinking...

687
00:56:34.402 --> 00:56:39.694
isn't is better to keep him close by
rather than sending him far away?

688
00:56:39.694 --> 00:56:41.081
What?

689
00:56:42.853 --> 00:56:45.243
That's just my opinion.

690
00:56:45.243 --> 00:56:47.583
I will do as you wish, Chief.

691
00:56:50.942 --> 00:56:52.386
Wait.

692
00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:01.688
They do say that you should
keep your enemies close.

693
00:57:02.368 --> 00:57:03.732
All right.

694
00:57:03.732 --> 00:57:06.944
Since things worked out this way,
keep him close and watch him.

695
00:57:06.944 --> 00:57:10.027
Make sure you don't get betrayed, okay?

696
00:57:10.027 --> 00:57:13.627
Yes, I will do as you've ordered.

697
00:58:27.176 --> 00:58:29.036
Oh, my legs hurt.

698
00:58:29.036 --> 00:58:31.487
Joon, let's play rock, paper, scissors.

699
00:58:31.487 --> 00:58:33.326
Why rock, paper, scissors suddenly?

700
00:58:33.326 --> 00:58:35.067
Loser can give the other
a piggyback ride.

701
00:58:35.067 --> 00:58:37.127
If you lose, you give me
a piggyback ride.

702
00:58:37.127 --> 00:58:39.603
If I lose, I give you a piggyback ride.

703
00:58:41.848 --> 00:58:44.288
- It's not fun?
- Not at all.

704
00:58:50.368 --> 00:58:52.560
Want a drink of soju?

705
00:59:11.639 --> 00:59:15.389
How can you be so pretty
even when you drink?

706
00:59:15.389 --> 00:59:16.998
How come you're doing the cleaning job?

707
00:59:16.998 --> 00:59:20.696
Because I want to be with you.
You know that.

708
00:59:22.212 --> 00:59:24.391
Oh, chicken gizzards.

709
00:59:24.391 --> 00:59:27.641
Wow, Joon you are a true foodie.

710
00:59:27.641 --> 00:59:31.625
Why is there so much food
I've never tried in the world?

711
00:59:35.292 --> 00:59:39.351
Anyway, thank you
for the cafeteria meal today.

712
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:41.147
I'm the one whose thankful.

713
00:59:42.373 --> 00:59:44.016
Remember what you said.

714
00:59:44.016 --> 00:59:47.255
It's up the individual
to find their confidence.

715
00:59:47.255 --> 00:59:50.891
Because of what you said,
for the first time in my life

716
00:59:50.891 --> 00:59:55.360
I was able to ask my father
for what I wanted confidently.

717
00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:00.188
Everyday that I spend with you
is so fresh and new.

718
01:00:07.964 --> 01:00:10.199
Byun Hyuk.

719
01:00:10.199 --> 01:00:12.141
Do you like me?

720
01:00:12.953 --> 01:00:14.333
Yes.

721
01:00:16.085 --> 01:00:17.978
Don't like me.

722
01:00:17.978 --> 01:00:19.089
Huh?

723
01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:21.237
I have no time to play around.

724
01:00:21.237 --> 01:00:23.447
I'm busy just trying to
make a living every day.

725
01:00:23.447 --> 01:00:25.685
I'm not someone who has nothing to do.

726
01:00:25.685 --> 01:00:28.589
It's not that I like you
because I have nothing to do.

727
01:00:33.402 --> 01:00:35.243
I'm serious.

728
01:01:01.467 --> 01:01:03.766
Oh, my friend!

729
01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:05.775
- My friend...
- I'll have an udon.

730
01:01:05.775 --> 01:01:06.944
Okay.

731
01:01:07.987 --> 01:01:11.540
Oh, now you're ignoring us?

732
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.360
What made that guy so twisted?

733
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.110
That's part of his charm.

734
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.551
Do you know what
his nickname was during school?

735
01:01:17.551 --> 01:01:20.025
- Hey.
- Twisted Doughnut.

736
01:01:21.659 --> 01:01:24.034
Twisted Doughnut.

737
01:01:24.034 --> 01:01:27.431
Oh, hey, Twisted Doughnut.

738
01:01:27.431 --> 01:01:31.634
Twisted Doughnut, you buy drinks since
you're in the Strategic Planning office.

739
01:01:31.634 --> 01:01:34.183
Really? You transferred?

740
01:01:34.183 --> 01:01:35.712
You must be happy.

741
01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:38.132
Your path to success is open, bang bang.

742
01:01:38.132 --> 01:01:40.614
All we do is, bang bang, unclog toilets.

743
01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:44.134
What? What's wrong with
unclogging toilets?

744
01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:46.049
Haven't you heard?

745
01:01:46.049 --> 01:01:48.889
This is the beauty of unclogging.

746
01:01:48.889 --> 01:01:50.719
- This is the beauty of unclogging?
- Yes.

747
01:01:50.719 --> 01:01:53.138
You can't just do it with strength.

748
01:01:53.138 --> 01:01:56.380
You need to put the plunger
in there and use your wrists.

749
01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:03.795
Left, right, left, right.
Bong, bong, bong.

750
01:02:03.795 --> 01:02:06.625
Get me to unclog
all toilets from now on.

751
01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:09.063
I am the expert in toilet unclogging.

752
01:02:10.656 --> 01:02:11.878
Unclogging a toilet.

753
01:02:11.878 --> 01:02:17.489
Left, right, left, right.
Bong, bong, bong.

754
01:02:23.185 --> 01:02:25.873
"Now is the time. Woo!"

755
01:02:25.873 --> 01:02:30.159
<i>Running toward the wind
that's calling for me.</i>

756
01:02:30.159 --> 01:02:34.851
<i>Running toward the sky,
I throw my body.</i>

757
01:02:35.404 --> 01:02:38.261
Oh, the lights are on in 301.

758
01:02:38.261 --> 01:02:40.719
The lights are on in 301.

759
01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:43.388
- Someone must've moved in.
- Someone must've moved in.

760
01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.877
I hope it's a good looking man.

761
01:02:45.877 --> 01:02:48.737
I hope it's a good look...

762
01:02:48.737 --> 01:02:49.904
What?

763
01:02:49.904 --> 01:02:51.898
I hope it's a pretty girl.

764
01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:55.197
All the women in this building
are too tough.

765
01:02:55.197 --> 01:02:58.886
Hey, what do you mean tough?

766
01:02:58.886 --> 01:03:01.339
Hey, Twisted Doughnut!

767
01:03:01.339 --> 01:03:03.638
She is pretty tough.

768
01:03:03.638 --> 01:03:05.982
Wait up, friends!

769
01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:36.413
Byun Hyuk.

770
01:03:37.594 --> 01:03:39.862
Do you like me?

771
01:03:41.882 --> 01:03:45.114
Jae Hoon, do you know what?

772
01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:50.560
Earlier today,
Joon called me by my name.

773
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.424
She called me Byun Hyuk.

774
01:03:54.547 --> 01:03:58.025
She always referred to me as
a "third generation rich guy."

775
01:03:58.025 --> 01:04:01.253
She finally called me by my name.

776
01:04:03.427 --> 01:04:06.989
<i>There's a female cleaner
that Hyuk works with.</i>

777
01:04:09.165 --> 01:04:14.447
They ran away from
the cafeteria holding hands.

778
01:04:15.116 --> 01:04:17.746
Find out who she is
and what kind of person she is.

779
01:04:19.317 --> 01:04:21.772
Find out her relationship to Hyuk.

780
01:04:24.176 --> 01:04:26.190
Yes, CEO.

781
01:04:40.931 --> 01:04:45.947
Every day that I spend with you
is so fresh and new.

782
01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:52.393
I'm serious.

783
01:05:03.174 --> 01:05:06.183
It's not that I like you
because I have nothing to do.

784
01:05:16.748 --> 01:05:19.362
Oh, so frustrating.

785
01:05:19.362 --> 01:05:22.009
Oh, what do I do?

786
01:05:33.009 --> 01:05:37.511
What do I do?
I already miss Joon.

787
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:46.098
Gosh... good night, Joon.

788
01:06:01.726 --> 01:06:05.168
Oh, this is seriously driving me crazy.
