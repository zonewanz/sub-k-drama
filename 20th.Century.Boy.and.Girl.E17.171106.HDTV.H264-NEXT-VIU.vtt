- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.470
- You should have this. - Thanks.

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.470
My name is Joo Eun Hye.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.970
Do you remember that one stalker who hid under your bed?

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.710
I saw someone who looked like her in the parking lot.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.111
I'm a fan of yours. Can I get a picture with you?

7
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.921
Sa Jin Jin's death day? Then will that brat die today?

8
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.191
Wait a moment.

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.030
Did you put in the bleach?

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.900
What's this?

11
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:44.830
Hey, let's go.

(Gong Ji Won)

13
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:05.150
Hello?

14
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.560
Did you check the V.S.?

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.531
Her temperature, pulse, and breathing are all normal.

16
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.801
It'll take us 10 minutes to get to the hospital.

17
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.631
Sa Jin Jin.

18

22
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.370
Jin Jin? What happened?

23
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.370
I'm her guardian.

(Myeongjin Hospital)

25
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.351
Excuse me, where can I find Sa Jin Jin?

26
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:16.161
- Where's her guardian? - She's right here.

27
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.640
Are you her guardian?

28
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:36.480
Yes.

29
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:40.610
We pumped her stomach. Fortunately, there's no damage to her esophagus.

30
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.621
But she'll need to be hospitalized for a few days just in case.

31
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.751
After she gets some rest, we'll move her to a room.

32
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:48.390
All right. Thank you.

Where is Sa Jin Jin?

36
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.221
She's over there.

37
00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:01.700
Jin Jin. Jin Jin.

How to protect someone special?

39
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:28.891
You have to make an assumption.

40
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.961
What if you're never able to see that person again?

41
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.031
Or what if that person is with someone else?

42
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:40.000
How would you feel then?

43
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.740
Is there someone you can't stand to lose?

44
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:46.411
Someone that you just don't want...

45
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:48.211
to lose?

46

48
00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:09.060
You're awake.

49

Can you see me?

50
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:18.971
It's okay. I'm here now. You'll be fine.

51
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.141
My poor thing. How did you manage without me?

52
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:26.281
- I'm sorry. - Because of me,

53
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.951
you cut your trip short.

54
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:31.951
What if it had gotten really bad while we were away?

55
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.620
It's such a relief that Anthony got to you in time.

56
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.930
Anthony was here?

57
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.331
We were too flustered,

58
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.701
and he had to leave in a hurry for work.

59
00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:45.831
We couldn't thank him properly.

60
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.641
How did you think of calling him?

61

Don't they deserve some applause?

66
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.310
Ji Won, did you ever think...

67
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.110
Jin Jin was pretty?

68
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.151
Right? Aren't you so cute?

69
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.651
No, you.

70
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:42.661
Are you Sa Jin Jin's guardian?

71
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:45.490
Yes.

I'm so sorry I'm late.

73
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.120
What's wrong with you? Why did you disappear?

74
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.351
Why did you say you were here? Why didn't you answer your phone?

75
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:14.151
Don't you care about the people waiting?

76
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:16.461
Is this how irresponsible you are?

77
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:20.430
This is the thrill of doing live shows.

78
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.961
It feels like your heart's dipped into cold then hot water.

79
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.430
I apologize.

80
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.601
You got here at 59 minutes. Everything's fine.

Thank you.

84
00:07:40.781 --> 00:07:44.021
What happened? I thought your stalker had gotten to you.

85
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.091

What a complete psycho.

89
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.940
His manager said she was a famous hardcore fan.

90
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.411
She called and visited all the time, sent weird gifts,

91
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.141
and hid under his bed.

92
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.610
They couldn't upset a fan, so...

93
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.351
She isn't a fan.

94
00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:13.610
What fan would bother him?

95
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.081
You're right. They think that...

96
00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:19.521
a fan can get away with anything they do.

97
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.461
"I did it out of love."

98
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.891
How dare they talk such garbage?

99
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.531
People like that aren't fans.

100
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.201
They should all be sent to prison...

101
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:33.471
and made to face a wall all day.

102
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.541
That's what Anthony said.

103
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:40.140
- What? - Don't ever forgive her.

104
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.250
Did I burden him with my troubles?

105
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.780
Sorry, Jin Jin. It's all my fault.

106
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:50.620
I failed to check the drinks.

107
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:53.821
No, no. It's my fault.

108
00:08:53.821 --> 00:08:57.191
I had no idea my superstar was in trouble.

109
00:08:57.191 --> 00:08:59.961
I was going crazy over some grilled intestines.

110
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:02.961
Yes. It's all your fault.

111
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.601
What'll you do about the smell?

112
00:09:07.331 --> 00:09:08.801
You reek.

Going down.

115
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.120
What is going on inside your head?

116
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.051
- Why? - When she bothered you,

117
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:30.520
you acted like a complete saint. Why are you so aggressive now?

118
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.931
She has to pay for what she did.

119
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:36.260
Are you sticking up for yourself now?

120
00:09:37.331 --> 00:09:39.831
How did you go to the hospital...

121
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:41.640
when you cared about morals?

122
00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:44.640
Did you not care about the live radio show?

123
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.971
Did you not care about me?

124
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:49.041
Sorry. I really am.

125
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:52.480
When you rushed over to Jin Jin,

126
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.081
was your frontal lobe paralyzed or something?

127
00:09:56.081 --> 00:09:57.181
What?

128
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.421
Did your instincts override reason?

129
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.561
There you go again.

00:10:17.571 --> 00:10:19.240
I'm on the mend.

133

Thanks for coming over during your busy schedule.

134
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.351
If you're worried about me, you don't have to be.

135
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.120
I was unlucky enough to meet someone strange.

136
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:33.821

00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:14.660
Well... I wasn't able to go to the hospital.

141
00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:18.870
I left right away. I barely made it to the radio station on time.

142
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.571
Right. I met Jin Jin's parents.

They're great people.

That's why Jin Jin's so kind.

Yes.

147
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:39.321
It's my fault.

148
00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:41.961
I feel terrible.

149
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:45.630
Don't be too bothered. You did nothing wrong.

150
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.191
It's my fault.

151
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.000
Would Jin Jin feel uncomfortable if I showed that I'm worried?

152
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.471
Of course. She would.

153
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.941
The moon's so bright tonight.

154
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.110

See you at our hideout.

161
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:43.051
Ji Won will be there too.

162
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.421
He said he's home. Spend time with him before we meet.

163

"How can you not show up when your friend is sick?"

166

"It looks like our 35-year friendship meant nothing."

"Drinking bleach then getting my stomach pumped? It's nothing."

00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:10.280
"I got so angry and frustrated because of you!"

170
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.721
No. No.

171
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.091
Let's take out that angry part.

172
00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:20.961
Wait, why should I? Why should I do that?

173
00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:22.291
Why should I?

174
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.230
I don't have anything to be sorry about.

175
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.201
No, I am sorry.

176
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:32.201
I'm dying to know how he is.

177
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.541
Darn it.

178
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.880
Gong Ji Won, why didn't you come...

179
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:46.150
What are you doing? He's gone.

180
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.520
He left.

181
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:52.821
- To where? - Home.

182
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.530
Didn't I tell you?

183
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:05.230
My house got fixed up. I should be going home.

184
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.770
I've been living in someone else's house when I had my own.

185
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.041
"Someone else's"?

186
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:13.770
I had to unpack, and I had a lot of work...

187
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:15.780
in Hong Kong.

188
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.650
That's why I couldn't visit. I'm sorry.

189
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:22.480
Are you disappointed?

190
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:25.390
I had my reasons, so please let me off.

191
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:28.321
How are you? Are you all right?

192
00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:30.221
Wow, you asked her that so quickly.

193
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:32.030
She's sitting here because she's fine.

194
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.500
When she collapsed, your brother was the first one there.

195
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.071
He was there even before her parents were.

196
00:14:38.071 --> 00:14:40.500
- Really? - What happened was...

197
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.240
Wow, Jin Jin, good for you. Anthony was your guardian.

198
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.471
So if you were disappointed, don't be.

199
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:48.610
I wasn't disappointed.

200
00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:51.010
Good girl.

201
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:54.921
Then I'll give you a piece of fried chicken.

202
00:14:56.051 --> 00:14:58.321
Your favorite, drumstick.

203
00:14:58.321 --> 00:15:01.620
Eat up. You need to eat more.

204
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:04.431
Young Shim, did you like wings?

205
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.160
Then a wing for you.

206
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.900
Ah Reum, you like chicken breast, right?

207
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.230
Here you go.

208
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:14.270
Are you telling me to lose weight?

209
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:16.400
Why are you giving me chicken breast?

210
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:18.211
You like dry meat.

211
00:15:18.211 --> 00:15:20.311
No one likes chicken breasts. I don't want it.

212
00:15:20.311 --> 00:15:22.240
Okay, then. Have a wing.

213
00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:26.351
- I want a drumstick. - There's only one left.

214
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:30.451
- I'm so full. I ate so much. - You should take care of yourself.

215
00:15:30.451 --> 00:15:33.321
- You didn't even eat much. - Jin Jin, you got thinner.

216
00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:36.791
- Bye. - Bye.

217
00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:38.530
- Bye. - Bye, guys.

218
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.160
Ah Reum, Young Shim.

219
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.601
I'll go with you.

220
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.331
I need to stop by the convenience store.

221
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:48.601
Do you want to come?

222
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:50.471
No.

223
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.740
Let's go.

224
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:58.010
- All right. - What's with you?

225
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.551
- Bye. - I heard you're moving out.

226
00:16:00.551 --> 00:16:02.951
- Yes. - Don't let any guys in, okay?

227
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:05.221
Why not? I should be letting them in.

228
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.691
Hey, what does an analyst do anyway?

229
00:16:08.561 --> 00:16:10.821
- Yes, what's an analyst? - That sounds dirty.

230
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.890
What? Do you think an analyst sounds dirty?

231
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.480
- Ji Won is weird, isn't he? - Definitely.

232
00:16:32.581 --> 00:16:34.520
- Did you catch that too? - I'm not an idiot.

233
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.750
Right? He likes me, doesn't he?

234
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.291
Goodness, I hate myself for being so popular.

235
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.000
Thank you.

236
00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:08.256

237
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.920
Why?

238
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.930
You like Jin Jin, don't you?

239
00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:25.271
Hey, at least give me some time to get ready.

240
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:27.601
You don't get that. Just answer us.

241
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:31.771
- Yes. - Why didn't you visit her?

242
00:17:31.771 --> 00:17:33.610
- Did you two fight? - No.

243
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.950
Then what? Is there a change in feelings or an obstacle?

244
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.150
We wouldn't have anything like that.

245
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.751
Are you concerned about her being on "We Got Married"...

246
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.251
with your brother?

247
00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:45.390
Not at all.

248
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.991
Hey, if your brother said he liked Jin Jin, would you back down?

249
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:53.591
I never thought of that.

250
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:57.261
And Jin Jin isn't Chul Min's type.

251
00:17:57.731 --> 00:17:59.831
Gosh, you're so sly.

252
00:18:01.001 --> 00:18:04.741
You and Jin Jin can't be friends anyway.

253
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:06.841
- Why not? - The moment you like someone,

254
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.940
you can never be friends with them anymore.

255
00:18:12.351 --> 00:18:15.321
Please don't let your imagination run wild.

256
00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:17.120
And don't be so prude either.

257
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.591
Ji Won.

258
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.261
I really support your first love.

259
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.291
So be honest.

260
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.331
Why do you suddenly act so awkward?

261
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:29.860
It's as if you're trying to draw a line between...

262
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.731
I'm not drawing any lines. We're really friends.

263
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:34.440
I mean it. Come on.

264
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.301
No, you don't.

265
00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:38.271
You're so transparent.

266
00:18:38.271 --> 00:18:41.410
You're too transparent, Ji Won.

267
00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:44.781
He's never honest. I told you.

268
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.720
Leave him alone. He'll figure it out.

269
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.140
Everything stopped.

270
00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:16.311
My world stopped...

271
00:19:16.811 --> 00:19:18.351
in your universe.

272
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.991
You make me think about and wait on you.

273
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.731
You give me a small hope.

274
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.771
I tell myself that...

275
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.511
the river in my heart will quiet down.

276
00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:49.311
That it'll become a quiet stream.

277
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:55.781
But in a second, my heart is overflowing with the ocean.

278
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:03.991
It also says, "It's all right."

279
00:20:10.101 --> 00:20:12.900
Will I be all right after this night?

280
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.041
Will the sunlight, the light of the universe,

281
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:21.940
and our world become a different place tomorrow?

282
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.851
You must have a lot to prepare for your first trial.

283
00:20:32.991 --> 00:20:34.561
It'll be in a few days.

284
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:35.991
Yes, you're right.

285
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:38.491
It'll be helpful for you to look into other trials.

286
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:41.331
You should attend the trials whenever you have time.

287
00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:42.801
Yes, I'll do that.

288
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.101
Will you return at 1pm today as well?

289
00:20:45.101 --> 00:20:47.271
- You should eat too. - Okay.

290
00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:49.071
Enjoy your lunch.

291
00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:07.761
- Hello. - Yes, welcome.

292
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.531
- How many? - Just me.

293
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.130
Let's see...

294
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.470
Oh, over there. That seat.

295
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.531
Okay.

296
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.120
Do you come here often?

297
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.420
Almost every single day.

298
00:21:39.321 --> 00:21:41.190
You must like beef soup.

299
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.690
I do.

300
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:47.291
I'm Korean, after all.

301
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.261
What about you?

302
00:21:51.571 --> 00:21:54.001
Me too. I'm Korean too.

303
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.680
By any chance,

304
00:22:03.811 --> 00:22:06.781
would you like to eat with me from time to time?

305
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.521
Mondays and Thursdays?

306
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.920
If that's okay with you.

307
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.021
Sounds wonderful.

308
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:26.731
Come eat.

309
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:29.341
I'm not eating.

310
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.741
Mom made braised short ribs.

311
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.710
She made a whole lot because Ji Won wanted to eat it.

312
00:22:51.231 --> 00:22:52.690
Gosh, Ji Won got...

313
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.001
the best meat available.

314
00:22:56.001 --> 00:22:58.001
Tell him to come eat upstairs.

315
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:02.301
How would he eat without the soup? He would need side dishes.

316
00:23:02.301 --> 00:23:05.210
Young people don't eat properly.

317
00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:09.210
This would do as an emergency food supply when he gets hungry.

318
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.110
Min Ho, go give this to Ji Won.

319
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.051
Why should I? Send her.

320
00:23:24.331 --> 00:23:26.261
Mom says you should eat proper meals.

321
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:29.061
All right.

322
00:23:30.331 --> 00:23:32.630
Tell her that I'm grateful.

323
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.880
What's wrong?

324
00:23:50.551 --> 00:23:51.650
What?

325
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.021
Mom told me to bring the pot back.

326
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.081
Your house seems nice.

327
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.150
Yes.

328
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.360
- Did you remodel it? - Yes.

329
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:54.821
Should I do it?

330
00:24:56.581 --> 00:24:57.650
No.

331
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.021
Should we do it together?

332
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:04.291
No.

333
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:09.200
Is there anything I can help with?

334
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:13.801
It's fine.

335
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.061
Ji Won isn't receiving my call. He must have left.

336
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.670
Gosh, he should've at least eaten.

337
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.140
He probably left after drinking milk.

338
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.370
You should have cooked rice porridge for him.

339
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.241
I'm thinking of doing that starting tomorrow.

340
00:25:54.781 --> 00:25:59.351
Gosh, it's not easy to ignore the empty seat.

341
00:25:59.351 --> 00:26:02.380
The house feels so empty with Ji Won gone.

342
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.150
Mom, you have a handsome son. Why do you care for him so much?

343
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.460
Don't you feel like you need to learn something from him?

344
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.620
Gosh.

345
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:16.501
Gosh, I should have at least fed him before he left for work.

346
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.170
It's fine. I'll eat this.

347
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.351
(Start Running)

348
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:08.551
(12 minutes 31 seconds)

349
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.920
This is President Gong Ji Won of National Chemicals.

350
00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:48.120
He will help our brand become a global cosmetic.

351
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.360
Nice to meet you. I'm Gong Ji Won.

352
00:27:58.622 --> 00:28:00.822
(Episode 18 will air shortly.)
