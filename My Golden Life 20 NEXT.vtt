Are you really Choi Eun Seok?

5
00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.249
What's wrong with you? She's your daughter.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.889
Who are you?

8
00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.600
I know that you're not my daughter.

9
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.840
Honey. What are you talking about?

10
00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.579
This is the DNA test between me and her.

11
00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.550

What I want to ask you...

15

No.

16
00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.769
What I want to check with you...

17
00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:12.570
is that if you knew.

18
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.409
You knew you're not my daughter.

19
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.150
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:26.120
Wait... Wait. Hold on.

21
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.189
Is this...

22
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.060
the DNA test between you and Eun Seok?

23
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.799
This can't be true.

24
00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.400
Why did you apologize, Eun Seok?

25
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.670
Why would you apologize?

26
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.109
I'm sorry. I should've told you earlier.

27
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.409
I was going to tell you everything today.

28
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.620
Yes.

29
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.150
You knew.

30
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.659
You knew.

31
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.519
You knew all about it.

32
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.129
And you deceived us.

33
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.800
I didn't mean to.

34
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.599
Get out.

35
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.569
Vice Chairman Choi. Please listen to me.

36
00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.909
I told my parents to go to the police tomorrow.

37
00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.379
I wasn't going to keep on deceiving you.

38
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.340
I didn't wait to hear your excuses!

39
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.409
I wanted to check in person.

40
00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.479
Now that I checked, we're finished.

41
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.849
Letting you walk out on your own...

42
00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.390
is the best I can do for you.

43

Eun Seok.

46
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.030
Don't call her that!

47
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.069
I have to go.

48
00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.610
I'll see that your parents...

49
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.110
don't end up being sued.

50
00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:02.449
Get up.

51
00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.719
Do you want to get kicked out?

Is it true?

Are... Are you really not my daughter?

56
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.449
Is it really true?

57
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.150
Did you know all about this?

58
00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.949
I'm sorry.

Take her out.

Where are you going?

62
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.000
When did you... How did you find out?

63
00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.409
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

64
00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.239
It's you who caused all this mess,

65
00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:09.580
so why would I do that?

66
00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:12.380
I asked where you're going!

67
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.479
I'm going to see Seo Tae Soo!

68
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.590
What a busy day.

69
00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.919
Why do I have so many group customers today?

70
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.260
(Ji An)

71
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.260
My gosh.

72
00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:26.960
Why did she text me?

73
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.400
Mom. Dad. I found out about everything.

74
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.369
I'm not the daughter of Haesung Corporation.

75
00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:36.510
Ji Soo is the real daughter.

76
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.539
So I'm telling Ji Soo's parents the truth.

77
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.750
I'll tell them first and ask for their forgiveness.

78
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.320
Please prepare yourselves to go...

79
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.919
to the station and turn yourselves in tomorrow.

80
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.390
What... My goodness.

81
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.960
What just happened?

82
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.690
My gosh.

83
00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:57.989
Ji An.

84
00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.700
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

85
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.299
Ji An. No, Ji An.

86
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.200
Gosh, what am I going to do? Hold on.

87
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.700
My goodness. Let me think.

88
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.609
What should I do?

89
00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:12.669
What should I do? Let me think.

90
00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:13.679
(Tae Soo)

91
00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:19.349
Come on. Please answer your phone.

92
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.789
Hey, Seok Doo.

93
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.830
Do Kyung and Min Soo are both vice presidents.

94
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.229
I'm the only managing director.

95
00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:38.729
What's wrong with my dad?

96
00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.200
Then pour a drink for this vice president.

97
00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:47.409
I get that you don't want to answer any calls.

98
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.239
But I think you should answer this.

99
00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:54.619
Yes, Mom.

100
00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:56.289
Do Kyung.

101
00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:59.320
We found out that she's not Eun Seok.

102
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.960
What do you mean?

103
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.630
Your dad ran another DNA test.

104
00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:07.330
The results said she's not Eun Seok.

105
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.729
Eun Seok...

106
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:13.270
No, Seo Ji An, right?

107
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.599
She knew about it too.

108
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:25.280
Eun Seok came home?

109
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.280
She said she needed to talk to us.

110
00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.789
Your dad is furious.

111
00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:32.619
He stormed out to see Seo Tae Soo.

112
00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:35.859
How did he find out?

113
00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.200
What?

114
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.929
I don't need an office now.

115
00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.599
I just took my first step.

116
00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.739
No, no.

117
00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:48.969
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

118
00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.239
Ji An?

119
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.710
(Ji An)

120
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.979
(Mom. Dad. I found out about everything.)

121
00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:25.609
I'm Choi Jae Sung, vice chairman of Haesung.

122
00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:27.679
Are you Seo Tae Soo...

123
00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:29.479
who sold your daughter off to get a fortune?

124
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.449
Are you the one who took my daughter away twice?

125
00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.689
- Sir. - Don't you dare kneel.

126
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.689
Repenting after getting caught isn't genuine.

127
00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.360
I concluded that my daughter was dead.

128
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.530
I did that for my entire life.

129
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.600
The daughter that I thought dead came back.

130
00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.429
But she's not my daughter either!

131
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.309
How could you switch your daughter...

132
00:08:57.309 --> 00:08:58.770
with someone else's?

133
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.939
How could you call yourself human?

134
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.419
There... There's nothing I can say.

135
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.520
I... I'm too ashamed to even apologize.

136
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.720
That's how much I'm sorry.

137
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.890
I don't want your empty apologies.

138
00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:18.089
Did you think you could keep that secret forever?

139
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.329
Is that why you accepted the restaurant?

140
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.900
You two took my daughter away from me 25 years ago.

141
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.470
I held myself back from killing you.

142
00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:33.679
Only because you raised my daughter.

143
00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.709
She grew up thinking you were her parents.

144
00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:38.250
I quelled my anger.

145
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.949
I rewarded you instead of retaliating.

146
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:43.390
I didn't even know you switched my daughter.

147
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.990
It... It was my doing.

148
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.990
He had no idea.

149
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.360
I sent Ji An because of my greed.

150
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.360
I don't know why I said she's yours,

151
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.659
but I'm responsible.

152
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.699
He only found out later.

153
00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:00.339
I'll pay for my sin.

154
00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:02.600
Of course you will.

155
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.069
You two...

156
00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.280
will pay for your crimes. So don't you...

157
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.909
dare say another word.

158
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:11.750
I'm only here to take my daughter today.

159
00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:13.780
Where's my daughter?

160
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:16.890
Bring me my daughter.

161
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.089
I don't want her to stay here for anymore.

162
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.199
Eun.. Eun Seok.

163
00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:38.839
Ji Soo.

164
00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:39.909
Eun Seok.

165
00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:41.539
Eun Seok!

166
00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:44.250
Ji... Ji Soo!

167
00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:52.120
Eun Seok.

168
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.059
Eun Seok!

169
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.130
Ji Soo.

170
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.360
Ji Soo.

171
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:04.329
Ji Soo. Ji Soo.

172
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.819
Your dad is furious.

173
00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:28.520
He stormed out to see Seo Tae Soo.

174
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.400
Eun Seok. Eun Seok!

175
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.409
Eun Seok!

176
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.909
Ji Soo. Ji Soo!

177
00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.740
Ji Soo!

178
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.409
- Father! - You're not her father!

179
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.919
Please stop. His family is watching.

180
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.630
Let's stop here today.

181
00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:52.140
Please take him home.

182
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.370
Dad.

183
00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:19.299
Please get up.

184
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.640
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

185
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.909
- after the beep. - Seo Ji An.

186
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.919
Could I see you for a second?

187
00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.650
I have something to say.

188
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.159
We must speak in person.

189
00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:18.159
What I want...

190
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.360
is for you...

191
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.750
How could you switch your daughter...

192
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.260
with someone else's?

193
00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:48.319
How could you call yourself human?

194
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.630
I concluded that my daughter was dead.

195
00:14:52.289 --> 00:14:53.659
I did that for my entire life.

196
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.900
The daughter that I thought dead came back.

197
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.600
But she's not my daughter either!

198
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.100
It was my doing.

199
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:02.909
He had no idea.

200
00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:05.539
I sent Ji An because of my greed.

201
00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:07.579
Eun Seok.

202
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.919
Mom,

203
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.949
why do you say this is Ji An?

204
00:15:16.319 --> 00:15:17.549
This is me.

205
00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:21.589
I never said it was Ji An. You heard it wrong.

206
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.059
Is this brand from Haesung Corporation?

207
00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:26.829
Did Ji An's parents open this for you?

208
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.299
It's shameful, isn't it?

209
00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:31.130
I look shameless, don't I?

210
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.630
Ji Soo,

211
00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:34.669
why don't you study abroad?

212
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.169
That's why she said those.

213
00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:45.449
How could you do that?

214
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.579
Are you out of your mind?

215
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:49.280
How can you...

216
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.490
How can you do such a ridiculous thing?

217
00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:56.890
Ji Tae.

218
00:15:58.589 --> 00:16:00.329
Let me explain.

219
00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:02.130
What is there to explain?

220
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.400
Is this something that can be excused?

221
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.339
You messed up the lives of Ji An and Ji Soo.

222
00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:10.539
What excuse can you give for that?

223
00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:12.740
And you even got a restaurant from them.

224
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.010
Are you...

225
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:19.949
the people I used to know?

226
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.520
I am sorry, Ji Tae.

227
00:16:23.819 --> 00:16:24.990
About what?

228
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.720
What are you sorry about?

229
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.860
How could you tell me to get married...

230
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.429
after doing such a thing?

231
00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:32.559
Were we supposed to see this happen...

232
00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.000
as soon as we got back from our honeymoon?

233
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.730
Ji Tae.

234
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.600
Don't do this. He's not at fault.

235
00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:45.209
I told you. It was me. I forced him into it.

236
00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:49.850
Yes.

237
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.250
Good job.

238
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.919
Well done.

239
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.319
You forced Dad into it, and you lied to Ji An.

240
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.789
And you deceived Ji Soo and her parents.

241
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.530
As if that's not enough, you took the restaurant.

242
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.200
Stop it.

243
00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:34.720
Honey.

244
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.089
I am too ashamed to look at you.

245
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:40.299
I am so embarrassed.

246
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.270
Don't say that you regret getting married.

247
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.240
How could I not?

248
00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.970
I didn't marry you because of your parents.

249
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.839
Well,

250
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.480
I am surprised, and it's shocking.

251
00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:00.849
But still,

252
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.920
didn't we promise to live for each other?

253
00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:06.020
We promised not to let our relationship...

254
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.359
get affected by other people.

255
00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:09.589
But I never imagined...

256
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.990
this ridiculous thing would happen.

257
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.240
It must be a big shock,

258
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.240
but let's forget it today. Even if it's just us.

259
00:18:36.889 --> 00:18:38.589
Ji Soo isn't picking up her phone either.

260
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.089
Ji Soo...

261
00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:42.789
must've been so shocked.

262
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.430
How did...

263
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.160
Ji An find out?

264
00:18:47.829 --> 00:18:50.200
Did Mr. Choi hear it from Ji An herself?

265
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.500
Is that important to you?

266
00:18:53.139 --> 00:18:56.309
We have to find Ji Soo and Ji An first.

267
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.510
Why would we find Ji An?

268
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.180
Ji An...

269
00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:03.210
will come home, right?

270
00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.680
I guess she will.

271
00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:07.349
Even if her parents are all messed up,

272
00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:09.619
this is the only place she can go.

273
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.589
She would still come with a heavy heart.

274
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.859
You said it before.

275
00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:17.430
You said Ji An would be too embarrassed to live.

276
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.899
What did that woman say?

277
00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:03.639
Why? If she says something,

278
00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:05.270
will you believe it again?

279
00:20:06.809 --> 00:20:08.980
Why didn't you do the DNA test properly?

280
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.010
I heard there were two toothbrushes.

281
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:14.119
Why did you only listen to what she said...

282
00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:16.020
and believe that Ji An was Eun Seok?

283
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.420
Why?

284
00:20:18.089 --> 00:20:20.520
You are so thorough and careful. So why?

285
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.020
I never thought...

286
00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:24.889
What?

287
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.799
I never thought she would dare to lie...

288
00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:33.339
to my face.

289
00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:36.970
As soon as I met her, I drove her into a corner.

290
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:38.970
I was so impatient,

291
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.079
and I had to know who my daughter was.

292
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.010
(CEO No Myung Hee)

293
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.349
My name is No Myung Hee.

294
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.450
That woman...

295
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.990
At first, she didn't want to tell me who it was.

296
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.119
I knew one of them was my daughter,

297
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.589
but she still claimed that they were both hers.

298
00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.760
My girls are twins. Fraternal twins.

299
00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:01.700
And one of them died...

300
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.000
in 1992.

301
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.839
I did a DNA test.

302
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.970
I already know that one of the girls is mine.

303
00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:14.339
Both Ji An and Ji Soo are mine. They're twins.

304
00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:15.940
You're mistaken.

305
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.480
Then let's get both girls...

306
00:21:18.349 --> 00:21:20.549
and test their DNA.

307
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.149
I said I would test both of the girls' DNA.

308
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:26.220
I threatened her and persuaded her.

309
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.920
I intensely grilled her.

310
00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:29.420
Who is it?

311
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.200
Please. Please don't test me.

312
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.160
Who is my daughter?

313
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.770
Who is it? Who is it?

314
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.670
Who is it? Who's my daughter?

315
00:21:41.399 --> 00:21:43.240
Ji An.

316
00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:49.950
I didn't even give her a minute,

317
00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:52.980
not a second to think.

318
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.220
I never thought someone like her...

319
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.190
would think of tricking me in a split second.

320
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.720
Moreover, how could she dare to...

321
00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:06.559
I never imagined she would lie to me.

322
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.430
You fell into your own trap.

323
00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:15.039
You never trust anyone.

324
00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.369
And yet, you neglected the fact that...

325
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.609
even a housewife can be as ambitious as you.

326
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.149
How did you find out? Eun Seok...

327
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.920
I mean, how did you know Ji An wasn't Eun Seok?

328
00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:30.420
Is that important?

329
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.690
Why didn't you tell me when you found out?

330
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.990
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

331
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.960
You can do anything you want.

332
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.829
But do I have to report everything to you?

333
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.599
What?

334
00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:41.299
If you told me about it from the start,

335
00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:42.460
this wouldn't have happened.

336
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.329
"I will take care of it." "I took care of it."

337
00:22:45.829 --> 00:22:48.170
And you brought this upon me.

338
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.470
So why should I have told you?

339
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.940
When I didn't have a clear proof?

340
00:22:52.609 --> 00:22:54.280
Is that why...

341
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.809
you made me a fool in front of Ji An?

342
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.879
Jae Sung, you made me a fool,

343
00:22:58.879 --> 00:23:02.180
just like Ji An, and in front of her too.

344
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.750
I accepted a stranger as my daughter!

345
00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:08.990
Who was made a bigger fool?

346
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:11.359
And who made me like this?

347
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.460
Even when you are fooled, you would neglect...

348
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.530
my feelings because you're upset about being fooled.

349
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.000
That's why I didn't tell you.

350
00:23:18.869 --> 00:23:20.039
Your ego?

351
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.639
It didn't matter to me.

352
00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:23.910
Even that girl was fooling us.

353
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.710
So confirming it was my priority.

354
00:23:26.069 --> 00:23:28.480
I needed to do it without your fuss.

355
00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:36.849
How did you know...

356
00:23:37.589 --> 00:23:38.819
that Ji An knew about it?

357
00:23:38.819 --> 00:23:40.119
I knew it too.

358
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.020
What?

359
00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:43.990
I knew. Eun Seok...

360
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.760
Ji An told me first.

361
00:23:48.099 --> 00:23:49.599
Then why didn't you tell me?

362
00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:52.399
I told her to delay telling you...

363
00:23:52.399 --> 00:23:53.500
until the end of the event.

364
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.770
What?

365
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.910
Ji An is innocent.

366
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.010
When she found out, she told me.

367
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.910
And I told her to tell you after the event...

368
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.049
since the event is important.

369
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.450
You knew?

370
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.619
We were going to tell you together.

371
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.119
Honey.

372
00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:24.530
How dare you...

373
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.399
How can you fool me too?

374
00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:55.399
Mr. Baker.

375
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.099
Mr. Baker.

376
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.220
You're a good boy. Watch that, okay?

377
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.460
Mommy has to talk.

378
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.089
Take them off.

379
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.559
What?

380
00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.960
Don't they teach you manners?

381
00:26:01.299 --> 00:26:02.899
How can we talk...

382
00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:04.369
when your whole face is covered up?

383
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.039
You are the one who attacked me...

384
00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.109
in the first place.

385
00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:18.980
How dare you teach me...

386
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.450
when you had an affair with my husband?

387
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.319
I didn't know he was married.

388
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:25.990
Do you think I will believe that?

389
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.319
Didn't Ryu...

390
00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:30.789
Didn't he tell you?

391
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.859
He never said that he was married.

392
00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:36.470
And we didn't even kiss.

393
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.869
I have a witness.

394
00:26:37.869 --> 00:26:40.200
I don't need an excuse. I have...

395
00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:42.770
Can I take this?

396
00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:45.240
You're a darling.

397
00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:48.139
I have a proof.

398
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.520
It won't happen again.

399
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.619
I will tell Mother to change the driver.

400
00:26:55.619 --> 00:26:58.220
So there is no need to get a divorce.

401
00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.760
It was a mistake,

402
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.359
but I understand that it must be upsetting.

403
00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:03.859
I sincerely apologize.

404
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:06.960
I am sorry.

405
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.030
A verbal apology isn't good enough.

406
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.139
You caused a damage, so you need to compensate.

407
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.770
How much?

408
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.869
100.

409
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.710
100,000 dollars?

410
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:24.750
Okay.

411
00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:36.329
I injected a tranquilizer.

412
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.859
So let her have a good sleep.

413
00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:41.160
Okay.

414
00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.349
Hey.

415
00:28:00.319 --> 00:28:01.349
Ji Soo?

416
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.250
Ji Soo. Ji Soo.

417
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.319
Hey.

418
00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:10.190
What are you doing?

419
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.589
It's Ji Soo.

420
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.629
Goodness, did you two drink together?

421
00:28:16.369 --> 00:28:17.700
How could you make her drink...

422
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.470
to the point of passing out?

423
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.700
It wasn't me.

424
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.910
I was on the way home, and she was sitting here.

425
00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:25.109
I called her, and she didn't answer me.

426
00:28:25.109 --> 00:28:27.079
I thought she was drunk, so I shook her,

427
00:28:27.079 --> 00:28:28.280
and she collapsed.

428
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.049
Did something happen between you two?

429
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.319
Me?

430
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.149
She was fine when she was going home.

431
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.750
Ji Soo.

432
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:39.859
Her hands are freezing.

433
00:28:39.859 --> 00:28:41.190
- Put her on your back. - What?

434
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.059
Put her on your back. Hurry up.

435
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.030
This way.

436
00:28:53.639 --> 00:28:56.339
My goodness. What's going on?

437
00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.539
Look for her phone.

438
00:28:59.069 --> 00:29:00.510
We have to call her family.

439
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.510
- Hurry. - Excuse me.

440
00:29:06.109 --> 00:29:07.980
She doesn't have a phone with her.

441
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.720
She's got nothing.

442
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.260
What do we do with her?

443
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.760
She's got fever too.

444
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.990
It seems like she's down with flu.

445
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.460
I will call Ms. Sunwoo.

446
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.500
Okay.

447
00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:22.930
No, you punk!

448
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.500
I am sorry.

449
00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:30.010
It's just that...

450
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.740
Women are not allowed in my house.

451
00:29:34.379 --> 00:29:35.539
It's off-limits to women.

452
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.309
How about Ji Soo then?

453
00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:41.549
She's like a squirrel. She's not a woman.

454
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.549
I will watch her...

455
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:44.990
and take her home when she wakes up.

456
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.389
You should go now.

457
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:48.789
How can I leave her alone with you?

458
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:50.059
I was the one who found her.

459
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:51.990
I can't believe this.

460
00:29:52.129 --> 00:29:54.930
Do you mean you don't trust me?

461
00:29:55.329 --> 00:29:57.670
You won't let me call Ms. Sunwoo.

462
00:29:58.829 --> 00:29:59.839
My goodness.

463
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.940
Right. I guess it's understandable.

464
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.109
I guess you could misunderstand me.

465
00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.280
Then you should stay here too.

466
00:30:08.639 --> 00:30:09.710
What?

467
00:30:09.879 --> 00:30:12.180
I am sure she will wake up after about 30 minutes.

468
00:30:45.849 --> 00:30:49.990
(Sunwoo Hyuk)

469
00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:14.680
Miss, you need to get changed.

470
00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:19.619
Miss.

471
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:25.990
Yes.

472
00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:51.910
Hello?

473
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.379
Hae Ja,

474
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.920
did Ji Soo go to your place?

475
00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:58.849
Ji Soo?

476
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:02.859
What happened to Ji Soo?

477
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:05.460
Did she run away from home?

478
00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:07.700
No. You should go back to sleep.

479
00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:10.230
Ji Soo.

480
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.039
Where did she go without a jacket?

481
00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.609
She wasn't herself when she was entering.

482
00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.780
She didn't smell of alcohol.

483
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.089
She's burning up.

484
00:33:03.089 --> 00:33:04.549
We need to wake her up.

485
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.960
Miss. Miss.

486
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.190
Miss.

487
00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:13.530
Miss. You are very sick.

488
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.299
She needs to go to the hospital.

489
00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:18.530
Miss, do you want me to call home?

490
00:33:18.569 --> 00:33:19.940
No.

491
00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:23.309
I don't need to go to the hospital.

492
00:33:24.639 --> 00:33:26.139
Just...

493
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.149
Just let me be.

494
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.760
What?

495
00:33:54.369 --> 00:33:55.599
Where did she go?

496
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.639
"I am sorry, Mr. Baker."

497
00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:05.010
"I will borrow 30 dollars for taxi fare."

498
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.420
She left.

499
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:32.140
Ji Soo.

500
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.540
Didn't you get cold?

501
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.220
Is it true that you did that?

502
00:34:41.319 --> 00:34:43.490
Did you really do that?

503
00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:49.260
I am sorry, Ji Soo.

504
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.200
I am sorry for what I did.

505
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:57.600
What I did was terrible.

506
00:34:59.939 --> 00:35:01.299
But at the time, I...

507
00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:02.470
Stop it.

508
00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:06.410
I don't want to hear anything.

509
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.450
Ji An isn't home yet.

510
00:35:24.729 --> 00:35:26.729
This is Ji An's dad.

511
00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:30.499
I was wondering if you got a call...

512
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.430
from Ji An today.

513
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.839
No, she didn't call me.

514
00:35:35.899 --> 00:35:39.740
Okay. This may sound a little strange,

515
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.580
but Ji An isn't answering my calls.

516
00:35:43.149 --> 00:35:44.680
Do you know her other friends'...

517
00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:49.180
I'll call her friends and get back to you.

518
00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:51.990
Okay. Thank you.

519
00:35:56.459 --> 00:35:59.930
The number you have dialed is not in service.

520
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.769
Ji An.

521
00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:07.069
Where are you?

522
00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:10.769
Please give me a call.

523
00:36:12.609 --> 00:36:14.979
I'm so sorry.

524
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.280
Ji An, I'm really sorry.

525
00:36:19.649 --> 00:36:20.780
But...

526
00:36:22.049 --> 00:36:23.220
come back home.

527
00:36:25.419 --> 00:36:26.490
Okay?

528
00:36:31.629 --> 00:36:32.729
Ji Soo.

529
00:36:36.729 --> 00:36:37.899
Ji Soo.

530
00:36:38.799 --> 00:36:39.899
Ji Soo.

531
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.140
So this is what it is?

532
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.709
Your real daughter is Ji An, right?

533
00:36:47.609 --> 00:36:49.510
You're only worried about Ji An.

534
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:53.549
Ji Soo, that's not it.

535
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.379
Even before I came back...

536
00:36:56.749 --> 00:36:58.519
Even before you apologized to me,

537
00:36:59.589 --> 00:37:01.459
you were just worried about Ji An.

538
00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:03.229
Are you afraid she'd die or something?

539
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.100
Are you worried she got kicked out of the house?

540
00:37:08.629 --> 00:37:09.870
Because she's your real daughter?

541
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.069
How could you do this to me?

542
00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:17.839
So I'm not your daughter?

543
00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:22.010
Ji Soo, that's not true.

544
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.410
This isn't what it is.

545
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.479
Then why did you send Ji An to the family?

546
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.280
You sent her because she's your real daughter.

547
00:37:28.919 --> 00:37:32.220
She is your real daughter. That's why you sent her.

548
00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:35.459
Ji Soo.

549
00:37:35.919 --> 00:37:38.990
Please listen to what I'm saying.

550
00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:41.760
You felt sorry for me, so you bought me an oven.

551
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.399
So you told me to go study abroad.

552
00:37:46.939 --> 00:37:48.999
Just to send me away...

553
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:51.109
from Ji An.

554
00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:54.379
No, that's not it. I didn't mean any of that.

555
00:37:54.879 --> 00:37:56.410
Ji Soo, that's not true.

556
00:37:57.479 --> 00:37:58.749
I'm sorry.

557
00:37:58.979 --> 00:38:02.280
I'm so sorry, Ji Soo. It's all my fault.

558
00:38:02.379 --> 00:38:04.890
I'm really sorry.

559
00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:06.019
I...

560
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.689
wasn't your daughter.

561
00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:11.030
You just raised me...

562
00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:14.930
instead of your dead daughter.

563
00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:02.080
All right. What you've done is inexcusable,

564
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.609
but I'll let you talk.

565
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.549
First of all, Ji An didn't know when she came here.

566
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.649
As soon as she found out, she told me about it.

567
00:39:10.819 --> 00:39:12.189
As I told you last night,

568
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.620
I told her to wait until the event is over.

569
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:17.129
It was an important event for us.

570
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.100
She wanted to beg for your mercy...

571
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:24.430
after completing the event successfully.

572
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:25.970
Do you think it can be an excuse?

573
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.499
I already introduced her to my acquaintances.

574
00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:29.709
What good is it completing the event?

575
00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.310
So you felt pity for Ji An.

576
00:39:33.939 --> 00:39:35.240
I think so.

577
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.879
She didn't do anything wrong.

578
00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.819
It's her fault that she's their daughter.

579
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:41.649
You can't say she's innocent.

580
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.390
You watched the whole process of the event.

581
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.459
You know how hard she worked for that.

582
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.359
Do Kyung, are you saying...

583
00:39:50.129 --> 00:39:53.160
you want us to forgive her parents because of that?

584
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:57.769
That's impossible.

585
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.140
I won't let it slide. It's nothing but an excuse.

586
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.669
I'll never forgive her and even you.

587
00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:05.740
Dad.

588
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.640
You should've told us the second you heard that.

589
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.049
You should've let us get things right immediately.

590
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:14.120
So Ra's mom called me and asked after her yesterday.

591
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.390
If things go wrong, your engagement will be broken.

592
00:40:17.549 --> 00:40:18.950
But you were buying time.

593
00:40:19.089 --> 00:40:21.790
How'd you run a company with such poor judgement?

594
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.260
What are you going to do then?

595
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.200
I don't want to talk about it with you.

596
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.069
I'll take care of getting things right.

597
00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:44.749
They wouldn't know if I sold these stocks.

598
00:40:46.249 --> 00:40:48.049
(The application for sale has been completed.)

599
00:40:59.799 --> 00:41:02.700
I can't raise my kid alone with 100,000 dollars.

600
00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:03.870
I want 500,000 dollars.

601
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.269
What is she talking about? Why would she divorce?

602
00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.640
I can't believe this.

603
00:41:12.439 --> 00:41:14.439
- A letter of resignation? - Yes.

604
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.049
It was on my desk.

605
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.510
Ji An left her letter of resignation.

606
00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.049
And her phone is turned off.

607
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:24.589
She already cleared out her desk.

608
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:28.089
She even left me a note about her work...

609
00:41:28.089 --> 00:41:29.419
regarding the event.

610
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.089
I don't understand why she's doing this.

611
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.100
She must have a reason.

612
00:41:34.499 --> 00:41:35.560
I see.

613
00:41:36.399 --> 00:41:37.470
Pardon?

614
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:42.399
So we can proceed with the event without her?

615
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.810
Yes.

616
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.910
Then I'll accept her resignation.

617
00:41:49.649 --> 00:41:50.709
Okay.

618
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.589
(Letter of Resignation)

619
00:41:59.249 --> 00:42:01.519
(Letter of Resignation)

620
00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:03.930
I submit a resignation for personal reasons.

621
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.859
Thank you for everything.

622
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.109
(Contact list)

623
00:42:17.269 --> 00:42:18.310
(Seo Ji An)

624
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.580
The number you have dialed is not in service.

625
00:42:23.879 --> 00:42:26.519
Please leave a message after the beep.

626
00:42:34.419 --> 00:42:35.720
I'm sorry about yesterday.

627
00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.030
You should've told me sooner.

628
00:42:41.399 --> 00:42:42.459
Then...

629
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.100
I would've come home with you.

630
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:49.939
Ji An.

631
00:42:51.209 --> 00:42:52.640
I'll prevent...

632
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.640
what you're worried about.

633
00:42:56.749 --> 00:42:57.810
So...

634
00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:00.680
don't worry about your parents.

635
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.649
Get some rest at home...

636
00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.890
and call me once you get better.

637
00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:13.830
The job I got you.

638
00:43:14.359 --> 00:43:15.760
They didn't hire you because of me.

639
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.729
If the whole thing didn't happen,

640
00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:21.870
we would've wanted to keep you in this company.

641
00:43:24.939 --> 00:43:25.970
Give me a call.

642
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.189
We should...

643
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.030
go to the police.

644
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.200
We should find Ji An first.

645
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.740
Where would we find her?

646
00:43:54.169 --> 00:43:56.370
Just stay home and take care of Ji Soo.

647
00:44:01.439 --> 00:44:03.580
(No Myung Hee)

648
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:17.060
Are you going out to find Ji An?

649
00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:20.229
No. I'm going out with you.

650
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:23.229
Let's go out for air. I can't stay at home.

651
00:44:23.999 --> 00:44:25.269
What about Ji An?

652
00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:28.200
She won't come home for a while.

653
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.410
She wouldn't want to see our parents yet.

654
00:44:33.479 --> 00:44:36.040
She'll come back after calming herself a little.

655
00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:48.290
I don't know what to say, Ji Soo.

656
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.129
You didn't know about it?

657
00:44:51.629 --> 00:44:52.629
Hey.

658
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:55.330
I'm sorry, Soo A.

659
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:10.109
Hi.

660
00:45:10.979 --> 00:45:12.109
How are you feeling?

661
00:45:12.979 --> 00:45:14.419
What happened?

662
00:45:14.819 --> 00:45:16.220
Sorry about yesterday.

663
00:45:17.049 --> 00:45:18.589
I'll put the money back.

664
00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:20.959
That's not important.

665
00:45:21.189 --> 00:45:22.359
Are you okay?

666
00:45:23.129 --> 00:45:24.160
I'm fine.

667
00:45:25.229 --> 00:45:26.499
The bread's out.

668
00:45:27.459 --> 00:45:30.530
You can take the day off if you want.

669
00:45:31.299 --> 00:45:33.470
No, I want to work.

670
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.999
I won't ask again.

671
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.439
Are you sure you're okay?

672
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:38.109
Yes.

673
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.780
I have nowhere else to go.

674
00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:01.060
She was always so bright and cheerful.

675
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.560
What happened?

676
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.269
There must be a reason why...

677
00:46:04.269 --> 00:46:05.629
she was outside the bakery...

678
00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:07.339
at night in just a hoodie.

679
00:46:09.499 --> 00:46:12.609
I should go and get the bread myself.

680
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.010
You'll go? Yourself?

681
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.510
I feel terrible that she came to work.

682
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:21.280
I should bring some hot yuzu tea with me.

683
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.970
Hi, Ji Soo.

684
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:46.410
What brings you here?

685
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.140
I came for the bread.

686
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.180
I was going to bring it to you later.

687
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.519
I heard from Mr. Sunwoo.

688
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:55.319
You were sick last night.

689
00:46:56.689 --> 00:46:59.490
I made this yuzu tea.

690
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.160
It's packed with vitamin C and is good for colds.

691
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.589
Thank you.

692
00:47:04.359 --> 00:47:06.899
This is for your boss.

693
00:47:07.229 --> 00:47:09.999
I brought him an Americano to wake him up.

694
00:47:09.999 --> 00:47:12.999
My boss can't drink coffee.

695
00:47:13.569 --> 00:47:14.640
Can't he?

696
00:47:16.609 --> 00:47:19.609
Is he not in at the moment?

697
00:47:20.939 --> 00:47:23.549
He was here a while ago.

698
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.950
Maybe he went to the toilet.

699
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.850
I wanted to say hello.

700
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.089
I'll just take the bread.

701
00:47:31.089 --> 00:47:33.689
He usually sets your loaves aside.

702
00:47:33.689 --> 00:47:34.919
Where are they?

703
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.290
The bread smells lovely.

704
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:46.939
Mr. Baker.

705
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.970
What's wrong? What are you doing?

706
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:05.890
Why...

707
00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:11.189
Why are you here, Kang Nam Goo?

708
00:48:16.129 --> 00:48:18.930
Do you really want to sell this?

709
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.280
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

710
00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.749
Hello, Ms. Choi Seo Hyun.

711
00:48:36.519 --> 00:48:38.019
I can pay you tomorrow...

712
00:48:38.019 --> 00:48:39.290
when my shares are sold.

713
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:40.589
Set the time and place.

714
00:48:41.419 --> 00:48:44.729
Keep your promise that you won't get divorced.

715
00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:46.959
How much will you give me?

716
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.959
You asked for 500,000 dollars.

717
00:48:49.569 --> 00:48:51.600
Are you worth 500,000 dollars?

718
00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:53.470
These photos will ruin your life,

719
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.040
not just your chances of marriage.

720
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.169
700,000 dollars.

721
00:48:59.109 --> 00:49:00.580
She wants 700,000 dollars.

722
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.580
Do you know how hard it was...

723
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.979
to get 500,000 dollars in secret?

724
00:49:06.379 --> 00:49:08.419
I sold enough shares so no one would notice,

725
00:49:08.419 --> 00:49:10.120
and even the cello my grandpa got me...

726
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.890
when I started university.

727
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:14.919
I was so ashamed to walk into the second-hand shop.

728
00:49:15.959 --> 00:49:18.089
She can't go up to 700,000 dollars.

729
00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:20.030
I can't get any more money.

730
00:49:21.499 --> 00:49:24.269
Will she divorce me for that much?

731
00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:27.339
I can look after you...

732
00:49:27.499 --> 00:49:29.200
if she'll divorce me.

733
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.479
You'll do what? Look after me?

734
00:49:34.209 --> 00:49:36.180
Why? Who said you could?

735
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:38.709
We got married because...

736
00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:41.249
she got pregnant by mistake.

737
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.589
We didn't love each other.

738
00:49:45.919 --> 00:49:46.959
I...

739
00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:50.790
I finally felt...

740
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.100
true love after meeting you.

741
00:49:53.129 --> 00:49:54.399
Don't turn around.

742
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:00.970
Ryu.

743
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.510
I'll be very clear.

744
00:50:04.339 --> 00:50:05.370
Stop.

745
00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.140
What?

746
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.049
I said stop. You promised.

747
00:50:10.049 --> 00:50:12.149
You said you'd stop when I said so.

748
00:50:13.379 --> 00:50:15.180
My brakes are broken.

749
00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:16.990
What?

750
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:19.720
I can't stop.

751
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.959
Why? What's wrong with you?

752
00:50:22.959 --> 00:50:25.089
I said we're not meant to be.

753
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.799
People die when brakes fail.

754
00:50:27.799 --> 00:50:28.859
I don't care...

755
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.229
if I die.

756
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.569
If I'm with you.

757
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.569
What are you doing?

758
00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.129
When should I tell Mom?

759
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.030
Is this how a criminal feels...

760
00:51:03.229 --> 00:51:04.870
before he turns himself in?

761
00:51:10.669 --> 00:51:12.310
(Cinderella)

762
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.240
I thought it was Mom.

763
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:17.580
I'm not working tonight.

764
00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:19.410
Let's meet up.

765
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.850
What?

766
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.120
Ji An was under a lot of pressure.

767
00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:30.359
She was in charge of a huge company project.

768
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.799
She wanted to confess after it succeeded...

769
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.030
to earn your forgiveness.

770
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:39.430
That's what she wanted.

771
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.640
I guess it didn't work out.

772
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:46.040
What? What did you say?

773
00:51:47.939 --> 00:51:50.810
Ji An can't come to the wedding.

774
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.580
She has to go on a business trip.

775
00:51:53.819 --> 00:51:55.519
Look over here and smile.

776
00:51:55.519 --> 00:51:57.950
Are you ready? 1, 2, 3.

777
00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:00.519
How did you manage?

778
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.359
I'm on my way to the airport.

779
00:52:02.359 --> 00:52:03.790
I have to go right away.

780
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.060
Mom, Dad, bye.

781
00:52:16.169 --> 00:52:17.510
She'll call me...

782
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.180
once she gets her wits back.

783
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.209
She has nowhere else to go.

784
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.910
Exactly.

785
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:26.749
That's the thing.

786
00:52:33.519 --> 00:52:36.390
She won't like to know that...

787
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.189
I came to see you.

788
00:52:39.799 --> 00:52:42.359
Can you keep calling her?

789
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.030
If you get through to her,

790
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.899
tell her to come home.

791
00:52:46.999 --> 00:52:48.299
No, no.

792
00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.010
Just a call.

793
00:52:51.769 --> 00:52:54.839
Tell her to give me a call.

794
00:52:55.479 --> 00:52:58.350
She'll be reluctant to call us herself.

795
00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:00.879
Okay. I'll tell her that.

796
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.649
I'm in no position to ask for favors.

797
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.959
Please help me out.

798
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.129
If she calls me,

799
00:53:10.129 --> 00:53:13.530
I'll contact you right away.

800
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.930
You do that. Thank you.

801
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.799
Please keep trying.

802
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.069
I will.

803
00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:23.470
Bye.

804
00:53:31.979 --> 00:53:33.850
Oh dear...

805
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:10.089
Don't kneel.

806
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.819
Sit over there.

807
00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:21.700
I can't dare.

808
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.899
If you feel bad, sit.

809
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.510
I'll be very direct.

810
00:54:38.249 --> 00:54:40.419
I called you over...

811
00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.850
so you can take your daughter's things.

812
00:54:47.689 --> 00:54:48.720
Ms. Min.

813
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.530
Show her the way.

814
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.450
I won't go.

815
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:20.649
This is home. I lived here for 25 years.

816
00:56:20.749 --> 00:56:23.450
The mom and dad I had for 25 years are mine.

817
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.260
Ji Soo, Ji Tae, and Ji Ho were family...

818
00:56:26.459 --> 00:56:27.720
for 25 years.

819
00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:29.629
So, I won't go.

820
00:56:30.959 --> 00:56:32.160
I can't handle you.

821
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.600
It's one less mouth to feed.

822
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.069
How can you tell me...

823
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.200
to leave so easily?

824
00:57:15.769 --> 00:57:16.870
Sit down.

825
00:57:28.819 --> 00:57:30.049
Is that it?

826
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:36.060
Yes.

827
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:39.600
You're right.

828
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.030
I bought her the rest.

829
00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:43.870
I decorated her room.

830
00:57:44.129 --> 00:57:45.999
For my daughter to use and wear.

831
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.769
Your daughter fell for your tricks...

832
00:57:49.769 --> 00:57:51.769
and used and wore it all.

833
00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:53.709
It was me.

834
00:57:55.379 --> 00:57:58.109
I'm the one who deceived you and your husband.

835
00:57:59.049 --> 00:58:00.249
Ji An and...

836
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:02.649
my husband knew nothing.

837
00:58:03.919 --> 00:58:05.589
My husband tried to stopped me.

838
00:58:06.089 --> 00:58:08.160
I guess he failed.

839
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.990
Because you were so smart.

840
00:58:12.189 --> 00:58:13.700
I just blurted it out.

841
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.700
I had lost my mind.

842
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:19.330
Ji Soo and Ji An...

843
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.370
meant the same to me.

844
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:26.310
Ji Soo had...

845
00:58:27.209 --> 00:58:29.010
no complaints in life,

846
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.280
but Ji An struggled...

847
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.080
She had no complaints?

848
00:58:34.319 --> 00:58:36.049
She lives in a shack,

849
00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:39.149
works at a bakery, and she had no complaints?

850
00:58:40.189 --> 00:58:41.319
Ji Soo...

851
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.189
I apologize.

852
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.060
That's not what I meant.

853
00:58:48.899 --> 00:58:51.200
Did your daughter mean that much to you?

854
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:54.740
You forced my girl to stay and be poor...

855
00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.269
and sent yours to us?

856
00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.540
Please kill me, ma'am.

857
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:02.950
Why would I kill you?

858
00:59:03.209 --> 00:59:04.780
Death is too easy.

859
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.850
I will kill your daughter.

860
00:59:10.819 --> 00:59:11.950
Seo Ji An.

861
00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:13.819
Ma'am.

862
00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.930
Your precious daughter, Seo Ji An.

863
00:59:17.689 --> 00:59:19.899
She'll never get a decent job again.

864
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.560
I'll make her live like you.

865
00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:25.569
Watch how she manages until the day you die.

866
00:59:26.769 --> 00:59:27.839
Ji An...

867
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:30.510
was duped into coming here.

868
00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:34.939
I'll go to the police and pay for my crimes.

869
00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:36.810
Please leave Ji An alone.

870
00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:39.950
I did you wrong. Please... Please.

871
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:41.149
Yang Mi Jung.

872
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:43.689
Don't you dare quit the restaurant I gave you.

873
00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.790
Seo Ji Tae, Lee Soo A, Seo Ji Ho.

874
00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:48.620
They'll all live in the dark ages if you do.

875
00:59:50.629 --> 00:59:52.490
You sold your daughter to make money.

876
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.999
Live with it forever.

877
00:59:55.129 --> 00:59:57.200
Feed your daughter with that money.

878
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.870
Ms. Min.

879
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:05.040
See her out.

880
01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:35.839
Was she here like this all night?

881
01:00:36.169 --> 01:00:39.939
She moaned all night like a ghost.

882
01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.010
Some people even left complaining.

883
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:46.720
I'm scared she might die.

884
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.620
Is she on drugs?

885
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:51.890
We should do something. Call the police.

886
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:54.459
Ask them what to do when this happens.

887
01:00:55.459 --> 01:00:56.729
- Oh dear. - What now?

888
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:59.660
I'm okay.

889
01:00:59.999 --> 01:01:01.260
She can talk.

890
01:01:04.569 --> 01:01:05.669
Oh dear.

891
01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:08.299
Water.

892
01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:13.709
Can you give me some water?

893
01:01:13.709 --> 01:01:16.080
- Yes, yes. - Water, of course.

894
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:27.519
Thank you.

895
01:01:39.569 --> 01:01:40.640
Yes.

896
01:01:41.669 --> 01:01:42.839
I care for you.

897
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:45.769
But why should I admit to that?

898
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.879
Why do you care?

899
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:49.950
What...

900
01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.310
do you want from me?

901
01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.649
You and I...

902
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.749
have different paths.

903
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:59.589
What do you expect of me?

904
01:02:00.689 --> 01:02:02.319
Why do you look at me like that?

905
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.390
I felt attracted.

906
01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:07.299
I admit to that.

907
01:02:07.459 --> 01:02:09.799
I felt attracted. So what? A kiss?

908
01:02:09.999 --> 01:02:11.200
I can kiss you 100 times.

909
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.200
But that's...

910
01:02:13.899 --> 01:02:15.040
all it can be.

911
01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:17.939
However much I like you,

912
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.180
I must...

913
01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:23.450
marry Jang So Ra. No, I will marry her.

914
01:02:24.249 --> 01:02:26.379
You live a life that suits you.

915
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:29.180
I'll go on living mine.

916
01:02:30.149 --> 01:02:31.220
So...

917
01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.859
don't expect anything from me.

918
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:41.600
Help me.

919
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.569
When I tell your parents today,

920
01:02:45.169 --> 01:02:47.240
I'd like you to be there with me.

921
01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.669
That's my last favor.

922
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:51.240
Help me.

923
01:02:56.264 --> 01:03:01.264
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

924
01:03:05.689 --> 01:03:06.760
Ji An.

925
01:03:07.519 --> 01:03:09.060
Where are you?

926
01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.729
Will you please call me?

927
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.169
I'm so sorry.

928
01:03:28.979 --> 01:03:30.280
Seo Ji An.

929
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:33.580
Why won't you call me?

930
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:42.790
How did you get in?

931
01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:45.430
Don't unpack it here. I'll eat it outside.

932
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:46.760
My colleagues will be back.

933
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.129
Ji Soo.

934
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:50.629
Goodbye.

935
01:03:51.629 --> 01:03:52.769
And...

936
01:03:53.769 --> 01:03:55.169
don't come here again.

937
01:03:55.669 --> 01:03:57.740
You can't come to the wedding?

938
01:03:57.839 --> 01:03:59.740
My business trip was already scheduled.

939
01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.609
The wedding was so sudden.

940
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:05.950
Seo Ji An.

941
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.479
Did you know already?

942
01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:18.359
(Ji An)

943
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:23.129
The phone is turned off.

944
01:04:23.129 --> 01:04:25.629
Please leave a message after the beep.

945
01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:35.740
I can't eat.

946
01:04:37.209 --> 01:04:39.379
I only brought some soup.

947
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:41.850
Can't you even eat this?

948
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.189
Thank you.

949
01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:48.819
Go straight to a hospital, okay?

950
01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.399
Does she have no family?

951
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.220
(Starting)

952
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:23.129
(Whiner, Ji Tae)

953
01:05:23.129 --> 01:05:25.390
(Mom, Dad, Whiner)

954
01:05:28.899 --> 01:05:31.299
(Whiner)

955
01:05:31.999 --> 01:05:33.439
Call me, Seo Ji An.

956
01:05:33.999 --> 01:05:35.470
I have to see you.

957
01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:37.769
Call me.

958
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:40.479
Why would you be a coward and turn off your phone?

959
01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:44.109
- Thank you. - Bye.

960
01:05:46.919 --> 01:05:49.249
(Ji An)

961
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.330
Ji Soo.
