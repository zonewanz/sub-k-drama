00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.556
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.450
Yes.

3
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.850
I cannot let that little kid die.

4
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:51.000
What are you doing here now?

5
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:52.731
I'll do it.

6
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.471
What?

7
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.941
I'll do what you asked me to do. I'll stay by your side at all times.

8
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.111
I'll be glued to you.

9
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.070
Is that right?

10
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.741
I'm glad to hear that.

11
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.310
So let's save his life.

12
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.511
Let's try to save that boy's life together.

13
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.720
Come on. Let's go.

14
00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:15.621
Where are we going?

15
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.131
To save that boy's life. I saw the shadow on him.

16
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:22.791
Seriously?

17
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.330
What kind of psycho can do that to such a little kid?

18
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.470
Anyway, if I ever catch him,

19
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:34.041
I'll put a million cockroaches inside him and sew him up.

20
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:35.771
About that shadow...

21
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.881
Are you sure that it was inside his body?

22
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:40.810
How can he bury a little boy alive?

23
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.151
He shouldn't call himself a human!

24
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.720
And he even threw chocolate bars at him.

25
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.791
That crazy... That insane psychopath.

26
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:51.560
The shadow wasn't inside his body, was it?

27
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:55.961
I wouldn't have been able to touch the shadow if it had been inside.

28
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:58.160
I wouldn't have been able to foresee how he'd die either.

29
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:00.631
Gosh, thank goodness.

30
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.440
I was lucky to touch it because it was outside his body.

31
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:05.101
Hey, wait.

32
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:06.841
You don't have time to get changed.

33
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.871
We don't know when that boy will die.

34
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.341
Let's go. We need to catch the culprit as soon as possible.

35
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:13.880
Oh, we just need to find a man with a bandage...

36
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.850
that has the "Excellent job" stamp on.

37
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.081
Let's go.

38
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:20.850
I'm busy.

39
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:22.551
Sorry? Wait.

40
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:25.760
You came all the way to my place to ask me to save lives with you.

41
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.790
Plus, how busy can you be at this late hour?

42
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.931
Here. Can't you see this?

43
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:36.000
What happened?

44
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.341
I must find the jerk who did this to me,

45
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.141
so go by yourself if you want to save that boy, okay?

46
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:43.810
Saving his life or not, do whatever you want.

47
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:47.380
Wait. That boy will die.

48
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:49.051
He'll be buried alive and die.

49
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:50.421
So what?

50
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:52.880
I want to know when you see the shadow inside, not outside!

51
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.750
Tell me when you see the black shadow inside someone's body, okay?

52
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:07.771
Why is he changing his words now?

53
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.970
You bonehead.

54
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.470
You said you wanted to save lives with me!

55
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.111
What an absurd jerk.

56
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.641
- Gosh, open the door! - That foul mouth of hers.

57
00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:21.250
How uncivilized. My gosh.

58
00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:22.810
For goodness' sake.

59
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.181
It's her, isn't it?

60
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:27.151
She's the woman we saw on the bridge, isn't she?

61
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:28.451
Yes, it's her.

62
00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.560
Why are you guys out here? She could've seen you.

63
00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:35.591
We're sorry.

64
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.630
By the way, why did she come to see you?

65
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.801
Did she say she'll do it? Will she be glued to you at all times?

66
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:43.801
I'll make her do it.

67
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.841
Why did you make her leave though?

68
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.111
She was pestering me about saving a boy.

69
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.681
How nosy. She has no idea that she's going to die herself.

70
00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:53.081
She should just help me find that loser.

71
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:54.780
Are you sure you want to leave her be like that?

72
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.350
If that woman ends up saving that boy's life,

73
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:01.750
how will you handle that?

74
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.621
I don't care whether she saves him or not. It has nothing to do with...

75
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.331
Hang on.

76
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.871
If that girl ends up saving that kid's life...

77
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:16.600
The kid destined to die will not die...

78
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:20.211
because of that woman you saved.

79
00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:23.441
What does that mean?

80
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.610
If you collected that woman's soul as planned,

81
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.180
she wouldn't be able to save the boy's life. Then ultimately...

82
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.850
Exactly.

83
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.951
The boy destined to die will live because of 444,

84
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.620
which means that he'll end up meddling in humans' affairs.

85
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.091
And what happens when we meddle in humans' life and death matters?

86
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:41.561
You might be put on the brink of perishment.

87
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.230
Your fate will be put in peril.

88
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.600
Gosh, stop using those idioms. You get them wrong all the time.

89
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.300
You've been watching too many historical dramas.

90
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.401
You brat.

91
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.410
I didn't think about that.

92
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:57.110
I must stop her.

93
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:03.651
Hey!

94
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.850
Hey!

95
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.490
Where did she go?

96
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:17.901
Hey.

97
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.740
What's going on? Has she already gone to save him?

98
00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:29.470
Gosh, she's so fast.

99
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.290
I knew that you'd come out from there again.

100
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.131
You stupid little... I know what's going on.

101
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:50.201
Hey, be honest with me.

102
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.701
About what?

103
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.930
You...

104
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.040
suffer from constipation, right?

105
00:06:05.141 --> 00:06:07.780
Hey, I need to button my pants. Gosh, let go of me!

106
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.410
Goodness gracious.

107
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.191
Gosh, you jerk. My hands feel icky.

108
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.331
Shall I have a cup of coffee?

109
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.771
- Let's see... - Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

110
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.370
That'd be nice.

111
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.381
Good. It's delicious.

112
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:47.591
Jerk, did you really have to take a sip?

113
00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:52.591
Isn't it good?

114
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.631
Now, it's your turn to do this for me.

115
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:57.901
My gosh, you make great coffee.

116
00:06:57.901 --> 00:06:59.061
It's delicious.

117
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:03.071
Oh, right. About that special forces agent...

118
00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:04.540
I heard that he ended up dead.

119
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.040
Gosh, it sounds like he and his wife loved each other very much.

120
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.540
- After his wife died, he wanted... - Cut it out. Just do it for me.

121
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:12.511
You can find where anyone is with their phone numbers alone.

122
00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:14.581
Gosh, you're such a handful.

123
00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:16.651
Hey, how many times have I told you?

124
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:19.821
You need to bring a warrant if you want to track anyone's location.

125
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:21.420
Gosh, you idiot.

126
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:26.360
Think about it. It's not like he's a suspect...

127
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.591
or somebody reported to us about him.

128
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.831
You may be a detective,

129
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.701
but it's illegal to track people's locations for no reason.

130
00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:35.030
You'll get arrested.

131
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.141
Move.

132
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.641
You little...

133
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:46.441
Gosh, I shall be the bigger person and put up with you.

134
00:07:46.441 --> 00:07:49.251
Hey, how can you call Captain Bong "short-legged grandpa"?

135
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:50.581
We even put up with that.

136
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:53.891
What would I gain by fighting a patient?

137
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:55.990
You must think that you can get away...

138
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.461
with anything because of that bullet in your head.

139
00:07:58.021 --> 00:08:00.160
Hey, you can try all you want, but it won't work.

140
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:02.160
You stubborn brat.

141
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.571
By the way, why isn't my wife picking up?

142
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:10.540
The phone is turned off.

143
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.670
Please leave a message after the tone.

144
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.011
After you're connected...

145
00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:17.881
Is she having an affair or what? Why isn't she picking up?

146
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.050
Seoun Police Station? Why does it say she's here?

147
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.691
Honey!

148
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.821
Honey!

149
00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:32.961
Surprise! I brought you some food.

150
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:42.031
(Seoun Police Station)

151
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:45.240
Seoun Police Station.

152
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:49.510
How does this thing know that she's here?

153
00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:55.451
It's so delicious. I'll give you some too.

154
00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.951
Now, I understand what people mean by "cringing".

155
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:00.990
Hey, how did you know...

156
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.461
that woman with chili pepper paste on her lips was here?

157
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.931
Is he talking about my lipstick now?

158
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:07.931
Honey.

159
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.061
Relax.

160
00:09:10.061 --> 00:09:11.961
I told you.

161
00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:15.431
He's not all there.

162
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.140
What?

163
00:09:20.841 --> 00:09:23.281
Oh, my darling's location?

164
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:25.041
I found her by using the Friend Locator.

165
00:09:25.041 --> 00:09:26.781
Friend Locator? I want to use it too.

166
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:30.120
Hey, you can't just start using it.

167
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.990
You must first add each other as friends like us lovebirds.

168
00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:36.691
But you already added her. Kang Ha Ram, right?

169
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.161
What?

170
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:40.031
- Let's eat. - Okay.

171
00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:41.191
When did this happen?

172
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:43.701
Bye, kids.

173
00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:46.130
Daddy, we want fried chicken. Buy us fried chicken!

174
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.931
Okay. See you later!

175
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:03.821
I'm hungry.

176
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:39.681
Who is it?

177
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.620
Hello, ma'am. I'm Geon Young's homeroom teacher.

178
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.390
- Hello. - Hello.

179
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.831
Sir, what brings you here?

180
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:50.760
I was in the area to take care of something,

181
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.801
and I thought I should go to school with Geon Young.

182
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:55.230
Actually, I was just about to call you.

183
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.600
He had diarrhea all night because he went out and ate chocolate...

184
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.441
while I stepped out for a few minutes yesterday.

185
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.140
I think he should stay home and get some rest today.

186
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.110
How is he now?

187
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.250
I gave him some medicine, and he just fell asleep.

188
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.781
Oh, would you like to see him?

189
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:11.051
No, it's all right.

190
00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:13.890
Well, please give me a call when he wakes up.

191
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.821
- Sure. - Then I'll get going.

192
00:11:15.821 --> 00:11:17.291
- Oh, okay. - Take care.

193
00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:18.990
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

194
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:27.730
- Excuse me. - Yes?

195
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.240
Are you Geon Young's teacher?

196
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.140
Yes.

197
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:34.041
But who are you?

198
00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:36.811
I just wanted to ask you about something.

199
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:39.380
By any chance, does Geon Young know someone...

200
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.380
who has bandages wrapped around his hand...

201
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.791
That darn banana.

202
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.390
Are you okay?

203
00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:54.331
- Are you all right? - Gosh.

204
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:55.730
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:57.931 --> 00:12:01.671
My gosh, why did that banana have to be on the street?

206
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.140
He isn't seriously hurt, is he?

207
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.640
What?

208
00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:12.610
- Hang in there. - Okay.

209
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.081
No way.

210
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:32.801
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

211
00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:36.301
It's nothing but just a little tear.

212
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.100
I can remove the bandages in a few days.

213
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.341
What was the thing you wanted to ask me earlier?

214
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.781
Well, about that...

215
00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:52.720
I'm so forgetful these days. I have a hard time to remember things.

216
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.390
I think I wanted to ask you for directions.

217
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.730
Gosh, I'm going to be late for my class.

218
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:05.531
- Goodbye then. - Bye.

219
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.341
He can't be. No.

220
00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:16.640
The one who killed Geon Young...

221
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.510
had bandages with a stamp on it.

222
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.451
It's different. He's not the one.

223
00:13:27.821 --> 00:13:29.390
I'm sure she's here.

224
00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:34.561
Gosh, where did she go again?

225
00:13:38.931 --> 00:13:42.331
What? What's wrong with this? No, no. Hey!

226
00:13:44.341 --> 00:13:45.341
Why now?

227
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.681
I see. It must be that kid. Right.

228
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.591
If I follow him, I'll be able to stop Ha Ram.

229
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.500
Now, let's see how well your drawings are.

230
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.211
What's this? Who are these?

231
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:22.211
Are they your parents?

232
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.941
Give me a high five.

233
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:25.281
Okay.

234
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.411
- Well, this looks good. - Doesn't the heart look nice?

235
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:32.150
Yes, it looks very nice. I think it'd be good to color it yellow.

236
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.321
Let's see.

237
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.291
Is there a tomato as big as that?

238
00:14:37.591 --> 00:14:39.161
You're so mischievous.

239
00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:41.531
That's right. He even saved me from that accident.

240
00:14:43.431 --> 00:14:45.801
That kind of a man would never kill Geon Young.

241
00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.600
Your drawing looks so good.

242
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.341
Please stamp my drawing then. Please stamp it.

243
00:14:51.341 --> 00:14:52.740
- Shall I stamp it? - Yes.

244
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.640
Okay. I'll stamp your drawings. Bring your drawings to me.

245
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.211
Here. Well done.

246
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.520
Is this Pikachu?

247
00:15:07.591 --> 00:15:09.091
Here you go.

248
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:11.990
You did such a great job, so I'll stamp it hard.

249
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:20.431
Hey.

250
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.941
What is this?

251
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:29.270
What are you doing?

252
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.181
My bandages have an "Excellent job" stamp now.

253
00:15:33.911 --> 00:15:35.681
I stamped his bandages.

254
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:56.230
Hey, Bowl Cut.

255
00:15:58.301 --> 00:15:59.870
Bowl Cut.

256
00:16:02.341 --> 00:16:04.581
Do you know how expensive it was to have this hair done?

257
00:16:05.311 --> 00:16:08.610
Also, my name isn't Bowl Cut. It's Han Jin Sook.

258
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:10.681
Why are you wandering around this late in the night?

259
00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:12.650
Clara might kick you out.

260
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.691
- I'm going to see my friend. - Your friend?

261
00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:17.220
You have no friends.

262
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.760
I do have friends. Seriously.

263
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.230
You silly.

264
00:16:24.031 --> 00:16:25.130
Did she hurt her leg?

265
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.171
No, she has polio.

266
00:16:29.431 --> 00:16:30.470
Because of that, it looks like...

267
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:34.071
her parents abandoned her at an orphanage when she was little.

268
00:16:35.311 --> 00:16:37.811
She lives in a bar doing chores now.

269
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.740
I feel so bad for her.

270
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.311
She's such a good kid.

271
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.551
(Corporal Song Jae Geun)

272
00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:32.301
(Escaped before the crackdown. Did someone leak information?)

273
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.200
(Possibility of teenage prostitution, can it be Bowl Cut?)

274
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:43.311
(Loser)

275
00:17:45.241 --> 00:17:48.850
This phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

276
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:53.450
We need to find a man in bandages with an "Excellent job" stamp.

277
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:54.950
Let's go.

278
00:17:55.821 --> 00:17:58.261
Go by yourself if you want to save that boy, okay?

279
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:00.660
Saving his life or not, do whatever you want.

280
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:04.301
Wait. That boy will die.

281
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:07.100
- He'll be buried alive and die. - So what?

282
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.880
Why aren't you coming to work?

283
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.011
Aren't you going to report to me the VIP list you checked yesterday?

284
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.180
Sir, something urgent came up.

285
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.350
Could you find out information about someone in a hurry?

286
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.150
- What? - You got...

287
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.690
my number and address through someone you know in the police.

288
00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.920
He's a teacher at Sarang Elementary School in Moojin.

289
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.561
I don't know his name. He seems to be in his early or mid 30s.

290
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.130
I'll send you his picture now. Thank you.

291
00:18:39.231 --> 00:18:40.831
Ms. Fortune-teller!

292
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.900
My gosh.

293
00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:49.440
Does she think I'm a private detective?

294
00:18:55.511 --> 00:18:57.420
What? Mr. Song.

295
00:18:58.281 --> 00:18:59.650
Hi, Man Soo.

296
00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:02.091
You're here. It must be hard for you.

297
00:19:02.091 --> 00:19:04.660
Not at all. Are you visiting my dad?

298
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.160
Yes. How is he?

299
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.630
- Who is that? - What?

300
00:19:14.231 --> 00:19:15.531
He's a police officer.

301
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:17.170
He patrols our neighborhood sometimes.

302
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.241
You didn't tell him anything, did you?

303
00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:24.110
Of course not. If I did, Clara will kick me out.

304
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:35.890
- I'm sorry. I've been busy. - It's okay.

305
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.660
- I'll take you to his room. - Would you?

306
00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:42.331
- Excuse me. - Gosh.

307
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.301
Doctor.

308
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.501
Here. You dropped your pen.

309
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.311
Thank you.

310
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.430
- Man Soo. - Yes?

311
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.960
I'm sure you're busy. You can go now.

312
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.231
I'll just see him for a while and leave.

313
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:55.771
Okay. Take care then.

314
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.221
All right. Congratulations on your promotion. Cheers.

315
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.021
- Thank you. - Also,

316
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.920
I wish your business...

317
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.821
to grow beyond Moojin and nationwide. Cheers!

318
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:20.731
That watch looks new.

319
00:21:21.231 --> 00:21:25.160
It looks very unique and classy.

320
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.400
- It's expensive, right? - This is not a watch.

321
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.100
It's an artwork.

322
00:21:30.301 --> 00:21:32.140
It's made by a Swiss master craftsman,

323
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.511
Schneider El... Something. El...

324
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:39.011
I can't remember. Anyway, it's made by a world-famous craftsman.

325
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:42.311
He even made all of the parts himself too.

326
00:21:42.781 --> 00:21:45.850
Schneider? No wonder.

327
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.850
It's so luxurious.

328
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.991
Surely, you should wear something like this...

329
00:21:50.991 --> 00:21:52.920
as the president of Chunsu Insurance.

330
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.360
It will make you look dignified as the president.

331
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.531
By the way, how much is it?

332
00:21:57.531 --> 00:22:00.071
I don't know. Someone gave it to me as a gift.

333
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.370
Anyway, to your success.

334
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.001
- Cheers. - Cheers.

335
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:18.680
I'm sure it was his watch.

336
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.620
Are the things written on it true?

337
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.360
Is what the woman named Clara said really true?

338
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.321
She says you got sexual favors from a teenage girl. Is that true?

339
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.390
Please answer me now!

340
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.360
- I... - Why did you do that?

341
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.531
Are you insane?

342
00:22:31.531 --> 00:22:33.301
If we start investigating...

343
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.831
Jae Geun.

344
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.940
I must have been out of my mind back then.

345
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.700
I know I did something crazy.

346
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.511
If people find out about this, it'll ruin my company and my family.

347
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.841
It will destroy everything I've built.

348
00:22:45.841 --> 00:22:48.850
Look, Jae Geun. Please let this slide just once.

349
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.821
That hostess of the bar. Please silence her, would you?

350
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.450
Even if I did,

351
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.991
if that teenage girl tells the truth, it will end me too.

352
00:22:59.991 --> 00:23:02.630
I heard she ran away. She will never show up.

353
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.100
So please.

354
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.271
Man... Man Ho.

355
00:23:21.081 --> 00:23:23.011
Look who it is.

356
00:23:23.011 --> 00:23:24.350
It's been such a long time.

357
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.021
You look very nice now that you're a commissioner general.

358
00:23:28.021 --> 00:23:30.091
Your way of speaking still hasn't changed.

359
00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:35.890
Man Ho.

360
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.071
It's about the watch your dad used to wear back in Moojin.

361
00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:42.301
Do you remember it?

362
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.741
It had a butterfly shape.

363
00:23:44.741 --> 00:23:46.541
Oh, that watch.

364
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.370
He gave it to me...

365
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.581
when he and I were still on good terms.

366
00:23:51.281 --> 00:23:53.180
Why are you suddenly asking about it?

367
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.450
What?

368
00:23:57.981 --> 00:23:59.021
It's nothing.

369
00:24:00.821 --> 00:24:03.491
I just thought of the time when your dad was showing it off to me.

370
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.491
I didn't realize the time.

371
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:08.860
I should get going.

372
00:24:36.251 --> 00:24:38.721
Yes. It's me.

373
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.061
I must speak with you.

374
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:44.430
I'll go over there now, so let's talk in person.

375
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.960
Eun Hye. Eun Hye?

376
00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:57.801
Eun Hye.

377
00:26:01.541 --> 00:26:03.281
This darn brat.

378
00:26:10.334 --> 00:26:12.133
This darn brat.

379
00:26:20.173 --> 00:26:23.584
Gosh, why is he taking so long to find information about someone?

380
00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:26.754
Maybe he lied about how he had connections in the police.

381
00:26:53.873 --> 00:26:55.044
Hi, did you find out?

382
00:26:55.044 --> 00:26:57.044
He doesn't seem to have any problems.

383
00:26:57.044 --> 00:26:58.514
- Really? - Yes.

384
00:26:58.514 --> 00:27:01.014
His evaluation as a teacher is good,

385
00:27:01.014 --> 00:27:03.284
and he won the great educator award.

386
00:27:04.824 --> 00:27:07.193
He majored in special education in Paris.

387
00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:08.923
He also worked at a special-education school there.

388
00:27:08.923 --> 00:27:10.223
He's an elite.

389
00:27:10.223 --> 00:27:11.324
Really?

390
00:27:13.364 --> 00:27:15.364
Gosh, have I been mistaken?

391
00:27:15.463 --> 00:27:18.564
I think he worked all over in Europe and not just in France.

392
00:27:18.633 --> 00:27:19.933
He did a lot of volunteer work too.

393
00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:22.203
Okay. I have to go now.

394
00:27:22.203 --> 00:27:24.104
Hold on a second.

395
00:27:26.643 --> 00:27:28.074
What the...

396
00:27:32.643 --> 00:27:33.653
What is it?

397
00:27:34.054 --> 00:27:36.784
This... This jerk...

398
00:27:36.784 --> 00:27:38.453
What? What is it?

399
00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:40.754
This jerk was arrested in Paris...

400
00:27:40.754 --> 00:27:43.193
for child molestation and possession of child pornography.

401
00:27:44.824 --> 00:27:46.564
What? Child molestation?

402
00:27:46.893 --> 00:27:47.963
Child pornography?

403
00:27:47.963 --> 00:27:51.834
It says the victim was one of his mentally handicapped students.

404
00:27:51.864 --> 00:27:54.004
The prosecution was suspended because he fled back to Korea.

405
00:27:55.133 --> 00:27:57.844
Ms. Fortune-teller. How do you know this scumbag...

406
00:27:59.403 --> 00:28:00.514
Ms. Fortune-teller?

407
00:28:00.873 --> 00:28:02.943
So that's why he kidnapped and killed Geon Young.

408
00:28:03.913 --> 00:28:07.284
That jerk deserves to be covered in feces.

409
00:28:19.933 --> 00:28:21.034
My gosh.

410
00:28:21.264 --> 00:28:22.534
I'm sorry.

411
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.163
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

412
00:28:39.183 --> 00:28:41.784
Wait. This place is...

413
00:28:46.054 --> 00:28:47.893
Eun Hye.

414
00:28:47.893 --> 00:28:50.364
"Eun Hye"? Is that the name of your apartment?

415
00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:55.233
He was looking for his teacher's house, not his own.

416
00:28:55.794 --> 00:28:56.933
Eun Hye Apartment.

417
00:28:57.663 --> 00:28:59.433
Eun Hye. Eun Hye Apartment.

418
00:29:00.703 --> 00:29:01.733
Where...

419
00:29:10.084 --> 00:29:11.784
As soon as this jerk comes out, I'll kill him.

420
00:29:23.463 --> 00:29:25.594
What? Isn't that...

421
00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:31.034
Wait.

422
00:29:35.903 --> 00:29:39.304
Hi. I'm the person who took Geon Young to the police station.

423
00:29:39.304 --> 00:29:40.814
Is Geon Young home?

424
00:29:40.844 --> 00:29:42.443
You're watching him, right?

425
00:29:42.443 --> 00:29:43.943
Actually,

426
00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:45.344
- Geon Young disappeared... - Geon Young!

427
00:29:45.344 --> 00:29:46.883
while his mom was in the bathroom.

428
00:29:46.883 --> 00:29:49.483
- Geon Young! - We're looking for him now.

429
00:29:50.824 --> 00:29:51.983
No.

430
00:30:00.534 --> 00:30:01.663
No.

431
00:30:11.203 --> 00:30:13.213
Stop the car. Stop the car right now!

432
00:30:13.213 --> 00:30:14.544
Are you crazy?

433
00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:17.643
You're the woman...

434
00:30:18.084 --> 00:30:19.814
You scumbag.

435
00:30:19.814 --> 00:30:21.183
Open the trunk now.

436
00:30:21.183 --> 00:30:23.754
- Open the trunk now! - What are you? Get off me!

437
00:30:24.784 --> 00:30:26.453
What's her problem?

438
00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:30.524
Stop the car! Stop it right now!

439
00:30:30.524 --> 00:30:31.663
Let Geon Young go.

440
00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.864
- Let Geon Young go! - What a crazy witch.

441
00:30:34.963 --> 00:30:36.264
Let Geon Young go!

442
00:30:43.173 --> 00:30:44.804
No! No!

443
00:30:45.774 --> 00:30:47.074
Open the door!

444
00:30:48.114 --> 00:30:49.213
Stop the car.

445
00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:51.244
Stop the car.

446
00:30:53.784 --> 00:30:56.554
Right. You must be desperate to die.

447
00:30:56.854 --> 00:30:58.854
I'll fulfill your wish and kill you.

448
00:30:59.354 --> 00:31:01.854
Let Geon Young go! Let him go.

449
00:31:07.334 --> 00:31:09.064
What... What is this?

450
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.510
What was that?

451
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.110
You jerk.

452
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.691
What...

453
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.161
My gosh.

454
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.100
Hey.

455
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.940
My gosh. Geon Young. Geon Young.

456
00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:47.811
Geon Young.

457
00:31:51.741 --> 00:31:53.311
Geon Young. Geon Young.

458
00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:11.860
What are you guys doing here?

459
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:16.370
Do you want to go to my house and see my puppy?

460
00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.440
No, Geon Young. You should go home.

461
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.741
- Your mom's waiting for you. - I want to go too.

462
00:32:22.771 --> 00:32:24.811
Geon Young, you can come next time. Okay?

463
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.811
Let's go, Eun Hye.

464
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:33.291
I want to see his puppy too.

465
00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:35.150
I want to see his puppy.

466
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.880
Eun Hye, it might be a little suffocating, but hang in there.

467
00:33:00.751 --> 00:33:03.751
If you make any noise, you won't be able to see my puppy. Okay?

468
00:33:47.561 --> 00:33:49.030
Puppy.

469
00:33:49.831 --> 00:33:51.300
Puppy.

470
00:33:55.331 --> 00:33:57.771
I want to see the puppy too.

471
00:33:58.171 --> 00:33:59.470
Puppy.

472
00:34:04.441 --> 00:34:05.541
What?

473
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:38.081
Puppy. Puppy.

474
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:39.910
Puppy.

475
00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:45.521
Eun Hye.

476
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.590
Do you want to poop?

477
00:34:52.861 --> 00:34:54.430
My stomach hurts.

478
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:56.601
Are you hungry?

479
00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:11.857
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E05 Black "She Will Never Save Others' Lives"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

480
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.291
My stomach hurts.

481
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.961
Eun Hye's hungry.

482
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.131
I should get her snacks. Snacks.

483
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:36.401
My goodness, are you okay?

484
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.041
Hey, are you okay?

485
00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:41.370
Hey.

486
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.740
Hey, little kid.

487
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:58.691
Hey, what are you doing here?

488
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:05.660
Don't you know your way home?

489
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.731
Eun Hye. Eun Hye.

490
00:36:08.171 --> 00:36:09.370
"Eun Hye"?

491
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.010
Eun Hye, it's time for your medicine.

492
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:38.030
Geon Young better not have said anything to anyone.

493
00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.370
Sir, what are you doing here?

494
00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:48.140
I wanted to go to school with Geon Young. I'll go now.

495
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.010
- Okay, bye. - Goodbye.

496
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:51.381
- Bye. - Bye.

497
00:36:53.751 --> 00:36:55.180
I guess he hasn't said anything.

498
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.700
What? Eun Hye's hungry.

499
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.320
Geon Young.

500
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.251
This darn brat.

501
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.631
- Eun Hye, eat this. - I'm scared.

502
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.930
- I miss my grandma. - Are you scared?

503
00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.760
- Come on. Let's go. - I'm scared.

504
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.890
Come on. Follow me.

505
00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:18.861
Follow me. Come on.

506
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:20.271
No, I'm scared.

507
00:38:21.401 --> 00:38:23.140
I miss my grandma.

508
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.740
You little jerk.

509
00:38:32.381 --> 00:38:34.381
- My goodness, what was that? - What should we do?

510
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:35.450
My gosh.

511
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:37.521
My goodness.

512
00:38:37.521 --> 00:38:38.651
Did he fall?

513
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:39.950
My goodness.

514
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.090
Did he jump off?

515
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.070
Hey, wake up.

516
00:39:05.581 --> 00:39:07.711
My goodness, what happened?

517
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:10.021
My gosh, I can't believe this.

518
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.151
How did this happen?

519
00:39:23.001 --> 00:39:24.300
I wonder if he's okay.

520
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:32.240
Move aside. The ambulance is going.

521
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.691
Stop the car.

522
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.861
You're the woman...

523
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.921
You scumbag.

524
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.131
- Open the trunk now! - What are you? Get off me!

525
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.550
Yes, sir. I took care of him.

526
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.501
How's she doing?

527
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.541
She was shocked, but everything else is normal.

528
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.811
Fortunately, he didn't do anything to her.

529
00:41:17.811 --> 00:41:19.811
After knowing that Geon Young had come by,

530
00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:22.450
he wasn't able to do anything because he became nervous.

531
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:24.550
That's a relief.

532
00:41:25.081 --> 00:41:27.021
But why did he go for Eun Hye?

533
00:41:27.021 --> 00:41:29.450
She was probably his target from the start.

534
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.820
Girls like Eun Hye can easily become...

535
00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.731
targets of child molesters.

536
00:41:33.731 --> 00:41:36.660
Her grandmother's ill, and she's intellectually disabled.

537
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.030
The assailants know that girls like her won't be able to report them...

538
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.271
or tell anyone about what happened.

539
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:42.700
I guess Geon Young...

540
00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.970
was trying to protect Eun Hye.

541
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.541
Are you really not going to talk?

542
00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:10.530
You're a mess.

543
00:42:10.601 --> 00:42:12.160
What does he say?

544
00:42:12.861 --> 00:42:14.700
I think what you told me was right.

545
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.030
Did he confess?

546
00:42:16.271 --> 00:42:17.870
Did he say he was going to kill Geon Young...

547
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.200
because he's a witness?

548
00:42:19.271 --> 00:42:20.370
Yes.

549
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.180
By the way, what did you tell the police?

550
00:42:28.651 --> 00:42:29.751
Well...

551
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.351
I said you told me that you heard a child's voice...

552
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.351
coming out of his luggage bag while you were passing by,

553
00:42:35.351 --> 00:42:36.691
and that's why I arrested him.

554
00:42:36.691 --> 00:42:38.791
Did they believe that?

555
00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:41.030
Of course. I'm a homicide detective.

556
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.300
If I told them that, they would've treated me like a crazy person.

557
00:42:45.461 --> 00:42:48.331
I guess that's because you actually look like a crazy person.

558
00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:49.640
My gosh, seriously.

559
00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:52.501
Do you want me to show you what crazy really looks like?

560
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.010
Forget about that. It's all over now, right?

561
00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.280
Let's go.

562
00:42:58.081 --> 00:42:59.780
I can't believe this.

563
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.950
Where is he?

564
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.151
Excuse me.

565
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.651
Oh, hello. I heard about what you did.

566
00:43:05.921 --> 00:43:07.450
Did you get seriously injured?

567
00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:09.191
No, I'm fine.

568
00:43:09.191 --> 00:43:11.490
What about Geon Young? Is he doing okay?

569
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.861
Yes, he's okay. Thankfully, his injury wasn't serious,

570
00:43:14.861 --> 00:43:17.930
so I came here as soon as I took him back home.

571
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:20.001
I'm so relieved.

572
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.370
Geon Young's a really brave kid.

573
00:43:23.441 --> 00:43:25.441
He did so much to save his friend.

574
00:43:25.441 --> 00:43:26.740
Thank you so much.

575
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.271
If it weren't for you, he would've...

576
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.240
No, don't say that. You should go inside.

577
00:43:32.981 --> 00:43:34.981
Okay. Thank you.

578
00:43:35.981 --> 00:43:38.081
Hey, you little...

579
00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:40.550
How could you do that?

580
00:43:40.691 --> 00:43:42.291
You dirty jerk.

581
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:45.291
How could you do that to them?

582
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:47.791
- Separate them. - My gosh.

583
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.061
- Don't do this to me. - You jerk. Seriously?

584
00:43:50.101 --> 00:43:51.361
This isn't right.

585
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.101
It's all over now, right?

586
00:43:56.441 --> 00:43:58.800
- Let's go. - Gosh, it hurts.

587
00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:01.740
Stop exaggerating.

588
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.041
I'm not a culprit.

589
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:06.280
And what kind of man grabs a woman by the wrist like that?

590
00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:11.581
Let's drop by Geon Young's place before we leave.

591
00:44:11.881 --> 00:44:12.950
Why?

592
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.921
I want to check if that shadow is gone.

593
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:18.120
The culprit got arrested, so I'm sure it's gone.

594
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.220
I'm busy. Let's just go.

595
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.631
Then...

596
00:44:20.861 --> 00:44:22.861
you can go to Seoul first.

597
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.200
I must see for myself to be at ease.

598
00:44:26.671 --> 00:44:27.970
I'll see you at Seoul then.

599
00:44:28.771 --> 00:44:30.800
Hey. Hey.

600
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.970
My gosh, I hate that human.

601
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.280
- Welcome. - Hello.

602
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.981
I came to see Geon Young.

603
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.490
Come inside, and have some tea.

604
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:55.061
No, it's okay. I must leave now.

605
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:56.660
Goodbye.

606
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.901
- Bye. - Bye.

607
00:44:59.331 --> 00:45:00.331
Let's go.

608
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.410
Thank you.

609
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.851
Forget it. Let's go now.

610
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.351
If it weren't for you, he would've gotten run over by that guy's car.

611
00:45:22.421 --> 00:45:24.760
But how did you know where I was?

612
00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.691
We're friends.

613
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.561
Oh, that's right.

614
00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:34.030
You saved my account when we caught that guy.

615
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.200
You said you were too busy to help last night.

616
00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:39.441
There's nothing more important than saving lives.

617
00:45:40.811 --> 00:45:42.311
Thank you.

618
00:45:44.581 --> 00:45:46.811
You may have lost your memory,

619
00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.581
but you're still the same.

620
00:45:49.851 --> 00:45:50.950
In what way?

621
00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.050
You always did the right thing. You were really cool.

622
00:45:56.251 --> 00:45:57.390
Me?

623
00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:00.590
I was a bit cool today.

624
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.590
I was talking about back when you were young.

625
00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:05.401
What? Then what about now?

626
00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:09.001
Right now, you're...

627
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.840
What was that smirk about?

628
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.140
Why aren't you finishing your sentence?

629
00:46:15.671 --> 00:46:16.840
I'll save it for next time.

630
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.180
I'll keep my eyes on you for a bit more.

631
00:46:20.151 --> 00:46:21.881
What? Don't...

632
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:24.751
Don't keep your eyes on me. What do you mean by that?

633
00:46:25.481 --> 00:46:27.620
How dare a human say that?

634
00:46:30.461 --> 00:46:34.260
Right now, you've become a lot more handsome and cool.

635
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:42.470
Don't keep your eyes on me. I'm warning you.

636
00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:45.441
I can't believe she said that. My gosh.

637
00:46:45.946 --> 00:46:47.516
(Seoun Police Station)

638
00:46:50.248 --> 00:46:51.518
Hey, Detective Park.

639
00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:54.259
Hasn't the remaining part of this CCTV footage been restored yet?

640
00:46:54.259 --> 00:46:56.688
Not yet. The footage itself is in very low quality.

641
00:46:56.788 --> 00:46:58.029
My gosh.

642
00:46:58.489 --> 00:47:01.328
Hurry up, and have this restored. Beat someone up if you must.

643
00:47:01.659 --> 00:47:02.659
Okay.

644
00:47:04.768 --> 00:47:05.998
Where are you going?

645
00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:10.708
Gwang Gyun, can you please buy a new cell phone?

646
00:47:10.708 --> 00:47:12.339
That thing always breaks down.

647
00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:14.609
You use it for an hour, and charge it for two hours.

648
00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:19.078
My gosh, you're the only person who doesn't use a smartphone.

649
00:47:19.078 --> 00:47:20.819
Gosh, you're like an old man.

650
00:47:20.819 --> 00:47:22.518
I missed a call from Jae Geun.

651
00:47:22.518 --> 00:47:24.589
(Check voice message)

652
00:47:25.518 --> 00:47:26.918
I must speak with you.

653
00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:30.429
Let's talk in person.

654
00:47:31.228 --> 00:47:32.688
What does he need to talk about with me?

655
00:47:37.328 --> 00:47:39.029
Hey, Jae Geun. I noticed that you called me.

656
00:47:39.129 --> 00:47:40.699
The owner of this phone got in an accident.

657
00:47:40.839 --> 00:47:42.598
What? An accident?

658
00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:48.109
This stop is Moojin Elementary School.

659
00:47:48.239 --> 00:47:50.248
Moojin Elementary School.

660
00:47:59.888 --> 00:48:01.489
Who are they?

661
00:48:02.489 --> 00:48:04.558
What? Are we there already?

662
00:48:04.958 --> 00:48:06.188
What? Wait.

663
00:48:06.188 --> 00:48:08.659
Sir, wait. Please stop the bus.

664
00:48:09.299 --> 00:48:11.129
Please stop the bus.

665
00:48:11.529 --> 00:48:13.168
Joon, get off the bus now.

666
00:48:13.168 --> 00:48:14.739
Where are you taking me again?

667
00:48:14.739 --> 00:48:17.009
Come on. Just get off the bus.

668
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:21.078
Seriously.

669
00:48:32.018 --> 00:48:33.719
Can't you remember this place?

670
00:48:33.958 --> 00:48:35.118
It's Moojin Elementary School.

671
00:48:35.118 --> 00:48:37.929
Do you remember? Can you remember this place?

672
00:48:38.429 --> 00:48:39.899
It says Moojin Elementary School right here.

673
00:48:40.129 --> 00:48:41.759
(Moojin Elementary School)

674
00:48:45.199 --> 00:48:46.339
This place...

675
00:48:47.268 --> 00:48:49.498
is where you and I went to school together.

676
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:51.469
Let's go inside.

677
00:48:51.469 --> 00:48:53.808
You might be able to remember something.

678
00:49:00.078 --> 00:49:02.179
(Moojin Elementary School)

679
00:49:04.688 --> 00:49:07.188
My gosh, this place hasn't changed at all.

680
00:49:08.489 --> 00:49:12.029
Back then, the schoolyard seemed to be as big as the Pacific Ocean.

681
00:49:12.029 --> 00:49:14.699
But it seems very cute now.

682
00:49:15.129 --> 00:49:16.399
That place over there...

683
00:49:18.199 --> 00:49:20.069
is where we first met.

684
00:49:27.609 --> 00:49:31.109
- She can see ghosts - She can see ghosts

685
00:49:31.379 --> 00:49:34.449
- She can see ghosts - She can see ghosts

686
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:41.159
Seeing shadows beside people used to scare me so much...

687
00:49:42.518 --> 00:49:44.388
that I always tried to keep my eyes fixed on the ground.

688
00:49:44.659 --> 00:49:47.399
That's why I was always an outcast at school.

689
00:49:48.458 --> 00:49:51.069
Hey, fortune-teller. Have you been waiting for us?

690
00:49:52.268 --> 00:49:54.339
Why? Do you want to get beaten up again?

691
00:49:58.009 --> 00:50:00.638
- Hey, what is that? - What is she wearing?

692
00:50:00.978 --> 00:50:02.409
It looks ridiculous.

693
00:50:02.409 --> 00:50:04.109
What is this?

694
00:50:04.649 --> 00:50:06.308
Hey, don't do that.

695
00:50:09.649 --> 00:50:10.788
What is he doing?

696
00:50:28.138 --> 00:50:30.239
- Guys, let's go. - Come on.

697
00:50:31.509 --> 00:50:33.509
- We'll see you later. - Gosh...

698
00:50:43.518 --> 00:50:45.518
Kiddo, are you all right?

699
00:50:53.098 --> 00:50:54.458
You have such pretty eyes.

700
00:50:55.899 --> 00:50:58.069
Why do you keep covering your pretty eyes?

701
00:50:59.668 --> 00:51:00.998
You're a student here, right?

702
00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:04.768
I'm Kim Joon. I'm in sixth grade.

703
00:51:09.179 --> 00:51:10.649
Do those boys bother you often?

704
00:51:12.279 --> 00:51:13.348
Don't cry.

705
00:51:13.649 --> 00:51:16.078
Do not let them think that you're an easy target.

706
00:51:16.078 --> 00:51:18.549
Say this to them if they ever bother you again.

707
00:51:19.248 --> 00:51:22.659
"You jerks. Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?"

708
00:51:22.659 --> 00:51:25.558
"Shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?"

709
00:51:27.399 --> 00:51:28.759
- Repeat after me. - What?

710
00:51:29.429 --> 00:51:30.998
I'll say it again. Listen up, okay?

711
00:51:31.969 --> 00:51:34.969
"You jerks. Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?"

712
00:51:35.138 --> 00:51:38.038
"Shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?"

713
00:51:38.138 --> 00:51:39.978
Hey, you...

714
00:51:40.409 --> 00:51:41.839
I can't hear you. Say it louder.

715
00:51:42.938 --> 00:51:46.149
"You jerks. Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?"

716
00:51:46.149 --> 00:51:49.449
"Shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?"

717
00:51:50.118 --> 00:51:52.688
Good. Curse at them like that if they bother you again.

718
00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:56.859
Say it like a spell whenever you feel scared or afraid.

719
00:51:56.989 --> 00:51:58.489
- Like a spell? - Yes.

720
00:51:58.859 --> 00:52:02.299
That's right. Then whatever that's bothering you will look like a joke.

721
00:52:02.659 --> 00:52:04.429
It'll look like a joke? All of them?

722
00:52:04.728 --> 00:52:06.799
You must know how to protect yourself.

723
00:52:07.768 --> 00:52:09.098
Try to look strong at all times.

724
00:52:09.868 --> 00:52:12.768
Then no one will be able to bother you. Don't forget that.

725
00:52:14.938 --> 00:52:16.509
Life works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?

726
00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:24.149
You said that when we met again after 20 years...

727
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:26.859
What are you looking at?

728
00:52:27.518 --> 00:52:30.188
Shall I poke your eyes with utility poles?

729
00:52:30.188 --> 00:52:33.159
Or shall I spoon your eyeballs and suck all the fluid out of them?

730
00:52:35.299 --> 00:52:36.328
Isn't it fascinating?

731
00:52:36.998 --> 00:52:39.598
I said what you taught me when we met again.

732
00:52:39.998 --> 00:52:42.498
Kim Joon taught you those absurd curse words?

733
00:52:42.839 --> 00:52:45.208
Yes, you told me...

734
00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:48.509
that whenever I feel scared or afraid,

735
00:52:48.879 --> 00:52:50.578
I should say those words like a spell.

736
00:52:50.679 --> 00:52:51.848
If I do so,

737
00:52:53.248 --> 00:52:56.388
everything that's bothering me will look like a joke.

738
00:52:57.688 --> 00:52:59.589
Then why do you curse all the time?

739
00:52:59.788 --> 00:53:00.859
About that...

740
00:53:02.759 --> 00:53:06.429
that's because they've been bothering me every second...

741
00:53:06.629 --> 00:53:08.029
of every day for the last 20 years.

742
00:53:08.529 --> 00:53:09.558
Who are they?

743
00:53:10.299 --> 00:53:12.199
You mean the shadows that you see?

744
00:53:12.368 --> 00:53:14.538
No, I meant people.

745
00:53:14.739 --> 00:53:17.268
- Humans? - Wherever I went,

746
00:53:18.168 --> 00:53:21.279
they would always whisper to each other in front of me...

747
00:53:22.978 --> 00:53:24.748
and behind my back.

748
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:27.748
"That girl has eyes of a ghost."

749
00:53:28.418 --> 00:53:29.888
"They're the eyes of a goblin."

750
00:53:30.748 --> 00:53:32.449
I've seen ghosts and goblins myself.

751
00:53:33.018 --> 00:53:35.058
Ghosts' eyes look duller than yours,

752
00:53:35.058 --> 00:53:37.288
whereas goblins' eyes are much bigger than yours.

753
00:53:37.288 --> 00:53:38.888
I think that your eyes are...

754
00:53:41.299 --> 00:53:42.558
My eyes?

755
00:53:44.469 --> 00:53:45.469
What about them?

756
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:49.168
They're deep,

757
00:53:49.909 --> 00:53:51.808
brown, and...

758
00:53:55.679 --> 00:53:57.578
They look different from other humans' eyes.

759
00:53:58.179 --> 00:54:00.549
How should I put this? There's something special about them.

760
00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:03.449
They're... They're special?

761
00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:06.319
What... What makes you think that they're special?

762
00:54:11.029 --> 00:54:12.458
Looking at them up close like this,

763
00:54:18.699 --> 00:54:19.768
they look like eyes of a dog.

764
00:54:22.699 --> 00:54:23.938
Eyes of a dog?

765
00:54:24.168 --> 00:54:26.069
How dare you say such a thing?

766
00:54:26.208 --> 00:54:29.179
Joon, Joon! Then your eyes are...

767
00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:33.779
You have eyes of a doe.

768
00:54:34.279 --> 00:54:35.918
Gosh, that sailor mouth.

769
00:54:36.748 --> 00:54:38.888
So Kim Joon taught her to talk like that?

770
00:54:46.728 --> 00:54:50.029
Joon, where are you going? Joon, Joon!

771
00:54:51.469 --> 00:54:53.069
You two do so many absurd things together.

772
00:54:53.438 --> 00:54:55.839
So? What did you guys bury inside?

773
00:54:56.438 --> 00:54:57.438
What was in there?

774
00:54:58.509 --> 00:54:59.839
Can't we dig it up?

775
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:02.938
No, we can't. I promised her we'll open it together 20 years later.

776
00:55:04.348 --> 00:55:05.848
Just don't tell her.

777
00:55:06.308 --> 00:55:09.149
I'll keep my lips sealed. Let's dig it up and see.

778
00:55:09.149 --> 00:55:10.288
Shall we?

779
00:55:28.168 --> 00:55:29.199
Joon!

780
00:55:35.509 --> 00:55:38.149
What are you doing here? You took off after teasing me.

781
00:55:39.848 --> 00:55:42.819
This is where we buried our time capsule.

782
00:55:42.978 --> 00:55:46.188
I guess construction for the commemoration park hasn't begun yet.

783
00:55:51.458 --> 00:55:52.759
Joon, do you remember?

784
00:55:53.259 --> 00:55:56.029
We buried a time capsule here together.

785
00:55:56.259 --> 00:55:57.668
Do you remember it now?

786
00:56:01.998 --> 00:56:03.609
No. Don't.

787
00:56:04.168 --> 00:56:05.339
Don't dig it up.

788
00:56:05.768 --> 00:56:08.109
The day we promised to open it together...

789
00:56:08.239 --> 00:56:10.109
is still a month away.

790
00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:11.779
Keep the promise, okay?

791
00:56:16.688 --> 00:56:18.188
There, it's covered now.

792
00:56:19.089 --> 00:56:23.089
We should hurry. Let's go.

793
00:56:27.359 --> 00:56:28.799
Come on now. This way.

794
00:56:46.848 --> 00:56:48.379
This place hasn't changed at all.

795
00:56:52.489 --> 00:56:54.458
You used to live here as a kid.

796
00:56:55.319 --> 00:56:56.558
Don't you remember?

797
00:57:08.868 --> 00:57:10.138
- Come on. - Goodness.

798
00:57:16.348 --> 00:57:19.819
That punk doesn't even respect me after everything I did to raise him.

799
00:57:21.379 --> 00:57:24.188
It's not like I wanted to be born into a family like this.

800
00:57:24.418 --> 00:57:27.558
Move out. Live on your own then. Don't you ever come back again.

801
00:57:27.788 --> 00:57:30.259
- Stop it! - Why?

802
00:57:32.129 --> 00:57:34.228
Gosh, I shouldn't have given birth to that punk.

803
00:57:34.228 --> 00:57:35.899
I should've just aborted him.

804
00:57:35.899 --> 00:57:39.839
Yes, why did you have me? I never wanted a mom like you.

805
00:57:39.839 --> 00:57:41.699
What did you just say? That little...

806
00:57:42.938 --> 00:57:44.708
Die, die!

807
00:57:44.839 --> 00:57:46.038
You embarrass me!

808
00:57:46.879 --> 00:57:48.109
I'm embarrassed of you.

809
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:50.308
I don't need a son like you. Die!

810
00:57:50.649 --> 00:57:52.549
Just die! I want you to die!

811
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:54.078
- Joon... - Just die already.

812
00:57:55.379 --> 00:57:57.819
Joon. Joon...

813
00:57:58.819 --> 00:58:00.018
Right.

814
00:58:01.418 --> 00:58:03.828
It's probably better to not remember this place.

815
00:58:04.929 --> 00:58:06.288
We should get going, Joon.

816
00:58:25.308 --> 00:58:27.078
- Let's dig it up and see. - Shall we?

817
00:58:28.819 --> 00:58:30.188
What on earth is going on?

818
00:58:30.388 --> 00:58:33.458
Why do I keep seeing flashbacks from Han Moo Gang's past?

819
00:58:46.368 --> 00:58:48.038
No! No!

820
00:58:48.668 --> 00:58:49.808
Stop the car.

821
00:58:51.009 --> 00:58:52.069
Let's go.

822
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:53.279
Gosh, it hurts.

823
00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:55.478
Stop exaggerating.

824
00:58:57.609 --> 00:58:59.719
She must've thrown a fit because she was in pain.

825
00:59:00.978 --> 00:59:02.449
She's such an odd human.

826
00:59:03.388 --> 00:59:06.219
She's doing all this to save a complete stranger's life.

827
00:59:11.388 --> 00:59:12.828
By the way, about this woman...

828
00:59:14.129 --> 00:59:15.498
Why must she die?

829
00:59:44.228 --> 00:59:46.929
Hey, what happened?

830
00:59:47.299 --> 00:59:49.969
We'll need to investigate it further to find out about the details,

831
00:59:49.998 --> 00:59:51.629
but I heard that he probably dozed off while driving.

832
00:59:51.629 --> 00:59:53.339
There are no CCTV cameras in the vicinity,

833
00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:54.768
and there aren't any witnesses either.

834
00:59:54.768 --> 00:59:56.938
It'll be a difficult case.

835
00:59:57.308 --> 01:00:00.138
I must speak with you. Let's talk in person.

836
01:00:00.339 --> 01:00:03.149
Did he get into the accident on his way to meet me?

837
01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:05.078
What did he want to talk about with me?

838
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:06.918
Hey, you made it. What is that?

839
01:00:06.918 --> 01:00:09.049
They're the things that were in the commissioner general's car.

840
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:10.688
I brought them to give them to his wife.

841
01:00:10.688 --> 01:00:13.018
- The car that was crashed? - Yes.

842
01:00:13.018 --> 01:00:15.589
Just a moment, okay? This is...

843
01:00:16.259 --> 01:00:19.359
Gwang Gyun, Gwang Gyun. Wait!

844
01:00:22.429 --> 01:00:23.629
What are you doing now?

845
01:00:23.929 --> 01:00:25.929
(Evidence)

846
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:27.498
What's he doing? Goodness.

847

(Santorini, Ask for Singing Pumpkin)

848
01:00:48.159 --> 01:00:50.089
What's this? It's a bar.

849
01:00:50.728 --> 01:00:52.489
Did he go to a bar alone?

850
01:00:52.788 --> 01:00:53.799
Pumpkin?

851
01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:57.929
Could this be Han Jin Sook's husband?

852
01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:00.768
- Hey. - Yes.

853
01:01:00.768 --> 01:01:02.969
Was this really found in the commissioner general's car?

854
01:01:02.969 --> 01:01:04.239
Oh, yes.

855
01:01:04.308 --> 01:01:06.779
It was caught in the sunroof of his car.

856
01:01:08.379 --> 01:01:10.248
That can't be.

857
01:01:17.149 --> 01:01:18.149
I'll be right back.

858
01:01:18.149 --> 01:01:19.549
- Gwang Gyun! - Gwang Gyun!

(Pumpkin Singer)

865
01:03:07.629 --> 01:03:09.399
How is this possible?

866
01:03:12.598 --> 01:03:14.699
How can Clara's drawing...

867
01:03:16.868 --> 01:03:19.138
be on Singing Pumpkin's business card?

868
01:03:27.949 --> 01:03:29.549
Thanks, Joon.

869
01:03:30.248 --> 01:03:33.558
Thanks to you, I was able to save Geon Young's life.

870
01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:36.989
You have to go somewhere with me tomorrow.

871
01:03:37.129 --> 01:03:38.129
Where?

872
01:03:38.129 --> 01:03:40.429
We're going to find a person that has the shadow inside their body.

873
01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:44.228
But I have to take care of what my boss asked me to do.

874
01:03:44.228 --> 01:03:46.228
Saving lives is more important, isn't it?

875
01:03:46.228 --> 01:03:48.038
Yes, it is. That is true.

876
01:03:48.038 --> 01:03:49.038
Stop making excuses.

877
01:03:49.038 --> 01:03:52.469
I just need you to check if you see the shadow or not, okay?

878
01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:58.078
Okay, I will. Go in now.

879
01:03:58.708 --> 01:04:00.618
Get some rest. I'll get going.

880
01:04:04.018 --> 01:04:05.348
Gosh.

881
01:04:10.129 --> 01:04:12.429
I'm okay. Seriously.

882
01:04:12.429 --> 01:04:14.159
Gosh, this...

883
01:04:14.159 --> 01:04:16.598
This is exactly why I painted this white.

884
01:04:18.228 --> 01:04:20.969
Goodness, I can never pull this out either.

885
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:26.239
I'll get going.

886
01:04:32.409 --> 01:04:34.279
She sure is clumsy.

887
01:04:35.649 --> 01:04:37.049
How could she not see that?

888
01:04:38.449 --> 01:04:39.688
She sure has dog eyes.

889
01:04:50.699 --> 01:04:53.839
He pressed charges against them again after a small group...

890
01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:55.868
of politicians criticized it as a sabotaging action.

891
01:04:56.299 --> 01:04:57.868
Next news.

892
01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:01.509
Kim, the man with French nationality who's been arrested for abducting...

893
01:05:01.509 --> 01:05:03.409
and confining a disabled child in Moojin,

894
01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:06.248
was actually indicted five years ago in France...

895
01:05:06.248 --> 01:05:08.779
for sexually molesting children and possessing child pornography.

896
01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:10.989
It's been revealed that he fled to Korea...

897
01:05:10.989 --> 01:05:13.558
while he was being investigated by the French prosecution.

898
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:16.929
Just because he graduated from a renowned university in Paris,

899
01:05:16.929 --> 01:05:18.958
no verification or certificates were required for him to...

900
01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:20.859
What on earth have you done?

901
01:05:20.859 --> 01:05:24.328
You went to stop her but ended up helping her save that boy's life.

902
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:27.138
How are you going to handle the consequences?

903
01:05:50.328 --> 01:05:52.029
Don't you know what will happen...

904
01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:53.899
when you meddle in humans' affairs?

905
01:05:55.058 --> 01:05:56.529
I never meddled in anything.

906
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:58.899
You saved that kid's life.

907
01:06:00.569 --> 01:06:02.098
I didn't save anyone's life.

908
01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.329
I came to see Geon Young.

909
01:06:36.669 --> 01:06:38.109
Goodbye.

910
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:39.268
- Bye. - Bye.

911
01:06:40.838 --> 01:06:41.838
Let's go.

912
01:07:08.039 --> 01:07:12.138
Does that mean he'll die like he's destined to be?

913
01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:13.709
Of course.

914
01:07:29.758 --> 01:07:31.959
That woman...

915
01:07:32.758 --> 01:07:34.699
will never be able to save anyone's life.

916
01:07:36.529 --> 01:07:38.098
I won't allow that.

917
01:07:40.798 --> 01:07:41.798
Never.

918
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:10.329
(Black)

919
01:08:10.529 --> 01:08:12.169
What on earth are you doing here?

920
01:08:12.228 --> 01:08:13.399
We got a call.

921
01:08:13.399 --> 01:08:14.999
Someone is after Leo.

922
01:08:14.999 --> 01:08:15.999
Who sent this?

923
01:08:15.999 --> 01:08:17.008
No one can dare touch my Leo.

924
01:08:17.008 --> 01:08:18.709
- Loser! - Joon! Joon!

925
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:20.678
He must've gotten his hands on that tape.

926
01:08:20.808 --> 01:08:23.209
It's only a matter of time before he finds out who I really am.

927
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:24.949
Backup team. I'm requesting backup...

928
01:08:24.949 --> 01:08:26.819
right now. Come immediately. You got that?

929
01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:27.819
It's that jerk.

930
01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:30.149
I must make sure that he can't bother me anymore.

931
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.249
How dare you, human.

932
01:08:32.548 --> 01:08:34.289
Why did I remember it just now?
