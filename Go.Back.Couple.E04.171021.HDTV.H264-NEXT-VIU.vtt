00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.945
(Winter of 1998, 19 years old Choi Ban Do)

4
00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:12.284
I don't feel like majoring civil construction.

5
00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.885
Goodness. Are you picking a menu?

6
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:16.925
You did terribly on your entrance exam.

7
00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:18.455
You don't feel like it?

8
00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.425
You can't be choosy right now.

9
00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.495
Registration hours are over.

10
00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:24.925
The doors will be closed.

11
00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.335
Please wait!

12
00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:44.816
Wait!

13
00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:46.555
Wait.

14
00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:50.686
Thank you.

15
00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:02.795
In young people's chests,

16
00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.066
lives a huge thing called the heart.

17
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.775
It pounds all the time...

18
00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:11.105
and makes you embarrassed.

19
00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:14.415
It makes us losers...

20
00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:16.275
that can't do anything.

21
00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:17.945
I can do this.

22
00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.286
Raise your head up.

23
00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.415
Be confident.

24
00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.296
Gosh.

25
00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:31.296
Goodness. I fell.

26
00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:34.266
You... You can drink that.

27
00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:41.206
Why did you do that? Why?

28
00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:43.305
Excuse me.

29
00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.245
Thanks for the drink.

30
00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:02.596
Doctor, you made an excellent choice.

31
00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:03.596
But...

32
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:06.566
when I became an adult and finally got to control it,

33
00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:09.905
this heart of mine seemed to have...

34
00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:12.636
stopped its movement.

35
00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:14.435
I'm not even sure if it's still alive.

36
00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:18.875
It disappeared without a trace.

37
00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:35.926
(Episode 4: Again, My Heart Beats)

38
00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:39.896
Walk straight. I'm tired.

39
00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:40.935
Gosh.

40
00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:43.565
You should've controlled yourself. Why did you drink so much?

41
00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:46.576
Hey, did I drink voluntarily?

42
00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:48.176
It was against my will.

43
00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:50.775
Gosh, that boozer.

44
00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:54.676
I can't believe a girl competes by drinking.

45
00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:55.976
What about it?

46
00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:57.646
I thought she was cool.

47
00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.185
What? It's locked?

48
00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:09.125
If I miss one more attendance, I'll get thrown out.

49
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.826
Gosh, I'm having such bad luck because of you!

50
00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:14.136
Hey, don't worry.

51
00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:15.495
Hey.

52
00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.305
We can go in.

53
00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:19.405
What will you do?

54
00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:22.176
- Hey. - Here I go.

55
00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:26.845
You got in.

56
00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:28.416
See? I got in.

57
00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:29.886
Here I come.

58
00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:31.646
All right.

59
00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.916
Hey, I think it'll work.

60
00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:35.116
Here.

61
00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.215
Wait. What's wrong with this?

62
00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:38.426
Gosh.

63
00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:42.025
I need to go back out.

64
00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:43.726
Okay. Back up.

65
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.435
What's wrong?

66
00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.435
Hey, it hurts.

67
00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:52.005
I'm coming out.

68
00:03:53.736 --> 00:03:56.745
Gosh, I'm stuck.

69
00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:59.076
Wait there. I'll be right out.

70
00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.576
Wait. This...

71
00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.116
Gosh, what should I do?

72
00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:08.785
Hey, Dok Jae.

73
00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:10.255
Help...

74
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:13.396
Why are you over there?

75
00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:15.226
The gate is open.

76
00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:16.226
What?

77
00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:22.366
Gosh.

78
00:04:26.606 --> 00:04:27.676
Here I come.

79
00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:28.705
Bring it on.

80
00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:37.716
You jerk.

81
00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.046
Stop it.

82
00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.755
It hurts, you jerk!

83
00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.726
Hey, punk!

84
00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:46.086
How can you...

85
00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.096
push my face like that? It hurt!

86
00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.366
It won't work.

87
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.466
Just go.

88
00:05:01.976 --> 00:05:02.976
What?

89
00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:05.776
There's no hope for me.

90
00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:08.776
Just go.

91
00:05:09.216 --> 00:05:10.586
Otherwise, both of us will die.

92
00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:12.216
You have to live.

93
00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:13.815
You have to make the roll call!

94
00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:17.226
Dok Jae...

95
00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:18.455
Do the roll call.

96
00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:22.156
Then come back to save me.

97
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:23.666
No.

98
00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:26.796
No!

99
00:05:26.796 --> 00:05:27.796
Just go!

100
00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.466
Leave!

101
00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:31.406
- No. - Hurry up and leave!

102
00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:32.565
Go!

103
00:05:33.205 --> 00:05:34.776
Go away!

104
00:05:34.776 --> 00:05:36.135
Go, Jae Woo.

105
00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.645
Leave!

106
00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:42.575
Jae Woo?

107
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.745
That punk is so fast.

108
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.856
Wait!

109
00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.226
I'm sorry. My friend's head is stuck...

110
00:05:53.156 --> 00:05:54.156
Excuse me.

111
00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:55.926
What?

112
00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:04.736
(Telephone)

113
00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:05.736
It's me, Yoon Bo Reum.

114
00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:08.005
Come to student hall room 201 by 2pm.

115
00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:15.416
Did she just ask me out on a date?

116
00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:21.856
Jae Woo.

117
00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:23.656
Jae Woo.

118
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:26.825
Jae Woo.

119
00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:30.495
Did you do the roll call yet?

120
00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:39.805
No way.

121
00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.776
It can't be raining.

122
00:06:42.776 --> 00:06:44.075
No way.

123
00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:46.075
I'm Go Dok Jae.

124
00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:50.916
Jae Woo.

125
00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:53.856
Ahn Jae Woo!

126
00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:56.315
It's raining!

127
00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:31.526
Mister.

128
00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:32.955
Is he hurt?

129
00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:34.426
- Mister. - Water.

130
00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:36.325
Mister. Gosh!

131
00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:37.495
Water.

132
00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:39.596
- Give me water. - What the...

133
00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:42.096
- Give me water. - Gosh.

134
00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:43.366
Water... Jae Woo...

135
00:07:43.765 --> 00:07:45.135
Jae Woo.

136
00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:57.515
Change your major...

137
00:07:57.916 --> 00:07:59.086
to business administration.

138
00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.656
History majors can't make money.

139
00:08:01.656 --> 00:08:03.825
You should major business if you like it so much.

140
00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:05.426
You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?

141
00:08:05.755 --> 00:08:08.026
You're doing everything I'm telling you not to do.

142
00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:11.226
I don't care about you that much to rebel against you.

143
00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:13.296
Change your major and learn business administration,

144
00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:15.836
or join the student council to learn about governance.

145
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.065
You choose.

146
00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:21.935
You mean learn about exploiting students?

147
00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:23.135
What?

148
00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:24.906
Honey.

149
00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.046
Well... Here.

150
00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:28.846
I couldn't give it to you yesterday.

151
00:08:28.846 --> 00:08:30.185
It's your birthday present.

152
00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:32.986
You two should just live happily together.

153
00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:34.556
Don't mind me.

154
00:08:34.616 --> 00:08:35.986
Take this.

155
00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:38.356
I bought this for you.

156
00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:44.995
That punk.

157
00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.495
He's too spoiled.

158
00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:50.135
I should stop his allowance or something.

159
00:08:50.366 --> 00:08:51.866
Don't you do that to him.

160
00:08:54.336 --> 00:08:57.275
Director Jung, we demand explanations.

161
00:08:57.275 --> 00:09:00.545
We demand explanations.

162
00:09:00.545 --> 00:09:06.216
Director Jung, we demand explanations.

163
00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:26.806
- Yes? - Why can't I ever catch you?

164
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.836
Why don't you pick up your phone?

165
00:09:29.076 --> 00:09:30.245
What is it?

166
00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:32.306
Nothing special, as always.

167
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:33.846
I need money.

168
00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:35.976
I don't have any.

169
00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:38.186
Why not? Doesn't your father give you any?

170
00:09:39.216 --> 00:09:40.785
I don't believe those two.

171
00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:42.956
Stop it.

172
00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:44.086
Stop what?

173
00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:46.086
Do you know how hard it was for me to give birth to you?

174
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.995
So how hard was it?

175
00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:50.995
And don't you know the day you had me?

176
00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:55.995
It's today. You gave birth to me today.

177
00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:00.576
If you need money, call him yourself.

178
00:10:00.936 --> 00:10:03.175
Stop putting me in between you two!

179
00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.755
Seongbuk-dong 31, please.

180
00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:36.745
What was that?

181
00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:44.586
How did he get stuck?

182
00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:46.716
That's amazing. Is he an idiot?

183
00:10:47.716 --> 00:10:48.785
Hey, kid.

184
00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:50.655
If you can't get yourself out,

185
00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:53.255
why did you get in there in the first place?

186
00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:57.995
Goodness, kids these days are really weird.

187
00:10:58.096 --> 00:10:59.726
- My goodness. - Excuse me.

188
00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:03.466
Can you do this gently, please?

189
00:11:05.806 --> 00:11:07.505
That's an electric saw.

190
00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:09.675
What are you trying to do with that?

191
00:11:09.946 --> 00:11:12.045
Why are you trying to cut off my neck?

192
00:11:13.745 --> 00:11:17.316
But why do you keep blabbering about me?

193
00:11:18.086 --> 00:11:19.716
Are you advertising our divorce?

194
00:11:19.716 --> 00:11:23.385
Why don't you put up a poster saying we have a kid too?

195
00:11:23.525 --> 00:11:25.525
Well, it was because I was drunk.

196
00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:26.925
You don't think I can do that?

197
00:11:27.255 --> 00:11:28.255
That's a fact.

198
00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:30.466
A fact, my foot.

199
00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:34.196
If that gets out, you and I both will be doomed.

200
00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:37.236
It won't be the both of us.

201
00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.775
If that gets out, you and I both will be doomed.

202
00:11:49.316 --> 00:11:50.785
It won't be the both of us.

203
00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:55.086
You're a married man, but you're after your first love.

204
00:11:55.186 --> 00:11:56.556
Does she know...

205
00:11:56.655 --> 00:11:58.155
that you're married with a kid?

206
00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:01.326
Why am I married? I'm divorced.

207
00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:07.665
Nobody here knows that I've been married.

208
00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:09.135
What about you?

209
00:12:09.135 --> 00:12:12.566
You're a married woman with a kid. But you were so happy...

210
00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.135
in a young man's arms.

211
00:12:14.336 --> 00:12:16.745
You're worse than me, lady.

212
00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:17.905
What's going on?

213
00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:20.576
- Are they cheating on each other? - Gosh, that's crazy.

214
00:12:20.645 --> 00:12:23.245
You mean yesterday? That was an accident.

215
00:12:25.915 --> 00:12:28.056
You better pay me the alimony.

216
00:12:28.056 --> 00:12:30.086
I'm going to get every penny from you.

217
00:12:30.086 --> 00:12:31.826
I'm a student.

218
00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:33.525
I can't even earn enough to buy gum.

219
00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:35.255
I'm a student with no money.

220
00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:37.066
I won't give it to you.

221
00:12:37.066 --> 00:12:38.765
I won't. Why would I give it to you?

222
00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:40.366
That's crazy.

223
00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:42.336
A married student?

224
00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:52.405
You cheapskate.

225
00:12:53.576 --> 00:12:56.515
What? You like gum, don't you?

226
00:12:57.045 --> 00:12:58.116
Fine.

227
00:12:58.446 --> 00:13:01.155
There's no talking to a cheapskate like you.

228
00:13:02.316 --> 00:13:03.826
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

229
00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:06.625
Of course, it does. You drank so much.

230
00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:07.755
Excuse me, lady.

231
00:13:08.295 --> 00:13:12.226
Only people who have partied know how to party.

232
00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:15.895
You'll ruin yourself if you keep doing something that's not yourself.

233
00:13:18.806 --> 00:13:19.936
What?

234
00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:27.145
Gosh, she startled me.

235
00:13:30.785 --> 00:13:32.245
Hey, Jin Joo.

236
00:13:32.716 --> 00:13:33.856
What?

237
00:13:34.385 --> 00:13:36.686
Stop talking to the guy you met at the club yesterday.

238
00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:37.956
Don't get involved with him.

239
00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:42.826
You must be excited that a guy gave you a number,

240
00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:46.866
but that jerk, Doctor Park, is just toying with you, okay?

241
00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:47.966
Goodness.

242
00:13:48.336 --> 00:13:49.635
Is he a doctor?

243
00:13:51.436 --> 00:13:52.905
- What? - On the other side?

244
00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:54.535
A doctor who works at a hospital?

245
00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:57.545
I knew he had a great taste.

246
00:13:57.706 --> 00:14:00.415
Now that I'm at it, I should turn my life around.

247
00:14:00.775 --> 00:14:02.476
Thanks for the information.

248
00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:04.145
Hey.

249
00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:05.846
Hey!

250
00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:13.495
How long are we staying in this time?

251
00:14:14.196 --> 00:14:15.326
Darn it.

252
00:14:20.295 --> 00:14:22.035
- Hey, go. - Darn it.

253
00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:24.206
- Did you leave the door open? - I don't know.

254
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:33.005
He left his wife and kid to chase after his first love.

255
00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:36.145
- And she doesn't know he's married. - Really?

256
00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:39.316
Hey, what's going on? What's with the uproar?

257
00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:43.086
- Amazing people have shown up. - Amazing?

258
00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:45.525
There's a student in our school who has been through a divorce.

259
00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:48.025
Really?

260
00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:49.995
Wait.

261
00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:52.925
If they're still a student, when did they get married and divorced?

262
00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:55.165
That's not the point.

263
00:14:55.466 --> 00:14:58.306
The point is that both of them are having affairs.

264
00:14:58.306 --> 00:14:59.836
- Affairs? - Wait, no.

265
00:15:00.035 --> 00:15:02.035
They're divorced, so technically, it's not an affair.

266
00:15:02.476 --> 00:15:05.045
But the thing is, they have a kid.

267
00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:08.316
A kid? Wow. Kids these days are scary.

268
00:15:08.515 --> 00:15:12.015
Hey, the guy went on about how he can't give her alimony,

269
00:15:12.015 --> 00:15:14.586
saying he doesn't even have a penny on him.

270
00:15:14.586 --> 00:15:17.326
Goodness, he's a human garbage.

271
00:15:17.326 --> 00:15:20.525
He is. He can't even be recycled.

272
00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:23.295
He said he's a student and that he doesn't have any money.

273
00:15:23.395 --> 00:15:25.425
The woman got so angry...

274
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.165
and called him a cheapskate and all.

275
00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:32.706
A cheap... A cheapskate?

276
00:15:33.306 --> 00:15:36.405
Hey, who told you about them?

277
00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:39.745
That thing.

278
00:15:40.375 --> 00:15:42.275
It was broadcast live from the studio.

279
00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.915
I'm sure everyone on campus heard them.

280
00:15:43.915 --> 00:15:45.816
Did you hear how he said he can't give her alimony?

281
00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:47.515
He's unbelievably cheap.

282
00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:48.556
Cheap?

283
00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:49.925
He's a human garbage.

284
00:15:49.925 --> 00:15:51.155
That's me?

285
00:15:52.255 --> 00:15:54.155
If she has a kid, she should be raising them.

286
00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:56.056
Why is she at school chasing after young men?

287
00:15:56.566 --> 00:15:59.395
The world is coming to an end. It's gone completely crazy.

288
00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:02.135
I'm the one who's about to go crazy.

289
00:16:02.196 --> 00:16:05.206
That means they could've had the kid while in high school.

290
00:16:05.706 --> 00:16:08.106
- The woman is something. - Exactly.

291
00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:13.175
Who keeps on bashing on the woman?

292
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:14.976
Why are you bashing her?

293
00:16:15.145 --> 00:16:16.175
Who are you?

294
00:16:16.846 --> 00:16:18.015
"Who are you?"

295
00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:21.015
Are you challenging me?

296
00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:23.655
Hey.

297
00:16:23.655 --> 00:16:25.826
Settle down. She's the lunatic history major.

298
00:16:26.826 --> 00:16:27.895
Don't mess with her.

299
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:32.596
How cool is that?

300
00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:35.895
Getting divorced. Isn't that so cool?

301
00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:37.135
Why does a woman always need to sacrifice?

302
00:16:37.135 --> 00:16:38.535
She wanted to live her life.

303
00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:40.806
She's so cool.

304
00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:44.706
Oh, maybe that was a drama script written by the broadcasting club.

305
00:16:45.245 --> 00:16:47.515
They sometimes put on a radio drama, you know.

306
00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:50.846
We have an announcement.

307
00:16:51.015 --> 00:16:54.856
The accident that happened was not caused by the broadcasting club.

308
00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.385
We are investigating the outline of the incident.

309
00:16:58.525 --> 00:16:59.726
Darn it.

310
00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:06.125
(We demand an explanation for increased food prices.)

311
00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.566
They recently got divorced.

312
00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:09.935
And his first love goes to our school too.

313
00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:12.266
- That's awful. - Right?

314
00:17:13.536 --> 00:17:15.205
Hey, the guy's first love goes to this school too.

315
00:17:17.475 --> 00:17:18.546
Hey.

316
00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:26.616
What are we going to do now?

317
00:17:26.856 --> 00:17:28.256
What do you want me to do?

318
00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:31.256
I don't know about the guy,

319
00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:33.625
but what about the girl? She has a kid at this age.

320
00:17:34.026 --> 00:17:35.225
A horrible...

321
00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:37.895
jerk.

322
00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.135
Sul, I didn't know you cursed.

323
00:17:43.606 --> 00:17:46.006
He's a jerk to get a naive girl pregnant.

324
00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:48.606
He's a jerk.

325
00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:49.675
I won't let him live.

326
00:17:49.675 --> 00:17:50.806
Well,

327
00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:53.875
he didn't get her pregnant. They were apparently married.

328
00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.046
Married.

329
00:17:55.046 --> 00:17:56.816
But he won't give her alimony.

330
00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:01.256
Why are you getting angry at me?

331
00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:04.056
Anyway, they abandoned the kid because both of them...

332
00:18:04.725 --> 00:18:05.955
didn't want to look after the kid.

333
00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.526
- That's nonsense! - That's nonsense!

334
00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:13.296
What's with you two?

335
00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:17.405
The whole campus is looking for that divorced couple right now.

336
00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:19.165
We don't have much clues,

337
00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:21.606
but it looks like they are in a bad relationship...

338
00:18:21.606 --> 00:18:23.276
by the way they fought at the broadcasting studio.

339
00:18:23.346 --> 00:18:25.846
Do you know anyone who fights without no apparent reason?

340
00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:29.016
I mean, the answer is always pretty nearby.

341
00:18:29.415 --> 00:18:31.145
I... I'm not sure.

342
00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:33.655
Hey, Jin Joo.

343
00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:36.385
Do you know anyone who does that?

344
00:18:37.086 --> 00:18:38.286
I don't know.

345
00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:41.056
I don't think it's anyone around me, Ban Do.

346
00:18:41.526 --> 00:18:43.465
Oh, I see.

347
00:18:44.996 --> 00:18:47.235
- Enjoy your food. - Sure.

348
00:18:47.496 --> 00:18:49.235
- Is it good? - Yes.

349
00:18:51.036 --> 00:18:52.306
Wow, the soup is refreshing.

350
00:18:52.306 --> 00:18:53.935
I heard both of them didn't want the kid.

351
00:18:54.036 --> 00:18:55.935
They shouldn't even call themselves humans.

352
00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:58.006
They said he hit her every day.

353
00:18:58.006 --> 00:19:00.215
Really? He's a scumbag.

354
00:19:00.215 --> 00:19:01.516
She's a gold digger.

355
00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.616
She planned everything to get money off him.

356
00:19:03.616 --> 00:19:05.246
He's a total scumbag.

357
00:19:05.246 --> 00:19:06.385
She's the same.

358
00:19:06.385 --> 00:19:08.185
They're perfect for each other.

359
00:19:16.826 --> 00:19:19.266
Only our voices have been revealed.

360
00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:21.836
I don't think anybody knows our voices.

361
00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:24.866
I can't believe they're calling me a gold digger.

362
00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.306
You're the one who seduced me.

363
00:19:26.306 --> 00:19:28.875
Hey, they're calling me a wife beater.

364
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.645
You're the one who hit me. I never hit you.

365
00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:34.475
Anyway, we can't fight in front of others.

366
00:19:34.915 --> 00:19:35.915
Okay.

367
00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:39.086
Why did you drag me to the radio booth?

368
00:19:39.086 --> 00:19:40.616
I didn't know we'd be on air.

369
00:19:40.616 --> 00:19:42.185
If you gave me Dr. Park's number...

370
00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:43.425
when I asked you,

371
00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:44.485
we wouldn't be in this trouble.

372
00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:45.925
It's not because of me.

373
00:19:46.225 --> 00:19:47.225
Hey.

374
00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:49.225
Then is it because of me?

375
00:19:50.326 --> 00:19:51.566
What are you doing here?

376
00:19:52.195 --> 00:19:53.366
What's because of what?

377
00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:57.366
It's because of the group meeting...

378
00:19:57.366 --> 00:19:58.766
that we became friends.

379
00:19:58.766 --> 00:19:59.806
Right.

380
00:19:59.806 --> 00:20:01.935
We all became friends because of that meeting.

381
00:20:04.106 --> 00:20:05.675
Bye, now.

382
00:20:08.276 --> 00:20:09.316
Let's go, Sul.

383
00:20:10.645 --> 00:20:12.485
We'll get going, Ban Do.

384
00:20:13.415 --> 00:20:15.915
Okay, Jin Joo. Bye.

385
00:20:28.866 --> 00:20:29.866
Excuse me.

386
00:20:31.635 --> 00:20:32.635
The club.

387
00:20:33.506 --> 00:20:34.506
Doctor...

388
00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:37.546
The note.

389
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:39.006
You remember.

390
00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:41.746
I see you go to my school.

391
00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:44.685
You were awesome on stage last night.

392
00:20:44.685 --> 00:20:45.786
What's he doing?

393
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:46.786
Well...

394
00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:49.516
I think I made a mistake last night.

395
00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:51.225
What?

396
00:20:51.225 --> 00:20:52.856
I should've gotten your number.

397
00:20:53.395 --> 00:20:54.596
I gave you mine instead.

398
00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.125
I guess this is fate.

399
00:20:57.425 --> 00:20:58.526
Because we meet again.

400
00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:03.435
Will you...

401
00:21:04.836 --> 00:21:05.935
give me your number?

402
00:21:10.246 --> 00:21:12.375
Gosh, of course.

403
00:21:12.645 --> 00:21:15.475
- I'll give it to you. - That stupid woman.

404
00:21:17.715 --> 00:21:19.346
Here's my phone number.

405
00:21:21.016 --> 00:21:22.056
I'll call you.

406
00:21:22.286 --> 00:21:23.885
Okay.

407
00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.965
She'll come to her senses after she's stabbed in the back.

408
00:21:30.965 --> 00:21:32.625
That scumbag...

409
00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:35.766
Who are you talking about?

410
00:21:36.635 --> 00:21:38.866
What? It's nothing.

411
00:21:39.106 --> 00:21:40.435
I don't know.

412
00:21:40.435 --> 00:21:42.576
Why should I care? She'll take care of it.

413
00:21:43.875 --> 00:21:45.375
What is it? Who do you mean?

414
00:21:45.576 --> 00:21:46.846
It's nothing.

415
00:21:58.286 --> 00:22:01.756
You there! Get out of my way!

416
00:22:18.606 --> 00:22:19.975
Why is she in my head?

417
00:22:21.975 --> 00:22:23.346
Will you really do it?

418
00:22:23.786 --> 00:22:26.116
Yes. I'll really do it.

419
00:22:28.155 --> 00:22:29.155
Okay.

420
00:22:31.256 --> 00:22:32.685
Help!

421
00:22:33.026 --> 00:22:35.496

422
00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:38.195

424

in the reference room after class.

425
00:22:49.945 --> 00:22:51.776
It's for the freshmen.

426
00:22:52.145 --> 00:22:55.116
So all of you should attend, okay?

427
00:22:55.116 --> 00:22:56.685
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

428
00:23:12.296 --> 00:23:13.566
Is he here to nitpick?

429
00:23:15.036 --> 00:23:17.006
Goodness.

430
00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:18.435
He lost weight.

431
00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:22.336
Well, I guess it's because I gave him false hope...

432
00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:23.975
after I rejected him.

433
00:23:25.076 --> 00:23:26.076
By the way,

434
00:23:26.106 --> 00:23:28.246
did he really stay single for 18 years...

435
00:23:28.246 --> 00:23:29.985
because he couldn't get over me?

436
00:23:33.086 --> 00:23:34.086
Hey.

437
00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:35.185
What?

438
00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:37.225
"Hey"?

439
00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:39.856
I'm asking you this...

440
00:23:40.925 --> 00:23:42.796
just in case.

441
00:23:44.266 --> 00:23:45.266
You don't think...

442
00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.796
I like you, do you?

443
00:23:47.796 --> 00:23:48.796
Pardon?

444
00:23:49.935 --> 00:23:51.165
Well...

445
00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:52.506
What is he saying?

446
00:23:53.836 --> 00:23:54.975
You do.

447
00:23:57.276 --> 00:23:58.346
You thought so, didn't you?

448
00:23:59.106 --> 00:24:01.246
Well, it's because you said you liked me.

449
00:24:01.246 --> 00:24:02.576
I never did.

450
00:24:03.116 --> 00:24:04.985
Well, you asked me out on a date.

451
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.155
I asked you out, but I never said I liked you.

452
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:08.155
Pardon?

453
00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:11.225
What's with him?

454
00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:13.356
Is he getting back at me for rejecting him?

455
00:24:13.356 --> 00:24:16.665
You have to like someone to go on a date.

456
00:24:16.796 --> 00:24:17.996
Then why did you ask me out?

457
00:24:17.996 --> 00:24:19.165
Because you were in front of me.

458
00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:22.135
Because I was in front of you?

459
00:24:22.135 --> 00:24:23.965
What if someone else was in front of you?

460
00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:25.106
I would've asked her out.

461
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:32.405
It's all clear now, right?

462
00:24:32.546 --> 00:24:34.375
Then let's not be clingy.

463
00:24:35.215 --> 00:24:36.546
Something...

464
00:24:41.116 --> 00:24:42.185
like this.

465
00:24:43.725 --> 00:24:44.725
Don't do it.

466
00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:46.485
Bye.

467
00:24:52.366 --> 00:24:54.195
He asked me out because I was in front of him?

468
00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:56.096
What?

469
00:24:56.866 --> 00:24:58.836
Then he never liked me in the past.

470
00:24:59.135 --> 00:25:00.806
Why is he telling me this now...

471

after 18 years?

472
00:25:05.776 --> 00:25:07.316
He shouldn't have told me that.

473
00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.185
He shouldn't have told me.

Yes, you did.

512
00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:54.536
- Hey. - Goodness.

513
00:29:00.746 --> 00:29:01.915
I'm sorry.

514
00:29:01.975 --> 00:29:04.816
(Asura)

515
00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:19.096
Seo Young.

516
00:29:19.195 --> 00:29:20.635
Get a hold of yourself.

517
00:29:22.165 --> 00:29:25.705
You're the main soloist, yet your body looks heavy.

518
00:29:25.705 --> 00:29:27.205
Are you going to manage your weight like this?

519
00:29:27.405 --> 00:29:28.606
I'm trying my hardest,

520
00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:31.405
but I don't get fat or thin easily.

521
00:29:31.405 --> 00:29:33.076
Is that your excuse?

522
00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:38.816
- You can drink these. - Sure.

523
00:29:39.715 --> 00:29:40.985
And have some of this.

524
00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:42.685
- But I'm on a diet. - Are you?

525
00:29:44.026 --> 00:29:45.256
I'll start tomorrow.

526
00:29:47.955 --> 00:29:49.425
This is good.

527
00:29:49.425 --> 00:29:51.096
Seo Young, come here.

528
00:29:51.165 --> 00:29:52.965
He brought some snacks for you.

529
00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:55.996
Hey, you must've been out.

530
00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:59.066
Yes, hey.

531
00:29:59.066 --> 00:30:00.135
Sit here.

532
00:30:05.106 --> 00:30:07.715
I bought sweet stuff because I thought you could use some sugar.

533
00:30:08.046 --> 00:30:09.885
You're very considerate.

534
00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:12.586
After we practice for a long time, we really crave sweets.

535
00:30:12.645 --> 00:30:13.885
How did you know?

536
00:30:14.316 --> 00:30:15.616
I read something like this.

537
00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:17.625
They say, "Life is bitter."

538
00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:18.885
And practice is bitter too.

539
00:30:19.326 --> 00:30:21.225
You need something sweet from time to time...

540
00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:23.895
to endure the bitter times looking forward to the sweets.

541
00:30:24.026 --> 00:30:25.826
- You have a point. - You're funny.

542
00:30:28.836 --> 00:30:29.935
Here.

543
00:30:29.935 --> 00:30:31.435
This way, you won't get it on your fingers.

544
00:30:32.006 --> 00:30:33.435
No, I'm fine.

545
00:30:34.576 --> 00:30:35.905
I think my stomach is upset.

546
00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:37.645
Really?

547
00:30:39.506 --> 00:30:41.046
Who is that guy?

548
00:30:41.076 --> 00:30:42.875
Is that her boyfriend?

549
00:30:43.246 --> 00:30:45.286
I never even had a chance to talk to her.

550
00:30:47.856 --> 00:30:49.215
Hey, guys.

551
00:30:49.385 --> 00:30:51.026
Come in. Let's share this.

552
00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:52.925
Us?

553
00:30:53.655 --> 00:30:54.925
Are you talking to us?

554
00:30:55.256 --> 00:30:56.395
Yes, you guys.

555
00:31:00.836 --> 00:31:01.866
Oh, gosh.

556
00:31:05.735 --> 00:31:07.576
- Thanks. - Thank you.

557
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.675
I hope the practice goes well.

558
00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:14.445
I'll return with something sweet before you forget me.

559
00:31:16.786 --> 00:31:17.915
Hey.

560
00:31:18.616 --> 00:31:19.715
Goodbye.

561
00:31:22.385 --> 00:31:23.625
Bye, guys.

562
00:31:23.725 --> 00:31:25.586
- Bye. - Come visit again.

563
00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:29.925
I never noticed him, but he's pretty cool.

564
00:31:31.866 --> 00:31:34.766
That was a perfect plan.

565
00:31:34.796 --> 00:31:37.536
He must really like you. He's nice to us too.

566
00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:39.205
Do you think so?

567
00:31:41.506 --> 00:31:43.106
Thanks for the donuts.

568
00:31:43.606 --> 00:31:45.645
You didn't have to mind us.

569
00:31:45.975 --> 00:31:48.875
That was a part of the plan too.

570
00:31:49.046 --> 00:31:50.846
That's how relaxed a middle-age man is.

571
00:31:51.346 --> 00:31:53.046
Sure, keep it up.

572
00:31:57.856 --> 00:31:59.526
Seo Young, are you okay?

573
00:31:59.586 --> 00:32:01.056
Seo Young, stand up.

574
00:32:01.225 --> 00:32:03.266
- Oh, no. - What do we do?

575
00:32:03.665 --> 00:32:05.395
- What is this? What happened? - What's wrong?

576
00:32:05.395 --> 00:32:07.496
- Should we call the 911? - Oh, no.

577
00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:08.766
- Can you give me a hand? - Okay.

578
00:32:09.866 --> 00:32:12.606
- Where's the nurse's room? - Right side, the end of the hall.

579
00:32:14.276 --> 00:32:16.475
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

580
00:32:17.375 --> 00:32:19.546
- Oh, gosh. - What do we do?

581
00:32:19.546 --> 00:32:22.175
She's like a feather. Why is she so light?

582
00:32:23.385 --> 00:32:24.485
Attention.

583
00:32:24.485 --> 00:32:28.185
That is history department's reference library.

584
00:32:31.286 --> 00:32:33.026
Just as you've heard,

585
00:32:33.395 --> 00:32:34.996
a long time ago,

586
00:32:35.326 --> 00:32:39.066
a freshman hung herself right in that room.

587
00:32:40.496 --> 00:32:42.866
However, after that day,

588
00:32:42.965 --> 00:32:45.905
many people have said they saw her ghost there.

589
00:32:49.606 --> 00:32:52.475
If any of you successfully go in there...

590
00:32:52.475 --> 00:32:54.776
and bring the specified book,

591
00:32:55.715 --> 00:32:57.645
the drinks are on us.

592
00:33:03.385 --> 00:33:06.125
However, no one ever successfully did this.

593
00:33:07.625 --> 00:33:09.096
Do we have to go in there?

594
00:33:09.725 --> 00:33:10.826
I'm scared.

595
00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:13.496
A horror experience.

596
00:33:14.036 --> 00:33:15.596
"Do Not Look Back".

597
00:33:17.266 --> 00:33:19.106
That's not scary.

598
00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:21.705
Why are they putting on a show?

599
00:33:24.675 --> 00:33:25.905
Hey, are you okay?

600
00:33:25.905 --> 00:33:27.246
- What? - What happened?

601
00:33:27.246 --> 00:33:29.116
- Calm down. - What happened?

602
00:33:29.116 --> 00:33:31.385
- Calm down. - There really was a ghost.

603
00:33:31.546 --> 00:33:33.415
Darn it, this is frightening.

604
00:33:33.556 --> 00:33:36.016
Who wants to go next?

605
00:33:37.756 --> 00:33:38.955
What is this? No one?

606
00:33:38.955 --> 00:33:40.256
She's really there.

607
00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:41.955
Just one more person.

608
00:33:45.395 --> 00:33:46.695
No one's going to succeed this year either.

609
00:33:48.096 --> 00:33:49.665
None of them can go inside.

610
00:33:51.705 --> 00:33:52.836
Ma Jin Joo?

611
00:34:01.875 --> 00:34:03.385
Is there really a ghost here?

612
00:34:07.185 --> 00:34:08.916
A red sticker.

613
00:34:10.025 --> 00:34:12.085
A red sticker.

614
00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:25.235
My gosh.

615
00:34:39.516 --> 00:34:40.755
Oh, goodness.

616
00:34:41.985 --> 00:34:43.016
Save me!

617
00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:48.795
My gosh, that startled me.

618
00:34:51.266 --> 00:34:52.326
Oh, gosh.

619
00:34:54.036 --> 00:34:55.166
What are these?

620
00:35:04.976 --> 00:35:06.005
What? What?

621
00:35:06.005 --> 00:35:07.175
Why are you doing this?

622
00:35:07.376 --> 00:35:10.085
Someone save me!

623
00:35:10.715 --> 00:35:12.616
Stop coming.

624
00:35:19.755 --> 00:35:20.855
Oh, gosh!

625
00:35:28.536 --> 00:35:29.795
Oh, no!

626
00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:38.806
Hey.

627
00:35:41.116 --> 00:35:42.175
Hey.

628
00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:47.855
It's a ghost!

629
00:35:53.556 --> 00:35:55.255
I remember you hiding there.

630
00:35:55.456 --> 00:35:56.695
I won't fall for this the second time.

631
00:35:59.025 --> 00:36:01.235
It's a ghost!

632
00:36:01.496 --> 00:36:03.335
Another one ran out.

633
00:36:03.766 --> 00:36:06.905
Anyway, why would a freshman kill herself here?

634
00:36:07.605 --> 00:36:10.275
It's scary. Goodness.

635
00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:15.016
It's because you tricked me.

636
00:36:21.355 --> 00:36:23.855
Okay, I got both of them out.

637
00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:25.985
Let's find that book now.

638
00:36:34.695 --> 00:36:36.036
Did you see the ghost?

639
00:36:36.036 --> 00:36:37.766
- I saw her. - Did you?

640
00:36:40.605 --> 00:36:42.476
- Goodness. - Goodness.

641
00:36:45.976 --> 00:36:47.445
Is it over already?

642
00:36:56.355 --> 00:36:57.385
My gosh.

643
00:36:57.385 --> 00:36:58.885
A red envelope.

644
00:37:00.355 --> 00:37:02.056
Let's see.

645
00:37:02.425 --> 00:37:04.695
A red envelope.

646
00:37:05.096 --> 00:37:06.126
A red...

647
00:37:08.096 --> 00:37:09.195
Found it.

648
00:37:16.775 --> 00:37:18.105
All right.

649
00:37:19.675 --> 00:37:21.945
Everyone will party tonight all thanks to me.

650
00:37:23.516 --> 00:37:24.985
What's so fun about this?

651
00:37:26.246 --> 00:37:27.956
Goodness, kids.

652
00:37:29.016 --> 00:37:30.255
I found it.

653
00:38:48.096 --> 00:38:50.436
I woke up because I'm hungry.

654
00:38:55.835 --> 00:38:57.675
You woke up because you're hungry too, right?

655
00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:00.876
What?

656
00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:07.516
If you're up, let's go.

657
00:39:08.686 --> 00:39:09.686
Go where?

658
00:39:19.366 --> 00:39:22.465
You two should never break up.

659
00:39:30.746 --> 00:39:33.105
Great. This is it.

660
00:39:33.105 --> 00:39:34.476
It's so delicious.

661
00:39:36.376 --> 00:39:37.646
What are you doing?

662
00:39:37.646 --> 00:39:39.385
I'm not going to eat.

663
00:39:39.385 --> 00:39:41.855
- Okay. Don't eat. - What?

664
00:39:41.855 --> 00:39:43.186
The nurse told me...

665
00:39:43.186 --> 00:39:44.755
you were watching your weight.

666
00:39:44.755 --> 00:39:46.596
I don't want you to blame me later.

667
00:39:46.596 --> 00:39:47.795
So don't eat.

668
00:39:48.456 --> 00:39:50.726
Then why am I sitting here?

669
00:39:50.925 --> 00:39:51.925
Wait.

670
00:39:52.996 --> 00:39:54.195
Gosh, it's delicious.

671
00:39:55.195 --> 00:39:56.965
Please keep me company.

672
00:39:56.965 --> 00:39:58.536
I really wanted to have samgyeopsal,

673
00:39:58.536 --> 00:40:00.275
but I had no friend to eat with.

674
00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:01.775
We know each other's number.

675
00:40:01.775 --> 00:40:03.175
You can do that for me, can't you?

676
00:40:06.616 --> 00:40:07.715
Do you want to try one?

677
00:40:08.076 --> 00:40:09.675
- Just one. - What?

678
00:40:13.985 --> 00:40:15.485
No.

679
00:40:15.715 --> 00:40:18.326
You're have to control your weight. What am I doing?

680
00:40:18.326 --> 00:40:19.556
No.

681
00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:20.655
I'm sorry.

682
00:40:23.326 --> 00:40:24.326
Hey.

683
00:40:24.965 --> 00:40:27.266
Why should I just sit here and watch?

684
00:40:27.266 --> 00:40:29.166
It's okay to eat one.

685
00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:34.936
You shouldn't.

686
00:40:37.646 --> 00:40:39.045
It's good.

687
00:40:52.485 --> 00:40:55.155
Didn't you say you were only going to eat one?

688
00:40:59.795 --> 00:41:00.795
I meant...

689
00:41:01.536 --> 00:41:04.366
one meal. I can have one meal.

690
00:41:05.905 --> 00:41:08.175
Okay. Eat up.

691
00:41:08.706 --> 00:41:10.976
If the food is delicious, it's zero calorie.

692
00:41:11.206 --> 00:41:12.675
Who says?

693
00:41:12.675 --> 00:41:13.746
That's the way it is.

694
00:41:26.755 --> 00:41:28.226
I'm so silly.

695
00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:30.326
Why am I nervous?

696
00:41:30.396 --> 00:41:31.896
He's just a kid.

697
00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:39.235
I mean...

698
00:41:39.465 --> 00:41:41.876
I've never gotten this far...

699
00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:45.405
Why didn't you say you were hiding?

700
00:41:45.405 --> 00:41:46.815
Why would I hide then?

701
00:41:46.945 --> 00:41:48.416
Well, you're right.

702
00:41:48.616 --> 00:41:50.085
Gosh, he's cranky.

703
00:41:50.085 --> 00:41:51.686
Goodness.

704
00:41:51.686 --> 00:41:53.355
I told you not to flirty with me.

705
00:41:54.355 --> 00:41:56.556
I don't think I did this time.

706
00:41:57.286 --> 00:42:00.525
You came to me and saved me.

707
00:42:00.525 --> 00:42:02.896
I guess you saved me because I was in front of you.

708
00:42:03.795 --> 00:42:04.896
Thank you.

709
00:42:10.706 --> 00:42:12.735
I think it's over.

710
00:42:12.735 --> 00:42:13.775
Aren't you going to leave?

711
00:42:13.976 --> 00:42:15.306
You should go first.

712
00:42:19.146 --> 00:42:20.516
Did you get hurt?

713
00:42:21.715 --> 00:42:23.686
Let me take a look.

714
00:42:23.786 --> 00:42:25.116
Hey.

715
00:42:26.286 --> 00:42:28.255
Don't touch my leg...

716
00:42:28.855 --> 00:42:30.085
Gosh.

717
00:42:30.085 --> 00:42:31.626
He's so fussy.

718
00:42:32.286 --> 00:42:34.726
Whatever. Let me see.

719
00:42:37.525 --> 00:42:39.795
Gosh, it's swollen.

720
00:42:40.465 --> 00:42:43.195
You should've been more careful.

721
00:42:43.835 --> 00:42:45.436
It must hurt.

722
00:42:46.235 --> 00:42:48.476
Sprained ankles can bother you forever.

723
00:42:48.476 --> 00:42:49.806
My goodness.

724
00:42:49.806 --> 00:42:51.976
Let's see. Try moving it.

725
00:42:51.976 --> 00:42:54.846
Try moving it a little bit.

726
00:42:55.116 --> 00:42:56.346
It's okay.

727
00:42:59.545 --> 00:43:01.485
Why do you keep talking down to me?

728
00:43:10.326 --> 00:43:11.326
Gosh.

729
00:43:13.396 --> 00:43:14.996
Hey, what are you doing?

730
00:43:14.996 --> 00:43:16.766
Let's just go.

731
00:43:16.766 --> 00:43:18.536
You can't walk properly.

732
00:43:18.965 --> 00:43:20.905
I told you not to do something like this.

733
00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:21.976
Walk slowly.

734
00:43:25.905 --> 00:43:27.315
Thank you.

735
00:43:32.585 --> 00:43:34.885
Oh, no.

736
00:43:38.726 --> 00:43:41.295
I'm crazy.

737
00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:09.456
I'll take these.

738
00:44:11.626 --> 00:44:12.626
Let's go.

739
00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:14.956
We ate, so now we should make zero calorie.

740
00:44:16.096 --> 00:44:17.166
What?

741
00:44:26.675 --> 00:44:28.135
Isn't it better to do the things you want...

742
00:44:28.135 --> 00:44:30.105
and clean up the mess after,

743
00:44:30.175 --> 00:44:32.576
rather than to get stressed by restraining yourself?

744
00:44:32.846 --> 00:44:34.545
Everything we do is to live.

745
00:44:34.545 --> 00:44:36.175
I guess it's not that big of a deal,

746
00:44:36.175 --> 00:44:38.116
now that I've done it.

747
00:44:38.385 --> 00:44:41.016
There's always a way to save yourself.

748
00:44:41.016 --> 00:44:42.085
The mess you make...

749
00:44:42.085 --> 00:44:44.056
can always be cleaned up.

750
00:44:44.855 --> 00:44:46.826
Doctors actually say it's better for women to...

751
00:44:46.826 --> 00:44:49.096
have some coffee or alcohol from time to time,

752
00:44:49.096 --> 00:44:51.866
rather than getting stressed from not drinking it.

753
00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:54.235
No way. I don't believe that.

754
00:44:54.235 --> 00:44:56.465
I'm serious. My wife...

755
00:44:59.335 --> 00:45:02.076
When my sister was pregnant,

756
00:45:02.076 --> 00:45:03.076
that's what I heard.

757
00:45:07.116 --> 00:45:08.976
Why did you do that suddenly?

758
00:45:09.885 --> 00:45:11.985
What? What do you mean?

759
00:45:13.215 --> 00:45:14.456
I mean...

760
00:45:14.686 --> 00:45:17.726
you couldn't talk to me before.

761
00:45:17.726 --> 00:45:19.726
You used to run away and hide.

762
00:45:20.855 --> 00:45:22.956
- What? - But all of a sudden...

763
00:45:23.465 --> 00:45:25.826
you asked me for my number and came to see me.

764
00:45:26.565 --> 00:45:27.996
You're like a different person.

765
00:45:28.835 --> 00:45:30.436
Did you know...

766
00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:32.905
that I was watching you?

767
00:45:32.905 --> 00:45:33.905
Yes.

768
00:45:34.005 --> 00:45:36.476
I've never seen anyone who was so bad at hiding.

769
00:45:40.346 --> 00:45:41.346
Well...

770
00:45:42.675 --> 00:45:44.016
Please forget that guy...

771
00:45:44.016 --> 00:45:45.686
from a few days ago.

772
00:45:46.346 --> 00:45:47.755
He was such a geek, wasn't he?

773
00:45:53.496 --> 00:45:54.896
What does that smile mean?

774
00:46:12.775 --> 00:46:14.215
This is nice.

775
00:46:16.076 --> 00:46:18.315
Seoul's air used to be like this.

776
00:46:18.815 --> 00:46:20.186
There's no fine dust.

777
00:46:20.186 --> 00:46:22.416
The sky is so clear.

778
00:46:23.385 --> 00:46:25.226
What's fine dust?

779
00:46:26.425 --> 00:46:29.355
It's famous air made in China.

780
00:46:29.496 --> 00:46:31.195
Does China sell air?

781
00:46:33.096 --> 00:46:34.766
They probably will.

782
00:46:34.766 --> 00:46:35.965
That's silly.

783
00:46:39.706 --> 00:46:41.576
This is really nice.

784
00:46:42.536 --> 00:46:44.105
I've never been to a place like this before.

785
00:46:53.456 --> 00:46:55.355
How did you know my shoe size?

786
00:46:55.755 --> 00:46:56.755
What?

787
00:46:58.126 --> 00:47:00.456
I just eyeballed it.

788
00:47:01.096 --> 00:47:02.295
What?

789
00:47:25.516 --> 00:47:27.755
- A nation without history... - A nation without history...

790
00:47:27.755 --> 00:47:29.556
- has no future! - has no future!

791
00:47:32.985 --> 00:47:34.755
(A nation without history has no future!)

792
00:47:34.855 --> 00:47:36.396
I never thought...

793
00:47:36.396 --> 00:47:38.826
Ma Jin Joo would succeed.

794
00:47:38.826 --> 00:47:40.335
She's amazing.

795
00:47:40.335 --> 00:47:43.536
- Ma Jin Joo! - Ma Jin Joo!

796
00:47:43.706 --> 00:47:45.235
- Ma Jin Joo! - Ma Jin Joo!

797
00:47:45.235 --> 00:47:48.005
Ghosts aren't scary.

798
00:47:48.005 --> 00:47:49.835
People are scarier.

799
00:48:06.186 --> 00:48:07.195
Here.

800
00:48:09.496 --> 00:48:11.065
You should put this on your ankle.

801
00:48:11.326 --> 00:48:13.065
It looked really swollen earlier.

802
00:48:13.195 --> 00:48:14.436
Don't mind me.

803
00:48:14.666 --> 00:48:18.005
Gosh, you never listen.

804
00:48:18.405 --> 00:48:19.666
Here.

805
00:48:22.036 --> 00:48:23.246
Hey.

806
00:48:23.405 --> 00:48:24.445
What are you doing?

807
00:48:26.646 --> 00:48:28.675
You got hurt because of me.

808
00:48:28.675 --> 00:48:29.746
How can I...

809
00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:31.445
not be concerned?

810
00:48:31.616 --> 00:48:33.556
Do you have eighth-grade syndrome or something?

811
00:48:33.755 --> 00:48:36.925
Why are you so prissy? Goodness.

812
00:48:37.626 --> 00:48:38.686
Don't take that off.

813
00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:41.195
Keep it there until the swelling goes away.

814
00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:48.036
Jin Joo, where have you been?

815
00:48:48.036 --> 00:48:49.565
- Let's drink. - All right.

816
00:48:49.565 --> 00:48:50.666
Cheers.

817
00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:53.235
- Cheers. - What was that? Is she a doctor?

818
00:48:53.235 --> 00:48:55.005
- Goodness. - Gosh.

819
00:48:55.505 --> 00:48:56.775
My stress is all gone.

820
00:48:56.775 --> 00:48:59.105
- All right, then. - Let's drink!

821
00:48:59.175 --> 00:49:01.516
And why does she keep talking down to me?

822
00:49:10.585 --> 00:49:11.686
This is great.

823
00:49:11.755 --> 00:49:13.295
Jin Joo, bottoms up.

824
00:49:13.295 --> 00:49:14.355
No, not me.

825
00:49:14.355 --> 00:49:16.425
No, no. You do it because you brought it up.

826
00:49:16.425 --> 00:49:18.965
- Bottoms up, bottoms up. - Bottoms up, bottoms up.

827
00:49:22.695 --> 00:49:23.835
Give her another glass.

828
00:49:34.815 --> 00:49:36.076
That hit the spot.

829
00:49:39.116 --> 00:49:40.286
Sul.

830
00:49:40.715 --> 00:49:42.585
Why are you drinking juice instead of beer?

831
00:49:43.226 --> 00:49:45.826
You and I never used to drink.

832
00:49:49.996 --> 00:49:51.726
But still, have some.

833
00:49:51.726 --> 00:49:53.126
Once you get married,

834
00:49:53.126 --> 00:49:55.735
you won't have enough time to get drunk even if you want to.

835
00:49:55.735 --> 00:49:56.806
Get married?

836
00:49:57.905 --> 00:50:01.835
I still hate seeing how people lose themselves when they get drunk.

837
00:50:06.476 --> 00:50:08.916
Sul, after living for some time, I realized it's okay...

838
00:50:10.146 --> 00:50:11.346
to lose yourself a bit.

839
00:50:12.315 --> 00:50:14.815
If you can't party because you're conscious of others,

840
00:50:14.815 --> 00:50:16.116
it's only bad for you.

841
00:50:16.116 --> 00:50:18.286
There's a season in life when you can lose yourself.

842
00:50:18.485 --> 00:50:21.126
If you lose yourself when you're older, that's worse.

843
00:50:21.996 --> 00:50:23.025
What?

844
00:50:23.565 --> 00:50:24.925
This is the time...

845
00:50:26.635 --> 00:50:27.766
for us to drink and party.

846
00:50:28.965 --> 00:50:30.605
All right, then.

847
00:50:30.806 --> 00:50:33.576
Don't mind others today, and eat as much as you want.

848
00:50:33.905 --> 00:50:34.936
Our slogan!

849
00:50:34.936 --> 00:50:38.376
A nation without history has no future!

850
00:50:38.405 --> 00:50:40.175
History department is the best!

851
00:50:51.885 --> 00:50:53.655
It's past... No future.

852
00:50:53.826 --> 00:50:54.925
No future.

853
00:50:59.096 --> 00:51:01.936
Hey, what's Sul doing over there?

854
00:51:02.795 --> 00:51:05.835
I'm going to take this one.

855
00:51:06.876 --> 00:51:10.346
I'm going to take seasoned chicken too.

856
00:51:12.706 --> 00:51:14.775
Half regular, half seasoned. Half and half.

857
00:51:29.056 --> 00:51:30.096
That hurt.

858
00:51:33.536 --> 00:51:35.596
Is the table all right?

859
00:51:40.405 --> 00:51:42.135
I think it's broken.

860
00:51:47.275 --> 00:51:49.016
My dear seniors.

861
00:51:49.675 --> 00:51:52.985
Make sure Sul gets home all right.

862
00:51:53.045 --> 00:51:55.085
Please, thank you.

863
00:51:56.826 --> 00:51:57.855
The roll call.

864
00:51:58.286 --> 00:52:01.695
She can't be late for the roll call.

865
00:52:01.755 --> 00:52:04.726
We have a lot of time left until the roll call.

866
00:52:05.166 --> 00:52:07.496
Hey, you can just go.

867
00:52:07.835 --> 00:52:11.405
In that case, goodbye.

868
00:52:20.076 --> 00:52:22.215
Hey, do you want to take one?

869
00:52:23.715 --> 00:52:25.616
Do you want one?

870
00:52:38.465 --> 00:52:39.795
She should be taking care of herself.

871
00:54:55.565 --> 00:54:57.666
If you ever feel like doing something again, let me know.

872
00:54:58.635 --> 00:55:00.936
I'll help you reset it back to zero calories.

873
00:55:03.576 --> 00:55:05.806
You're too young to live holding yourself back.

874
00:55:08.376 --> 00:55:09.416
No.

875
00:55:09.985 --> 00:55:11.116
Thanks for today,

876
00:55:11.445 --> 00:55:12.786
but don't ever do that again.

877
00:55:15.585 --> 00:55:19.525
I never missed first place during youth competitions.

878
00:55:20.096 --> 00:55:21.726
I got this far...

879
00:55:22.226 --> 00:55:25.025
because I held back no matter how hard it was.

880
00:55:26.025 --> 00:55:27.465
It didn't just happen.

881
00:55:29.335 --> 00:55:30.666
Anyway, thanks.

882
00:55:34.735 --> 00:55:36.275
I'd like to know more about you.

883
00:55:43.016 --> 00:55:44.186
There's my bus.

884
00:55:46.246 --> 00:55:47.315
Goodbye, then.

885
00:55:47.315 --> 00:55:48.885
Sure, goodbye.

886
00:55:54.726 --> 00:55:55.896
Bye.

887
00:56:04.105 --> 00:56:05.166
Yes!

888
00:56:05.335 --> 00:56:07.405
Yes, yes, yes!

889
00:56:10.746 --> 00:56:13.315
Gosh, great job. Great job.

890
00:56:34.235 --> 00:56:35.866
It's still very hot.

891
00:56:36.135 --> 00:56:37.565
It really is summer now.

892
00:56:56.585 --> 00:56:58.855
- Honey. - Goodness, I said it's hot.

893
00:56:59.556 --> 00:57:02.425
It's too hot. It's hot.

894
00:57:07.666 --> 00:57:08.766
It's hot!

895
00:57:27.016 --> 00:57:28.155
I'm still here.

896
00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:45.465
Goodness.

897
00:57:46.266 --> 00:57:49.635
What's gotten into you? You're washing the dishes.

898
00:57:50.905 --> 00:57:52.175
Do you want to get married?

899
00:57:53.646 --> 00:57:55.376
Is that the only way I can wash the dishes?

900
00:57:55.775 --> 00:57:57.186
Have a seat and rest, Mom.

901
00:57:57.916 --> 00:57:59.385
Move aside.

902
00:57:59.545 --> 00:58:02.215
You'll do this for life after you get married anyway.

903
00:58:02.715 --> 00:58:04.556
You'll be doing this until you die.

904
00:58:05.286 --> 00:58:06.655
Have you matured?

905
00:58:07.355 --> 00:58:09.655
I don't know when I'll be a kid again,

906
00:58:10.126 --> 00:58:11.965
so when that happens, just accept it.

907
00:58:12.596 --> 00:58:13.735
What are you talking about?

908
00:58:14.635 --> 00:58:15.835
Go rest.

909
00:58:17.806 --> 00:58:19.976
Have a seat. Just rest.

910
00:58:23.505 --> 00:58:24.545
Let's get a watermelon.

911
00:58:25.976 --> 00:58:27.545
How much is this?

912
00:58:27.746 --> 00:58:29.045
It's 5 dollars for 1.

913
00:58:29.815 --> 00:58:31.045
Is this five dollars?

914
00:58:31.885 --> 00:58:33.146
Mom, you like grapes.

915
00:58:33.456 --> 00:58:36.315
You're right. They do look great.

916
00:58:36.655 --> 00:58:37.925
It's okay.

917
00:58:38.226 --> 00:58:40.355
I'm the only one who eats grapes.

918
00:58:40.355 --> 00:58:43.695
You two and your dad love watermelon.

919
00:58:45.266 --> 00:58:46.465
Just get it.

920
00:58:47.396 --> 00:58:49.766
I really want some grapes today too.

921
00:58:50.536 --> 00:58:52.605
You never eat any grapes.

922
00:58:52.735 --> 00:58:54.505
I love grapes.

923
00:58:54.905 --> 00:58:56.005
Just like you.

924
00:59:06.416 --> 00:59:07.416
That's right.

925
00:59:08.286 --> 00:59:10.525
I forgot to pick up the photos.

926
00:59:10.525 --> 00:59:12.956
Goodness. How could I forget?

927
00:59:13.655 --> 00:59:15.295
The photo studio next to the market?

928
00:59:15.295 --> 00:59:16.295
Yes.

929
00:59:16.666 --> 00:59:18.396
You go home first. I'll get them.

930
00:59:18.896 --> 00:59:20.666
Thanks.

931
00:59:33.146 --> 00:59:34.146
What?

932
00:59:35.175 --> 00:59:36.916
(To Go Eun Sook)

933
00:59:37.315 --> 00:59:39.416
Who left this here?

934
00:59:54.965 --> 00:59:56.065
Goodness.

935
00:59:59.065 --> 01:00:00.076
Mister.

936
01:00:01.005 --> 01:00:04.306
You should say sorry if you bumped into someone.

937
01:00:04.306 --> 01:00:06.675
Can't you see I dropped these because of you?

938
01:00:07.876 --> 01:00:10.516
You should've held on to them better.

939
01:00:10.916 --> 01:00:11.945
What?

940
01:00:12.385 --> 01:00:13.786
I was just standing in front of my house.

941
01:00:13.786 --> 01:00:15.815
You're the one who bumped into me, no the other way.

942
01:00:15.815 --> 01:00:17.855
Gosh, what is this lady?

943
01:00:17.885 --> 01:00:19.425
What a bad luck.

944
01:00:19.896 --> 01:00:21.996
So what do you want me to do?

945
01:00:22.195 --> 01:00:23.496
What do you want me to do?

946
01:00:23.496 --> 01:00:25.195
Why you...

947
01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:27.635
What's wrong with you?

948
01:00:27.735 --> 01:00:29.496
How dare you speak to her like that?

949
01:00:30.135 --> 01:00:32.766
What? "How dare you"?

950
01:00:33.036 --> 01:00:34.876
Gosh, what a day.

951
01:00:35.405 --> 01:00:37.275
What's with this neighborhood?

952
01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:40.116
If you bumped into someone you should apologize.

953
01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:41.346
Or pay her for ruining her groceries.

954
01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.416
You should do something, you little punk.

955
01:00:44.646 --> 01:00:46.885
That's right, you little punk.

956
01:00:48.956 --> 01:00:51.425
I can't believe this.

957
01:00:51.425 --> 01:00:52.585
Who are you?

958
01:00:52.686 --> 01:00:54.295
Why are you butting in?

959
01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:55.525
Me?

960
01:00:57.326 --> 01:00:58.425
I'm her son.

961
01:00:58.826 --> 01:00:59.826
What's that to you?

962
01:00:59.936 --> 01:01:00.936
Her son?

963
01:01:01.835 --> 01:01:05.036
Gosh. I knew it.

964
01:01:05.335 --> 01:01:06.335
Gosh.

965
01:01:07.405 --> 01:01:10.545
Consider yourselves lucky. My goodness.

966
01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:11.976
What?

967
01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:14.576
That rude brat.

968
01:01:17.315 --> 01:01:19.346
Are you okay, ma'am?

969
01:01:20.286 --> 01:01:21.385
Yes.

970
01:01:27.155 --> 01:01:28.155
Here.

971
01:01:29.126 --> 01:01:30.396
Thank you.

972
01:01:30.826 --> 01:01:34.235
Your mom must feel so reassured to have a son like you.

973
01:01:34.396 --> 01:01:36.166
All I have are two daughters.

974
01:01:44.675 --> 01:01:47.775
Why do you look so happy? Your daughter's getting married!

975
01:01:47.775 --> 01:01:50.416
How can you look so happy?

976
01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:52.346
Of course I'm happy.

977
01:01:52.346 --> 01:01:53.686
I never had a son.

978
01:01:53.686 --> 01:01:55.855
But now I have one.

979
01:01:57.655 --> 01:01:59.525
He's so handsome.

980
01:02:05.496 --> 01:02:06.695
Hey!

981
01:02:10.806 --> 01:02:11.806
Goodness.

982
01:02:13.905 --> 01:02:15.105
Mom, go inside.

983
01:02:16.005 --> 01:02:17.545
What are you doing?

984
01:02:17.545 --> 01:02:18.706
He...

985
01:02:18.706 --> 01:02:20.246
Mom, go inside.

986
01:02:20.246 --> 01:02:22.116
Go in first. Here.

987
01:02:22.116 --> 01:02:23.385
Go in.

988
01:02:23.686 --> 01:02:25.045
Go inside, okay?

989
01:02:33.496 --> 01:02:34.496
Well...

990
01:02:35.425 --> 01:02:37.726
I was just passing by.

991
01:02:38.496 --> 01:02:39.565
How dare you...

992
01:02:39.896 --> 01:02:41.396
come here?

993
01:02:45.905 --> 01:02:47.735
Did you come here to see my mom?

994
01:03:03.016 --> 01:03:04.686
I'm sorry.

995
01:03:05.985 --> 01:03:08.496
I'm sorry, Mother.

996
01:03:09.496 --> 01:03:10.866
I'm sorry.

997
01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:13.666
I'm sorry.

998
01:03:52.635 --> 01:03:55.806
(Go Back Couple)

999
01:03:55.806 --> 01:03:57.976
You're acting weird lately.

1000
01:03:57.976 --> 01:04:00.246
You had a dream that I was dying.

1001
01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:01.775
Are you going out with Bo Reum?

1002
01:04:01.775 --> 01:04:03.715
No, they aren't going out.

1003
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.385
It wasn't a kiss. It was a peck.

1004
01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:07.416
Eating alone makes you lose appetite.

1005
01:04:07.916 --> 01:04:10.085
It has to be here, right?

1006
01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.326
I didn't do anything wrong.

1007
01:04:12.585 --> 01:04:13.855
It's not like I'm cheating.

1008
01:04:14.096 --> 01:04:15.226
Why is she here?

1009
01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:17.195
You said we were going to the hospital.

1010
01:04:17.195 --> 01:04:19.266
You told me not to flirt with you.

1011
01:04:19.266 --> 01:04:20.635
You aren't asking me out.

1012
01:04:20.835 --> 01:04:21.936
I'm not.

1013
01:04:21.936 --> 01:04:23.096
I'm hitting on you.
