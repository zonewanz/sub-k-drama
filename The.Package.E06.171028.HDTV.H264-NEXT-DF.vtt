<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.527
<i>It's too ordinary.</i>

4
00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:35.443
<i>Just enough clouds, just enough sunlight</i>

5
00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:37.413
<i>and just enough tears.</i>

6
00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:44.023
<i>If it rained right now,
I'd feel like the lead of a tragic love.</i>

7
00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.578
<i>But there's no way that will happen.</i>

8
00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:52.437
<i>Because I've never been
a lead in this world.</i>

9
00:00:56.818 --> 00:01:00.279
<i>I'm merely one of 50 million citizens.</i>

10
00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:05.123
<i>I'm one of 8 million workers.</i>

11
00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.430
<i>I'm one of 700 employees.</i>

12
00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:20.736
<i>I'm one of 1.6 million
constipation sufferers.</i>

13
00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:26.112
<i>I went to a so-so college,
and gained so-so experience.</i>

14
00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:30.016
<i>I'm an average woman
who lives off a so-so wage.</i>

15
00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:36.440
<i>I'm a typical extra
of the Republic of Korea.</i>

16
00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:44.490
It's so hot. I'm so hot. It's so hot.

17
00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:47.942
Goodness.

18
00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:52.272
- Mom.
- What?

19
00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:55.457
- Am I your biological daughter?
- I know, right?

20
00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:57.216
Is Dad really my biological dad?

21
00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.847
I'm sad about that too.

22
00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:04.894
Is there any possibility that I'm
a hidden daughter of a rich family?

23
00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.706
How nice would that be?

24
00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:11.421
<i>I don't have any secrets
behind my birth either.</i>

25
00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:16.627
<i>How can my one
and only life be so ordinary?</i>

26
00:02:18.314 --> 00:02:20.416
- Good morning.
- You're here?

27
00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.566
Have some eggs.

28
00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:28.312
<i>Look at this bastard.</i>

29
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.267
<i>How can my relationship
be so average too?</i>

30
00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.042
<i>100 days since we met.</i>

31
00:02:54.024 --> 00:02:55.782
<i>200 days since we met.</i>

32
00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:03.984
<i>- 300 days.</i>
- I said I'll type the documents.

33
00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.768
Hey, I'll call you back.

34
00:03:07.477 --> 00:03:10.123
Yeah, I'll call you later. Yeah.

35
00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:14.623
<i>Three years since we met.</i>

36
00:03:29.672 --> 00:03:31.667
I'm here. I'm here, okay?

37
00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.132
Let's go eat some
Korean sausage rice soup.

38
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.988
<i>Look at this bastard.</i>

39
00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:45.561
Don't you know I don't eat the sausages?

40
00:03:46.203 --> 00:03:48.320
But I like the sausages.

41
00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:55.704
<i>An ordinary love for an ordinary woman.</i>

42
00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.750
What is it this time?
Where are you going?

43
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.595
Do you have to poop?

44
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:09.234
Don't make a deal out of it. You'll end
up getting married, having children

45
00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:11.947
arguing with your husband

46
00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:15.303
and living according to
what you can afford.

47
00:04:15.303 --> 00:04:19.375
An average life will bring us
the most happiness.

48
00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.589
Do you think it's anything special?

49
00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:26.990
<i>Is that... the answer?</i>

50
00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:30.173
<i>[Reject the Ordinary!]
[Accept the Ordinary!]</i>

51
00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:33.430
<i>Is there an answer at all?</i>

52
00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:39.291
<i>I entered a small company,
got married, and had children.</i>

53
00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:44.986
<i>I lied to my dad about
coming here, so here I am.</i>

54
00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:48.368
<i>- Did you lie to your father?
- Yes.</i>

55
00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:50.370
<i>I can't find an answer.</i>

56
00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:53.075
<i>I'm sick of this.</i>

57
00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:56.890
<i>There's no longer
anything special in my life.</i>

58
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.880
<i>There's nothing
that makes my heart pound.</i>

59
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.714
<i>It's so boring.</i>

60
00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:05.945
<i>It... was boring...</i>

61
00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:12.127
I'm going to propose to you
when you get back from your vacation.

62
00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:15.699
I'm going to ask you out.

63
00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:22.301
<i>I wish it would rain.</i>

64
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.974
<i>How... should I say it?</i>

65
00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:39.551
<i>[Just like a French film.]</i>

66
00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:44.231
Go back home.

67
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:46.079
Let's go home, Big Sis.

68
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.866
You don't deserve to cry. Let's go home.

69
00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:56.408
I'll go home. I will.

70
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:01.762
- Let's go to the airport.
- I'm working right now.

71
00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.572
I abandoned my work to come here.

72
00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:06.173
- I'll go when the time is right.
- Yeah right.

73
00:06:06.173 --> 00:06:08.368
- I'll scold you.
- Do it.

74
00:06:09.057 --> 00:06:11.517
Soo Soo, I'm working right now!

75
00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:14.104
- Let's go the airport!
- Listen to me!

76
00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:16.188
Let's talk here.

77
00:06:16.188 --> 00:06:17.829
Wait!

78
00:06:18.637 --> 00:06:20.745
Don't do this. Let go, okay?

79
00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:24.305
- Let's go to the airport.
- Soo Soo! Soo Soo!

80
00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:27.868
- Soo Soo!
- Don't let him boss you around.

81
00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:29.096
You're acting like a fool.

82
00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:31.717
You can't hit people like that!

83
00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:35.616
Soo Soo, look at me. Can you hear me?

84
00:06:35.616 --> 00:06:36.947
Are you okay?

85
00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:42.885
Are you okay? Get a hold of yourself.

86
00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:45.765
Can you get up?

87
00:06:47.702 --> 00:06:49.608
Can you get up?

88
00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:53.296
What the heck? Give it back!

89
00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:55.450
What are you filming?

90
00:06:57.916 --> 00:06:59.962
Hey...

91
00:06:59.962 --> 00:07:01.921
You changed your passcode again.

92
00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:07.060
Why do you keep changing
your passcode? Unlock it.

93
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.202
You must be kidding me.

94
00:07:09.202 --> 00:07:11.962
Hey, you're being suspicious.

95
00:08:03.058 --> 00:08:06.651
- Who's that punk?
- A tourist.

96
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:09.300
He overreacted for a tourist.

97
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.043
Did you sleep with him?

98
00:08:12.988 --> 00:08:15.680
- I'll scold you.
- As long as you didn't.

99
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.351
- Let's go home.
- I'm a guide.

100
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.628
How can I abandon my tourists?

101
00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:25.615
Can't you abandon them
like you abandoned your family?

102
00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:29.274
I'll go back myself. I just need
to finish one more semester.

103
00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:31.173
I'll go back when I'm done.

104
00:08:31.173 --> 00:08:35.368
Why? Is it because you were ditched
by the man you ran away with?

105
00:08:35.368 --> 00:08:38.204
If you get a PhD,
will it be less embarrassing?

106
00:08:38.204 --> 00:08:42.222
That's won't change anything.
You're just protecting your pride.

107
00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:45.406
Am I not allowed to do that?
Can't I protect my pride?

108
00:08:45.406 --> 00:08:50.065
What's the use?
What do you need that pride for?

109
00:08:50.065 --> 00:08:52.282
Will someone praise you for your PhD?

110
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.445
Mom? Dad?

111
00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:56.094
Or that bastard, Bae Hyung Goo?

112
00:08:57.425 --> 00:08:59.960
- Don't mention that bastard.
- That son of a bitch...

113
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.483
I told you not to bring him up!

114
00:09:03.983 --> 00:09:06.799
I mean it. Don't bring him up.

115
00:09:11.262 --> 00:09:12.748
It's hot!

116
00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.868
- Soo Soo.
- What?

117
00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:25.181
- Have you been well?
- Of course not.

118
00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:30.783
How are Mom and Dad?

119
00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:34.903
It's hot.

120
00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:44.848
You know Mom and Dad's tempers.

121
00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:49.551
They did just fine after you left.

122
00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:54.653
You should have sent her off
with more money!

123
00:09:54.653 --> 00:09:58.094
Why did you leave the gold ring?
That girl has no money.

124
00:09:58.094 --> 00:10:00.267
Geez, seriously...

125
00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:04.065
She stole your card,
so she can withdraw cash from it.

126
00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:05.805
Don't worry too much.

127
00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:09.765
Hey, that's a Korean card,
so it can't be used abroad.

128
00:10:09.765 --> 00:10:12.733
- Geez, seriously.
- You shouldn't be crying!

129
00:10:12.733 --> 00:10:16.563
Take her off the family registry,
and burn all her belongings in her room!

130
00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:19.002
- Doo Ri, report her to the police.
- Pardon?

131
00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:21.397
Forget it. I'll do it.

132
00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:24.174
Geez, stop it.

133
00:10:24.174 --> 00:10:26.247
Hello? Is this the police?

134
00:10:26.247 --> 00:10:27.988
- Mom!
- Her name is Yoon So So!

135
00:10:27.988 --> 00:10:31.397
- Mom, stop!
- Hey, let go of me!

136
00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:34.147
- Don't do this!
- Let go of me!

137
00:10:35.113 --> 00:10:37.502
Hey, be careful! Hey, stop it!

138
00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:40.665
- Your back! Hey, stop it!
- Gosh, what do I do?

139
00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:41.905
- Get up!
- Give it to me!

140
00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:45.454
- Hey, stop it!
- You woman!

141
00:10:45.454 --> 00:10:48.849
- You can't report your daughter!
- Get out of my way!

142
00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:50.929
Your room still looks the same.

143
00:10:51.482 --> 00:10:53.748
Mom cleans it every day, too.

144
00:10:53.748 --> 00:10:57.044
- Let go!
- Hey, stop it!

145
00:10:57.044 --> 00:11:00.320
- Let go of it!
- Wow, seriously!

146
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.090
I raised you all your life!

147
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.603
How could you abandon us for a man?

148
00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:09.373
I'm going to burn
everything down! I will...

149
00:11:09.373 --> 00:11:12.887
Mom, you can't do that! This isn't right!

150
00:11:12.887 --> 00:11:14.196
Stop it!

151
00:11:14.987 --> 00:11:18.627
I'll shoot you!
I'll shoot you with a gun!

152
00:11:18.627 --> 00:11:20.686
I'll shoot you!

153
00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:24.271
- Who are you going to shoot?
- Bang! Bang!

154
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:26.992
Bang!

155
00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:28.584
Wow, this woman.

156
00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:30.689
I'll shoot you!

157
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:33.028
You can't shoot anyone!

158
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.166
Mom and Dad believe you're
going to come back any time now.

159
00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:42.079
They said the same thing
ever since you left.

160
00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:44.352
They said you'll "be back tomorrow."

161
00:11:46.632 --> 00:11:49.027
So you can go back now.

162
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.800
It's hot.

163
00:11:58.936 --> 00:12:00.589
Let's go home, Big Sis.

164
00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:05.879
<i>I became pathetic.</i>

165
00:12:07.123 --> 00:12:09.770
<i>The time I gave him.</i>

166
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.604
<i>The time he gave me.</i>

167
00:12:12.604 --> 00:12:15.367
<i>The time we spent
holding on to each other.</i>

168
00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:16.792
Han So Ran!

169
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.667
<i>Will a new path open when this one ends?</i>

170
00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:24.421
Hey, when will you stop this?

171
00:12:25.738 --> 00:12:28.559
<i>If this path ends, that is.</i>

172
00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:29.730
Hey!

173
00:12:32.287 --> 00:12:34.214
<i>It's another dead end.</i>

174
00:12:35.217 --> 00:12:37.147
<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

175
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.820
Everything will turn out for the best.

176
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.665
I'll get my investments,
and the business will succeed.

177
00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:46.897
I walked all the way here,
but it's another dead end.

178
00:12:46.897 --> 00:12:50.107
I know. I get it, so let's talk.

179
00:12:51.297 --> 00:12:54.868
- Why are things so hard?
- Yeah, I know things are hard.

180
00:12:54.868 --> 00:12:56.539
It's because you can't poop properly.

181
00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.964
<i>I can't poop properly because of you.</i>

182
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.097
The thing is... I resigned from my job.

183
00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:09.565
You did the right thing.
A lot of people want to hire you.

184
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.065
I'm... going to quit my job.

185
00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:17.560
I didn't like that company.
The pay was low.

186
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.845
You have somewhere to go, right?

187
00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:23.080
I do... but I should search
for more options.

188
00:13:25.954 --> 00:13:29.387
- I quit my job.
- What?

189
00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:33.039
I don't think I'm cut out
to work in a company.

190
00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:36.557
I have a good idea,
so I'm going to start a business.

191
00:13:36.557 --> 00:13:38.704
A senior of mine
will connect me to investors.

192
00:13:53.143 --> 00:13:55.739
<i>That's when I started being constipated.</i>

193
00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:59.280
He'll give me good news in three days.

194
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.555
I'll really succeed. I'm confident.

195
00:14:01.555 --> 00:14:05.032
Yeah, I wish you the best.

196
00:14:06.734 --> 00:14:08.512
Stop acting like this!

197
00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:12.584
Let's stop getting angry
and hurting each other.

198
00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:15.369
Why are you acting this way?
You need to tell me!

199
00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:16.853
I told you.

200
00:14:16.853 --> 00:14:20.597
We're holding on to each other
because we're afraid of breaking up!

201
00:14:24.657 --> 00:14:29.334
You've... been acting weird
ever since we got to France.

202
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:33.762
I didn't ask you this question
for seven years.

203
00:14:33.762 --> 00:14:36.829
- I didn't have to, either.
- Then, don't ask.

204
00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.833
Is there another man?

205
00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:45.844
I'm going to propose to you
when you get back from vacation.

206
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.075
I'm going to ask you out.

207
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.199
You already knew
I was going to ask you out.

208
00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:01.281
Can you answer me?

209
00:15:02.677 --> 00:15:04.695
Do you like someone else?

210
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.305
Is that... the only thought
that comes to your mind?

211
00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:14.454
It might not be important to you,
but it is for me.

212
00:15:15.943 --> 00:15:19.656
I felt sorry after I told you
we should break up.

213
00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:22.297
I tried not to feel sorry,
but I couldn't help it.

214
00:15:22.844 --> 00:15:27.507
But... I don't feel the need
to be sorry anymore.

215
00:15:29.126 --> 00:15:31.179
Thanks for lifting
the weight off my shoulders.

216
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:59.253
<i>We might have held on to each other all
this time to find a reason to break up.</i>

217
00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:02.603
<i>It's like that between couples.</i>

218
00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:06.523
<i>As soon as we want to break up</i>

219
00:16:06.523 --> 00:16:10.167
<i>we start looking for a reason to end it.</i>

220
00:16:28.867 --> 00:16:30.468
Hey, it's me.

221
00:16:30.468 --> 00:16:32.826
<i>Where are you? Are you on the plane?</i>

222
00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:36.012
- No.
<i>- Why not?</i>

223
00:16:36.012 --> 00:16:38.438
Because I'm on vacation.

224
00:16:38.438 --> 00:16:39.936
I see.

225
00:16:41.097 --> 00:16:44.997
I'm on vacation too. I'm at Montmartre.

226
00:16:51.698 --> 00:16:56.103
I'm sad. I thought you'd be
surprised when I said that.

227
00:16:58.325 --> 00:17:02.017
I'm not in France, but at
Naksan Park behind Daehangno.

228
00:17:02.017 --> 00:17:03.634
Do you remember?

229
00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:10.472
They say this is the Montmartre of Seoul.

230
00:17:10.472 --> 00:17:12.947
You've never been to Montmartre.

231
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.505
Do you remember?

232
00:17:15.505 --> 00:17:17.871
You liked places like this.

233
00:17:21.786 --> 00:17:23.805
They say this is the Naples of Asia.

234
00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:27.331
You've never been to Naples.

235
00:17:29.134 --> 00:17:31.761
They say this is the Alps of Korea.

236
00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.907
You haven't been to the Alps either.

237
00:17:37.651 --> 00:17:39.727
Where is this place?

238
00:17:39.727 --> 00:17:42.951
They say this is the Santorini of Busan.

239
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:46.862
But I'm not too sure
because I've never been there.

240
00:17:46.862 --> 00:17:50.357
We've been to the Machu Picchu
of Korea, and the German Town too.

241
00:17:50.357 --> 00:17:51.870
<i>Hey.</i>

242
00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:56.376
Do you remember what I said earlier?

243
00:18:01.266 --> 00:18:04.548
Erase it if you want, but...

244
00:18:04.548 --> 00:18:09.719
you're going to have to
remember what you erased.

245
00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:13.131
<i>Do you remember what you erased?</i>

246
00:18:13.131 --> 00:18:15.696
<i>[Would you like to delete this folder?]</i>

247
00:18:15.696 --> 00:18:17.173
<i>[Deleting...]</i>

248
00:18:17.173 --> 00:18:19.490
<i>[The file has been deleted.]</i>

249
00:18:23.465 --> 00:18:27.672
I knew it was over if you erased
that picture. But I think...

250
00:18:27.672 --> 00:18:30.419
I wanted you to erase that picture.

251
00:18:31.014 --> 00:18:33.555
Because then we could break up.

252
00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:35.466
Without any lingering feelings.

253
00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:37.423
That's cowardly.

254
00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:41.907
If I asked you not to erase it,
would you have listened?

255
00:18:42.594 --> 00:18:44.479
Don't get ahead of yourself.

256
00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:47.833
I didn't delete the picture,
but the file inside.

257
00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:50.834
That was our picture,
no matter what was inside.

258
00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:54.680
What did you want so badly
that you erased our picture?

259
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.323
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't be
the person you wanted me to be.</i>

260
00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:09.677
I cleaned your room.
I'll cook for you when you get back.

261
00:19:09.677 --> 00:19:13.032
No, I'm not going back.

262
00:19:13.032 --> 00:19:14.606
I'm hanging up.

263
00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:21.426
<i>Congratulations. You did a good job.</i>

264
00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:24.063
<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

265
00:20:31.475 --> 00:20:33.835
<i>I didn't know this would happen.</i>

266
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.331
Han So Ran!

267
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:38.132
Yes, Team Leader.

268
00:20:38.734 --> 00:20:42.700
We did it.
These all passed the first round.

269
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.460
- Really?
- How did you come up with this theme?

270
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.978
<i>I simply expressed the desire
for bowel movements in design form.</i>

271
00:20:49.978 --> 00:20:54.658
"Restoration" is the keyword these days,
so I used some designs from the past.

272
00:20:54.658 --> 00:20:59.600
You did a really good job.
Design the other water bottles this way.

273
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.728
- The extended designs too?
- Of course.

274
00:21:03.572 --> 00:21:06.654
Let's try to pass
the final round too, okay?

275
00:21:06.654 --> 00:21:08.336
Yes, I'll do my best.

276
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.566
Thank you for doing a good job.

277
00:21:11.566 --> 00:21:13.092
Let's have dinner together.

278
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:24.680
- Are you eating dinner with him?
- I'm not sure.

279
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.095
- Did he mean a team dinner?
- I don't know.

280
00:21:28.095 --> 00:21:33.423
But passing the theme stage isn't
something to be that happy over.

281
00:21:33.423 --> 00:21:37.014
- It's only because you did it.
- Hey, no way.

282
00:21:37.014 --> 00:21:40.894
If you don't want to eat just the two
of you, should I join you too?

283
00:21:40.894 --> 00:21:43.382
Gosh, my stomach hurts. I need to poop.

284
00:21:43.382 --> 00:21:46.362
You always talk about poop...

285
00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:56.014
<i>We passed the final round. Hurry back.</i>

286
00:21:56.014 --> 00:21:57.380
<i>Let's eat dinner together.</i>

287
00:21:59.064 --> 00:22:03.362
<i>[Thank you...]</i>

288
00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:14.950
<i>It's hard to respond to this man.</i>

289
00:22:16.094 --> 00:22:17.692
You're going on a vacation?

290
00:22:19.485 --> 00:22:20.987
Who are you going with?

291
00:22:28.402 --> 00:22:31.567
<i>Thank you, Team Leader. Work hard.</i>

292
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:08.312
<i>I feel suffocated.</i>

293
00:23:10.864 --> 00:23:12.805
<i>I want to go somewhere far away.</i>

294
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.822
<i>I want to go so badly.</i>

295
00:24:17.782 --> 00:24:21.065
- Let's go.
- I'm not ready yet.

296
00:24:21.065 --> 00:24:25.253
If I go, it's similar to if you abandoned
your students in the middle of class.

297
00:24:25.253 --> 00:24:29.494
I can abandon them. Although,
I'm not even a teacher anymore.

298
00:24:29.494 --> 00:24:34.840
There are no flights today, so let's
stay for the night and talk it out.

299
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.466
We can eat together,
and you need to apologize to him.

300
00:24:38.466 --> 00:24:40.681
To whom? Sumimasen?

301
00:24:40.681 --> 00:24:44.305
Who's Sumimasen? You need
to sincerely apologize to him.

302
00:24:44.305 --> 00:24:47.370
You're talking about
the tourist who hit me.

303
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.807
I can't apologize.
Why do I have to apologize?

304
00:24:54.628 --> 00:24:56.507
If I apologize,
will you go back to Korea?

305
00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.065
Fine, I'll apologize.
But I can't compensate him.

306
00:25:04.065 --> 00:25:07.390
- I was hurt too.
- You'd better be polite.

307
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.630
He's our customer.

308
00:25:12.439 --> 00:25:16.153
- Where are you going?
- We should find him to apologize.

309
00:25:17.408 --> 00:25:19.036
You'd better not run away!

310
00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:28.226
Yes, Ma Ru. Where are you?

311
00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:31.353
Me? I'm near the mountain.

312
00:25:31.353 --> 00:25:35.382
<i>- The castle?</i>
- No, not the castle. The mountain.

313
00:25:35.382 --> 00:25:37.884
<i>There's no mountain here.</i>

314
00:25:37.884 --> 00:25:40.518
I see a mountain right here.

315
00:25:41.067 --> 00:25:43.981
Are you on the island, by any chance?

316
00:25:44.605 --> 00:25:46.388
I said it's a mountain.

317
00:25:46.388 --> 00:25:49.603
Are you on the island
that looks like a mountain?

318
00:25:49.603 --> 00:25:53.467
- Pardon?
- Are you there? I mean, the mountain?

319
00:25:54.055 --> 00:25:56.096
I think that's the place.

320
00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:59.630
You're driving me crazy.
Are you there right now?

321
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.952
Yes, can you see me?

322
00:26:02.952 --> 00:26:04.327
Why did you go there?

323
00:26:06.846 --> 00:26:09.164
Because the mountain is here.

324
00:26:09.164 --> 00:26:11.709
I told you not to go there!

325
00:26:11.709 --> 00:26:15.188
- When?
- Why didn't you listen to me?

326
00:26:15.188 --> 00:26:19.604
Do you see the island? It's not
a mountain. It's an island.

327
00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:24.311
You can walk there when the tide is low,
but there are sand pits everywhere.

328
00:26:24.311 --> 00:26:29.370
If you go there without a guide,
you could die after falling into a pit.

329
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:34.620
There were people who died there,
so you mustn't go there by yourself.

330
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.860
Do you understand?

331
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.623
Yeah, I'm flying back tonight.

332
00:26:38.623 --> 00:26:43.296
<i>I told you not to go there!
You could die in the pits!</i>

333
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:47.950
I didn't die, though.

334
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.484
You're driving me crazy!

335
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:52.959
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry back.

336
00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:55.844
Never mind, I'll go there.
Don't go anywhere.

337
00:26:55.844 --> 00:26:58.469
<i>I'll go there,
so don't go anywhere, okay?</i>

338
00:26:58.469 --> 00:27:00.170
You can't go anywhere!

339
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.073
One coffee, please.

340
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.128
Yes, yes.

341
00:27:10.902 --> 00:27:12.221
Damn it!

342
00:27:17.023 --> 00:27:19.083
I'll go there. Don't go anywhere.

343
00:27:19.083 --> 00:27:23.506
I'll go there, so don't go anywhere,
okay? You can't go anywhere!

344
00:27:23.506 --> 00:27:25.490
One coffee, please.

345
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:27.486
Yes, yes.

346
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:35.882
Damn it!

347
00:28:01.601 --> 00:28:03.413
He's driving me crazy.

348
00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:05.904
You're dead.

349

350
00:28:32.218 --> 00:28:34.459
Boss, it's me, Soo Soo.

351
00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:36.950
Hey, didn't you leave for Korea yet?

352
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.984
<i>Forget that, and give me
my sister's number.</i>

353
00:28:43.565 --> 00:28:49.885
Hey, in France, there is a strict law
against releasing personal information.

354
00:28:49.885 --> 00:28:53.017
I just met her,
but I didn't get her number.

355
00:28:53.017 --> 00:28:56.103
You met her? When? Where?

356
00:28:56.103 --> 00:28:57.994
I met her here earlier!

357
00:28:59.459 --> 00:29:02.459
You're lying to me, huh?

358
00:29:02.459 --> 00:29:04.382
I know you didn't meet her.

359
00:29:04.382 --> 00:29:06.615
It's true! You can check!

360
00:29:06.615 --> 00:29:11.061
After you check, tell her to call me,
or give me her number, okay?

361
00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:14.024
Hurry! Damn it!

362
00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:20.327
<i>[Guide So So]</i>

363
00:29:24.556 --> 00:29:25.892
Yes, So So.

364
00:29:26.709 --> 00:29:29.153
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm on the island.</i>

365
00:29:29.153 --> 00:29:30.803
Where on the island?

366
00:29:32.084 --> 00:29:34.514
If you go straight
and turn right, I'm here.

367
00:29:35.557 --> 00:29:37.481
You'd better not move.

368
00:29:54.844 --> 00:30:00.628
San Ma Ru, I clearly told
everyone not to come here.

369
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:05.613
One moment.

370
00:30:05.613 --> 00:30:08.346
- Yes, it's me.
- So So.

371
00:30:08.346 --> 00:30:09.995
Is everything all right?

372
00:30:09.995 --> 00:30:12.097
How could everything be all right?

373
00:30:12.097 --> 00:30:14.981
I told you I didn't want this group!

374
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:20.046
There are countless problems, and I
have to resolve them! I didn't want this!

375
00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:22.246
Don't call me! I'm hanging up!

376
00:30:25.581 --> 00:30:28.447
I guess she's doing fine.
Geez, that girl.

377
00:30:29.469 --> 00:30:33.700
- So So, calm down.
- How can I calm down?

378
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.603
Do you know how dangerous this place is?

379
00:30:35.603 --> 00:30:37.998
I said you can't come here
without a professional guide!

380
00:30:37.998 --> 00:30:40.613
If you get into an accident,
who should take the responsibility?

381
00:30:40.613 --> 00:30:43.144
Do you want our business to be suspended?

382
00:30:43.144 --> 00:30:47.316
- Will your business be suspended?
- Is that the problem here?

383
00:30:47.316 --> 00:30:50.081
If you fall into a sand pit,
we won't be able find your body.

384
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:52.514
Why do you keep getting into trouble?

385
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.609
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry, we don't have time.

386
00:30:57.609 --> 00:30:59.825
- Where are we going?
- Do you want to be trapped here?

387
00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:01.226
Follow me!

388
00:31:02.998 --> 00:31:05.852
Gosh, seriously! Hurry up!

389
00:31:25.469 --> 00:31:26.942
The tide is coming in.

390
00:31:26.942 --> 00:31:29.668
Wow, it's coming in so quickly.

391
00:31:29.668 --> 00:31:31.276
Look over there.

392
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.100
Wow...

393
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.360
- What do you do when the tide comes in?
- Paddle.

394
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.863
That's right.

395
00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:44.831
Hey, get out of the way.
This way! This is the place.

396
00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:48.507
Hey, get out of way.
Come up here for a better view.

397
00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:52.105
Wow, it looks just like
the beach on Jindo.

398
00:31:52.105 --> 00:31:53.658
Mister.

399
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.122
You can't just push her out of the way.

400
00:31:57.122 --> 00:31:59.968
- I did?
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

401
00:31:59.968 --> 00:32:02.854
You can't just push
someone out of the way.

402
00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:05.911
Can't you have some manners
within the group?

403
00:32:05.911 --> 00:32:08.337
I didn't hit anyone!

404
00:32:08.337 --> 00:32:13.884
You were like this last time too. Is it
mannerly to speak to an elder that way?

405
00:32:16.228 --> 00:32:19.016
You made a mistake first!

406
00:32:19.016 --> 00:32:21.827
I'm sorry. I'll apologize. I'm sorry.

407
00:32:22.414 --> 00:32:26.350
Regardless of what I did,
you shouldn't look at an elder that way.

408
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.187
Stop it. We were the ones
who made a mistake.

409
00:32:29.187 --> 00:32:31.507
You don't own any of this land!

410
00:32:33.113 --> 00:32:36.350
You shouldn't treat another group
member like this in a foreign country!

411
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.363
You just need to apologize.
Why are you yelling?

412
00:32:38.363 --> 00:32:41.594
Fine, if I really hit her,
I'll apologize!

413
00:32:41.594 --> 00:32:44.581
- What?
- Big Sis, come here!

414
00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:45.941
Did I hit you?

415
00:32:47.014 --> 00:32:49.812
- Big Sis!
- Don't yell!

416
00:32:49.812 --> 00:32:52.337
And don't call her Big Sis!

417
00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:53.901
What are you dissatisfied about?

418
00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:57.305
<i>I really hate this package vacation.</i>

419
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.961
I'm going crazy here.

420
00:33:15.318 --> 00:33:16.815
It's okay.

421
00:33:18.366 --> 00:33:21.770
Cheer up. The tide will go down soon.

422
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.691
This is my fault.

423
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.907
They said this is Heaven.

424
00:33:47.535 --> 00:33:48.889
It really is.

425
00:34:20.531 --> 00:34:22.674
<i>You must be happy.</i>

426
00:34:22.674 --> 00:34:26.009
<i>You're an island and land
at the same time.</i>

427
00:34:26.009 --> 00:34:29.180
<i>It must be nice to be
the only one of its kind in this world.</i>

428
00:34:32.009 --> 00:34:34.254
<i>You're lucky to be ordinary.</i>

429
00:34:34.254 --> 00:34:36.772
Stop the nonsense and get married.

430
00:34:36.772 --> 00:34:39.964
Do you really want to send
your only daughter off to get married?

431
00:34:39.964 --> 00:34:42.607
Then live a cool life instead.

432
00:34:42.607 --> 00:34:45.102
How can I live a cool life?

433
00:34:45.102 --> 00:34:48.323
If I knew that,
would I be living like this?

434
00:34:50.381 --> 00:34:57.064
Mom, have you ever thought
of yourself as a cool woman before?

435
00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.169
I did, twice.

436
00:35:05.368 --> 00:35:07.301
- The first time...
- When you gave birth to me?

437
00:35:07.301 --> 00:35:09.270
No, when I gave birth
to your older brother.

438
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:12.154
- Then was it the second time?
- No.

439
00:35:12.154 --> 00:35:16.056
It was when I lost weight
and wore beautiful clothes.

440
00:35:16.056 --> 00:35:20.134
- Try losing one inch in waist size.
- What about when you had me?

441
00:35:20.614 --> 00:35:25.018
I was happy. I met
a life-long comrade that day.

442
00:35:25.018 --> 00:35:30.064
If you're happy, it doesn't matter if you
look cool. If you like it, you're good.

443
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.953
But I don't know how this is
different from a manicure.

444
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:42.359
<i>I don't know... the version
of myself that I'd like.</i>

445
00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:46.178
<i>How can I... become happy and cool?</i>

446
00:36:10.524 --> 00:36:12.107
It looks really cool.

447
00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:16.335
I had no idea scenery like this existed.

448
00:36:26.368 --> 00:36:29.140
We have to stay here
until the tide goes down.

449
00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:32.663
Yes, I know.

450
00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:35.100
The tide will go down tomorrow morning.

451
00:36:38.957 --> 00:36:42.506
- Pardon?
- We can leave tomorrow morning.

452
00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:46.384
Then, do we have to
stay here all night...

453
00:36:51.087 --> 00:36:54.665
Then they should have put up
signs telling us to stay out

454
00:36:54.665 --> 00:36:55.843
or employed police officers.

455
00:36:55.843 --> 00:36:58.966
This isn't how you
run a tourist attraction.

456
00:37:01.649 --> 00:37:04.761
Don't you agree?
They weren't being very considerate.

457
00:37:04.761 --> 00:37:07.268
Stop it. You're making me even angrier.

458
00:37:10.096 --> 00:37:11.462
Okay.

459
00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.486
Are there any accommodations here?

460
00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:20.254
Does that make sense?

461
00:37:20.254 --> 00:37:21.868
It doesn't.

462
00:37:27.962 --> 00:37:29.609
Can you give me some space?

463
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.102
Yes.

464
00:37:41.189 --> 00:37:43.236
Are there any bathrooms here?

465
00:38:15.531 --> 00:38:17.495
Okay, let's eat.

466
00:38:18.495 --> 00:38:20.960
- I need to take a picture.
- Yes, you should.

467
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.232
Here.

468
00:38:29.317 --> 00:38:31.951
This is good. This is real food.

469
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:33.460
Yeah, it's good.

470
00:38:35.718 --> 00:38:37.872
- Eat.
- Yes.

471
00:38:37.872 --> 00:38:39.866
Hey, eat lots.

472
00:38:52.703 --> 00:38:55.375
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat?

473
00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:19.960
<i>[World Pharmaceuticals]</i>

474
00:39:34.328 --> 00:39:36.350
Did you erase the file?

475
00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.607
- Yes.
- Good job.

476
00:39:39.607 --> 00:39:41.973
We'll begin the dismissal procedure now.

477
00:39:43.745 --> 00:39:49.035
Pardon? You said if we found the file
you wouldn't take disciplinary action.

478
00:39:49.817 --> 00:39:53.888
What's wrong with you?
How can we work with that punk?

479
00:39:53.888 --> 00:39:56.160
- But still...
- But what?

480
00:39:57.078 --> 00:39:58.381
What?

481
00:40:00.453 --> 00:40:03.524
Is Ma Ru the God of Justice,
and are we Satan?

482
00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:16.781
Deputy Oh.

483
00:40:18.518 --> 00:40:23.683
Back in the day, English guys loaded
their boat with green tea from China.

484
00:40:24.328 --> 00:40:26.408
It wasn't a trip that
lasted a day or two.

485
00:40:26.408 --> 00:40:28.529
It all rotted on their way back home.

486
00:40:29.672 --> 00:40:32.692
They had to throw them away,
but it was such a waste.

487
00:40:34.189 --> 00:40:37.736
They opened it just to check,
but what do you know?

488
00:40:38.252 --> 00:40:40.268
They were fine.

489
00:40:40.268 --> 00:40:42.651
The rotten version was actually better.

490
00:40:45.466 --> 00:40:47.223
It's known as black tea now.

491
00:40:51.613 --> 00:40:55.143
Is green tea right, and black tea wrong?

492
00:40:55.143 --> 00:40:57.381
That's not true.

493
00:41:00.006 --> 00:41:02.777
This entire place is black tea.

494
00:41:02.777 --> 00:41:06.352
You're black tea, and I'm black tea too.

495
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.589
There's no room for green tea here.

496
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:14.169
If Ma Ru gets fired,
he'll be on the black list

497
00:41:14.169 --> 00:41:15.709
and won't be able to get a job.

498
00:41:16.955 --> 00:41:18.473
Isn't that obvious?

499
00:41:20.056 --> 00:41:23.256
That's the only way to keep
punks like Ma Ru out of this world.

500
00:41:38.053 --> 00:41:40.674
It's cold, isn't it? Wait a minute.

501
00:41:40.674 --> 00:41:44.968
I'll make a fire soon.
I did this a lot in the military.

502
00:41:44.968 --> 00:41:47.799
I was in the special forces.

503
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.509
Don't worry. It's been a long time.
But I'll make a fire soon.

504
00:42:08.509 --> 00:42:11.926
That's okay.
Don't cut up both your hands.

505
00:42:14.942 --> 00:42:18.960
People who were in the special forces
can't even do anything right.

506
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.410
- I used to be good at it.
- That's okay.

507
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:25.118
I was in the Girl Scouts as a child.

508
00:42:25.118 --> 00:42:27.477
Making a fire is a piece of cake.

509
00:42:43.169 --> 00:42:46.056
Girl... Girl Scouts?

510
00:42:48.241 --> 00:42:49.674
I'm sorry.

511
00:42:51.765 --> 00:42:53.350
Girls.

512
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:21.935
That's okay. You must be cold too.

513
00:43:21.935 --> 00:43:25.174
- I'm fine.
- Don't pretend. You'll get sick.

514
00:43:25.174 --> 00:43:27.355
I said I was in the special forces.

515
00:43:40.082 --> 00:43:44.832
I'm sorry for this.
Your husband must be waiting.

516
00:43:44.832 --> 00:43:47.455
My husband? Who are you talking about?

517
00:43:47.455 --> 00:43:49.681
The man who dragged you away earlier.

518
00:43:50.841 --> 00:43:52.390
He's my little brother.

519
00:43:53.642 --> 00:43:55.962
I guess your husband is younger than you.

520
00:43:55.962 --> 00:44:00.239
No, he's my biological brother.
My one and only brother.

521
00:44:01.091 --> 00:44:03.198
He's your brother?

522
00:44:05.419 --> 00:44:06.910
That's a relief.

523
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:10.913
Why? Why are you relieved?

524
00:44:10.913 --> 00:44:14.312
A violent husband, and an abused wife.

525
00:44:14.312 --> 00:44:18.169
A strange, subordinate
relationship you can't escape.

526
00:44:18.169 --> 00:44:20.035
That's what it seemed like.

527
00:44:21.524 --> 00:44:24.049
But why is your brother so stubborn?

528
00:44:24.049 --> 00:44:26.535
- He's so rude to his older sister.
- That's not true.

529
00:44:26.535 --> 00:44:29.942
He's a gentle and kind kid.

530
00:44:29.942 --> 00:44:32.582
If you speak Japanese, I'll kill you!

531
00:44:32.582 --> 00:44:35.080
I don't know if he's gentle.

532
00:44:35.768 --> 00:44:38.410
And I don't know if he's kind, either.

533
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:42.015
He may seem that way,
but if you look closely, he's different.

534
00:44:54.701 --> 00:44:57.366
What made you want to
come all the way here?

535
00:44:57.366 --> 00:44:59.415
Were you always so curious?

536
00:44:59.415 --> 00:45:01.569
You must get into a lot of trouble.

537
00:45:01.569 --> 00:45:06.265
That's not true.
I got in trouble once as a kid

538
00:45:06.265 --> 00:45:08.198
but everyone does it.

539
00:45:08.198 --> 00:45:09.681
What did you do?

540
00:45:10.622 --> 00:45:13.910
If a dehumidifier and a humidifier
fought, which one would win?

541
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.348
- Things like that.
- Pardon?

542
00:45:16.348 --> 00:45:19.169
What are you talking about?

543
00:45:19.169 --> 00:45:23.082
One makes moisture,
and the other gets rid of it.

544
00:45:23.082 --> 00:45:27.102
- Aren't you curious which would win?
- Not at all.

545
00:45:27.102 --> 00:45:30.955
Why aren't you curious?
I was really curious.

546
00:45:30.955 --> 00:45:33.178
I put it to the test.

547
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:53.299
You must be crazy. So, which one won?

548
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.424
My mom.

549
00:45:56.531 --> 00:45:58.645
I told you to study,
but you only get into trouble.

550
00:45:58.645 --> 00:45:59.995
Are you paying for electricity?

551
00:45:59.995 --> 00:46:01.288
I'm sorry.

552
00:46:01.288 --> 00:46:04.506
What are you sorry about?
You'd better get into college this time!

553
00:46:04.506 --> 00:46:05.580
Do things right!

554
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.671
That hurts!

555
00:46:06.671 --> 00:46:09.522
My mother always wins in our family.

556
00:46:09.522 --> 00:46:11.238
I'm jealous.

557
00:46:12.587 --> 00:46:15.435
I've never been hit by my mom before.

558
00:46:15.435 --> 00:46:17.585
Really? Not even once?

559
00:46:23.067 --> 00:46:24.192
What?

560
00:46:24.966 --> 00:46:27.384
France? Marriage?

561
00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:30.093
You must have lost your mind!

562
00:46:30.093 --> 00:46:34.567
How... How much do you have to
be hit to get your act together?

563
00:46:34.567 --> 00:46:36.857
- You little...
- Hey, stop it.

564
00:46:36.857 --> 00:46:39.455
Hey, you need to be hit...

565
00:46:39.455 --> 00:46:41.402
- Hit me! Hit me if you want!
- You little...

566
00:46:41.402 --> 00:46:44.656
Let go! Let go!

567
00:46:46.817 --> 00:46:50.093
- So So!
- What? Hit me!

568
00:46:50.093 --> 00:46:52.305
I'm going to France!

569
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:57.285
<i>It would have been nice
if she hit me that day.</i>

570
00:46:57.285 --> 00:47:00.145
So So, the biggest happiness

571
00:47:00.145 --> 00:47:04.618
comes from finding a man
who will love you, and you only.

572
00:47:04.618 --> 00:47:06.759
It's like a fantasy, isn't it?

573
00:47:06.759 --> 00:47:10.049
That's why it doesn't exist
in real life. There are no men like that

574
00:47:10.049 --> 00:47:12.346
and there's no love like that.

575
00:47:13.468 --> 00:47:15.254
I'm still going to go.

576
00:47:15.877 --> 00:47:18.502
I'm going to France!

577
00:47:19.317 --> 00:47:21.823
I always won when I fought with my mom.

578
00:47:21.823 --> 00:47:24.058
I've never lost before.

579
00:47:31.953 --> 00:47:33.962
Why do you keep sticking to me?

580
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:45.139
Why do you keep sticking to me?

581
00:47:45.139 --> 00:47:47.479
We'll freeze to death at this rate.

582
00:47:49.378 --> 00:47:52.452
Fine, but don't come any closer.

583
00:47:55.108 --> 00:47:58.057
- What are you doing?
- Put down your spines.

584
00:47:58.057 --> 00:48:00.916
That's how the hedgehogs froze to death.

585
00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:02.653
Hedgehogs?

586
00:48:02.653 --> 00:48:05.146
It was on a very cold day.

587
00:48:05.146 --> 00:48:09.461
There was a group of hedgehogs, but if
they huddled together, they got stabbed

588
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:11.209
and if they dispersed,
they froze to death.

589
00:48:11.209 --> 00:48:14.012
So they kept a reasonable
distance from one another.

590
00:48:14.012 --> 00:48:16.372
A reasonably safe distance.

591
00:48:17.387 --> 00:48:19.041
That's how they froze to death.

592
00:48:30.666 --> 00:48:35.320
<i>How nice would it be
to be able to talk all night long?</i>

593
00:48:37.758 --> 00:48:41.340
<i>How nice would it be
to have something to talk about</i>

594
00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.269
<i>all night long?</i>

595
00:48:44.746 --> 00:48:46.499
Let's talk.

596
00:48:48.584 --> 00:48:51.131
Okay, go ahead.

597
00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:57.235
Hey, I told you I was
on the phone because of work.

598
00:48:59.349 --> 00:49:02.233
I thought you'd understand.

599
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.418
I always understood.

600
00:49:09.106 --> 00:49:11.932
No, you never have.

601
00:49:11.932 --> 00:49:15.695
I don't want to answer
work-related calls in France, either.

602
00:49:15.695 --> 00:49:18.309
But this is all for our future.

603
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:22.066
- This is so we can have a happy future.
- If you succeed

604
00:49:22.066 --> 00:49:23.778
does that mean we'll be happy too?

605
00:49:23.778 --> 00:49:25.447
Hey, Han So Ran.

606
00:49:26.494 --> 00:49:29.121
I'm not doing this just for myself.

607
00:49:29.121 --> 00:49:33.240
If you succeed, do you think
everything else will get better too?

608
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.325
- Is it wrong to succeed?
- That's not what I mean.

609
00:49:36.325 --> 00:49:37.988
Then what do you mean?

610
00:49:40.635 --> 00:49:42.238
Let's talk later.

611
00:49:42.907 --> 00:49:44.807
- When?
- Just later.

612
00:49:44.807 --> 00:49:47.512
Let's talk now. It's not
something we should put off.

613
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.144
<i>I want to talk right now too. Not later.</i>

614
00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:57.811
Later, when I succeed,
let's get married in a beautiful place.

615
00:49:57.811 --> 00:50:01.631
Later, I'll make a lot of money,
so we can live in a country house.

616
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:04.916
Later, when I get investments,
I'll buy you pretty clothes.

617
00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:06.885
Let's go there later.

618
00:50:06.885 --> 00:50:08.724
Later.

619
00:50:08.724 --> 00:50:10.227
Later.

620
00:50:10.227 --> 00:50:11.729
Later.

621
00:50:12.378 --> 00:50:15.006
Later, when things get better... Later.

622
00:50:16.354 --> 00:50:17.695
<i>I'm sick of this.</i>

623
00:50:18.947 --> 00:50:22.711
Why aren't you saying anything?
You need to talk so I understand.

624
00:50:23.405 --> 00:50:28.035
<i>I don't want to talk,
but I want to listen.</i>

625
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.860
The most important thing
is our time together right now.

626
00:50:34.546 --> 00:50:37.628
<i>I wanted to hear something like that</i>

627
00:50:37.628 --> 00:50:41.849
<i>that would make me happy.
Not later, but now.</i>

628
00:50:42.845 --> 00:50:48.117
Fine, when I said you smelled,
and that you should poop, I was wrong.

629
00:50:48.117 --> 00:50:51.639
I'm sorry, but you started it.

630
00:50:51.639 --> 00:50:55.025
You said you smelled something
between that guy and the guide.

631
00:50:55.025 --> 00:50:58.881
To be honest, I really hate it
when you talk about other people.

632
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:00.688
I got really annoyed.

633
00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:03.740
Do you know why I only
talk about other people?

634
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.381
You were always like that.

635
00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:09.514
<i>Because you avoid conversations about us.</i>

636
00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:14.881
<i>Because you always put off
conversations about us until later.</i>

637
00:51:14.881 --> 00:51:19.838
<i>That's why the only thing
I could talk about was other people.</i>

638
00:51:19.838 --> 00:51:25.108
Did you see her makeup?
Her style was ridiculous. How tacky.

639
00:51:25.108 --> 00:51:27.285
And isn't that man weird too?

640
00:51:27.285 --> 00:51:30.497
Why would he come on
a package vacation all by himself?

641
00:51:30.497 --> 00:51:33.584
Is he a pervert?
I'm sure she has depression.

642
00:51:33.584 --> 00:51:37.988
But then again, if my husband
were uneducated, I'd be depressed too.

643
00:51:37.988 --> 00:51:40.802
Hey, why do you only
talk about other people?

644
00:51:40.802 --> 00:51:43.662
Can't we talk about us for once?

645
00:51:44.693 --> 00:51:48.508
<i>I wanted to talk about us too.</i>

646
00:51:50.256 --> 00:51:52.340
Hey, where are you going
in the middle of the night?

647
00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.117
I thought you wanted to talk!

648
00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.151
Later.

649
00:53:04.579 --> 00:53:06.983
<i>We were like that once.</i>

650
00:53:09.755 --> 00:53:12.985
Let's make a couple bank account.

651
00:53:13.651 --> 00:53:16.001
- Who will manage it?
- Me, of course.

652
00:53:16.001 --> 00:53:18.423
Of course.

653
00:53:18.423 --> 00:53:22.376
Let's deposit 100,000 to 150,000 won
a month and go on yearly vacations

654
00:53:22.376 --> 00:53:26.510
and use it for our dates.
"Dutch pay" makes us look distant.

655
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.155
Did you know "Dutch pay"
isn't a correct English expression?

656
00:53:29.155 --> 00:53:32.322
Really? Then, what is it?

657
00:53:32.322 --> 00:53:33.932
Dutch pay?
(In Japanese)

658
00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.438
- It's hot.
- Am I wrong?

659
00:53:48.447 --> 00:53:51.434
I'm sorry for getting mad
at you yesterday.

660
00:53:51.434 --> 00:53:53.505
No, I'm sorry.

661
00:53:53.505 --> 00:53:56.430
But when I act like that, comfort me.

662
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:59.644
Don't just leave like you did yesterday.

663
00:53:59.644 --> 00:54:02.385
Okay, I won't do that again.

664
00:54:02.385 --> 00:54:06.334
Even if I get mad at you,
smile for me, okay?

665
00:54:06.334 --> 00:54:07.713
Okay.

666
00:54:07.713 --> 00:54:11.581
Even if I tell you to get out of
my sight, don't leave me alone.

667
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:13.644
Okay.

668
00:54:14.282 --> 00:54:18.622
No matter what happens, stay by my side.

669
00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:21.753
Don't worry. I'll stay by your side.

670
00:54:29.168 --> 00:54:33.851
<i>Back then, everything
was special between us.</i>

671
00:54:35.023 --> 00:54:39.709
<i>That's really... how we used to be.</i>

672
00:57:23.572 --> 00:57:26.311
<i>I want to become a version
of myself that I like.</i>

673
00:57:28.744 --> 00:57:31.481
<i>There's no longer
anything drastic in my life</i>

674
00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:34.684
<i>and nothing makes my heart pound anymore.</i>

675
00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:38.746
<i>But I won't be swayed
by anything or anyone.</i>

676
00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:44.081
You already knew
I was going to propose to you.

677
00:57:47.918 --> 00:57:49.881
I'll be a good boyfriend to you.

678
00:57:53.914 --> 00:57:56.887
I'll reject your proposal
when I get back.

679
00:57:56.887 --> 00:58:01.077
Then I guess I'll do better
so you can't reject me.

680
00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:04.063
Please don't do that.
I won't change my mind.

681
00:58:04.063 --> 00:58:06.260
Don't be so sure

682
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.356
until your vacation is over.

683
00:58:20.943 --> 00:58:24.322
<i>I must find a version of myself
that I will like.</i>

684
00:58:25.709 --> 00:58:30.251
<i>As if I'm in a French movie,
where they always find an answer.</i>

685

- Did you see that?</i>

00:59:32.689 --> 00:59:36.537
<i>- Yeah, I did.
