00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:03.225
(One Night Two Days)

2
00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:05.225
(The best trip voted by our viewers,)

3
00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:07.195
(Gimje Countryside Diary Special)

4
00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:11.124
(Dragonflies bathe in the sun.)

5
00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:14.034
(Cosmoses say hello.)

6
00:00:14.435 --> 00:00:16.504
(It's fall.)

7
00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:19.105
(We're at Gimje...)

8
00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:22.074
(at a countryside village.)

9
00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:24.605
- What now? - No way.

10
00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.545
Are we here to work on the fields?

11
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.714
We're here in Shindeok Village,

12
00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:31.515
Gimje, North Jeolla Province.

13
00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:34.354
Isn't it close to your hometown?

14
00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:35.825
Yes, mine's only half an hour away.

15
00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:37.424
The rice here is delicious.

16
00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:41.454
It's Korea's largest breadbasket.

17
00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:45.234
It's the only place where you can see the horizon.

18
00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:46.734
- The horizon? - Really?

19
00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:47.734
Isn't that it?

20
00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:49.965
Isn't it that linear line?

21
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.374
The endless horizon.

22
00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:53.634
One can be seen at the sea too.

23
00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:56.244
- Really? - Knowing that...

24
00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:57.575
is nothing to be proud of.

25
00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:01.844
Farmers get busy around this time of year.

26
00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:03.414
- Now that scares me. - So today is...

27
00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:05.714
the Country Side Diary Special.

28
00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:07.384
Really?

29
00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:09.024
(He knows what's going to happen.)

30
00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:11.255
It means we're working today.

31
00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.794
We're probably all going to have chores.

32
00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:17.625
Think of it as an abbreviation.

33
00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:19.494
- We're all working. - Right.

34
00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:23.835
So let me introduce you to the elders of the village.

35
00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:26.904
- They will hand out jobs. - Please come on out!

36
00:01:28.544 --> 00:01:30.604
(Like greeting a son back home)

37
00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:34.145
(There's a skip to their steps.)

38
00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.714
(Helicam recording)

39
00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:41.085
(However,)

40
00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:43.524
(they suddenly stop dead in their tracks.)

41
00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:47.794
(What's going on?)

42
00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:50.664
Come on over!

43
00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.195
- Over here. - They find this awkward.

44
00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:55.304
- Hello. - Hi.

45
00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:57.205
Please have a seat over here.

46
00:01:57.205 --> 00:01:59.005
- All right. - Hello. Have a seat.

47
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:00.434
- Here. - Thanks.

48
00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:02.175
- Hello. - Over here.

49
00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:04.205
(Finally, they're in their seats.)

50
00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.144
(Why are they facing that way though?)

51
00:02:10.644 --> 00:02:13.014
(They couldn't care less about the celebrities.)

52
00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:16.625
The elders of the village are in love...

53
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.354
with our helicam.

54
00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:21.195
They're asking if it's remote controlled.

55
00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:22.195
Remote controlled?

56
00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:24.164
- It's coming closer. - Here it is.

57
00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:25.195
Here it comes.

58
00:02:25.364 --> 00:02:27.695
- Come on. - It's the helicam.

59
00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:28.704
(Did I startle you?)

60
00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.535
(Greetings)

61
00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:32.535
We're over here.

62
00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:33.634
Look over there.

63
00:02:33.634 --> 00:02:34.704
Wave at the camera.

64
00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:36.074
Hello!

65
00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:37.875
(Hi!)

66
00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:40.914
Isn't it cool?

67
00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:44.315
And now it flies away.

68
00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:45.384
(Over and out!)

69
00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:48.984
They are your partners for today.

70
00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:51.954
They got dolled up to meet you today.

71
00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:53.824
- Really? - It's nice to meet you.

72
00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.565
- Hello. - Greetings.

73
00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:57.065
- Hi. - Hello.

74
00:02:57.065 --> 00:02:59.465
Look how pretty they look today.

75
00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:00.535
That's right.

76
00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:02.364
Do you all go to the same salon?

77
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:04.005
- No. - No?

78
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:05.574
- Not at all. - Really?

79
00:03:05.574 --> 00:03:07.204
- They see other stylists. - I see.

80
00:03:07.674 --> 00:03:08.905
Of course.

81
00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.975
Do you normally wear your pearl necklace to work?

82
00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.315
Of course. I see I still have it on.

83
00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:16.514
I guess I forgot to take it off.

84
00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:17.815
- I mean... - Look at her.

85
00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:20.055
Her pants match her shoes and gloves.

86
00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:21.155
(She's the resident fashionista.)

87
00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:22.185
You're very stylish.

88
00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.625
- I'm drawing blood today. - Blood?

89
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:25.695
Yes, over here.

90
00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:27.725
- I see. - That was alarming.

91
00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:28.725
(They thought they had to donate blood.)

92
00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.294
She gave us a hint of what we're doing today.

93
00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.334
You all heard her.

94
00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:35.604
So now we'll go ahead...

95
00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:39.805
and let them decide on who they want as workers.

96
00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:42.875
The six ladies here today will...

97
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.815
tell you about the jobs they have for you.

98
00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:48.514
You should know that some are harder than others.

99
00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:50.044
- Gosh. - I knew it.

100
00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:53.185
What's the toughest job today?

101
00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:55.854
Guys, look at their shoes.

102
00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:59.394
- Look at the shoes. - That's enough of a clue.

103
00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:02.125
- Look at hers. - She has on boots.

104
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.125
- The boots. - My goodness.

105
00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:07.364
The job she has for us must be the hardest.

106
00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:10.305
So let's start with the easiest task.

107
00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:13.505
Jobs will keep getting harder and harder.

108
00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:17.904
So ma'am, could you tell us about the job...

109
00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:19.844
you have for them today?

110
00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:22.245
I'm taking Jong Min to harvest chilies.

111
00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:23.985
- The tops of chilies. - Really?

112
00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:26.255
- Chilies? - Harvesting chilies.

113
00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:27.584
- Right. - The tops of chilies.

114
00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:29.654
- We'll work at home. - At home?

115
00:04:29.654 --> 00:04:30.884
- Really? - What?

116
00:04:30.884 --> 00:04:33.255
- That should be easy. - That's easy.

117
00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:36.195
You can work while facing each other.

118
00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:39.264
What if he ruins the chilies though?

119
00:04:39.264 --> 00:04:40.865
You'll get an earful from me!

120
00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.435
That sounds quite easy though.

121
00:04:42.435 --> 00:04:44.065
Would it be okay...

122
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:47.034
to take someone else instead of Jong Min?

123
00:04:47.034 --> 00:04:48.074
I only need the one.

124
00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:51.815
She must be Jong Min's fan.

125
00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:54.144
Do you even know our names?

126
00:04:54.144 --> 00:04:55.714
- I don't. - She only knows Jong Min.

127
00:04:55.714 --> 00:04:57.844
My name is Cha Tae Hyun.

128
00:04:57.844 --> 00:04:59.315
- Tae Hyun? - Yes, that's me.

129
00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:01.485
I only know Jong Min for sure.

130
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.495
- No way. - That's unbelievable.

131
00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:06.995
How can this be?

132
00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:09.295
His seven years here wasn't all for nothing.

133
00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:11.324
- Right? - It was worth it.

134
00:05:11.324 --> 00:05:12.495
Of course.

135
00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:16.764
So Ms. Oh, who will you choose?

136
00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:18.134
You know who it is.

137
00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:20.435
- The one beside Jong Min. - I only want Jong Min.

138
00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:22.805
(Jong Min will take tops of chilies.)

139
00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:24.074
No way.

140
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:26.974
- He'll be a disaster. - Don't take him.

141
00:05:26.974 --> 00:05:29.284
Whomever I choose is up to me.

142
00:05:30.014 --> 00:05:31.884
- How could you? - Come on.

143
00:05:31.884 --> 00:05:34.014
It's supposed to be a fair process.

144
00:05:34.014 --> 00:05:35.014
(It should be fair!)

145
00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:36.524
But...

146
00:05:36.524 --> 00:05:37.985
- Why are you yelling? - Whatever.

147
00:05:39.224 --> 00:05:41.654
The next task won't be that bad either.

148
00:05:41.654 --> 00:05:45.295
Ma'am, what task do you have in store for them?

149
00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:46.894
I'm going to the market.

150
00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:49.065
- The market? - That'd be great.

151
00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:51.464
- To the market? - So I need someone...

152
00:05:51.464 --> 00:05:54.074
- who can bargain well. - It'll be a day off.

153
00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:55.844
- Ma'am, please. - That's me.

154
00:05:55.844 --> 00:05:57.404
- And good with numbers. - 2, 3 dollars.

155
00:05:57.404 --> 00:05:58.945
I used to be great at that.

156
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:00.074
Ma'am!

157
00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:02.185
You look beautiful today.

158
00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:05.884
You look like the youngest of the bunch.

159
00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:07.884
Can we be friends?

160
00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:12.024
You're barely a few years older than me anyway.

161
00:06:12.024 --> 00:06:14.224
I see he has a good eye.

162
00:06:14.224 --> 00:06:15.865
- She is the youngest. - Really?

163
00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:16.925
See?

164
00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:19.235
I'm this good at driving a bargain.

165
00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:22.834
We're really good at bargaining for things.

166
00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:25.404
- But he's the worst. - I don't like you though.

167
00:06:27.005 --> 00:06:29.375
- Did you hear that? - I've nothing to say.

168
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:32.875
So I'm choosing the one in the red shirt.

169
00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:34.415
- What? - Ma'am.

170
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:35.884
- Me? - No way.

171
00:06:35.884 --> 00:06:37.584
- You can't do this to us. - Ma'am.

172
00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:40.685
Ma'am, I'm wearing a red shirt as well.

173
00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:42.125
The moment I walked in...

174
00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:43.925
and saw you all,

175
00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:45.324
I immediately grew fond of him.

176
00:06:45.324 --> 00:06:47.425
- That's impossible. - Please, ma'am.

177
00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:49.464
They're making decisions based on looks.

178
00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:51.964
This isn't about who they fancy.

179
00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:53.764
I stand no chance then.

180
00:06:53.764 --> 00:06:57.505
(Meanwhile, she takes a good look at them all.)

181
00:06:57.505 --> 00:06:58.935
(Why is she looking at me?)

182
00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:01.574
Did you immediately feel a connection?

183
00:07:01.574 --> 00:07:02.844
He looks like my son.

184
00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:07.144
(Joo Hyuk will go to the market.)

185
00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:10.144
Congratulations on an easy task.

186
00:07:10.144 --> 00:07:11.384
(The two are delighted.)

187
00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:13.954
The other two didn't do so,

188
00:07:13.954 --> 00:07:15.954
but the ladies left are now...

189
00:07:15.954 --> 00:07:17.584
scanning our faces.

190
00:07:17.584 --> 00:07:20.625
(Quietly, they scan the remaining four.)

191
00:07:21.094 --> 00:07:22.594
They're choosing as we speak.

192
00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:27.195
Let me ask you this. Do any of you only care...

193
00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:28.665
about who's the strongest?

194
00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:31.065
- Not me. - Do our looks matter?

195
00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.974
I like someone who takes my direction well.

196
00:07:34.134 --> 00:07:36.745
- Someone obedient. - Yes, that's it.

197
00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:40.445
I need someone who listens to what I say.

198
00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:42.884
It can't be someone stubborn.

199
00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:45.185
- She means you. - You mean me?

200
00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:47.055
She thinks you're stubborn.

201
00:07:47.055 --> 00:07:50.255
Next is a task with a level three difficulty.

202
00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:52.055
This is where the tasks...

203
00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:54.625
get a little trickier.

204
00:07:55.464 --> 00:07:57.925
- Oh gosh... - I don't like this.

205
00:07:57.925 --> 00:07:59.935
I'm working on the chili field,

206
00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:02.964
so I need someone with strong legs.

207
00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:05.105
- Here. - Look at this.

208
00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:08.005
I like the one wearing red pants.

209
00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:09.774
(Do you mean Joon Ho?)

210
00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.445
- I like his legs. - Thank you.

211
00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:14.514
- Ma'am... - They're great.

212
00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:17.485
- Is it me or not? - He needs to be strong.

213
00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:18.884
Is it me or not?

214
00:08:18.884 --> 00:08:20.985
- He needs to be strong. - Ma'am.

215
00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:23.355
Tae Hyun over here has the strongest legs.

216
00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:24.425
- He does. - I do.

217
00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:25.695
He fathered three children.

218
00:08:25.695 --> 00:08:27.925
I need all three of you.

219
00:08:28.764 --> 00:08:30.065
(Pardon?)

220
00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:33.395
It's a job for about 5 to 6 people.

221
00:08:34.195 --> 00:08:37.204
But this is a level three task.

222
00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:38.775
You need to be strong too.

223
00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:40.405
Let me ask you this then.

224
00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:43.974
If you had to choose one, who would it be?

225
00:08:43.974 --> 00:08:46.015
I've liked him from the beginning.

226
00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:49.045
They've already made up their minds.

227
00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:51.614
- This is meaningless. - Unbelievable.

228
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.214
Ma'am, who do you have in mind?

229
00:08:54.885 --> 00:08:55.954
You.

230
00:08:55.954 --> 00:08:57.025
(I want you.)

231
00:08:57.025 --> 00:08:58.025
What?

232
00:08:58.025 --> 00:09:00.224
I'll be doing the level five task!

233
00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:01.925
- Gosh. - Unbelievable.

234
00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:04.525
The lady at the end has been making eye contact.

235
00:09:05.234 --> 00:09:06.834
You seem very strong.

236
00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:09.104
See?

237
00:09:09.104 --> 00:09:11.165
There was no point to this.

238
00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:13.535
Anyway, thank you so much.

239
00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:17.604
(Joon Ho will pull out chili stalks.)

240
00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:20.714
Why are you more tanned than the lady with...

241
00:09:21.374 --> 00:09:23.344
the level five task?

242
00:09:23.344 --> 00:09:25.555
That's because I work a lot.

243
00:09:25.555 --> 00:09:27.885
I work day and night.

244
00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:29.084
- That's why. - Day and night?

245
00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:32.354
You don't seem like the type to take breaks.

246
00:09:32.354 --> 00:09:33.624
- I don't. - You don't take breaks.

247
00:09:33.624 --> 00:09:34.655
I keep on working.

248
00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:37.094
Why won't you take breaks?

249
00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:38.765
That's what I thought.

250
00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:39.935
Okay, next.

251
00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:41.594
- Only three are left. - Gosh.

252
00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:44.834
I need someone who are good with dogs.

253
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.004
- Dogs? - Dogs?

254
00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:47.234
He should be good with dogs.

255
00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:49.645
I'd also like him...

256
00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:52.275
to follow my lead and do as I say.

257
00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:53.344
Are we building a dog house?

258
00:09:53.344 --> 00:09:54.844
- Yes. - Let me do it.

259
00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:57.185
- I'll do it. - What?

260
00:09:57.714 --> 00:09:59.315
My friend!

261
00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:00.454
What was that?

262
00:10:00.785 --> 00:10:03.484
You were already chosen by someone else.

263
00:10:03.484 --> 00:10:05.425
Who do you think will...

264
00:10:05.425 --> 00:10:06.895
follow your orders the best?

265
00:10:06.895 --> 00:10:09.565
Out of you lot? I'd say none.

266
00:10:10.824 --> 00:10:11.834
Goodness.

267
00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:12.964
(They're good for nothing.)

268
00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.964
Ma'am, how about this?

269
00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:18.974
You can choose whoever mimics a dog the best.

270
00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:21.334
- A dog? - A dog or a puppy.

271
00:10:21.334 --> 00:10:22.805
(That's a good idea!)

272
00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:24.675
- That's a good idea. - All right.

273
00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:25.775
(If that's what you want...)

274
00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:27.515
Unbelievable.

275
00:10:27.515 --> 00:10:28.545
(Your wish is my command.)

276
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.885
(He waggles his tail.)

277
00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:32.555
Look at them.

278
00:10:33.055 --> 00:10:35.124
(They suddenly all become dogs.)

279
00:10:36.224 --> 00:10:37.954
(Tae Hyun flips on his back.)

280
00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:39.055
(You're a sweetheart.)

281
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.025
That dog has a sunstroke.

282
00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.364
(Panting)

283
00:10:43.464 --> 00:10:45.025
(Is he exhausted already?)

284
00:10:45.025 --> 00:10:46.094
He is useless.

285
00:10:46.334 --> 00:10:48.604
- This dog collapsed. - I think he's sick.

286
00:10:48.604 --> 00:10:49.604
You're right.

287
00:10:49.604 --> 00:10:52.504
That's a sick dog right there.

288
00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:54.135
(Tae Hyun snags the opportunity.)

289
00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:56.574
He's very good at this.

290
00:10:56.574 --> 00:10:57.704
That dog's peeing.

291
00:10:58.675 --> 00:11:00.275
(Which dog?)

292
00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:03.445
Look at him.

293
00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:04.545
(The fat dog!)

294
00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:06.155
(He sure looks strong.)

295
00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:07.515
Are you a tiger or a dog?

296
00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:10.785
Ma'am, you should choose the sweetest dog.

297
00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:12.754
I choose him at the end.

298
00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:14.295
I choose him at the end.

299
00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:17.525
(Tae Hyun will build the dog house.)

300
00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:19.565
(What about these two then?)

301
00:11:19.565 --> 00:11:21.195
Joon Young is out of luck today.

302
00:11:21.935 --> 00:11:24.305
Since I'm nearly the last to choose,

303
00:11:24.305 --> 00:11:25.574
I'm losing all of my top choices.

304
00:11:26.535 --> 00:11:28.135
(She doesn't like either of them.)

305
00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:29.204
That's too bad.

306
00:11:29.204 --> 00:11:30.844
He's much stronger.

307
00:11:31.244 --> 00:11:32.744
Joon Young isn't lucky today.

308
00:11:32.915 --> 00:11:34.175
The level five task.

309
00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:36.815
What job do you have for them today?

310
00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:38.045
Papering.

311
00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:39.114
- What? - Papering.

312
00:11:39.114 --> 00:11:40.114
Papering.

313
00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:41.714
(Compost?)

314
00:11:41.714 --> 00:11:42.724
No, papering.

315
00:11:42.724 --> 00:11:44.425
You'll be papering a wall.

316
00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:45.494
- A wall? - With wallpaper?

317
00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:46.695
(They will paper a wall.)

318
00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:48.395
- I love interior design. - Papering.

319
00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:50.425
I'm tall, so I can reach higher places.

320
00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:52.295
My dad used to run a paper mill.

321
00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:54.494
But you're too heavy.

322
00:11:55.094 --> 00:11:56.165
Me?

323
00:11:56.665 --> 00:11:58.675
You're too heavy to step on a chair.

324
00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:01.275
(He's disqualified for safety reasons.)

325
00:12:02.074 --> 00:12:03.405
(Defconn is hurt.)

326
00:12:03.405 --> 00:12:05.145
- Right. - I need someone...

327
00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:07.574
- Someone young. - He needs to be light...

328
00:12:07.574 --> 00:12:08.844
and nimble.

329
00:12:08.844 --> 00:12:10.084
But...

330
00:12:10.084 --> 00:12:12.484
- That's what I think. - He's fast.

331
00:12:12.484 --> 00:12:13.614
Joon Young's fast.

332
00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:15.785
I'm chubby too,

333
00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:17.584
so it wouldn't be safe if I chose you.

334
00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:20.354
If that's the case, then he's your man.

335
00:12:22.364 --> 00:12:24.864
- I guess you're mine. - He's also tall too.

336
00:12:24.864 --> 00:12:26.135
You were born to be mine.

337
00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:29.004
Did you hear that?

338
00:12:29.334 --> 00:12:31.104
She says you were born to be hers.

339
00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:33.604
(That was the most direct proposal ever.)

340
00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:35.645
(They are made for each other.)

341
00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:36.974
They're made for each other.

342
00:12:37.844 --> 00:12:40.344
(She's already picturing how to utilize Defconn.)

343
00:12:40.344 --> 00:12:42.885
He is pretty big.

344
00:12:43.114 --> 00:12:45.515
She thinks you're too big to fit in the rice field.

345
00:12:46.114 --> 00:12:47.685
Do I have to get in the field?

346
00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:50.055
Of course. You need to weave in and out.

347
00:12:50.055 --> 00:12:52.655
- In the ditch. - Do you like me though?

348
00:12:52.655 --> 00:12:54.724
- His glasses... - You're too big.

349
00:12:54.724 --> 00:12:55.925
She thinks you're too big.

350
00:12:56.124 --> 00:12:57.624
You're too big for the job though.

351
00:12:57.624 --> 00:13:00.494
He's too big to weave in and out.

352
00:13:00.494 --> 00:13:01.494
He's too big.

353
00:13:01.494 --> 00:13:03.135
What about him then?

354
00:13:03.135 --> 00:13:06.074
Would you like Joon Young instead?

355
00:13:06.334 --> 00:13:07.874
Yes. He probably is nimble.

356
00:13:09.074 --> 00:13:10.874
The choice has already been made.

357
00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.744
Play rock-paper- scissors for him.

358
00:13:12.744 --> 00:13:14.015
You can't.

359
00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:17.344
We've been sticking to the order so far!

360
00:13:17.344 --> 00:13:19.614
- Gosh, we're sorry. - Goodness.

361
00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:21.555
Take him instead.

362
00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:23.254
Take him.

363
00:13:23.254 --> 00:13:25.195
- No, I won't. - I need the other one.

364
00:13:25.195 --> 00:13:28.025
Others should play rock-paper-scissors too.

365
00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:29.165
It can't just be me.

366
00:13:29.165 --> 00:13:31.724
- Did you hear that? - You're absolutely right.

367
00:13:31.724 --> 00:13:32.734
Joon Young, get over here.

368
00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:34.494
The choice has been made.

369
00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:35.665
Defconn's hers.

370
00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:37.265
(Defconn has to go to the rice field.)

371
00:13:37.265 --> 00:13:38.775
(Joon Young will paper the wall.)

372
00:13:39.675 --> 00:13:41.175
Ma'am. Please bear with me.

373
00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:42.204
He looks good.

374
00:13:42.744 --> 00:13:45.675
We hope we don't cause any trouble,

375
00:13:45.675 --> 00:13:47.045
so we'll do our best.

376
00:13:47.045 --> 00:13:50.244
You'll need to fit between the crops.

377
00:13:50.415 --> 00:13:51.614
Defconn.

378
00:13:51.614 --> 00:13:52.685
(Throwing)

379
00:13:54.685 --> 00:13:56.885
- Already? - You should wear them.

380
00:13:57.254 --> 00:14:00.124
They are your sons for the day,

381
00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:02.925
so treat them like your very own.

382
00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:04.724
Can I smack them too?

383
00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:07.234
- Of course. - Really?

384
00:14:07.234 --> 00:14:08.265
Is that a joke?

385
00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.135
If you are...

386
00:14:10.364 --> 00:14:13.305
satisfied with the job they did,

387
00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:15.645
you can also pay them a small amount.

388
00:14:17.175 --> 00:14:18.945
I can't give you much,

389
00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:21.844
but I won't let you go hungry.

390
00:14:21.844 --> 00:14:23.415
- Really? - That's great.

391
00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:25.155
Ma'am, ma'am.

392
00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.984
Just know that I don't eat much.

393
00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:28.685
Doenjang.

394
00:14:29.254 --> 00:14:30.425
Am I supposed to eat that?

395
00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:33.795
- Doenjang. - Unbelievable.

396
00:14:34.925 --> 00:14:36.295
(That's what she meant.)

397
00:14:36.295 --> 00:14:38.265
That's how she meant it.

398
00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:41.265
That's how she replied to Defconn's statement.

399
00:14:41.935 --> 00:14:43.035
Doenjang.

400
00:14:43.665 --> 00:14:45.234
It makes a delicious sauce.

401
00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:47.905
Of course. Anyway, you can pay me...

402
00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:50.104
only if you think I did a good job.

403
00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:52.114
- I'll do my best. - Sure.

404
00:14:53.515 --> 00:14:56.015
- She's hilarious. - I know.

405
00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:57.645
I want to win her approval.

406
00:14:58.415 --> 00:15:00.754
Do you have pork belly at your house?

407
00:15:00.754 --> 00:15:01.785
No, I don't.

408
00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:05.254
- What do you have then? - Doenjang jjigae...

409
00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:06.695
and aged kimchi.

410
00:15:06.695 --> 00:15:08.055
- Of course. - That sounds great.

411
00:15:08.055 --> 00:15:09.624
It's the best.

412
00:15:09.624 --> 00:15:11.724
Will you even have time to eat though?

413
00:15:12.464 --> 00:15:14.795
That's right. We won't.

414
00:15:15.504 --> 00:15:17.734
I'm busy every waking minute of the day.

415
00:15:17.734 --> 00:15:19.474
You should enjoy your life more.

416
00:15:20.305 --> 00:15:21.504
I will!

417
00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.045
Anyway, let's all do our best.

418
00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:24.744
- Of course. - We can do it.

419
00:15:24.744 --> 00:15:26.145
- Let's go. - Good luck.

420
00:15:26.145 --> 00:15:29.084
Let's ask her to cue us in then.

421
00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:31.045
- Just say, "One Night". - Sure.

422
00:15:31.045 --> 00:15:32.555
Say "One Night" on the count of three.

423
00:15:32.555 --> 00:15:35.185
We'll join in by saying "Two Days".

424
00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.185
Which camera should we look into?

425
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.954
- Just make a V. - Okay, I got it.

426
00:15:38.954 --> 00:15:40.425
- Are you ready? - Just say "Two Days".

427
00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:42.594
- All right then. - Are we good?

428
00:15:42.765 --> 00:15:44.324
1, 2, 3.

429
00:15:44.324 --> 00:15:46.165
- One Night... - Two Nights!

430
00:15:47.094 --> 00:15:48.805
- One Night... - Two Nights!

431
00:15:48.935 --> 00:15:49.964
What?

432
00:15:49.964 --> 00:15:51.035
(Isn't a night with them enough?)

433
00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:53.675
A single night is not enough for her.

434
00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:56.275
She wants us to stay for more than a night.

435
00:15:56.275 --> 00:15:57.974
- You'll lead us in. - One!

436
00:15:58.074 --> 00:16:00.614
- The others will follow. - Say "Two Days" together.

437
00:16:00.614 --> 00:16:02.714
- We'll do it together. - "Two Days".

438
00:16:02.714 --> 00:16:05.084
- 1, 2, 3. - 1!

439
00:16:05.084 --> 00:16:06.984
- 2. - 2!

440
00:16:06.984 --> 00:16:08.484
You'll say "One Night" alone.

441
00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:09.624
One Night!

442
00:16:09.624 --> 00:16:10.885
(Take three)

443
00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:15.395
Hold on. What was that?

444
00:16:15.395 --> 00:16:16.464
(She remained silent since she might get it wrong.)

445
00:16:16.464 --> 00:16:17.964
- One Night... - Hurry up already.

446
00:16:17.964 --> 00:16:19.234
- We're losing daylight. - Of course.

447
00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:20.895
- You'll say "One Night". - She's right.

448
00:16:20.895 --> 00:16:22.905
She'll be the only one saying it.

449
00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:25.035
You've been great so far.

450
00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:27.035
You know what you have to do, right?

451
00:16:27.604 --> 00:16:28.775
- All right. - Here we go.

452
00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:31.545
- One Night... - Two Days!

453
00:16:33.374 --> 00:16:35.545
(Finally, they did it!)

454
00:16:36.815 --> 00:16:38.114
Ma'am, wait for me.

455
00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:40.614
Wait for me.

456
00:16:40.614 --> 00:16:41.714
(She busily heads off alone.)

457
00:16:42.324 --> 00:16:45.195
Like I said, I'm busy every waking minute.

458
00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:48.864
How about we go out into the town,

459
00:16:49.094 --> 00:16:50.464
do some shopping,

460
00:16:50.464 --> 00:16:52.135
and eat at some of...

461
00:16:52.135 --> 00:16:54.765
Gimje's most delicious restaurants?

462
00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:57.004
- What do you say? - Sure.

463
00:16:59.805 --> 00:17:01.305
Did you listen to what I just said?

464
00:17:02.244 --> 00:17:03.804
We need to go that way.

465
00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.744
My chilies are over there.

466
00:17:05.744 --> 00:17:06.945
Are we going to work already?

467
00:17:07.145 --> 00:17:09.244
(She wasn't listening after all.)

468
00:17:10.044 --> 00:17:11.415
- Is this it? - Yes.

469
00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:12.454
Whose field is it?

470
00:17:12.454 --> 00:17:13.514
Mine.

471
00:17:14.085 --> 00:17:15.425
Are we working already?

472
00:17:15.685 --> 00:17:16.754
But we just got here.

473
00:17:18.595 --> 00:17:21.724
It takes over two hours to pull these out.

474
00:17:21.994 --> 00:17:24.064
You don't have to do it today though.

475
00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:25.895
It doesn't have to be done today.

476
00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:28.234
Of course. Will you do it tomorrow then?

477
00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:29.264
(Will you do it tomorrow?)

478
00:17:29.534 --> 00:17:30.665
(It's your job either way.)

479
00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:31.665
Is that it?

480
00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:34.004
(Joyous)

481
00:17:35.704 --> 00:17:40.445
(It's going to be quite the day today.)

482
00:17:41.244 --> 00:17:42.484
(Who's putting on these extravagant pants?)

483
00:17:42.915 --> 00:17:44.945
(It's Defconn with the level six task.)

484
00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:47.085
(He puts on his big sized boots.)

485
00:17:48.724 --> 00:17:49.754
Ma'am!

486
00:17:50.454 --> 00:17:51.484
Where are you?

487
00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:53.425
- Do I look okay? - Sure.

488
00:17:53.554 --> 00:17:56.125
- I'm here. - You really are huge.

489
00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.195
That I am.

490
00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:00.764
Gosh. Is it always so hot here?

491
00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:03.405
No, but it is around this time of year.

492
00:18:03.935 --> 00:18:05.835
So my job is to...

493
00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:08.135
- pull out the weeds. - That's right.

494
00:18:08.135 --> 00:18:09.675
Gather them with your hands.

495
00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:10.875
All right.

496
00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:12.244
Let's say these are weeds.

497
00:18:12.244 --> 00:18:14.014
Take them in your hands...

498
00:18:14.014 --> 00:18:15.415
and cut them with a sickle.

499
00:18:15.615 --> 00:18:17.385
- Grab and cut. - I see.

500
00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:19.484
How long do you do this for normally?

501
00:18:19.484 --> 00:18:21.454
From 8am to 6pm.

502
00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:22.855
(She normally works from 8am to 6pm.)

503
00:18:24.254 --> 00:18:25.294
6pm.

504
00:18:25.294 --> 00:18:27.125
- 8 hours a day. - I think it's 10.

505
00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:28.155
- Is it 10? - Yes.

506
00:18:28.155 --> 00:18:29.695
- Then it's 10. - Yes, 10.

507
00:18:31.494 --> 00:18:32.794
You work 10 hours a day.

508
00:18:34.464 --> 00:18:36.034
- Get in this way. - Sure.

509
00:18:36.034 --> 00:18:37.405
Weave in and out of the crops.

510
00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:38.704
Make sure you don't break any of them.

511
00:18:38.704 --> 00:18:40.375
Of course not.

512
00:18:40.605 --> 00:18:41.635
That'd be bad.

513
00:18:41.635 --> 00:18:43.605
You can watch as I make my way down.

514
00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:44.645
Aren't you coming?

515
00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:45.744
I'm not.

516
00:18:45.744 --> 00:18:47.044
I'm your supervisor today.

517
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:48.115
I see.

518
00:18:48.714 --> 00:18:50.044
- I'll get to it then. - Sure.

519
00:18:50.044 --> 00:18:51.284
- You can watch me. - Go ahead.

520
00:18:51.284 --> 00:18:53.514
- Look how I'm doing. - Watch the crops.

521
00:18:53.514 --> 00:18:55.224
Am I doing well?

522
00:18:55.224 --> 00:18:56.325
(The supervisor has her hands behind her.)

523
00:18:56.325 --> 00:18:57.855
- Am I doing all right? - Get on with it.

524
00:18:58.724 --> 00:19:00.695
- I'll get rid of them. - Sure.

525
00:19:01.254 --> 00:19:02.964
Do you get leeches around here?

526
00:19:03.724 --> 00:19:04.794
We do.

527
00:19:04.794 --> 00:19:06.695
(We do get leeches.)

528
00:19:07.534 --> 00:19:10.165
You have on boots, so stop worrying.

529
00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:15.244
- You over there. - Yes?

530
00:19:15.244 --> 00:19:17.304
Discard the weeds you cut...

531
00:19:17.304 --> 00:19:20.675
- at the end of the ditch. - Sure thing.

532
00:19:23.115 --> 00:19:24.314
Be careful.

533
00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:27.254
You'll ruin all the crops if you fall down.

534
00:19:27.254 --> 00:19:28.254
Right.

535
00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:33.254
- You over there! - Yes?

536
00:19:33.254 --> 00:19:34.554
What's your name?

537
00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:36.125
It's tricky. Anyway, it's Defconn.

538
00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:37.195
What did you say?

539
00:19:37.264 --> 00:19:38.764
(Depugonie?)

540
00:19:38.764 --> 00:19:40.564
- Defconn. - Defconn?

541
00:19:40.564 --> 00:19:41.935
Yes, that's right.

542
00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:44.204
- Defconn. - Right.

543
00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:46.135
Your name must mean you're big as well.

544
00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:48.135
Yes, exactly.

545
00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:50.345
Are you still watching?

546
00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:53.145
- Be careful out there. - Sure.

547
00:19:54.474 --> 00:19:56.445
I shouldn't ruin a single crop.

548
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.984
It's 10 cents for each ruined crop.

549
00:19:59.085 --> 00:20:00.085
Sure thing.

550
00:20:00.984 --> 00:20:02.054
Here it is.

551
00:20:02.054 --> 00:20:03.355
(Standing awkwardly)

552
00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:07.155
(Finally, he pulls out his first weed.)

553
00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:08.254
Is this it?

554
00:20:08.524 --> 00:20:09.625
- Is this it? - Yes.

555
00:20:09.895 --> 00:20:10.964
- Did I get it right? - Yes.

556
00:20:10.964 --> 00:20:12.135
Make some noise!

557
00:20:13.365 --> 00:20:15.365
- Okay! - Thank you.

558
00:20:15.704 --> 00:20:17.464
These weeds are a menace.

559
00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:21.945
Ma'am, is this always done manually?

560
00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:23.704
- Can't machines do it? - They can't.

561
00:20:23.704 --> 00:20:25.714
They'll cause too much havoc.

562
00:20:25.744 --> 00:20:26.774
Of course.

563
00:20:26.774 --> 00:20:29.044
Do you see the weeds in front of you?

564
00:20:29.044 --> 00:20:30.514
Grab them with your hand.

565
00:20:30.514 --> 00:20:32.615
All right. I'll do just that.

566
00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:35.625
Once they're gathered, cut it with your sickle.

567
00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:38.385
- My sickle? - Cut it across.

568
00:20:38.385 --> 00:20:41.254
- Like this? - That wasn't deep enough.

569
00:20:41.254 --> 00:20:42.365
Reach further down.

570
00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:44.764
- Further down? - Yes, at least half way.

571
00:20:46.365 --> 00:20:47.595
I can't tell them apart.

572
00:20:47.595 --> 00:20:48.605
(It's not easy to spot them.)

573
00:20:49.464 --> 00:20:52.175
What about this?

574
00:20:53.004 --> 00:20:54.304
- What about this? - Good job.

575
00:20:54.635 --> 00:20:55.675
I did a good job.

576
00:20:57.345 --> 00:20:59.575
Ma'am, when do we eat?

577
00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:02.645
(You haven't done any work yet.)

578
00:21:02.645 --> 00:21:04.984
At noon. Noon!

579
00:21:04.984 --> 00:21:06.054
Noon?

580
00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:08.885
I should've cut them...

581
00:21:09.524 --> 00:21:13.524
before the crops started to grow, so I'm late.

582
00:21:13.524 --> 00:21:15.464
There aren't many hands to help, right?

583
00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:17.264
- No. - There aren't.

584
00:21:17.264 --> 00:21:19.294
I'll help you as much as I can today.

585
00:21:23.064 --> 00:21:25.004
(The black area are fields of weeds.)

586
00:21:27.105 --> 00:21:28.335
The weeds are tough too.

587
00:21:30.504 --> 00:21:32.615
(It's not easy since it's his first time.)

588
00:21:33.474 --> 00:21:35.345
(But he does his best.)

589
00:21:36.544 --> 00:21:39.284
(Meanwhile, at Joon Ho's chili field)

590
00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:42.185
- Do I pick the red ones? - Yes.

591
00:21:42.524 --> 00:21:44.724
Pick them and cut the strings.

592
00:21:44.855 --> 00:21:46.095
You need to pick the chili stalks.

593
00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:47.724
I need to pick the stalks after picking the chilies?

594
00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:48.724
Yes.

595
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.464
(After giving instructions,)

596
00:21:50.994 --> 00:21:52.534
(Mal Lae starts working.)

597
00:21:53.464 --> 00:21:56.635
(She looks skilled in using a sickle.)

598
00:21:57.804 --> 00:22:00.304
(She's unbelievably fast.)

599
00:22:01.534 --> 00:22:04.145
(She keeps working without a single break.)

600
00:22:05.744 --> 00:22:08.685
(She's the master of the chili farm.)

601
00:22:11.484 --> 00:22:14.254
You need to get rid of the supporting sticks.

602
00:22:14.784 --> 00:22:17.484
I'll do it. Let me handle this.

603
00:22:17.484 --> 00:22:19.855
I'll do the work that requires power. I'm a man.

604
00:22:21.395 --> 00:22:25.095
(Struggling)

605
00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:28.665
(Why is it so firmly stuck?)

606
00:22:29.405 --> 00:22:31.704
My goodness. It won't come out.

607
00:22:31.704 --> 00:22:34.304
This is harder than I thought.

608
00:22:34.935 --> 00:22:36.945
Could you try picking one?

609
00:22:36.945 --> 00:22:38.514
(Defconn tries to pick one pole.)

610
00:22:38.945 --> 00:22:40.075
Here you go.

611
00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:41.984
(He easily picked it out.)

612
00:22:42.915 --> 00:22:44.784
(It's easy.)

613
00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:50.325
Something is wrong. It's supposed to be hard.

614
00:22:51.685 --> 00:22:53.254
I didn't know it required power.

615
00:22:53.954 --> 00:22:55.165
Gosh, this is hard.

616
00:22:56.425 --> 00:22:58.294
(A little while later)

617
00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.435
(Joon Ho got the hang of it.)

618
00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:04.704
(He picked out a few stakes.)

619
00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:08.605
Mal Lae works all the time.

620
00:23:08.945 --> 00:23:09.945
She works even at night.

621
00:23:09.945 --> 00:23:12.445
- I'm so unlucky. - You are indeed.

622
00:23:12.645 --> 00:23:15.514
She's the only one working when others are singing.

623
00:23:15.514 --> 00:23:17.415
I was once scared by some rustling noise...

624
00:23:17.415 --> 00:23:19.885
while passing by here. It turned out to be her.

625
00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:22.625
(Joon Ho is picked by a wrong partner today.)

626
00:23:24.085 --> 00:23:26.625
Son, don't be so frustrated.

627
00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:28.895
I'm going back to Seoul, Mom.

628
00:23:29.695 --> 00:23:31.024
I want to go study.

629
00:23:31.724 --> 00:23:33.895
My talent doesn't deserve this.

630
00:23:34.764 --> 00:23:36.435
I'll go to Seoul and become a lawyer.

631
00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:39.675
I'll give this to you. I'll give this to you.

632
00:23:40.004 --> 00:23:41.304
Since you worked hard, I'll give this to you.

633
00:23:41.304 --> 00:23:43.744
What are you saying? I'm tired of chilies.

634
00:23:43.744 --> 00:23:44.905
We always eat chilies at home.

635
00:23:44.905 --> 00:23:45.915
(Her son is sick of chilies.)

636
00:23:45.915 --> 00:23:49.214
Defconn, how far have you done?

637
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:50.585
Would you like to come in and try picking one?

638
00:23:50.585 --> 00:23:52.814
No, thank you.

639
00:23:53.585 --> 00:23:55.224
That's the hardest task, isn't it?

640
00:23:55.984 --> 00:23:57.454
- Why don't you help him? - Pardon me?

641
00:23:57.454 --> 00:23:58.754
I've got to help her.

642
00:23:58.994 --> 00:24:00.825
Mal Lae and I work and help each other,

643
00:24:00.825 --> 00:24:02.494
while you just watch him working...

644
00:24:02.564 --> 00:24:03.595
like a supervisor.

645
00:24:04.294 --> 00:24:06.635
He's really sly.

646
00:24:06.635 --> 00:24:07.865
- What are you saying? - I'm better, right?

647
00:24:08.365 --> 00:24:09.734
Ma'am, aren't I better than him?

648
00:24:09.734 --> 00:24:11.204
- You are. - Make some noise!

649
00:24:11.635 --> 00:24:12.875
What do you want from me?

650
00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:15.375
"What do you want from me?"

651
00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:16.474
(Joon Ho and Defconn get used to the work.)

652
00:24:19.075 --> 00:24:21.514
(There's a child here who doesn't know what to do.)

653
00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:25.615
- Do you live alone? - Yes.

654
00:24:25.885 --> 00:24:27.585
- Really? - I live alone.

655
00:24:27.655 --> 00:24:29.984
You must be living in a studio apartment.

656
00:24:30.984 --> 00:24:32.895
(The room to paper will be small.)

657
00:24:35.365 --> 00:24:37.794
(Welcome to the palace.)

658
00:24:38.734 --> 00:24:40.635
Do you live alone in such a big place?

659
00:24:42.405 --> 00:24:44.905
(This is where Joon Young will be working today.)

660
00:24:46.075 --> 00:24:49.675
(Repaper the old wall.)

661
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:54.615
- This... - We need to rip it first.

662
00:24:54.615 --> 00:24:55.784
- Rip it? - Yes.

663
00:24:55.784 --> 00:24:57.314
Should I rip the paper first?

664
00:24:57.915 --> 00:24:59.454
Yes, you should.

665
00:25:00.855 --> 00:25:01.885
Very well.

666
00:25:03.484 --> 00:25:04.885
(But...)

667
00:25:07.395 --> 00:25:09.825
(He's so poor at ripping it.)

668
00:25:10.695 --> 00:25:13.095
Ma'am, doesn't this look artsy?

669
00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:14.095
What?

670
00:25:16.004 --> 00:25:17.034
(Clumsy)

671
00:25:17.034 --> 00:25:18.034
It looked like something.

672
00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:20.935
Oh, no. There's a spider.

673
00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:22.375
It's all right.

674
00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:24.145
(He's so scared.)

675
00:25:25.814 --> 00:25:27.915
We're in trouble.

676
00:25:28.175 --> 00:25:30.544
If you work like that, you can't finish it by today.

677
00:25:30.685 --> 00:25:31.685
You're right.

678
00:25:31.784 --> 00:25:33.484
How was your first impression of him?

679
00:25:33.885 --> 00:25:36.125
It's all right. It's all right, but...

680
00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:37.685
he's a little weak.

681
00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:41.195
Ma'am, you need to speak a little more quietly...

682
00:25:41.254 --> 00:25:43.524
so that I can't hear.

683
00:25:44.494 --> 00:25:45.895
Will I ever get to finish it?

684
00:25:46.095 --> 00:25:47.595
You'd better rip it more quickly.

685
00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:50.886
Let me search how to rip wallpapers.

686
00:25:51.987 --> 00:25:53.856
How to rip wallpapers easily.

687
00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:55.487
Can you search that too?

688
00:25:56.557 --> 00:25:59.396
It'd be perfect to have something like this.

689
00:25:59.497 --> 00:26:02.866
It'd be great to scrape it with something like this.

690
00:26:03.297 --> 00:26:04.327
Hang on a second.

691
00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:07.967
I'm not sure if this will do.

692
00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:09.166
(Did she find a scraper?)

693
00:26:10.166 --> 00:26:11.366
Here's a knife.

694
00:26:12.977 --> 00:26:13.977
Here.

695
00:26:14.577 --> 00:26:15.807
This is not what I need.

696
00:26:16.077 --> 00:26:18.616
What do you need? That one is a bit sharp.

697
00:26:18.616 --> 00:26:19.646
This is a knife.

698
00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:22.386
Just try scraping like this.

699
00:26:26.156 --> 00:26:27.586
(It works.)

700
00:26:29.156 --> 00:26:31.287
(He peels the wallpaper the way he peels fruits.)

701
00:26:31.386 --> 00:26:33.396
Just like that.

702
00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:37.596
(He peels the paper with the help of the knife.)

703
00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:39.767
I think we can start repapering now.

704
00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:42.436
- Ma'am. - Yes.

705
00:26:43.406 --> 00:26:45.376
- Give me some food. - Pardon?

706
00:26:45.477 --> 00:26:46.537
I want to eat.

707
00:26:46.537 --> 00:26:48.446
(You haven't worked much.)

708
00:26:48.446 --> 00:26:49.446
I have to cook then.

709
00:26:50.577 --> 00:26:51.977
What do you eat normally?

710
00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:54.247
- What? - What do you eat?

711
00:26:54.676 --> 00:26:57.416
I eat only aged kimchi and rice.

712
00:26:57.886 --> 00:26:59.086
You're a liar.

713
00:27:01.257 --> 00:27:02.386
Let's eat pork cutlet.

714
00:27:03.327 --> 00:27:06.227
My goodness. I can't eat it. It smells too strong.

715
00:27:07.057 --> 00:27:08.297
Do you not eat something like pizza?

716
00:27:08.297 --> 00:27:09.527
I don't like pizza either.

717
00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:10.666
(There is no pizza.)

718
00:27:10.666 --> 00:27:15.267
You like that kind of food because you are young.

719
00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:18.336
Do you want some snack? What about bread?

720
00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:19.876
- Pardon? - Do you like bread?

721
00:27:19.936 --> 00:27:20.977
No, thank you.

722
00:27:21.636 --> 00:27:22.747
I'd like to eat pork cutlet.

723
00:27:22.946 --> 00:27:25.247
I don't have pork cutlet.

724
00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:27.977
(Chuckling)

725
00:27:29.346 --> 00:27:30.517
(Meanwhile, Joo Hyuk heads downtown.)

726
00:27:30.517 --> 00:27:32.017
Why did you pick me?

727
00:27:33.317 --> 00:27:36.126
When all six of you were standing in front of me,

728
00:27:36.257 --> 00:27:39.856
I wanted to pick you. You reminded me of my son.

729
00:27:39.856 --> 00:27:42.896
Then I will call you Mom...

730
00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:45.037
the whole day today.

731
00:27:45.037 --> 00:27:46.866
I will call you Mom. Mom.

732
00:27:47.037 --> 00:27:48.237
You're my mom today.

733
00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:52.707
Do you know the bus schedule? I don't know.

734
00:27:53.176 --> 00:27:54.676
Let me go ask around.

735
00:27:55.577 --> 00:27:57.807
The first bus comes at 10:26am.

736
00:27:57.807 --> 00:27:59.277
(The bus comes every one hour.)

737
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:02.317
Mom, Gimje seems to be...

738
00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:04.287
known for cosmos.

739
00:28:04.487 --> 00:28:06.386
I saw many cosmos on the way here.

740
00:28:14.457 --> 00:28:16.227
(An old bus station)

741
00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:19.767
I think this is my first time...

742
00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:23.436
waiting for a bus at a bus station in the country.

743
00:28:24.866 --> 00:28:28.707
I've seen people waiting here while driving by,

744
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:30.406
but I have never been here myself.

745
00:28:32.547 --> 00:28:34.577
(He's a passenger of the country today.)

746
00:28:37.886 --> 00:28:39.057
Hurry up.

747
00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:49.866
(Let's ride the country bus to the market.)

748
00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:54.497
I feel like I'm visiting my aunt in countryside.

749
00:28:58.537 --> 00:29:02.247
Who do you think looks the most disobedient?

750
00:29:02.676 --> 00:29:03.906
The worst worker.

751
00:29:04.376 --> 00:29:07.416
Do you think young people here are good workers?

752
00:29:07.416 --> 00:29:08.416
They aren't.

753
00:29:08.517 --> 00:29:11.886
They just study and play with computer.

754
00:29:11.886 --> 00:29:13.057
They don't know how to work.

755
00:29:13.057 --> 00:29:15.827
I think Tae Hyun will work hard.

756
00:29:16.856 --> 00:29:20.257
I think Joon Young will work all right too.

757
00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:23.166
But I feel like Joon Ho, Jong Min, and Defconn...

758
00:29:23.166 --> 00:29:24.696
will be talking only.

759
00:29:26.396 --> 00:29:29.636
I love you, Lee Yong Im!

760
00:29:29.636 --> 00:29:32.376
Let's work together, Lee Yong Im!

761
00:29:32.376 --> 00:29:35.376
I'll use this cane here. You should watch yourself.

762
00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:36.376
I'm sorry.

763
00:29:39.047 --> 00:29:40.876
I was just trying to make you like me.

764
00:29:40.876 --> 00:29:43.146
Forget about me and focus on mowing.

765
00:29:43.146 --> 00:29:44.186
All right, Ma'am.

766
00:29:44.287 --> 00:29:46.787
(There's 1 worker while there are 4 supervisors.)

767
00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:50.487
(We are watching you.)

768
00:29:50.487 --> 00:29:52.297
You need to pick these.

769
00:29:52.356 --> 00:29:54.656
(Meanwhile, Joon Ho tries to cut the corner.)

770
00:29:55.027 --> 00:29:56.297
Do you like music?

771
00:29:56.527 --> 00:29:58.096
I do like music.

772
00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.666
Do you know there's a song about chilies?

773
00:29:59.666 --> 00:30:00.767
(She's not so interested.)

774
00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:01.767
This is the chili song.

775
00:30:04.406 --> 00:30:06.577
(Excited)

776
00:30:07.606 --> 00:30:09.676
(She even dances hard.)

777
00:30:10.077 --> 00:30:11.077
Yes, chili.

778
00:30:12.346 --> 00:30:14.317
How exciting. How exciting.

779
00:30:14.817 --> 00:30:17.517
How easy it is.

780
00:30:20.186 --> 00:30:22.987
(Joon Ho sings one verse.)

781
00:30:23.086 --> 00:30:25.297
In the summer

782
00:30:26.327 --> 00:30:29.227
(She sings the next verse.)

783
00:30:29.297 --> 00:30:32.336
I walk on the riverbank

784
00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:35.767
(A passionate performance at the chili farm.)

785
00:30:38.376 --> 00:30:39.737
This is fun.

786
00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:43.376
(He's poor at helping out, but good at entertaining.)

787
00:30:43.376 --> 00:30:44.507
This is awesome.

788
00:30:44.507 --> 00:30:48.987
You're now listening to Mal Lae's "Chili Story".

789
00:30:49.386 --> 00:30:51.217
Which song do you want me to play next?

790
00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:53.957
Ma'am. Could you sing for me?

791
00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:56.257
I can't sing.

792
00:30:56.257 --> 00:30:58.287
Please sing a song.

793
00:30:58.287 --> 00:31:00.797
I can't work efficiently.

794
00:31:00.797 --> 00:31:01.997
Sing a song.

795
00:31:02.267 --> 00:31:05.567
(Taedong River)

796
00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:06.767
I forgot what comes next.

797
00:31:06.767 --> 00:31:07.767
(She forgot the lyrics.)

798
00:31:07.767 --> 00:31:10.237
- You're good. - It's "Sad Taedong".

799
00:31:11.406 --> 00:31:14.507
("Sad Taedong River")

800
00:31:14.507 --> 00:31:15.507
Taedong River

801
00:31:17.346 --> 00:31:20.517
(The song encourages him to pull the weeds.)

802
00:31:24.717 --> 00:31:28.426
(Joon Ho comes after the melody.)

803
00:31:29.527 --> 00:31:31.757
(He came to visit them while Mal Lae is away.)

804
00:31:32.227 --> 00:31:34.527
How do you like it? Does it help you?

805
00:31:34.527 --> 00:31:36.267
No, it gets harder.

806
00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:38.396
What? I sang the song to cheer you up.

807
00:31:38.936 --> 00:31:40.136
I was joking. It cheers me up.

808
00:31:41.136 --> 00:31:43.467
Defconn, let's help each other out.

809
00:31:44.366 --> 00:31:47.477
We'll work at the chili field first.

810
00:31:47.977 --> 00:31:49.646
- No, work here first. - Why?

811
00:31:49.646 --> 00:31:51.307
You need to finish this first.

812
00:31:51.307 --> 00:31:52.977
It feels like I just got more work.

813
00:31:53.616 --> 00:31:56.116
Why did I volunteer for a harder job?

814
00:31:57.086 --> 00:31:58.247
Just start working.

815
00:31:58.586 --> 00:32:00.517
What am I supposed to do here?

816
00:32:00.987 --> 00:32:02.827
Why aren't you at the chili field?

817
00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:04.787
- Chili field? - Yes.

818
00:32:04.987 --> 00:32:07.257
- Where's Mal Lae? - She left to get lunch.

819
00:32:08.596 --> 00:32:13.166
(Careless)

820
00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:15.336
- You can't do that. - Why not?

821
00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:17.836
Go deep to cut it so it won't come back out.

822
00:32:18.237 --> 00:32:20.176
Why are we cutting it off? There must be a reason.

823
00:32:20.176 --> 00:32:21.507
Because it takes all the nutrition.

824
00:32:23.876 --> 00:32:25.676
(Looking around)

825
00:32:26.346 --> 00:32:28.346
(Where's my son?)

826
00:32:28.616 --> 00:32:31.146
The chili pepper lady is coming. Let's hide.

827
00:32:31.146 --> 00:32:32.957
I should hide.

828
00:32:33.317 --> 00:32:34.957
- I'm here. - Go hide.

829
00:32:34.957 --> 00:32:37.057
- Tell her I'm not here. - You should hide.

830
00:32:37.827 --> 00:32:39.156
- Ma'am. - What?

831
00:32:39.156 --> 00:32:41.327
He ran away as he didn't want to work.

832
00:32:42.096 --> 00:32:43.696
- Where did he go? - He ran away.

833
00:32:43.696 --> 00:32:45.896
- Where is he? - He went back to Seoul.

834
00:32:47.636 --> 00:32:52.906
(Did my son go back to Seoul?)

835
00:32:55.747 --> 00:32:57.906
(I'm going to Seoul, Mom.)

836
00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:03.916
(Eventually, the mother...)

837
00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:07.856
(I was too weak-hearted to hang onto him)

838
00:33:08.727 --> 00:33:10.886
(She sublimates her sorrow into a song.)

839
00:33:12.126 --> 00:33:13.557
(Standing up)

840
00:33:14.727 --> 00:33:16.967
(Singing works great for a wayward son.)

841
00:33:17.997 --> 00:33:20.537
(I feel so empty inside)

842
00:33:20.537 --> 00:33:22.207
Mal Lae!

843
00:33:22.207 --> 00:33:23.737
Mal Lae!

844
00:33:24.007 --> 00:33:25.007
There you are!

845
00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:26.876
Come here.

846
00:33:27.936 --> 00:33:29.547
I'll go in there.

847
00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:32.017
We should go work there.

848
00:33:32.017 --> 00:33:33.817
- I'll be right back. - What are you doing here?

849
00:33:33.817 --> 00:33:35.217
Finish it first.

850
00:33:35.886 --> 00:33:37.487
You need to pick it like this.

851
00:33:37.487 --> 00:33:39.156
(Mal Lae is upset.)

852
00:33:39.356 --> 00:33:40.356
Look.

853
00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:41.386
(She demonstrates how to pull the stalks.)

854
00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.386
Look.

855
00:33:42.386 --> 00:33:43.787
See?

856
00:33:45.827 --> 00:33:49.196
(She's violent.)

857
00:33:49.196 --> 00:33:51.866
He's supposed to do this. Where did my son go?

858
00:33:52.767 --> 00:33:54.567
(He's chatting away with the neighbors.)

859
00:33:54.567 --> 00:33:56.166
What are you talking about?

860
00:33:56.537 --> 00:33:58.207
- Let's go. - You're here.

861
00:33:58.406 --> 00:34:01.307
- Okay. - Just do as I say.

862
00:34:01.307 --> 00:34:03.977
- Okay. - You don't look that way.

863
00:34:04.247 --> 00:34:05.376
But why are you so lazy?

864
00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:07.216
Okay. I'll do it.

865
00:34:07.216 --> 00:34:08.886
- I'm on it. - You need a spanking.

866
00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:10.316
I'll do it.

867
00:34:10.316 --> 00:34:13.087
- You need to be punished. - It really hurts.

868
00:34:13.316 --> 00:34:15.156
- You rascal! - It really hurts.

869
00:34:16.026 --> 00:34:17.057
I'm done spanking.

870
00:34:17.787 --> 00:34:18.796
Stop it.

871
00:34:18.796 --> 00:34:20.696
(It turns out my son was a good boy.)

872
00:34:22.227 --> 00:34:23.796
I'm so tired.

873
00:34:23.796 --> 00:34:25.596
(Joon Ho got caught again.)

874
00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:26.966
What?

875
00:34:29.066 --> 00:34:30.607
(Winking)

876
00:34:30.607 --> 00:34:34.906
The drifting clouds

877
00:34:35.477 --> 00:34:37.046
(Letting out a sigh)

878
00:34:37.046 --> 00:34:38.446
Please stop singing.

879
00:34:38.446 --> 00:34:40.946
(I was told this would be a level three task.)

880
00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:44.116
(Meanwhile, this is the level one work.)

881
00:34:46.687 --> 00:34:49.957
(The chilies make Jong Min sigh deeply.)

882
00:34:49.957 --> 00:34:51.187
How are we going to do all this?

883
00:34:51.897 --> 00:34:55.767
It's just better than working in a farm.

884
00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:58.227
- At least I get to sit. - Just do it.

885
00:34:58.227 --> 00:34:59.596
- Should I take this off? - Yes.

886
00:35:00.466 --> 00:35:01.866
(Struggling with a chili)

887
00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:04.966
You won't finish this within today like that.

888
00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:06.477
What should I do then?

889
00:35:07.477 --> 00:35:11.276
(Jeong Ae thinks of Jong Min as her grandson.)

890
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:12.276
This is amazing.

891
00:35:12.676 --> 00:35:13.816
(He's enough for me.)

892
00:35:14.877 --> 00:35:16.216
Jong Min must be flattered.

893
00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:19.756
- Is it past 10? - Yes, it's 11.

894
00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:21.656
I'm going to pick some persimmons to eat.

895
00:35:21.656 --> 00:35:22.727
- Really? - Yes.

896
00:35:23.587 --> 00:35:26.397
- You got persimmons here? - It's right over there.

897
00:35:27.057 --> 00:35:31.866
(She picks some persimmons herself for Jong Min.)

898
00:35:35.037 --> 00:35:37.566
Here. Try it. I'm not sure if it's sweet.

899
00:35:40.937 --> 00:35:42.176
This is the best part of being in the country.

900
00:35:42.176 --> 00:35:44.276
(He takes a big bite.)

901
00:35:47.247 --> 00:35:48.417
It didn't come out last year.

902
00:35:48.417 --> 00:35:50.087
It's the first one of this season.

903
00:35:50.917 --> 00:35:52.886
(It's bitter.)

904
00:35:53.957 --> 00:35:55.256
I can tell it's the first one.

905
00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.057
(Still, this is as good as being in paradise.)

906
00:35:58.057 --> 00:35:59.057
I like it though.

907
00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:03.267
Your dog is having puppies?

908
00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:04.926
- It's about to have them. - Now?

909
00:36:04.926 --> 00:36:07.296
- It'd have a big belly. - It does.

910
00:36:07.296 --> 00:36:09.307
Its belly is so big...

911
00:36:09.307 --> 00:36:11.807
that it almost hits the ground.

912
00:36:12.707 --> 00:36:14.676
Then are you prepared...

913
00:36:14.676 --> 00:36:16.906
to build a new doghouse?

914
00:36:17.276 --> 00:36:20.216
We got the blueprint ready.

915
00:36:20.877 --> 00:36:22.517
You made a blueprint?

916
00:36:22.517 --> 00:36:23.846
My husband did.

917
00:36:23.846 --> 00:36:25.557
- I just did... - I see. Your husband.

918
00:36:25.557 --> 00:36:26.557
All right.

919
00:36:28.087 --> 00:36:31.426
So all I need to do is build the doghouse.

920
00:36:31.727 --> 00:36:34.426
Hammering and stuff like that. It'd be fun.

921
00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:35.767
Make it pretty though.

922
00:36:35.767 --> 00:36:36.767
(Is it a blueprint like this?)

923
00:36:36.767 --> 00:36:38.696
(Is it even a blueprint?)

924
00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:41.566
Is this the blueprint you were talking about?

925
00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:43.807
- Yes. - Is this what you want?

926
00:36:43.807 --> 00:36:47.136
We'd need four sticks on the sides.

927
00:36:47.676 --> 00:36:49.707
- Wait a minute. - We need a plane.

928
00:36:49.877 --> 00:36:51.446
This is so...

929
00:36:51.446 --> 00:36:54.147
We should make it pretty though.

930
00:36:54.147 --> 00:36:55.787
Where's Ddarong's current house?

931
00:36:55.787 --> 00:36:57.616
- This is it. - This?

932
00:36:57.616 --> 00:36:59.087
She sleeps in this house.

933
00:36:59.087 --> 00:37:00.656
I see. It's here.

934
00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:03.357
Ddarong's house is nice.

935
00:37:03.787 --> 00:37:06.357
It's not nice. It's very old.

936
00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:08.526
It must be cool in there.

937
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:10.966
Ddarong needs a bigger house.

938
00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:15.466
- So what should I do now? - What?

939
00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:17.866
- What should I do? - I told you.

940
00:37:19.207 --> 00:37:22.006
Cut up the boards according to the drawing.

941
00:37:22.846 --> 00:37:25.517
- Like this? - Why don't you use that?

942
00:37:26.517 --> 00:37:27.546
Grab it.

943
00:37:27.716 --> 00:37:29.787
- I'll measure it for you. - Okay.

944
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:34.187
- We need four of it. - This long?

945
00:37:34.187 --> 00:37:35.227
- Yes. - Okay.

946
00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:37.926
- I'll do it. - Cut it straight.

947
00:37:38.087 --> 00:37:39.096
Okay.

948
00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:40.256
Hold it.

949
00:37:41.057 --> 00:37:42.627
I'll go get the sticks.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

950
00:37:44.267 --> 00:37:47.966
Seriously, I thought you had a blueprint.

951
00:37:47.966 --> 00:37:50.437
I was surprised to see that.

952
00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:53.906
So everything is planned in your head, right?

953
00:37:54.107 --> 00:37:56.747
The details for the doghouse.

954
00:37:57.077 --> 00:37:59.616
I have no idea how it'll turn out.

955
00:37:59.616 --> 00:38:00.676
(Don't worry.)

956
00:38:00.676 --> 00:38:02.546
- We need more. - More?

957
00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:03.616
Four.

958
00:38:03.886 --> 00:38:06.587
Should we make it like this? Here?

959
00:38:06.587 --> 00:38:08.827
- Underneath... - You need one under that.

960
00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:12.357
We need another four sticks for the base.

961
00:38:12.357 --> 00:38:13.526
(How would it turn out?)

962
00:38:13.526 --> 00:38:14.596
We need four.

963
00:38:15.497 --> 00:38:17.526
(They start cutting the base sticks first.)

964
00:38:17.526 --> 00:38:19.566
- Four of it. - Four of this.

965
00:38:19.566 --> 00:38:21.497
So we need eight in total.

966
00:38:21.837 --> 00:38:23.136
- We need eight of it? - Yes.

967
00:38:23.437 --> 00:38:26.136
- What about the top? - We need to cut it.

968
00:38:26.136 --> 00:38:28.136
We need 12 sticks in total.

969
00:38:28.136 --> 00:38:31.307
We need 4 on the top. 4 on the bottom.

970
00:38:31.307 --> 00:38:32.846
And another four as pillars.

971
00:38:32.946 --> 00:38:35.846
We already have them.

972
00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:37.687
- So we only need four. - That's not it.

973
00:38:37.687 --> 00:38:38.756
It'll work.

974
00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:42.486
We need four supports here.

975
00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.827
And we need four sticks on the top.

976
00:38:45.296 --> 00:38:46.827
That means we need 12 in total.

977
00:38:47.526 --> 00:38:49.196
I'm telling you it's not 12.

978
00:38:50.827 --> 00:38:53.096
We need 4 on the bottom and on top.

979
00:38:53.296 --> 00:38:54.537
- What about the roof? - So it's eight.

980
00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:56.636
- Well... - We need to make a roof.

981
00:38:56.636 --> 00:38:58.877
- I'm not sure about this. - We need four supports.

982
00:38:58.877 --> 00:39:01.776
- I know. - So I'll do as I'm told.

983
00:39:01.776 --> 00:39:03.046
I don't know what to do.

984
00:39:03.046 --> 00:39:06.446
Then, you won't need one on here?

985
00:39:06.446 --> 00:39:07.546
They are the bosses.

986
00:39:07.546 --> 00:39:08.616
Hold this.

987
00:39:08.986 --> 00:39:12.316
So we need 12 sticks in total.

988
00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.287
I'm telling you. I'm right about this.

989
00:39:14.687 --> 00:39:17.357
- They are the same. - Put them together.

990
00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:19.196
- Put them together. - This one?

991
00:39:19.196 --> 00:39:20.827
- Where? - On top.

992
00:39:20.926 --> 00:39:21.997
- Here? - Yes.

993
00:39:21.997 --> 00:39:22.997
Like this?

994
00:39:25.337 --> 00:39:27.997
It would've been hard for you to make this alone.

995
00:39:28.537 --> 00:39:30.136
What's so hard about that?

996
00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:36.006
(They're done putting eight sticks together.)

997
00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:37.077
Wait.

998
00:39:39.077 --> 00:39:40.716
(We don't have supports.)

999
00:39:40.716 --> 00:39:43.247
Is that it? It turns out you were right.

1000
00:39:43.346 --> 00:39:45.886
I told you. We need 12.

1001
00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:46.917
(I told you so.)

1002
00:39:47.687 --> 00:39:48.886
You're right.

1003
00:39:49.486 --> 00:39:50.526
We need to cut more.

1004
00:39:51.457 --> 00:39:53.827
- We need four. - I told you.

1005
00:39:54.627 --> 00:39:55.997
We have two.

1006
00:39:57.066 --> 00:39:59.397
I just hope Ddarong will have a nice house.

1007
00:39:59.596 --> 00:40:01.497
It'll work out.

1008
00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:02.866
How many times has she given birth?

1009
00:40:04.466 --> 00:40:05.807
I don't even know that.

1010
00:40:07.077 --> 00:40:08.107
Where's the puppies' dad?

1011
00:40:08.946 --> 00:40:10.006
I don't know who the dad is.

1012
00:40:14.577 --> 00:40:17.116
Ddarong. I didn't know you were so easy.

1013
00:40:17.316 --> 00:40:19.616
Do you like that Ddarong is pregnant?

1014
00:40:19.816 --> 00:40:23.026
No. It's just a lot of work.

1015
00:40:23.026 --> 00:40:24.026
I know.

1016
00:40:24.156 --> 00:40:26.327
You should tie her up then.

1017
00:40:27.457 --> 00:40:30.767
I left her unleashed so she'd watch the house.

1018
00:40:30.767 --> 00:40:31.897
Ddarong, you're so...

1019
00:40:31.897 --> 00:40:33.596
(Shy)

1020
00:40:34.897 --> 00:40:38.337
(They start assembling the supports.)

1021
00:40:38.337 --> 00:40:39.577
Please hold this.

1022
00:40:43.807 --> 00:40:48.846
(It's starting to take shape.)

1023
00:40:50.986 --> 00:40:52.017
We don't have one here.

1024
00:40:52.457 --> 00:40:54.486
Gosh, let's just do it as it is.

1025
00:40:57.986 --> 00:41:00.627
You were measuring things with a ruler before.

1026
00:41:01.457 --> 00:41:03.866
He's getting tired of it.

1027
00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:07.466
(She got me.)

1028
00:41:07.466 --> 00:41:10.236
He'd just do it roughly to finish it now.

1029
00:41:10.236 --> 00:41:11.267
He's tired.

1030
00:41:12.437 --> 00:41:14.506
- It's just... - Hold this tight.

1031
00:41:14.506 --> 00:41:16.546
It's a lot of work.

1032
00:41:19.017 --> 00:41:20.446
Their shoulders must hurt.

1033
00:41:21.816 --> 00:41:23.486
- What? - The shoulders must hurt.

1034
00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.486
- Who? - These guys.

1035
00:41:26.256 --> 00:41:27.587
I thought you were talking about your husband.

1036
00:41:31.557 --> 00:41:34.296
I thought you were talking about your husband.

1037
00:41:35.167 --> 00:41:36.796
Were you talking about the cameramen?

1038
00:41:36.796 --> 00:41:38.767
It must be very heavy.

1039
00:41:39.596 --> 00:41:40.866
They'd dislocate their shoulders.

1040
00:41:42.337 --> 00:41:43.667
Go and prepare lunch.

1041
00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:44.736
My shoulders hurt.

1042
00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:45.937
(She's off to prepare lunch.)

1043
00:41:46.276 --> 00:41:47.377
You're worried, right?

1044
00:41:47.676 --> 00:41:49.747
No, I'm not.

1045
00:41:49.747 --> 00:41:51.207
(You guys take care of it.)

1046
00:41:52.747 --> 00:41:54.247
Is this your hometown?

1047
00:41:55.316 --> 00:41:57.386
Yes, this is samteo.

1048
00:41:58.087 --> 00:42:00.187
- Pardon? - This is samteo.

1049
00:42:00.187 --> 00:42:01.256
- Samteo? - Yes.

1050
00:42:01.256 --> 00:42:04.087
- The place I was born. - That's called samteo?

1051
00:42:04.087 --> 00:42:05.526
- Yes. - You were born here.

1052
00:42:06.057 --> 00:42:07.227
I grew up here.

1053
00:42:08.596 --> 00:42:11.127
- Where did you meet her? - What?

1054
00:42:11.127 --> 00:42:12.667
Where did you meet your wife?

1055
00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.667
- Jeongeup. - Jeongeup?

1056
00:42:16.167 --> 00:42:17.466
- In Jeongeup? - Yes.

1057
00:42:17.736 --> 00:42:19.236
How did you meet her in Jeongeup?

1058
00:42:19.406 --> 00:42:20.906
It was an arranged marriage.

1059
00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:23.877
That's how people got married back then.

1060
00:42:27.877 --> 00:42:28.986
It was tough.

1061
00:42:29.616 --> 00:42:31.546
Pardon? It was tough?

1062
00:42:31.546 --> 00:42:32.687
Sure, it was.

1063
00:42:32.687 --> 00:42:36.526
Because I was in Seoul for nine years.

1064
00:42:37.386 --> 00:42:39.196
You mean she had a tough time.

1065
00:42:39.196 --> 00:42:40.296
That was out of nowhere.

1066
00:42:41.727 --> 00:42:43.926
- Were you in Seoul? - What?

1067
00:42:43.926 --> 00:42:44.997
(They had to live apart.)

1068
00:42:44.997 --> 00:42:47.796
I lived in Seoul. I did construction work.

1069
00:42:48.136 --> 00:42:49.966
- I see. - Yes.

1070
00:42:51.207 --> 00:42:53.636
Your wife was here farming...

1071
00:42:54.506 --> 00:42:56.147
and you worked in Seoul.

1072
00:42:59.616 --> 00:43:02.886
You came home four times a year?

1073
00:43:02.886 --> 00:43:04.046
Yes.

1074
00:43:04.587 --> 00:43:05.857
(Goodness)

1075
00:43:07.457 --> 00:43:10.256
Your wife must've gone through a lot.

1076
00:43:10.256 --> 00:43:11.327
(He feels bad for his wife.)

1077
00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:15.096
She went through so much. She did.

1078
00:43:18.636 --> 00:43:20.066
Have lunch first.

1079
00:43:20.066 --> 00:43:21.837
Okay. Should I go that way?

1080
00:43:21.866 --> 00:43:23.366
- Come here. - There?

1081
00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.136
I'll go this way.

1082
00:43:25.136 --> 00:43:26.307
(He won't do as he's told.)

1083
00:43:27.077 --> 00:43:28.747
Everyone, come this way.

1084
00:43:30.046 --> 00:43:32.247
(He listens to his wife.)

1085
00:43:34.247 --> 00:43:36.446
Gosh, I'm tired.

1086
00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:38.216
Who is that?

1087
00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:40.386
(Yong Im is bringing lunch.)

1088
00:43:40.386 --> 00:43:42.926
I say delicious! You say snack!

1089
00:43:42.926 --> 00:43:45.727
- Delicious! - Snack!

1090
00:43:46.926 --> 00:43:48.866
I say delicious snack, you say...

1091
00:43:50.066 --> 00:43:51.596
Snack!

1092
00:43:54.736 --> 00:43:58.037
You're so healthy and full of energy.

1093
00:43:58.037 --> 00:44:01.077
Do you work like this every day?

1094
00:44:01.077 --> 00:44:03.247
Every day. I don't even realize the time passing.

1095
00:44:03.747 --> 00:44:05.417
We don't even notice the sun setting.

1096
00:44:05.417 --> 00:44:06.577
We don't notice it.

1097
00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:07.716
You're such a good liar.

1098
00:44:07.716 --> 00:44:09.517
- I'm telling the truth. - She is.

1099
00:44:09.517 --> 00:44:11.587
- Really? - It's shocking.

1100
00:44:11.587 --> 00:44:13.216
- She works so much. - I don't take...

1101
00:44:13.216 --> 00:44:15.187
government money, not even a cent.

1102
00:44:15.187 --> 00:44:16.587
You don't receive old age pension?

1103
00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.057
No. They don't give me anything.

1104
00:44:18.057 --> 00:44:19.497
You worked really hard.

1105
00:44:19.926 --> 00:44:22.066
So you should take a break now.

1106
00:44:22.397 --> 00:44:25.767
I want to live comfortably now.

1107
00:44:26.366 --> 00:44:27.767
I want to go sightseeing.

1108
00:44:27.767 --> 00:44:29.167
- Of course, you should. - Yes.

1109
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:30.906
I'll go to Jeju Island.

1110
00:44:30.906 --> 00:44:32.837
- You should go. - Go to Jeju Island...

1111
00:44:33.136 --> 00:44:34.537
and spend a lot of money.

1112
00:44:35.377 --> 00:44:36.776
No, I can't spend money.

1113
00:44:38.276 --> 00:44:39.446
How old are you two?

1114
00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:41.477
We're strangers.

1115
00:44:41.477 --> 00:44:43.216
I know you aren't related.

1116
00:44:43.616 --> 00:44:45.087
I want to know how old you are.

1117
00:44:45.216 --> 00:44:47.457
She is the same age as my husband.

1118
00:44:48.087 --> 00:44:50.857
That's why I'm really good to her.

1119
00:44:51.357 --> 00:44:54.296
I thought Mal Lae was very quiet.

1120
00:44:54.296 --> 00:44:57.127
I'm very quiet. I'm not a talker.

1121
00:44:58.366 --> 00:45:00.937
- I never... - I live alone,

1122
00:45:00.937 --> 00:45:03.537
- so I'm happy you guys... - You live alone?

1123
00:45:03.537 --> 00:45:05.707
- Yes, alone. - Where are your children?

1124
00:45:05.707 --> 00:45:09.147
They all left. They live in Seoul and Daegu.

1125
00:45:09.247 --> 00:45:11.046
She raised them with these chilies.

1126
00:45:11.446 --> 00:45:13.716
I feed my grandchildren.

1127
00:45:13.716 --> 00:45:15.647
I feed my five daughters.

1128
00:45:15.647 --> 00:45:17.787
I feed them all through farming.

1129
00:45:18.287 --> 00:45:19.716
I press oil and feed them.

1130
00:45:20.386 --> 00:45:21.517
She's a rapper.

1131
00:45:21.517 --> 00:45:23.327
- I'm not. - I feed them all

1132
00:45:23.327 --> 00:45:25.696
I feed my grandchildren and I feed my children

1133
00:45:25.696 --> 00:45:28.866
- I feed them all - I feed them all!

1134
00:45:28.997 --> 00:45:30.727
By the way,

1135
00:45:30.866 --> 00:45:33.596
when did you meet your husband?

1136
00:45:33.596 --> 00:45:35.066
I met him when I was 20.

1137
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.566
- How old was he? - My husband was...

1138
00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.307
- 9 years older than me. - 9 years older?

1139
00:45:39.307 --> 00:45:40.736
- Yes. - That's a big age gap.

1140
00:45:40.736 --> 00:45:42.846
But we didn't live too happily.

1141
00:45:42.846 --> 00:45:43.877
Why not?

1142
00:45:43.877 --> 00:45:45.616
Because he died early.

1143
00:45:45.616 --> 00:45:46.676
(Her husband passed away early.)

1144
00:45:46.676 --> 00:45:47.917
- He passed away. - Yes.

1145
00:45:48.176 --> 00:45:52.017
That's why I had to work night and day.

1146
00:45:52.017 --> 00:45:53.957
- After he died? - Yes.

1147
00:45:54.457 --> 00:45:57.087
Nobody in this town works like I do.

1148
00:45:58.127 --> 00:46:00.227
- You're famous for it. - Yes.

1149
00:46:00.227 --> 00:46:03.727
Now that I'm old, I miss my husband.

1150
00:46:03.796 --> 00:46:06.796
I should be with my husband soon.

1151
00:46:06.796 --> 00:46:08.807
Don't say that. You should make a boyfriend.

1152
00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:11.107
No, I'll meet my husband again.

1153
00:46:11.707 --> 00:46:13.937
Because I didn't get to live with him for long.

1154
00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:15.906
Did you love him that much?

1155
00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:17.046
Yes, of course.

1156
00:46:17.046 --> 00:46:19.247
I miss him so much.

1157
00:46:19.716 --> 00:46:21.017
It makes me cry.

1158
00:46:21.017 --> 00:46:23.787
(It makes me cry.)

1159
00:46:23.787 --> 00:46:24.846
Don't cry.

1160
00:46:27.656 --> 00:46:29.526
One time,

1161
00:46:29.526 --> 00:46:33.026
I wailed in the field when nobody was watching.

1162
00:46:33.426 --> 00:46:35.827
I couldn't think of a way to make a living.

1163
00:46:36.096 --> 00:46:37.296
I felt like I couldn't continue.

1164
00:46:37.827 --> 00:46:40.696
But I did. I'm proud of myself.

1165
00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:45.207
I think of my husband when my kids bring gifts.

1166
00:46:45.207 --> 00:46:47.377
I miss him, but I don't mention it.

1167
00:46:47.377 --> 00:46:50.247
I have a picture of him hanging in my house.

1168
00:46:50.776 --> 00:46:52.716
I'm afraid someone might steal it.

1169
00:46:52.716 --> 00:46:55.346
(Because he is so handsome.)

1170
00:46:56.616 --> 00:46:58.017
- I live by drinking. - Here.

1171
00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:01.187
- Let's do a love shot. - Okay.

1172
00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:03.057
Do you know love shot?

1173
00:47:03.057 --> 00:47:05.327
- Love shot? Like this? - Love shot.

1174
00:47:08.096 --> 00:47:09.096
It's good.

1175
00:47:09.096 --> 00:47:10.696
- It's yummy. - It's good.

1176
00:47:10.696 --> 00:47:12.096
This is great.

1177
00:47:12.437 --> 00:47:15.736
She's not talking because Mal Lae is here.

1178
00:47:15.906 --> 00:47:16.937
(Quiet)

1179
00:47:16.937 --> 00:47:19.377
We were chatting a lot earlier.

1180
00:47:20.077 --> 00:47:22.276
We should start working before lunch.

1181
00:47:22.276 --> 00:47:23.276
Of course.

1182
00:47:24.147 --> 00:47:25.276
She wants to go.

1183
00:47:25.316 --> 00:47:27.216
(Let's go and do our work.)

1184
00:47:28.917 --> 00:47:30.087
1, 2, 3.

1185
00:47:32.857 --> 00:47:34.057
I'm happy.

1186
00:47:35.187 --> 00:47:36.256
I feel good.

1187
00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:39.957
Hello.

1188
00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:41.966
Gosh, it's One Night Two Days.

1189
00:47:41.966 --> 00:47:43.127
- It's Kim Joo Hyuk. - Hello.

1190
00:47:43.127 --> 00:47:44.127
Hi.

1191
00:47:44.327 --> 00:47:45.897
He's here to say hi.

1192
00:47:47.096 --> 00:47:48.466
I'm here to get groceries.

1193
00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:51.136
- Okay. - How much is two skates?

1194
00:47:51.437 --> 00:47:53.207
Two Korean skates...

1195
00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:55.247
cost 140 dollars.

1196
00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:56.406
- 140 dollars? - Yes.

1197
00:47:56.546 --> 00:47:57.607
Give me a discount.

1198
00:47:57.906 --> 00:47:59.077
I came all the way here.

1199
00:47:59.077 --> 00:48:02.346
Please wait a minute. I want to get a picture.

1200
00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:03.546
I need to get a photo.

1201
00:48:03.546 --> 00:48:05.256
- How much cheaper? - Hold on.

1202
00:48:05.256 --> 00:48:06.517
Tell me that first.

1203
00:48:06.517 --> 00:48:08.857
I won't take a picture without a discount.

1204
00:48:09.727 --> 00:48:11.897
I'll give them to you for 120 dollars.

1205
00:48:11.897 --> 00:48:13.357
- 10 dollars off each. - That's great.

1206
00:48:14.926 --> 00:48:16.966
He won't leave unless I give him a discount.

1207
00:48:16.966 --> 00:48:17.997
Skates...

1208
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:20.466
What should I get?

1209
00:48:21.167 --> 00:48:23.506
- Scallion. - Scallion, cucumber.

1210
00:48:24.236 --> 00:48:26.006
- A box of grapes. - Okay.

1211
00:48:26.207 --> 00:48:27.537
We have to get fish sauce too.

1212
00:48:28.136 --> 00:48:30.006
- Wait. Ma'am. - What?

1213
00:48:30.546 --> 00:48:32.517
We don't need to buy fish sauce.

1214
00:48:33.046 --> 00:48:34.077
We have so much.

1215
00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.116
(Just ask our staff.)

1216
00:48:35.116 --> 00:48:36.116
Don't we have a lot of it?

1217
00:48:37.116 --> 00:48:38.187
How much for 10 cucumbers?

1218
00:48:38.187 --> 00:48:40.187
- 5 dollars. - 5 dollars.

1219
00:48:40.187 --> 00:48:42.087
- Scallions? - Five dollars.

1220
00:48:42.087 --> 00:48:43.986
- Give him some discount. - Onions.

1221
00:48:43.986 --> 00:48:46.827
I'm giving them to him for a good price.

1222
00:48:46.827 --> 00:48:48.096
- Come on. - No.

1223
00:48:48.096 --> 00:48:49.696
You have to give us more discount.

1224
00:48:49.696 --> 00:48:50.926
- Cheaper. - It is cheap.

1225
00:48:50.926 --> 00:48:52.236
- Come on. - 20 dollars.

1226
00:48:52.236 --> 00:48:53.397
Just take 20 dollars, please.

1227
00:48:53.866 --> 00:48:55.807
Give them to us for 20 dollars.

1228
00:48:55.807 --> 00:48:58.676
For 20 dollars. Please.

1229
00:48:58.937 --> 00:49:00.707
(All right.)

1230
00:49:02.446 --> 00:49:04.107
I did it.

1231
00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:09.287
(A more aggressive negotiation starts now.)

1232
00:49:10.486 --> 00:49:11.517
(He shoots a local commercial.)

1233
00:49:11.517 --> 00:49:13.287
Do you want high quality meat?

1234
00:49:14.457 --> 00:49:18.526
Then come to this butcher's shop.

1235
00:49:19.327 --> 00:49:22.167
They prepare quality meat in a clean kitchen.

1236
00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:24.397
(With a commercial and photo shoot...)

1237
00:49:24.667 --> 00:49:26.866
How much will it be all together?

1238
00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:29.136
- Pardon? - Can I give you discount?

1239
00:49:29.136 --> 00:49:30.366
Of course.

1240
00:49:30.506 --> 00:49:32.577
Otherwise I can't have dinner tonight.

1241
00:49:33.176 --> 00:49:34.276
15 dollars.

1242
00:49:34.276 --> 00:49:35.477
(He received 15 dollars off.)

1243
00:49:35.946 --> 00:49:37.377
It'll be weird if I get too much discount.

1244
00:49:38.077 --> 00:49:40.216
I picked the best one.

1245
00:49:41.577 --> 00:49:42.616
He's really handsome.

1246
00:49:42.616 --> 00:49:44.917
They asked me to pick 1 out of 6.

1247
00:49:44.917 --> 00:49:46.287
- So I chose him. - Others aren't handsome.

1248
00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:48.727
They're not handsome. They aren't even human.

1249
00:49:48.727 --> 00:49:49.727
He's tall too.

1250
00:49:51.727 --> 00:49:53.057
(It's back to Joon Ho and Defconn.)

1251
00:49:53.057 --> 00:49:56.127
After harvest, where does this rice go to?

1252
00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:57.727
- Seoul. - Where are you going?

1253
00:49:58.026 --> 00:49:59.337
- Right? - Where are you going?

1254
00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:01.267
Keep working. I'm going for lunch.

1255
00:50:01.267 --> 00:50:03.537
(I'm going for lunch.)

1256
00:50:05.077 --> 00:50:06.136
Lend a hand!

1257
00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:07.676
(He's running away.)

1258
00:50:08.406 --> 00:50:09.406
- Ma'am. - Yes?

1259
00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.877
I'm a musician.

1260
00:50:11.006 --> 00:50:13.017
- I see. - Do you know rap?

1261
00:50:13.017 --> 00:50:14.116
- No. - You don't, right?

1262
00:50:14.116 --> 00:50:15.216
Say "ho"!

1263
00:50:15.216 --> 00:50:17.446
(He tries to introduce her to hip hop.)

1264
00:50:18.116 --> 00:50:20.287
- Say ho, ho! - Ho, ho!

1265
00:50:20.287 --> 00:50:21.827
You're great.

1266
00:50:21.827 --> 00:50:23.526
(Are you watching this, Yoon Mi Rae?)

1267
00:50:23.986 --> 00:50:25.796
You should ride a bike or something.

1268
00:50:25.796 --> 00:50:27.397
- You have bad legs. - Yes.

1269
00:50:27.397 --> 00:50:28.696
- Should I carry you? - No.

1270
00:50:28.696 --> 00:50:29.767
- Come on. - No.

1271
00:50:29.767 --> 00:50:30.926
- Ma'am. - No.

1272
00:50:30.926 --> 00:50:33.337
Let me give you a piggyback ride.

1273
00:50:33.337 --> 00:50:34.537
- Come on. - No.

1274
00:50:34.537 --> 00:50:36.437
- I'm really strong. - No.

1275
00:50:36.437 --> 00:50:38.066
- Come on. - I said no.

1276
00:50:38.066 --> 00:50:39.707
- Just hop on. - No.

1277
00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:42.147
Hop on. Just carry my sickle.

1278
00:50:42.176 --> 00:50:43.546
Just carry my sickle please.

1279
00:50:43.546 --> 00:50:44.946
Nice.

1280
00:50:44.946 --> 00:50:46.116
You're so light.

1281
00:50:46.517 --> 00:50:48.716
I weigh only 42kg.

1282
00:50:49.316 --> 00:50:50.517
- Only 42kg? - Yes.

1283
00:50:50.517 --> 00:50:52.087
You're such a good son.

1284
00:50:52.187 --> 00:50:53.787
Don't you feel like you're getting married?

1285
00:50:53.787 --> 00:50:55.756
I feel like I'm riding a horse.

1286
00:50:55.756 --> 00:50:56.926
(She is happy.)

1287
00:50:56.926 --> 00:50:58.057
She's 42kg.

1288
00:50:58.357 --> 00:51:00.457
I feel like I'm on a horse.

1289
00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:01.457
She's my bride.

1290
00:51:03.526 --> 00:51:05.437
(Time goes by...)

1291
00:51:05.437 --> 00:51:07.937
(and now it's lunch time.)

1292
00:51:08.937 --> 00:51:10.267
What will I feed him?

1293
00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:11.267
(The old ladies worry about lunch menu.)

1294
00:51:11.267 --> 00:51:12.437
There are no side dishes.

1295
00:51:13.607 --> 00:51:16.176
There's no side dish. What should I give them?

1296
00:51:18.207 --> 00:51:19.747
There isn't much. What should I do?

1297
00:51:20.676 --> 00:51:22.046
I have no side dishes.

1298
00:51:22.346 --> 00:51:23.716
There are so many.

1299
00:51:23.716 --> 00:51:26.386
I hope they won't get upset.

1300
00:51:27.216 --> 00:51:28.287
There is no space on the table.

1301
00:51:28.756 --> 00:51:30.227
I have no side dishes.

1302
00:51:32.796 --> 00:51:35.227
(Every mother feels the same.)

1303
00:51:35.227 --> 00:51:37.866
(They always want to give more.)

1304
00:51:39.037 --> 00:51:40.736
(Yong Im is preparing lunch.)

1305
00:51:40.736 --> 00:51:42.707
Ma'am. I see that...

1306
00:51:42.707 --> 00:51:44.937
one of the light bulbs is burned out.

1307
00:51:45.276 --> 00:51:46.437
- Yes. - It's burned out.

1308
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:48.406
I'm not tall enough to replace it.

1309
00:51:48.647 --> 00:51:51.006
- I'll do it. - That's not the problem.

1310
00:51:51.006 --> 00:51:53.846
The lighting itself has a problem.

1311
00:51:53.846 --> 00:51:55.187
- Its tip. - Its tip?

1312
00:51:55.187 --> 00:51:56.787
- Yes. - It's not the light bulb?

1313
00:51:56.787 --> 00:51:58.917
No. It's the problem of the lighting's tip.

1314
00:51:58.917 --> 00:52:00.756
It's the tip? How should I fix it then?

1315
00:52:00.756 --> 00:52:02.256
I have a new one.

1316
00:52:02.256 --> 00:52:03.557
Here. This is the one.

1317
00:52:03.557 --> 00:52:04.857
- Oh, this? - Yes.

1318
00:52:04.957 --> 00:52:07.526
- You need to replace it. - Hang on, this is...

1319
00:52:07.526 --> 00:52:09.327
- Gosh. - Do you need something?

1320
00:52:09.366 --> 00:52:12.037
I've never done this before.

1321
00:52:12.997 --> 00:52:15.767
(He decides to give it a try.)

1322
00:52:17.006 --> 00:52:18.636
(He disassembles the broken lighting.)

1323
00:52:21.477 --> 00:52:22.977
(She continues to make lunch.)

1324
00:52:24.807 --> 00:52:27.846
(He connects the new lighting.)

1325
00:52:30.846 --> 00:52:32.187
(The yellow corvina is almost done.)

1326
00:52:33.256 --> 00:52:35.627
(Defconn is...)

1327
00:52:35.627 --> 00:52:37.756
(sweating much too.)

1328
00:52:39.426 --> 00:52:42.966
(When she's almost done cooking,)

1329
00:52:45.267 --> 00:52:46.897
(he finishes setting it up.)

1330
00:52:49.437 --> 00:52:51.676
(Will the new lighting that he set up...)

1331
00:52:51.676 --> 00:52:54.176
(work properly?)

1332
00:52:54.176 --> 00:52:55.176
Please.

1333
00:52:56.346 --> 00:52:58.977
(Both of the light bulbs light up brightly.)

1334
00:52:59.477 --> 00:53:03.287
- Ms. Lee. - Did you fix it?

1335
00:53:03.546 --> 00:53:05.986
- What is it? - Turn the switch on.

1336
00:53:06.187 --> 00:53:07.187
- The switch? - Yes.

1337
00:53:07.287 --> 00:53:08.787
(The dark room...)

1338
00:53:08.787 --> 00:53:10.087
(lights up again.)

1339
00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:11.156
(She smiles brightly too.)

1340
00:53:11.156 --> 00:53:13.256
- Say "ho". - Ho, ho.

1341
00:53:15.096 --> 00:53:16.096
Scream!

1342
00:53:20.767 --> 00:53:23.267
(Someone else is working while the food is made.)

1343
00:53:24.966 --> 00:53:26.207
Shall I hang it now?

1344
00:53:28.676 --> 00:53:30.846
(He carefully hangs the first piece.)

1345
00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:34.077
Isn't this perfect?

1346
00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:35.247
(Satisfied)

1347
00:53:35.247 --> 00:53:36.946
It looks okay, right? Yes.

1348
00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:40.756
Ma'am, look. I hung it. I'll do it 1 by 1.

1349
00:53:40.756 --> 00:53:41.986
- I see. - Do you like purple?

1350
00:53:41.986 --> 00:53:45.227
That's the easy part. Do the hard part first.

1351
00:53:45.227 --> 00:53:46.796
You should cover that after I leave.

1352
00:53:46.796 --> 00:53:48.966
(You should cover that after I leave.)

1353
00:53:49.327 --> 00:53:50.426
I'd get sick.

1354
00:53:51.196 --> 00:53:53.167
(This is what he's done in two hours.)

1355
00:53:54.897 --> 00:53:57.636
(The quintessence of a homemade meal)

1356
00:53:57.636 --> 00:54:00.477
You made more food because of me, didn't you?

1357
00:54:00.477 --> 00:54:03.477
- No. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1358
00:54:04.477 --> 00:54:05.546
(Awesome)

1359
00:54:05.546 --> 00:54:07.176
- It's great. - There aren't much food.

1360
00:54:07.176 --> 00:54:08.616
It's nothing to show off.

1361
00:54:10.846 --> 00:54:12.256
How many bowls of rice are those?

1362
00:54:12.256 --> 00:54:15.926
She prepared it for all of us.

1363
00:54:16.557 --> 00:54:18.526
- You'll film first? - Yes.

1364
00:54:18.596 --> 00:54:19.627
Suit yourselves.

1365
00:54:20.327 --> 00:54:22.596
(Even though there are no pork cutlet or pizza,)

1366
00:54:24.366 --> 00:54:25.636
(they can't be compared to these food.)

1367
00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.037
This is the food I usually eat.

1368
00:54:29.837 --> 00:54:31.837
(Everyone...)

1369
00:54:31.837 --> 00:54:34.577
(enjoys their delicious homemade food.)

1370
00:54:37.877 --> 00:54:38.877
It's good.

1371
00:54:39.577 --> 00:54:40.616
(Amazed)

1372
00:54:40.616 --> 00:54:43.116
- It's delicious. - Good, good, it's good.

1373
00:54:43.287 --> 00:54:44.846
- Is it good? - Yes.

1374
00:54:45.187 --> 00:54:46.986
Gosh, this is the one.

1375
00:54:47.187 --> 00:54:48.827
This is the true kimchi of Jeolla Province.

1376
00:54:48.827 --> 00:54:50.557
(Watching him eat makes her happy.)

1377
00:54:51.957 --> 00:54:52.957
It's delicious.

1378
00:54:52.957 --> 00:54:53.997
(Despite the great food)

1379
00:54:56.227 --> 00:54:58.966
- Can I stop eating now? - What? Why?

1380
00:54:59.466 --> 00:55:03.006
I ate lunch already.

1381
00:55:04.437 --> 00:55:05.676
I was too hungry.

1382
00:55:06.807 --> 00:55:08.236
(No way.)

1383
00:55:08.676 --> 00:55:10.877
When? While we were working?

1384
00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.116
Yes.

1385
00:55:12.116 --> 00:55:13.116
(Embarrassed)

1386
00:55:15.116 --> 00:55:19.017
I didn't feel comfortable eating while you work.

1387
00:55:20.886 --> 00:55:23.426
Whom did you want to take at first?

1388
00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.997
- Whom did I want to pick? - Yes.

1389
00:55:26.426 --> 00:55:29.627
The one who went to paper the wall looked innocent.

1390
00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:31.366
The one who's papering the wall.

1391
00:55:32.337 --> 00:55:33.966
- At Ms. Shin's house? - Yes.

1392
00:55:33.966 --> 00:55:35.366
But he seems too weak to hammer.

1393
00:55:35.366 --> 00:55:37.167
He can't handle it.

1394
00:55:37.906 --> 00:55:42.377
So I was going to pick the fat one with a beard,

1395
00:55:43.307 --> 00:55:45.017
but...

1396
00:55:45.017 --> 00:55:46.346
I thought he wouldn't be good for me.

1397
00:55:46.346 --> 00:55:48.017
(He's not my type.)

1398
00:55:48.017 --> 00:55:49.216
The one who worked at the farm?

1399
00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.316
I didn't think I could work with him.

1400
00:55:53.187 --> 00:55:55.526
Your husband told me that...

1401
00:55:56.026 --> 00:55:57.957
you got married by arrangement.

1402
00:55:58.827 --> 00:56:00.457
- By arrangement? - Excuse me.

1403
00:56:00.696 --> 00:56:02.327
- Eat up. - Like many others.

1404
00:56:02.596 --> 00:56:05.337
- I should go. - Sit back down.

1405
00:56:05.337 --> 00:56:06.696
Did he tell you that?

1406
00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:08.267
(He's sitting back down.)

1407
00:56:08.267 --> 00:56:09.307
Sit on the chair.

1408
00:56:10.466 --> 00:56:13.877
Maybe I wouldn't have married him if we had met.

1409
00:56:13.906 --> 00:56:15.577
(Shocked)

1410
00:56:16.307 --> 00:56:17.946
We hadn't even met.

1411
00:56:18.247 --> 00:56:21.247
Our parents arranged our marriage.

1412
00:56:23.017 --> 00:56:25.386
Did you not like him at first?

1413
00:56:25.386 --> 00:56:28.486
- Well... - We were married anyway.

1414
00:56:28.827 --> 00:56:30.227
He met...

1415
00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.057
13 other women before me.

1416
00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:34.957
13 women.

1417
00:56:35.127 --> 00:56:36.227
(Embarrassed)

1418
00:56:38.066 --> 00:56:41.707
- I was too young then. - You didn't date anyone.

1419
00:56:41.707 --> 00:56:44.066
No. I just visited this town...

1420
00:56:44.366 --> 00:56:47.877
and got married unexpectedly.

1421
00:56:48.446 --> 00:56:50.946
He met all those women...

1422
00:56:51.077 --> 00:56:52.616
but chose me in the end.

1423
00:56:53.017 --> 00:56:56.087
I guess you didn't like those other women you met.

1424
00:56:56.747 --> 00:56:58.517
Right? He didn't like them.

1425
00:56:58.587 --> 00:57:00.417
- I didn't like them. - See?

1426
00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.287
But you liked her, right?

1427
00:57:02.756 --> 00:57:03.986
I told you we never dated.

1428
00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:06.426
Still, he liked you when he first saw you.

1429
00:57:06.426 --> 00:57:08.897
- We hadn't met... - I had seen you...

1430
00:57:08.897 --> 00:57:10.696
when you were in our town.

1431
00:57:10.696 --> 00:57:11.767
No, he hadn't.

1432
00:57:11.767 --> 00:57:12.796
(Shy)

1433
00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.897
He was watching you secretly.

1434
00:57:15.837 --> 00:57:18.837
- Let's go. - Watch out for the cars.

1435
00:57:18.837 --> 00:57:19.837
Okay.

1436
00:57:20.577 --> 00:57:22.807
- How much is it? - One dollar each.

1437
00:57:23.877 --> 00:57:25.377
You should give me one for free.

1438
00:57:26.846 --> 00:57:28.846
(He's still trying to save money.)

1439
00:57:30.816 --> 00:57:33.156
It's 15 dollars, but I'll just take 12.

1440
00:57:33.486 --> 00:57:35.127
15 dollars? 12 dollars?

1441
00:57:35.127 --> 00:57:36.587
- Just 12 dollars. - I don't have it.

1442
00:57:36.587 --> 00:57:38.057
I only have 11 dollars.

1443
00:57:38.057 --> 00:57:40.256
Fine, just give me 11. I'm doing this for her.

1444
00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:42.167
He has a good taste. It's pretty.

1445
00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:43.167
(He buys her a pink hat.)

1446
00:57:44.066 --> 00:57:46.866
(Meanwhile, Ms. Oh is...)

1447
00:57:46.866 --> 00:57:49.466
My daughter sent them to me.

1448
00:57:52.877 --> 00:57:54.877
(A phone rings.)

1449
00:57:55.877 --> 00:57:59.276
Hi. It's my granddaughter.

1450
00:57:59.276 --> 00:58:01.986
(Granddaughter?)

1451
00:58:02.647 --> 00:58:05.116
- May I speak to her? - I'll put him on.

1452
00:58:05.116 --> 00:58:06.116
Talk to him.

1453
00:58:06.187 --> 00:58:08.017
- Hello? - Hello?

1454
00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:09.227
Hi.

1455
00:58:09.587 --> 00:58:11.227
Hi, are you filming right now?

1456
00:58:11.227 --> 00:58:12.557
Yes, we are.

1457
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.167
Do you have a boyfriend?

1458
00:58:15.167 --> 00:58:16.426
(Do you have a boyfriend?)

1459
00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:17.767
Do you have a boyfriend?

1460
00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:21.366
- I do. - You do?

1461
00:58:21.767 --> 00:58:22.767
She's too young.

1462
00:58:22.906 --> 00:58:25.077
All right, take care. Please hold on.

1463
00:58:25.077 --> 00:58:26.077
(She has a boyfriend.)

1464
00:58:26.676 --> 00:58:27.676
Okay.

1465
00:58:27.676 --> 00:58:29.107
(I should just eat.)

1466
00:58:29.107 --> 00:58:30.747
We're eating lunch now.

1467
00:58:31.546 --> 00:58:33.316
By the way, why is this here?

1468
00:58:33.816 --> 00:58:35.747
That? It's a stereo.

1469
00:58:36.087 --> 00:58:38.017
- It's a karaoke machine. - That's right.

1470
00:58:38.017 --> 00:58:39.357
- It is. - Why do you have it?

1471
00:58:39.357 --> 00:58:40.886
My son-in-law brought it.

1472
00:58:40.986 --> 00:58:42.986
- For you to sing? - Yes.

1473
00:58:43.256 --> 00:58:45.557
- He brought it for me. - He's good to you.

1474
00:58:45.696 --> 00:58:47.696
- He's really good to me. - You're a good singer.

1475
00:58:47.696 --> 00:58:49.227
- I'm not. - You must've practiced.

1476
00:58:49.227 --> 00:58:52.066
No, I can't even speak in front of people.

1477
00:58:52.066 --> 00:58:54.167
Gosh, that's not true at all.

1478
00:58:54.167 --> 00:58:55.906
I'm not a good talker.

1479
00:58:55.906 --> 00:58:57.267
I thought you were Yu Jae Seok.

1480
00:58:57.267 --> 00:59:01.107
No, I'm not a good talker. I can't speak in public.

1481
00:59:01.107 --> 00:59:03.846
You're a good singer, you raised good children,

1482
00:59:04.006 --> 00:59:06.647
you're a smooth talker, you're hardworking,

1483
00:59:06.647 --> 00:59:08.716
- and you have cute eyes. - No.

1484
00:59:08.986 --> 00:59:10.886
My skin is dark because I've worked a lot.

1485
00:59:10.886 --> 00:59:13.116
- You're a good cook too. - I'm not.

1486
00:59:13.187 --> 00:59:14.616
Your food was delicious.

1487
00:59:15.256 --> 00:59:16.256
Really?

1488
00:59:16.256 --> 00:59:17.486
(Was it really delicious?)

1489
00:59:18.156 --> 00:59:19.557
When will we see each other?

1490
00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.656
- What? - When will we meet?

1491
00:59:22.566 --> 00:59:24.167
- When will we meet again? - Yes.

1492
00:59:24.997 --> 00:59:26.767
Our team is still in this town.

1493
00:59:27.537 --> 00:59:29.966
I know. When will we see each other again?

1494
00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:32.537
- After the filming? - Yes, after this.

1495
00:59:32.877 --> 00:59:35.077
I'll visit you when I come to this region.

1496
00:59:35.077 --> 00:59:37.776
I will. I'll visit you when I'm in Gimje.

1497
00:59:37.776 --> 00:59:39.676
- All right. Visit me. - Okay.

1498
00:59:39.816 --> 00:59:41.377
I have three sons now.

1499
00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:42.546
You do.

1500
00:59:43.386 --> 00:59:45.557
Actually, I saw a photo studio.

1501
00:59:46.287 --> 00:59:48.886
I wanted to take a picture with her,

1502
00:59:49.486 --> 00:59:51.656
but I don't have money since I bought her a hat.

1503
00:59:51.696 --> 00:59:52.796
Talk to the photographer.

1504
00:59:52.857 --> 00:59:55.767
To do it for free? Do you think it's possible?

1505
00:59:55.767 --> 00:59:56.767
(Maybe he can make it happen.)

1506
00:59:58.566 --> 00:59:59.736
(They go into the photo studio.)

1507
00:59:59.736 --> 01:00:01.366
- Hello. - Welcome.

1508
01:00:01.366 --> 01:00:02.866
Hello.

1509
01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:05.176
How much is it for taking a picture?

1510
01:00:05.377 --> 01:00:08.077
- ID picture? - No, together with her.

1511
01:00:08.077 --> 01:00:09.307
- Two of you? - Yes.

1512
01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.977
The minimum charge is 30 dollars.

1513
01:00:11.977 --> 01:00:14.377
- 30 dollars? - Yes.

1514
01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:16.046
It's the smallest size.

1515
01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:20.287
Could you take our picture and hang it outside?

1516
01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.256
If you want me to.

1517
01:00:24.256 --> 01:00:25.827
I want you to.

1518
01:00:25.827 --> 01:00:27.426
(He even seems a bit scary now.)

1519
01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:29.696
Do you?

1520
01:00:30.066 --> 01:00:31.736
In return,

1521
01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:33.837
could you do it for free?

1522
01:00:33.837 --> 01:00:34.966
(He finally said it.)

1523
01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:38.537
She can't do that. Nobody would do that.

1524
01:00:39.337 --> 01:00:40.377
How about 20 dollars?

1525
01:00:40.377 --> 01:00:41.977
(He doesn't even have 20 cents.)

1526
01:00:42.077 --> 01:00:43.377
I can do that.

1527
01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.546
We will lend you 20 dollars then.

1528
01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:47.377
It's a loan.

1529
01:00:48.386 --> 01:00:51.017
Thank you. I'll pay you back.

1530
01:00:52.017 --> 01:00:53.017
(How?)

1531
01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.386
How am I going to earn 20 dollars?

1532
01:00:57.926 --> 01:01:00.727
(Anyhow,)

1533
01:01:00.727 --> 01:01:02.627
(he starts to freshen up.)

1534
01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.866
You should comb your hair before taking the picture.

1535
01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:10.207
You should look pretty in the picture.

1536
01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.537
Which position should we take?

1537
01:01:13.537 --> 01:01:16.307
It'd be good if you sit close to each other.

1538
01:01:16.446 --> 01:01:17.946
Put your hand around her shoulders.

1539
01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:22.846
- Please print two. - Okay.

1540
01:01:27.357 --> 01:01:29.187
Gosh, you look great in it.

1541
01:01:29.187 --> 01:01:30.187
Do I?

1542
01:01:31.127 --> 01:01:33.397
Here. It's 20 dollars, right?

1543
01:01:33.727 --> 01:01:34.727
Thank you.

1544
01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:37.327
- Thank you as well. - Not at all.

1545
01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:38.696
Thank you for...

1546
01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.167
- taking our picture. - I wanted to do it.

1547
01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:41.337
He's like my son.

1548
01:01:41.337 --> 01:01:44.207
(A picture of good memories)

1549
01:01:45.877 --> 01:01:49.077
- My work deserves a meal. - That's enough.

1550
01:01:49.477 --> 01:01:51.917
- I changed that. - Right.

1551
01:01:52.716 --> 01:01:54.877
The television needs to be fixed too.

1552
01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.687
(The television needs to be fixed.)

1553
01:01:57.187 --> 01:01:59.756
(Television too?)

1554
01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:02.256
- Television? - It's embarrassing.

1555
01:02:03.827 --> 01:02:05.557
Why don't you sing?

1556
01:02:05.557 --> 01:02:06.727
Which song shall I sing?

1557
01:02:06.997 --> 01:02:08.366
Does it work?

1558
01:02:08.926 --> 01:02:10.997
You must press the button, but it doesn't work.

1559
01:02:10.997 --> 01:02:12.497
What about accompaniment?

1560
01:02:12.497 --> 01:02:14.566
It doesn't work. It's not necessary.

1561
01:02:15.807 --> 01:02:17.307
I can't because TV doesn't work.

1562
01:02:17.966 --> 01:02:19.276
I'll try it.

1563
01:02:20.077 --> 01:02:22.846
- It's covered with dust. - Don't do it.

1564
01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:24.207
It doesn't work.

1565
01:02:24.647 --> 01:02:26.417
Wait, let me try it.

1566
01:02:27.517 --> 01:02:30.216
- Here it is. - It's old.

1567
01:02:30.787 --> 01:02:32.716
I'll just try it.

1568
01:02:34.216 --> 01:02:35.227
It won't explode.

1569
01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:37.687
There we go.

1570
01:02:38.557 --> 01:02:39.656
The light came on.

1571
01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:43.167
Here it is.

1572
01:02:44.997 --> 01:02:46.796
- It must be old. - It is.

1573
01:02:47.437 --> 01:02:48.807
(Buzzing)

1574
01:02:49.636 --> 01:02:51.307
(The microphone works too.)

1575
01:02:51.466 --> 01:02:53.136
(Testing)

1576
01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.877
(She's surprised.)

1577
01:02:57.176 --> 01:02:58.176
Does it work?

1578
01:02:58.176 --> 01:03:00.147
(She takes out the karaoke booklet.)

1579
01:03:01.647 --> 01:03:04.116
(The sound is still a mess.)

1580
01:03:06.386 --> 01:03:08.756
(Does he know how to operate it?)

1581
01:03:09.687 --> 01:03:12.457
(It's not a frozen screen.)

1582
01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:18.296
This was it. This was the problem.

1583
01:03:19.397 --> 01:03:21.466
(The noise finally disappears.)

1584
01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:22.466
Didn't I do well?

1585
01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:24.566
It stopped.

1586
01:03:24.566 --> 01:03:25.577
(He fixes the speakers.)

1587
01:03:25.577 --> 01:03:27.377
(She's pleased.)

1588
01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:28.946
Okay.

1589
01:03:29.176 --> 01:03:30.946
Yes, what's up?

1590
01:03:32.577 --> 01:03:36.517
(Will the music play too?)

1591
01:03:37.587 --> 01:03:38.787
Here it is.

1592
01:03:38.787 --> 01:03:40.587
(Here it is.)

1593
01:03:42.227 --> 01:03:43.327
He's a technician.

1594
01:03:45.627 --> 01:03:47.557
I didn't think it worked.

1595
01:03:48.796 --> 01:03:50.627
My mom ran a karaoke room in the past.

1596
01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:55.136
(Enjoy your time.)

1597
01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.776
(His voice sounds exaggerated.)

1598
01:04:01.807 --> 01:04:03.406
(She sings along.)

1599
01:04:04.446 --> 01:04:07.816
(My beloved Mal Lae)

1600
01:04:07.816 --> 01:04:10.546
(I want to live with you forever.)

1601
01:04:11.886 --> 01:04:14.517
(She sings solo.)

1602
01:04:15.627 --> 01:04:16.827
It starts with "A 19-year-old".

1603
01:04:16.827 --> 01:04:19.296
A 19-year-old

1604
01:04:19.296 --> 01:04:23.066
A 19-year-old young bride

1605
01:04:23.066 --> 01:04:25.866
Gives all of her love

1606
01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:27.466
Let's start again.

1607
01:04:28.537 --> 01:04:31.006
Let's start again. Please sing with the beat.

1608
01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:33.977
This is Kim Joon Ho's karaoke.

1609
01:04:34.377 --> 01:04:35.877
Please put in more effort.

1610
01:04:35.877 --> 01:04:37.846
- Okay. - That's enough.

1611
01:04:39.216 --> 01:04:41.846
(When the song starts,)

1612
01:04:43.816 --> 01:04:47.256
(she immediately takes the stage.)

1613
01:04:50.627 --> 01:04:52.227
(Will you go...)

1614
01:04:52.227 --> 01:04:53.827
(Will you...)

1615
01:04:54.397 --> 01:04:56.566
(Will you go after leaving love?)

1616
01:04:58.267 --> 01:04:59.997
- That's enough. - Just one more song.

1617
01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:02.337
- That's enough. - I want to sing.

1618
01:05:02.906 --> 01:05:07.077
Did you throw away the tears?

1619
01:05:07.577 --> 01:05:09.546
(Didn't she say that was enough?)

1620
01:05:09.546 --> 01:05:12.877
Come on, let's go!

1621
01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:14.577
Let's go.

1622
01:05:15.187 --> 01:05:16.517
- One more song. - That's enough.

1623
01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:19.656
Play "I Miss My Hometown". It's an old song.

1624
01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.957
(My hometown)

1625
01:05:23.756 --> 01:05:27.497
- I really miss it - I really miss it

1626
01:05:27.497 --> 01:05:29.466
(She seems quite tired.)

1627
01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:32.167
That's it.

1628
01:05:32.466 --> 01:05:34.167
(He continues singing.)

1629
01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:35.636
(Sighing)

1630
01:05:35.636 --> 01:05:36.906
Stop it.

1631
01:05:37.937 --> 01:05:40.736
(He sings alone passionately.)

1632
01:05:44.546 --> 01:05:45.977
(Your time is up.)

1633
01:05:45.977 --> 01:05:47.017
All right.

1634
01:05:48.247 --> 01:05:50.546
(May I sing 10 more minutes?)

1635
01:05:51.517 --> 01:05:53.287
Your score might be zero.

1636
01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:55.627
What? I'm a great singer. I recorded seven albums.

1637
01:05:55.627 --> 01:05:57.957
- He might score 0. - Don't you know "Zombie"?

1638
01:05:58.026 --> 01:06:00.096
- What? - It's this song.

1639
01:06:00.096 --> 01:06:01.397
(It's the main song from his seventh album.)

1640
01:06:01.727 --> 01:06:02.997
What does the zombie say?

1641
01:06:02.997 --> 01:06:05.837
(She loves to dance.)

1642
01:06:06.937 --> 01:06:10.807
- Go to the chili field - What does the zombie say

1643
01:06:10.807 --> 01:06:15.077
Let's go pick some chilies

1644
01:06:15.077 --> 01:06:16.207
Let's go.

1645
01:06:16.207 --> 01:06:17.307
Let's go to the chili field.

1646
01:06:19.747 --> 01:06:20.747
It's at 1:30pm.

1647
01:06:20.747 --> 01:06:21.816
(Joo Hyuk and Jeom Soon head to the bus stop.)

1648
01:06:21.816 --> 01:06:22.816
It's next.

1649
01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:24.486
(There's a music performance.)

1650
01:06:24.486 --> 01:06:25.557
There's a big crowd.

1651
01:06:27.557 --> 01:06:30.127
(They stare at the crowd.)

1652
01:06:30.127 --> 01:06:31.227
Do you want to go see it?

1653
01:06:33.926 --> 01:06:36.526
(They come to take a look.)

1654
01:06:39.736 --> 01:06:42.107
(He wanders about awkwardly.)

1655
01:06:42.107 --> 01:06:44.636
- Are you the organizer? - Pardon?

1656
01:06:44.636 --> 01:06:45.807
Did you organize this?

1657
01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:47.906
Hello.

1658
01:06:48.176 --> 01:06:50.546
I have a question.

1659
01:06:50.546 --> 01:06:52.616
We're shooting One Night Two Days.

1660
01:06:53.446 --> 01:06:56.346
I borrowed 20 dollars from the staff.

1661
01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:58.716
I have to pay it back.

1662
01:06:59.787 --> 01:07:04.327
May I participate in the event for 20 dollars?

1663
01:07:04.327 --> 01:07:06.756
(What did you say?)

1664
01:07:08.127 --> 01:07:10.397
(He's determined to pay back what he owes.)

1665
01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:13.596
(On the other hand,)

1666
01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.437
(Joo Hyuk is usually extremely shy.)

1667
01:07:18.406 --> 01:07:21.977
(He doesn't like doing something in public.)

1668
01:07:23.577 --> 01:07:25.716
- What will you do? - I can sing a song.

1669
01:07:25.716 --> 01:07:26.747
A song?

1670
01:07:26.846 --> 01:07:29.517
Shall I sing "Shabang Shabang"?

1671
01:07:29.517 --> 01:07:30.517
Yes.

1672
01:07:30.687 --> 01:07:32.287
I'm not confident at all.

1673
01:07:32.287 --> 01:07:34.017
(He works at an event to take a photo.)

1674
01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:37.827
We have a special guest from One Night Two Days.

1675
01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:40.256
It's the most amazing and free man.

1676
01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:42.696
Here's Kim Joo Hyuk. Please come out.

1677
01:07:45.296 --> 01:07:47.437
- Look. - Hello.

1678
01:07:47.437 --> 01:07:48.506
He's handsome.

1679
01:07:48.506 --> 01:07:50.636
Hello, I'm Kim Joo Hyuk.

1680
01:07:50.636 --> 01:07:51.736
What?

1681
01:07:51.736 --> 01:07:54.437
One Night Two Days came to shoot in Gimje.

1682
01:07:54.736 --> 01:07:56.307
(What's going on?)

1683
01:07:56.607 --> 01:07:58.147
Play the music.

1684
01:07:58.147 --> 01:07:59.216
(He's excited.)

1685
01:08:00.116 --> 01:08:01.517
You are totally awesome

1686
01:08:01.517 --> 01:08:05.057
(This is a totally different Joo Hyuk.)

1687
01:08:06.357 --> 01:08:08.187
It's time to dance.

1688
01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:10.827
You'll be rewarded if you dance well.

1689
01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:13.997
Not only Joo Hyuk, but she also has to dance well.

1690
01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:18.097
It's a dance time with Joo Hyuk.

1691
01:08:18.097 --> 01:08:19.766
Here's some music.

1692
01:08:21.266 --> 01:08:23.306
(The big audience could make them shy.)

1693
01:08:28.446 --> 01:08:30.406
(They dance well together.)

1694
01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:34.646
(She enjoys it more than expected.)

1695
01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:37.616
That was great.

1696
01:08:37.887 --> 01:08:39.016
She's so excited.

1697
01:08:39.016 --> 01:08:42.226
- She's the most excited. - She is.

1698
01:08:42.226 --> 01:08:43.257
Give them an applause.

1699
01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.526
(Before getting paid,)

1700
01:08:45.526 --> 01:08:46.957
(the audience gives him cash.)

1701
01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:49.726
Thank you so much.

1702
01:08:49.726 --> 01:08:50.896
Thank you.

1703
01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:55.406
(He's rich.)

1704
01:08:57.936 --> 01:08:58.976
Here's your 20 dollars.

1705
01:08:58.976 --> 01:09:00.337
(He pays back the exact amount.)

1706
01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.077
I worked hard to earn it.

1707
01:09:02.177 --> 01:09:05.516
Putting the wallpaper on the ceiling is hard.

1708
01:09:05.677 --> 01:09:07.347
There's always a way.

1709
01:09:08.847 --> 01:09:11.616
I'd like to introduce you to a guy.

1710
01:09:11.616 --> 01:09:13.587
Really? Let's bring him.

1711
01:09:14.856 --> 01:09:16.186
(Hold tight.)

1712
01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.356
Let's go.

1713
01:09:20.226 --> 01:09:22.896
(The search team goes everywhere in town.)

1714
01:09:22.896 --> 01:09:24.866
There he is.

1715
01:09:26.236 --> 01:09:27.297
He's right here.

1716
01:09:27.366 --> 01:09:28.866
(What?)

1717
01:09:28.906 --> 01:09:31.637
You said you'll introduce me to a guy.

1718
01:09:31.637 --> 01:09:32.976
Pardon me?

1719
01:09:32.976 --> 01:09:33.976
Come this way.

1720
01:09:35.806 --> 01:09:37.047
- Get on. - Where are you going?

1721
01:09:37.646 --> 01:09:38.776
- Get on. - Where are you going?

1722
01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:42.217
(You'll find out.)

1723
01:09:42.816 --> 01:09:44.247
Will you follow us?

1724
01:09:44.587 --> 01:09:45.986
(He gets dragged without knowing why.)

1725
01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.327
(He's just happy.)

1726
01:09:49.327 --> 01:09:50.427
It's very close.

1727
01:09:52.297 --> 01:09:54.757
(It's time to change the wallpaper.)

1728
01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.497
Which song goes well with papering the walls?

1729
01:09:58.396 --> 01:09:59.597
I know.

1730
01:10:00.137 --> 01:10:02.766
It's "Monster" by Drunken Tiger.

1731
01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.707
(The song plays.)

1732
01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:08.276
(Spread it on)

1733
01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:12.747
(Featuring the lighting designer)

1734
01:10:13.616 --> 01:10:15.116
- Sir. - Yes?

1735
01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:16.917
Could you hang the light later?

1736
01:10:18.186 --> 01:10:19.356
This?

1737
01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:21.217
Please, sir.

1738
01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.056
(He installs the light.)

1739
01:10:23.056 --> 01:10:24.457
It's easy.

1740
01:10:24.457 --> 01:10:25.757
- Can you turn it on? - Okay.

1741
01:10:26.726 --> 01:10:27.896
- It works. - Great.

1742
01:10:29.297 --> 01:10:30.366
We're done.

1743
01:10:30.366 --> 01:10:31.427
(He's relieved.)

1744
01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:37.707
(They change the wallpaper to her favorite color.)

1745
01:10:39.007 --> 01:10:41.476
(It's a lovely living room.)

1746
01:10:42.007 --> 01:10:43.446
Do you like pink?

1747
01:10:44.377 --> 01:10:45.747
I like it.

1748
01:10:46.717 --> 01:10:47.976
The paper is getting wrinkled.

1749
01:10:48.686 --> 01:10:50.587
You're right. It should be fixed.

1750
01:10:50.986 --> 01:10:53.257
(We'll hire a professional.)

1751
01:10:53.757 --> 01:10:55.627
(He's still proud.)

1752
01:10:57.387 --> 01:11:00.097
(In the second stage of building a doghouse)

1753
01:11:01.226 --> 01:11:04.827
(He cuts a metal sheet for the door.)

1754
01:11:04.896 --> 01:11:07.467
This seems like wood, not metal.

1755
01:11:08.606 --> 01:11:10.736
(Next is covering the roof.)

1756
01:11:10.736 --> 01:11:13.507
Cover the roof with the material.

1757
01:11:14.406 --> 01:11:17.377
(He still listens to his wife.)

1758
01:11:18.247 --> 01:11:19.316
That looks good.

1759
01:11:19.316 --> 01:11:21.377
(They spend the afternoon working hard.)

1760
01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:22.887
(Ddarong)

1761
01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:24.887
(It's ready for her to move in.)

1762
01:11:26.257 --> 01:11:27.656
There she is.

1763
01:11:28.827 --> 01:11:29.827
Hey.

1764
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.957
- It's your house. - It's okay.

1765
01:11:31.957 --> 01:11:34.526
It's nice. They made it for you to give birth.

1766
01:11:34.526 --> 01:11:35.967
Good girl.

1767
01:11:37.266 --> 01:11:39.337
(He works on the final touch.)

1768
01:11:39.566 --> 01:11:41.766
(One Night Two Days, give birth to healthy puppies.)

1769
01:11:41.766 --> 01:11:43.806
(A fancy doghouse is built.)

1770
01:11:46.106 --> 01:11:48.306
(The blueprint and the reality)

1771
01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:54.347
(He wants to pull out all the weeds.)

1772
01:11:55.516 --> 01:11:57.646
(It's a fine day in one autumn afternoon.)

1773
01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:58.717
There are so many weeds.

1774
01:11:59.087 --> 01:12:00.787
- It's there. - Really?

1775
01:12:00.787 --> 01:12:02.856
(For the men from city,)

1776
01:12:02.856 --> 01:12:04.257
Of course.

1777
01:12:05.457 --> 01:12:06.497
Believe me.

1778
01:12:06.497 --> 01:12:08.156
(the life in the country is relaxing and warm.)

1779
01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:11.467
How can one old lady do all this work?

1780
01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:19.276
(He stops being a lazy man and starts to work.)

1781
01:12:21.007 --> 01:12:26.276
(The very fall day is about to end.)

1782
01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:27.616
Ma'am, look.

1783
01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.087
I did all the work while you were sleeping.

1784
01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.587
Look here.

1785
01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:35.127
- You pulled them all. - I did. I did.

1786
01:12:35.127 --> 01:12:36.887
(After pulling the weeds)

1787
01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:39.127
You did a great job.

1788
01:12:39.127 --> 01:12:41.556
- Say "ho"! - Ho!

1789
01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.097
Make some noise!

1790
01:12:44.097 --> 01:12:45.436
(She makes a loud noise.)

1791
01:12:45.436 --> 01:12:46.436
Awesome.
