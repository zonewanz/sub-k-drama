1
00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.329
We'll really go to the beach tomorrow, right?

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.640
Of course. You don't even have to ask me twice.

3
00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.269
By the way, can you take tomorrow off too?

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.279
It's fine because I've worked hard enough to earn it.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.779
Don't worry about me. Just look up places online to decide where to go.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.519
All right. Let's go in.

7
00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.460
- Come in. You need to come home. - Why?

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.460
I heard that you were staying at Hong Joo's place for only two days.

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.059
It's been over two days. Come home now.

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.789
Well, I have my stuff at her place.

11
00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.299
Don't you worry. Ms. Yoon brought them over early in the day.

12
00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:42.299
Stop being a nuisance and come home already.

13
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.500
All right.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.140
Well, see you tomorrow.

15
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.140
Okay.

16
00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:50.980
Go in, please. Goodness.

17
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.009
Why is Mom being like this?

18
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.119
You got home at the perfect time. Help me fold this.

19
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.990
Sure.

20
00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:11.630
- Mom. - Yes?

21
00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:14.400
I heard you dropped off Jae Chan's stuff at his place.

22
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.470
We said he'd stay here for only two days anyway.

23
00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:20.200
But still, it's just too heartless to kick him out like that.

24
00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.549
Mom, did he upset you or hurt your feelings?

25
00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:29.250
No, he didn't.

26
00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.980
No, I changed it.

27
00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.650
I changed what I saw in my dream, but things got even worse.

28
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.279
If I lose him like how I lost Dad, I'll...

29
00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.859
I couldn't prevent it even though I knew that Dad would die.

30
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.630
Mom, I couldn't prevent it.

31
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.730
I couldn't save Dad's life.

32
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.569
Mom, it's my fault because I couldn't stop it.

33
00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.599
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Jung.

34
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.069
I can't bear to see Hong Joo...

35
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.230
falling apart again.

36
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.809
Which beach should we go to?

37
00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:12.679
The South Sea is probably too far for a day trip.

38
00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.530
I sent onion extract to your address. Did you get it?

39
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.130
I've been praying for you every day.

40
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.630
Don't worry about us. Just take good care of yourself, okay?

41
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.670
Don't push yourself. Take more time off if you're still not well.

42
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.199
I'm the most handsome guy in our department without you around.

43
00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.340
Your absence isn't even noticeable.

44
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.179
Get as much rest as you need.

45
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.110
Goodness, why are they being so nice to me all of a sudden?

46
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.519
Whatever, I don't care. I'm still going to the beach.

47
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.030
Are you sure you're dressed for the beach?

48
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.760
Yes, this is my usual beach outfit.

49
00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.269
A full suit, a pair of sunglasses,

50
00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.869
and a beach mat.

51
00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.940
Gosh, why isn't the bus here yet?

52
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.070
The beach-bound bus.

53
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.880
You seem anxious.

54
00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.880
You must be worried about someone else suffering in your place.

55
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.920
No, I don't care.

56
00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.889
Besides, they can suffer a little in my place.

57
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.489
I mean, I'm the only one who got beaten up by suspects...

58
00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:25.789
and got shot. I've been through so much.

59
00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.059
It'd be too unfair for me to have to quit my job.

60
00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.989
I'm the only who suffers.

61
00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:32.400
It's definitely not fair.

62
00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.099
Such hardships need to be distributed fairly.

63
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.800
Forget it. We can go to the beach another day.

64
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.940
You should go to work.

65
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.309
Why? Let's go to the beach. You said you wanted to go.

66
00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:45.210
No, it's okay. I didn't feel good about going either.

67
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.210
See? I brought my laptop...

68
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.409
in case I'd end up going to work.

69
00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.489
We'll probably be able to create a new path if we work at it.

70
00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:59.920
Go to work now.

71
00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.900
All right. I'm going back to work,

72
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.840
but I'll flee to the beach right away if I regret it.

73
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.710
Call me if you end up doing that. I'll flee with you.

74
00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.929
I warned you that it'll be a difficult decision.

75
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.500
You should mentally prepare yourself.

76
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.070
Okay.

77
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.610
Hurry up! Come here and push me down.

78
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.639
Was it you?

79
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.809
Yes!

80
00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:56.480
- Oh, no! - Hurry up!

81
00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:42.489
It fits you perfectly.

82
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.260
You've seen me before, right?

83
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.630
In front of the elevator.

84
00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.099
No, I've never seen you before.

85
00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:25.699
- I'm Lieutenant Oh Kyung Han. - Kid, are you okay?

86
00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.139
You're under arrest for assault.

87
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:30.880
You have the right to an attorney...

88
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.710
and the right to remain silent.

89
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.710
Listen. I just wanted to talk to that kid.

90
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.949
What on earth did you tell him? You made him wet his pants.

91
00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:40.590
I must take you to the station first.

92
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.889
You can tell me all about it when we get there.

93
00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:45.119
Wait, gosh...

94
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.059
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

95
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.630
By the way, how did you know that man...

96
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.530
would cause trouble? You said we should follow him.

97
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.269
I'm pretty good at reading faces, you know.

98
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.909
Do you think that I'll be promoted to a captain?

99
00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:05.179
I'm not sure.

100
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.079
Du Hyun, I'm here.

101
00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.550
Hey, you came at the perfect time.

102
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.219
Do you remember that teaching assistant... My goodness.

103
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.320
I remember him, of course. The teaching assistant...

104
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.219
who revolted against Mr. Moon?

105
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.630
Were you out looking at real estate properties or what?

106
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.230
I guess this is your new way of rebelling against me.

107
00:08:24.429 --> 00:08:26.969
Well, that's not really why I'm dressed like this today.

108
00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:30.070
Go on. What about the teaching assistant?

109
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.900
Oh, right.

110
00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:36.010
Well, I called the hospital to see if I'd be able to interview him...

111
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.539
in your place,

112
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.110
but they said that he's brain-dead now.

113
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.210
Apparently, his organs will be donated to seven people today.

114
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.519
Seven people...

115
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.550
It must be him.

116
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.889
What?

117
00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:53.559
Du Hyun, I have to step out.

118
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.000
Yes, ma'am. Have a great day.

119
00:08:57.699 --> 00:08:59.559
She must think she's above me.

120
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.570
Call me right away if the suspect gets arrested.

121
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.869
I'll keep checking my phone.

122
00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:05.900
Also, please check if what I submitted this morning...

123
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.440
has been approved.

124
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440
Sure.

125
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.380
Ms. Son, are you going somewhere?

126
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.010
I have to go to the hospital to see Chan Ho.

127
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.550
Well...

128
00:09:22.719 --> 00:09:24.420
- Here, this one too. - Got it.

129
00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:27.460
It looks like her son is ill.

130
00:09:27.489 --> 00:09:29.190
Yes, it seems so.

131
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.500
It must be twice as hard as a single mother.

132
00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:43.070
Ms. Son and Mr. Lee! I'm much better now thanks to your concern.

133
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.280
I know you've been really worried...

134
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.710
Hey, welcome back.

135
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.809
Hey, you.

136
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.050
Ms. Son, wait.

137
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.849
They obviously haven't been that worried about me.

138
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.659
Ms. Son, what's the matter?

139
00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:04.230
Did something happen to Chan Ho?

140
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.469
He might get a kidney transplant today.

141
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.269
You found a donor?

142
00:10:11.469 --> 00:10:13.969
Yes, he's a brain-dead patient.

143
00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.309
I think he'll officially be pronounced brain-dead shortly.

144
00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:18.809
The doctor said Chan Ho can undergo surgery as soon as that happens.

145
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.150
It feels so surreal.

146
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.920
I can't even believe it.

147
00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:26.380
It'll go well, right?

148
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:29.090
No doubt! Of course everything will go well.

149
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.590
I don't want to worry others. You know what I mean, right?

150
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.530
I'm a very discreet person.

151
00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:39.130
If I were a big mouth,

152
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.269
everyone at our office would already know about Mr. Park...

153
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:43.230
getting facial fillers and Ms. Shin being a Buddhist.

154
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.440
Mr. Park got facial fillers?

155
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.510
Gosh, don't even get me started.

156
00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:51.110
He's addicted to minor cosmetic procedures.

157
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.110
If you look at him upclose,

158
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.309
you'll see he got work done all over.

159
00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:55.909
My goodness. And Ms. Shin is a Buddhist?

160
00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:58.280
She's very devoted.

161
00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.980
She goes to a temple regularly...

162
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.250
to do 108 prostrations. Like this.

163
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.489
My gosh. I can't believe I didn't know about these gossip until now.

164
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.500
Did that help you relax a little?

165
00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:24.239
Goodness.

166
00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:27.579
Even when you arrive at the hospital later,

167
00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:30.079
try to stay calm and relaxed like now.

168
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.650
Okay?

169
00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:34.889
Thanks.

170
00:11:39.789 --> 00:11:40.829
Good luck!

171
00:11:43.489 --> 00:11:44.659
I'll call you.

172
00:11:44.659 --> 00:11:47.400
Go, go! You got this!

173
00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.309
Best of luck.

174
00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:08.889
Gosh, where did everyone go?

175
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.730
Ms. Moon! I'm back.

176
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.760
Welcome back, Mr. Jung.

177
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.170
Why are you walking in like that?

178
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.599
You prefer seeing me from behind.

179
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.670
I'll keep walking like this in front of you from now on.

180
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.010
Okay, thank you.

181
00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:31.440
Hi, Ms. Moon.

182
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.349
Mr. Jung!

183
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.579
Are you okay now?

184
00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:38.849
Are you fully recovered?

185
00:12:38.849 --> 00:12:40.219
I hope you're not pushing yourself to be here.

186
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.789
My gosh, look at your face. You've lost so much weight.

187
00:12:42.789 --> 00:12:44.059
Your face was already tiny to begin with.

188
00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:48.789
Mr. Choi, you're the only one who's welcoming me.

189
00:12:49.489 --> 00:12:52.599
That's not true. Everyone missed you a lot.

190
00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:54.429
No, it looks like you're the only one who missed me.

191
00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:58.099
You two can catch up later. Please take care of this first.

192
00:12:58.769 --> 00:12:59.800
What is this?

193
00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:01.269
It's paperwork for an inspection.

194
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.710
The organ transplant process will begin right after the inspection,

195
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.179
so you need to take care of it immediately.

196
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.480
Where did I put that thing?

197
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.690
(Request for Organ Extraction and Transplant Authorization)

198
00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:18.519
If what I saw in my dream actually happens,

199
00:13:18.719 --> 00:13:21.989
you'll do an inspection as soon as you return to work tomorrow.

200
00:13:22.289 --> 00:13:23.489
Why are you just standing there?

201
00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:25.630
You should sign it and send it off immediately.

202
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.030
They can't begin the transplant surgery without it.

203
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.170
Mr. Choi, what should I do if this man's brain death...

204
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.500
wasn't caused by the accident?

205
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.210
What if he was beaten up by someone?

206
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.679
Gosh, then you shouldn't authorize the organ transplant.

207
00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:38.940
We'll need to do an autopsy.

208
00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:43.010
Mr. Choi, let's go to Seogu University Hospital now.

209
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.250
Pardon me? What for?

210
00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:46.989
I think I need to dig into the case a little before I authorize this.

211
00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:49.389
Oh, okay.

212
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.760
He's digging again when he just got back?

213
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:55.289
All he does is dig.

214
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.829
He probably thinks that he's a groundhog or something.

215
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.070
I forgot about it for a second.

216
00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:03.329
That's why no one is welcoming him.

217
00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:04.369
Exactly.

218
00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:14.409
It's not mine.

219
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.280
Hey, Woo Tak.

220
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.449
Where are you now?

221
00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:21.949
I'm on my way to a hospital for an inspection.

222
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.920
Hong Joo told you about my dream, right?

223
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.590
Yes, I heard about it.

224
00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:29.230
I think I just arrested the culprit of the case,

225
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.659
Professor Moon Tae Min.

226
00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:33.530
Seriously?

227
00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:37.599
And I think that I have a witness here as well.

228
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.869
He's a little kid, so his statements are inconsistent,

229
00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:42.570
but they're pretty detailed.

230
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.110
We'll be transferring this case to Hangang Police Station shortly.

231
00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:51.449
Mr. Jung, you're back.

232
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.320
Are you fully recovered now?

233
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.489
Yes.

234
00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:57.019
Tell me the details of what happened.

235
00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.760
I've been told that I'll be sent to Hangang Police Station...

236
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.090
for allegedly assaulting that little kid.

237
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.829
The assault charge isn't the problem.

238
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.630
If you go there now, they'll dig your teaching assistant's case too.

239
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.969
Didn't you say that they won't...

240
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.139
be able to perform an autopsy after the organ transplants?

241
00:15:11.739 --> 00:15:13.239
They won't be able to figure out the cause of death.

242
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.909
That means I'll be able to get out of it completely.

243
00:15:17.909 --> 00:15:20.239
When you arrive there, tell them that you must consult your lawyer,

244
00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:21.380
and don't say anything.

245
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.750
I'll take care of the rest.

246
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.489
Gosh, that man is driving me crazy.

247
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.230
Let's go to Seogu University Hospital first.

248
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.300
Yes, sir.

249
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.920
Hang in there.

250
00:16:01.219 --> 00:16:03.219
Chan Ho, you're so brave.

251
00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:06.260
Yes. If this surgery goes well,

252
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.090
you'll no longer need to come here for dialysis.

253
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.500
I'll be able to urinate like my friends do, right?

254
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.829
Of course.

255
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:16.670
You're so smart.

256
00:16:18.099 --> 00:16:21.039
Doctor and Ms. Son, may I have a word with you?

257
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.210
What's the matter?

258
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.280
It doesn't look like we can perform the surgery today.

259
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.079
Why suddenly?

260
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.909
A prosecutor just did an inspection,

261
00:16:27.909 --> 00:16:29.849
but he left without authorizing the organ extraction.

262
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.519
He said that they may need to do an autopsy.

263
00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.775
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E22 While You Were Sleeping "To Die or to be Bad"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

264
00:16:53.739 --> 00:16:54.840
Excuse me.

265
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:56.309
Yes?

266
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:59.110
Is the patient, Lee Hwan, undergoing organ procurement at the moment?

267
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.409
Who are you?

268
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.650
I'm a friend of his.

269
00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:03.920
Our professor is wondering what's going on with him.

270
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.420
A prosecutor came by earlier and inspected him,

271
00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.349
but he didn't authorize the organ extraction.

272
00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.090
He said the injury may not have been an accident.

273
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.320
He didn't authorize it?

274
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.000
Do you know who the prosecutor in charge is?

275
00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:23.800
He said his name is Jung Jae Chan.

276
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.940
He's very tall.

277
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:31.239
All right, Jae Chan. Bring it on.

278
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.309
I hope that the case goes to trial since this happened already.

279
00:17:33.309 --> 00:17:35.409
Let's have a showdown at the trial.

280
00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:43.150
Ms. Son.

281
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:46.960
Why are you back so early? What happened with the surgery?

282
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.590
They couldn't do it today.

283
00:17:50.329 --> 00:17:51.360
Why?

284
00:17:52.829 --> 00:17:54.199
I told you.

285
00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:58.440
It felt so surreal, and I couldn't even believe it.

286
00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:00.869
My hunch was right.

287
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.139
It sounds like the donor who was going to donate his kidney...

288
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.809
has to undergo an autopsy now.

289
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.750
There you are.

290
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:19.619
Mr. Park needs you two in his office.

291
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.030
He wants to see us? Why?

292
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.760
He said there's an urgent matter to discuss with you.

293
00:18:27.469 --> 00:18:29.900
(Request for Organ Extraction and Transplant Authorization)

294
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.210
I'm sorry I'm late.

295
00:18:37.639 --> 00:18:38.780
What's the matter?

296
00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:40.750
What would you like to discuss with us?

297
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:43.280
Mr. Jung complicated things for us...

298
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.920
as soon as he got back.

299
00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:46.780
Gosh, you're picking on him again.

300
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.349
He didn't complicate anything.

301
00:18:48.349 --> 00:18:50.250
It is something that we must look into.

302
00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:52.389
- Fill them in. - Yes, sir.

303
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.489
I just inspected a patient who's been pronounced brain-dead...

304
00:18:55.489 --> 00:18:56.760
at Seogu University Hospital.

305
00:18:57.659 --> 00:18:59.130
The doctors were waiting on my authorization...

306
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.000
to begin organ procurement right away.

307
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.139
Hey, what are you doing here?

308
00:19:06.139 --> 00:19:08.239
The surgery needs to be done urgently. Authorize it right away.

309
00:19:08.239 --> 00:19:09.539
I couldn't authorize it.

310
00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:10.610
Why not?

311
00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:16.510
I don't think that it was an accidental injury.

312
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.650
Then what caused it?

313
00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:24.889
Reporter Nam from SBC sent me this clip earlier.

314
00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:27.230
It's from the writer Moon Tae Min's recent book launch party.

315
00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:29.789
This teaching assistant here is the victim.

316
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.099
As you can see, he was dragged out after revolting against Mr. Moon,

317
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.530
and he was found an hour later after falling through an elevator shaft...

318
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.869
in the same building.

319
00:19:36.969 --> 00:19:39.369
I heard that happened because he got completely drunk.

320
00:19:39.369 --> 00:19:40.440
No.

321
00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:44.010
As you can see now, he was not drunk at all.

322
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.380
Compared to other guests at the party, he barely sipped his drink.

323
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.079
You're right.

324
00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:52.880
So? Are you trying to say that someone pushed him?

325
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.449
Yes.

326
00:19:55.989 --> 00:19:57.289
Have you identified a suspect?

327
00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.559
I hope this isn't just based on your speculations...

328
00:19:59.789 --> 00:20:01.260
because it'll affect many people.

329
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.400
Moon Tae Min is the prime suspect.

330
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.800
Are you sure?

331
00:20:07.829 --> 00:20:10.070
I just got a call from Sangku Division.

332
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.900
Mr. Moon got arrested for assault while following a kindergartener.

333
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.409
But that kid said he saw Mr. Moon at the site of the accident.

334
00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:19.440
I see. It does sound suspicious in many ways.

335
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.849
It looks like we need to do an autopsy.

336
00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:22.849
Mr. Park.

337
00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:24.849
We can't perform an autopsy on him now because...

338
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.019
he's still considered brain-dead.

339
00:20:26.219 --> 00:20:29.719
Cardiac death usually follows in a few days,

340
00:20:29.719 --> 00:20:30.960
so we can do it then.

341
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.659
Then his organs can't be donated.

342
00:20:33.659 --> 00:20:35.860
Are you saying we should give up the autopsy for organ donation?

343
00:20:36.329 --> 00:20:37.730
What if the culprit gets away?

344
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.630
What if the autopsy confirms that it was an accidental death?

345
00:20:40.099 --> 00:20:42.570
Seven people whose lives could've been saved will die.

346
00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:48.969
Gosh, I just don't get it.

347
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.639
There isn't even sufficient evidence. How can you go against...

348
00:20:51.639 --> 00:20:53.440
the victim's family and push ahead with the autopsy?

349
00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:56.780
The victim's family also requested an autopsy.

350
00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.679
I bet you persuaded them!

351
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.119
Hey, your achievements are more important to you...

352
00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:03.150
than seven people's lives, aren't they?

353
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.460
That's not what this is about.

354
00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.030
Mr. Lee, what is the matter with you?

355
00:21:07.289 --> 00:21:09.230
We shouldn't approach this emotionally.

356
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.960
Look, don't you know that we must figure out the cause of death...

357
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.099
through an autopsy in cases where homicide is suspected?

358
00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:16.800
Only then, we'll be able to take the suspect to court.

359
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.170
We need to have firm evidence.

360
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.309
Do you think the evidence we have now is crucial enough...

361
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.539
to sacrifice seven people's lives?

362
00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:28.480
My goodness.

363
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.780
Do you think so too?

364
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:37.460
I do think that Mr. Lee has a point.

365
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.590
It seems too risky to give up organ transplants...

366
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.659
because of the circumstantial evidence we have at the moment.

367
00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:53.710
What about you, Ms. Son?

368
00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:57.940
- Pardon me? - What do you think?

369
00:21:58.079 --> 00:22:00.480
Should we authorize the organ extraction?

370
00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:08.389
I think...

371
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.789
I...

372
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.130
I don't think that we should authorize it.

373
00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:22.699
Ms. Son.

374
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.099
The autopsy...

375
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.010
needs to be done.

376
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.139
I think that Mr. Jung...

377
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.579
made the right call.

378
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:02.769
Ms. Son, are you out of your mind?

379
00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:05.010
Don't you know what case Mr. Jung is working on now?

380
00:23:05.179 --> 00:23:07.980
That brain-dead patient was supposed to give Chan Ho his kidney.

381
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.010
I know that.

382
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.579
And you think we should do the autopsy?

383
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.320
Are you saying you'll give up on Chan Ho just to catch that culprit?

384
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.650
You know that is not what I meant.

385
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.159
No, I don't know!

386
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.760
I have no idea why you're doing this!

387
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.099
If you're going to tell me that you arrived at such a decision...

388
00:23:24.099 --> 00:23:25.500
because you're a prosecutor...

389
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.969
I didn't make the decision as a prosecutor.

390
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.539
It's my choice as a parent.

391
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:40.449
If...

392
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.880
I'm that teaching assistant's parent,

393
00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:47.489
I'll want to know why my son died.

394
00:23:48.449 --> 00:23:51.389
It'll be more important than saving the life of someone else's child.

395
00:23:54.329 --> 00:23:55.360
Hwan.

396
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.860
Tell me.

397
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.929
Who did this to you?

398
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.170
Dad will catch that person...

399
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.480
and teach him a serious lesson.

400
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.650
Tell me, son. Please?

401
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.929
Whether it's about 7 or 70 people's lives,

402
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.530
bringing justice for my son who died like that...

403
00:24:33.869 --> 00:24:36.469
will come before saving other people's lives.

404
00:24:39.239 --> 00:24:40.909
All parents would feel that way.

405
00:24:43.469 --> 00:24:44.780
That's why...

406
00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:47.510
I think that we need to do the autopsy.

407
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.880
I'm not saying it as a prosecutor.

408
00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:54.349
That's what I think...

409
00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:00.329
as a parent.

410
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.329
That brain-dead victim will be pronounced dead in less than a week.

411
00:25:43.739 --> 00:25:47.070
We can do an autopsy then. Go ahead and reject this request.

412
00:25:53.809 --> 00:25:55.349
(Request for Organ Extraction and Transplant Authorization)

413
00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:58.179
What will you choose?

414
00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:01.519
Will you save seven people's lives,

415
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.920
or will you catch that one suspect?

416
00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:17.099
What would you choose if you were me?

417
00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:19.300
If I were you,

418
00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:26.880
I wouldn't choose either of them.

419
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.289
Sir, can we do the autopsy and organ transplants...

420
00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:38.159
at the same time?

421
00:26:38.489 --> 00:26:39.590
What?

422
00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:43.190
I spoke with the organ transplant surgeon, and he said...

423
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.059
that it has been done even though such cases are very rare.

424
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:49.369
In the bridge murder case which took place in Busan in 2008,

425
00:26:49.369 --> 00:26:51.099
the autopsy and organ transplant were done simultaneously,

426
00:26:51.099 --> 00:26:52.469
and the suspect was convicted of murder.

427
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.670
The same goes for the Pyeongchang sky resort case from 2014.

428
00:26:55.769 --> 00:26:57.739
The autopsy and organ transplant were done together,

429
00:26:57.739 --> 00:26:59.510
and the suspect was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

430
00:26:59.639 --> 00:27:00.679
In addition...

431
00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:03.880
Like you said, those are such rare cases.

432
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.989
We won't be able to examine his organs if transplants are performed,

433
00:27:07.019 --> 00:27:09.090
which means it'll be very hard to figure out the cause of death.

434
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.659
Right, but those rare cases...

435
00:27:11.659 --> 00:27:13.489
share many similarities with this case.

436
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.190
The injuries on all the victims...

437
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.530
were contained in their heads and did not affect their organs.

438
00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:19.760
Also, the autopsies revealed throttling marks on their necks.

439
00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:21.429
We won't need to examine his organs.

440
00:27:21.429 --> 00:27:23.130
We should be able to determine the cause of death...

441
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.969
through just examining his neck and head.

442
00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:38.420
You can't sound uncertain about this.

443
00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:40.519
We must determine the cause of death.

444
00:27:41.949 --> 00:27:45.519
Yes, sir. I'll find out no matter what.

445
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.599
If I were you,

446
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.360
I'd save the seven people's lives...

447
00:27:53.599 --> 00:27:55.030
and also catch the culprit.

448
00:27:57.869 --> 00:27:59.199
That's my choice.

449
00:28:44.876 --> 00:28:47.076
(While You Were Sleeping)
