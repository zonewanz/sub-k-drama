1
00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:08.453
Good. Keep breathing.

2
00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:09.522
(Episode 32)

3
00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:12.893
It's prolapse of umbilical cord.

4
00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:14.493
(The umbilical cord descending before the baby)

5
00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:15.563
What?

6
00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:17.962
What? What is it? My baby...

7
00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:19.793
Is there something wrong with my baby?

8
00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:22.333
Your umbilical cord is already out. At this rate,

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.102
your baby will be in danger.

10
00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:26.802
I'll push the baby's head upward...

11
00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.903
to reduce the cord compression. It's going to hurt.

12
00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:31.442
It's okay. Breathe.

13
00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:33.712
You just need to stay calm and steady. Okay?

14
00:00:35.343 --> 00:00:37.712
1, 2, 3.

15
00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:43.453
- Oh, my goodness. - Gosh.

16
00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:45.423
She's going to be okay.

17
00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:47.453
I guess her contractions just started.

18
00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:49.093
Her due date isn't for another month.

19
00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:51.063
Oh, gosh. What do I do?

20
00:00:51.493 --> 00:00:54.862
What if something happens to both of them?

21
00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:56.203
It's a little too soon,

22
00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:59.432
but they'll be fine if we safely move your daughter to a hospital.

23
00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:01.902
Goodness, Min Kyung...

24
00:01:02.102 --> 00:01:04.673
Oh, dear. Please sit down, and have some water.

25
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:07.013
- It's going to be okay. - Oh, gosh. What should I do?

26
00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:08.343
Goodness.

27
00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:12.313
Let's try again. 1, 2, 3.

28
00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:14.112
Because of the sea fog?

29
00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:16.052
Is there any way you can come?

30
00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:18.453
Fog is more dangerous than high winds to fly a helicopter.

31
00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:20.323
Mom.

32
00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:22.063
Okay then.

33
00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:26.392
The Coast Guard can't help.

34
00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:28.862
The sea fog's too thick, and they can't send a boat or a helicopter.

35
00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.603
Nurse Yoo, go and get Nurse Pyo.

36
00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:39.472
Doctor, I can't do it.

37
00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:41.382
Let's try once more.

38
00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:43.843
1, 2, 3.

39
00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:48.153
- Try to relax. She'll be fine. - Okay.

40
00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:50.323
- Nurse Pyo! - What is it?

41
00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:52.823
- She needs you right now. - What?

42
00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:56.162
- What... - Don't get too worried yet.

43
00:01:56.162 --> 00:01:58.963
I'll go and see what's going on.

44
00:01:58.963 --> 00:02:01.332
Nurse Joo, look after her.

45
00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:02.903
- I will. - Nurse.

46
00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:05.233
Come and sit with me.

47
00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:08.472
- What's going on? - Don't worry.

48
00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:11.943
What's going on?

49
00:02:11.943 --> 00:02:13.573
What's this noise?

50
00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:16.043
It's the sound of a woman in labor.

51
00:02:16.043 --> 00:02:17.443
My goodness.

52
00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:19.312
Why did you jump?

53
00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:21.652
Don't you know how to knock?

54
00:02:21.652 --> 00:02:23.983
Why are you so flustered?

55
00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:26.693
Are you afraid they'll ask you to catch the baby?

56
00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:28.423
Will she have the baby here?

57
00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:31.693
She might have to if the umbilical cord's prolapsed.

58
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.862
Are we letting people have babies on board now?

59
00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.503
Mom...

60
00:02:39.503 --> 00:02:40.832
A prolapsed umbilical cord?

61
00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:46.872
- Then... - She needs surgery right away.

62
00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:49.212
- But as you know... - You're an internalist.

63
00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:52.682
You're a surgeon. Do you have any experience?

64
00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:56.622
I only watched as an intern. I've never done it myself.

65
00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:06.693
It's serious, but we need to take some time out.

66
00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:09.663
We need time to decide what's best for the patient...

67
00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:10.902
and her baby.

68
00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:17.342
Nurse Pyo.

69
00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:20.513
You assisted in an OBGYN OR for three years.

70
00:03:20.872 --> 00:03:21.883
Yes.

71
00:03:22.443 --> 00:03:25.413
Then you must know what must be done.

72
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:26.582
I do.

73
00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:30.082
Mom.

74
00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:36.622
(Surgery)

75
00:03:36.622 --> 00:03:38.663
Ever taken part in a childbirth?

76
00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:40.133
Twice as an intern.

77
00:03:40.962 --> 00:03:44.003
I didn't because I'd decided on surgery very early on.

78
00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:46.272
The field tour was just a formality.

79
00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:49.173
Still, you know it has to be us.

80
00:03:49.802 --> 00:03:51.272
This is insane.

81
00:03:51.943 --> 00:03:55.312
I only know what I was taught in medical school and saw once.

82
00:03:55.312 --> 00:03:56.742
The baby needs to come out.

83
00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:59.283
If we wait too long, it'll run out of oxygen...

84
00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:00.652
And die.

85
00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:04.723
We can prevent that. Let's stick to the manual.

86
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.022
If need be, we'll call Jeil Hospital's specialist.

87
00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:12.263
We should talk with the patient's mother first.

88
00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:14.932
I'll prep the patient.

89
00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:27.572
- An operation? - Yes.

90
00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:29.882
Here, you mean?

91
00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:32.213
I'm sorry, but yes.

92
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.112
Will she be okay?

93
00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:36.583
Can't we do it on the mainland?

94
00:04:37.182 --> 00:04:39.752
I wish we could, but...

95
00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:42.192
the circumstances aren't helping.

96
00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:45.862
The Coast Guard can't come over in the thick fog,

97
00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:48.302
and even if they could, your daughter...

98
00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:51.333
might not be able to go.

99
00:04:52.572 --> 00:04:54.132
Is it that serious?

100
00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:56.242
The umbilical cord has fallen out.

101
00:04:56.242 --> 00:04:58.612
What does that mean?

102
00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:02.112
If the baby's oxygen supply is cut off,

103
00:05:02.112 --> 00:05:04.952
the worst case scenario would be a stillbirth.

104
00:05:04.952 --> 00:05:08.783
What? A stillbirth?

105
00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:12.353
Oh no. What are you hesitating for?

106
00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:14.893
Go and do the surgery right now.

107
00:05:14.893 --> 00:05:16.093
The problem is...

108
00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:18.132
There's another problem?

109
00:05:18.132 --> 00:05:21.302
I'm a surgeon, not an OBGYN specialist.

110
00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:23.603
- So... - So what?

111
00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:25.802
I have never performed a cesarean before.

112
00:05:25.802 --> 00:05:27.733
Not even once.

113
00:05:28.302 --> 00:05:30.072
This is your first time?

114
00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:35.312
Will you still entrust me with your daughter's life?

115
00:05:35.983 --> 00:05:37.213
Oh dear.

116
00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:40.413
I can't operate without your permission.

117
00:05:41.283 --> 00:05:42.452
What should I do?

118
00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:45.322
Why even ask? The baby might die. Let her do it.

119
00:05:45.322 --> 00:05:47.153
Stay out of it, Nurse Joo.

120
00:05:47.523 --> 00:05:49.923
You shouldn't give your opinion.

121
00:05:49.923 --> 00:05:53.893
The guardian must make the decision carefully.

122
00:05:53.893 --> 00:05:54.903
Right.

123
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:58.502
What should I do?

124
00:05:58.502 --> 00:05:59.903
What will you do?

125
00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:04.143
Will you let me operate?

126
00:06:04.143 --> 00:06:05.143
Yes.

127
00:06:13.252 --> 00:06:14.983
Please do it.

128
00:06:16.483 --> 00:06:19.692
My daughter and grandchild.

129
00:06:20.992 --> 00:06:23.163
Please save them.

130
00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.333
I will do my best.

131
00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:38.372
Joon Young, monitor the patient.

132
00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:41.213
- You're the circulating nurse. - Okay, doctor.

133
00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:42.612
(Circulating nurses assist)

134
00:06:42.942 --> 00:06:45.182
Do I have to help this time?

135
00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:47.182
I'm a bit scared.

136
00:06:47.182 --> 00:06:49.583
- Hey. - Get going.

137
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:52.552
- Go, right now. - Darn it.

138
00:06:53.692 --> 00:06:54.793
Kwak.

139
00:06:55.523 --> 00:06:58.362
Is it true she's only in her 36th week?

140
00:06:58.463 --> 00:07:00.262
Yes, why?

141
00:07:01.663 --> 00:07:05.072
Get things started. I'll sort out the rest from here.

142
00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:25.223
(Doctor Kang Dong Joon)

143
00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:27.963
Doctor, it's Doctor Kang from Jeil Hospital.

144
00:07:27.963 --> 00:07:29.223
Put him on speaker.

145
00:07:33.663 --> 00:07:35.562
Doctor Song, it's me.

146
00:07:35.562 --> 00:07:39.132
None of the OBGYN doctors are available. They're all busy.

147
00:07:39.473 --> 00:07:41.872
I'll get someone on the line as soon as possible,

148
00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:43.702
so start operating first.

149
00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:51.512
Scalpel.

150
00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:57.182
Cut from below the navel to the pubis.

151
00:07:57.182 --> 00:07:58.353
Okay?

152
00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:09.432
An incubator...

153
00:08:09.762 --> 00:08:12.903
A blanket would be better than a box.

154
00:08:13.372 --> 00:08:14.572
Let's see.

155
00:08:15.673 --> 00:08:17.043
What should we do?

156
00:08:18.312 --> 00:08:21.012
That's it. Why didn't I think of that?

157
00:08:40.732 --> 00:08:42.903
I just washed this after a year.

158
00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:45.773
Kid.

159
00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:49.003
You made me wash it to save your life.

160
00:08:55.812 --> 00:08:59.552
What's all this? Why is it all splayed out?

161
00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:02.052
Why are you cutting your clothes?

162
00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:05.692
Can you get me a pouch and some suturing thread?

163
00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:07.993
What for? Are you going to operate too?

164
00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:09.423
Would I?

165
00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:11.462
Then why do you need a pouch and suturing thread?

166
00:09:11.462 --> 00:09:14.493
The mother is only 36 weeks into her pregnancy.

167
00:09:14.962 --> 00:09:18.403
It's very likely that her baby is premature.

168
00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:20.003
Where would we put it?

169
00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:23.702
I don't know. I didn't think that far. Where would we put it?

170
00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:25.113
In an incubator.

171
00:09:25.113 --> 00:09:27.982
- We don't have one on board. - I'm making one.

172
00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:30.783
You're making an incubator? With this?

173
00:09:30.783 --> 00:09:32.852
Yes. Get what I asked for.

174
00:09:40.623 --> 00:09:42.363
I cut through the peritoneum.

175
00:09:47.393 --> 00:09:50.302
Next, push the bladder downward.

176
00:09:52.972 --> 00:09:55.003
There. Do you see the womb?

177
00:09:56.102 --> 00:09:58.972
Make a horizontal cut and take the baby out.

178
00:10:01.513 --> 00:10:02.643
Scalpel.

179
00:10:13.253 --> 00:10:15.793
Put your hand in and take the baby out.

180
00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:24.602
Do you feel it?

181
00:10:48.423 --> 00:10:50.062
Oh dear...

182
00:10:52.592 --> 00:10:56.562
What happened? Is the baby out?

183
00:10:56.562 --> 00:10:59.003
Yes. It's a beautiful girl.

184
00:11:01.403 --> 00:11:05.712
Why don't I hear it crying?

185
00:11:06.212 --> 00:11:07.413
That's because...

186
00:11:16.352 --> 00:11:20.192
They're suctioning out the substance in her airway.

187
00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:22.462
That will clear the airways and...

188
00:11:25.962 --> 00:11:27.232
That sound...

189
00:11:27.332 --> 00:11:30.102
She's crying. That means she can breathe on her own.

190
00:11:32.302 --> 00:11:35.143
Does that mean everything's okay?

191
00:11:35.873 --> 00:11:38.212
We can't relax just yet.

192
00:11:38.373 --> 00:11:40.442
The baby was born early...

193
00:11:40.442 --> 00:11:43.143
and doesn't even weigh 2kg.

194
00:11:43.143 --> 00:11:44.852
You need an incubator.

195
00:11:45.753 --> 00:11:47.082
Like this?

196
00:11:47.783 --> 00:11:48.923
Doctor Kim.

197
00:11:53.893 --> 00:11:57.023
She's weak, but can breathe on her own.

198
00:11:57.322 --> 00:12:01.363
The incubator's most important role...

199
00:12:01.503 --> 00:12:03.003
is to keep her warm.

200
00:12:03.702 --> 00:12:07.202
If we wrap her up nicely with this,

201
00:12:07.503 --> 00:12:09.572
it'll help keep her warm.

202
00:12:20.852 --> 00:12:23.852
Doctor Kim, you made this yourself?

203
00:12:24.283 --> 00:12:27.153
He did. I thought he was MacGyver.

204
00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:29.663
You scored.

205
00:12:31.023 --> 00:12:32.663
This is nothing.

206
00:12:34.903 --> 00:12:35.962
Nurse?

207
00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:39.503
Thank you.

208
00:12:49.942 --> 00:12:51.312
She can breathe,

209
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:54.253
but if we give her a supply of oxygen,

210
00:12:55.653 --> 00:12:57.082
it would help, right?

211
00:12:57.253 --> 00:12:58.852
Where did you find that?

212
00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:01.293
Nurse Joo found it.

213
00:13:02.062 --> 00:13:04.263
It wasn't that difficult.

214
00:13:06.493 --> 00:13:08.462
This is one lucky baby.

215
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:11.472
We happened to have a sample.

216
00:13:12.232 --> 00:13:13.332
We did.

217
00:13:19.113 --> 00:13:20.842
Where's Doctor Cha?

218
00:13:32.322 --> 00:13:33.493
Doctor Cha.

219
00:13:39.692 --> 00:13:41.932
The fog cleared up.

220
00:13:43.302 --> 00:13:46.472
What were you doing out here?

221
00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:53.442
Were you crying again?

222
00:13:56.743 --> 00:14:00.283
I won't be able to see my future wife give birth.

223
00:14:00.812 --> 00:14:02.722
I should tell her not to have kids.

224
00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:05.993
You overreact to the point where it's a disease.

225
00:14:06.552 --> 00:14:09.893
Why worry about a wife when you don't even have a girlfriend?

226
00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:15.133
Let's drink.

227
00:14:16.062 --> 00:14:17.302
To what?

228
00:14:17.663 --> 00:14:22.202
To your incredibly brave future wife.

229
00:14:22.842 --> 00:14:25.942
How do you know if my future wife will be brave?

230
00:14:26.913 --> 00:14:29.442
Brave women are like that.

231
00:14:30.283 --> 00:14:33.413
They're attracted to men who need protecting.

232
00:14:35.253 --> 00:14:36.523
- Are they? - Yes.

233
00:14:36.852 --> 00:14:40.153
So stop crying and drink up.

234
00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:44.293
Sure. Cheers.

235
00:14:44.462 --> 00:14:45.562
Cheers.

236

Are you awake?

00:15:19.393 --> 00:15:21.932
Where am I?

239
00:15:21.932 --> 00:15:23.562
In an ambulance.

240
00:15:25.932 --> 00:15:29.643
The baby you're holding. Is it mine?

241
00:15:31.773 --> 00:15:33.543
Can I hold her?

242
00:15:34.243 --> 00:15:35.442
Of course you can.

243
00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:37.513
Doctor Song.

244
00:15:40.952 --> 00:15:42.822
Get up slowly.

245
00:15:44.623 --> 00:15:45.722
Here you go.

246
00:15:50.893 --> 00:15:52.633
You're really small.

247
00:15:54.363 --> 00:15:55.732
Because of me,

248
00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:00.403
you were born before you could grow.

249
00:16:01.743 --> 00:16:02.873
Sorry.

250
00:16:03.472 --> 00:16:06.413
For giving birth a month too soon.

251
00:16:07.982 --> 00:16:10.913
I'm sorry I couldn't keep you for longer.

252
00:16:12.613 --> 00:16:14.352
I'm so sorry,

253
00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:20.493
but it's good to see you.

254
00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:24.592
Hello, baby.

255
00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:32.003
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

256
00:16:41.283 --> 00:16:42.312
What happened?

257
00:16:42.312 --> 00:16:44.753
The mother and baby are both healthy.

258
00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:47.113
Well done.

259
00:16:47.682 --> 00:16:49.153
You'd finished before I could...

260
00:16:49.153 --> 00:16:50.982
get a doctor on the phone.

261
00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:54.192
I thought that meant bad news.

262
00:16:56.263 --> 00:16:58.763
You pulled off an OBGYN operation.

263
00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:02.663
You might end up becoming a true all-round player.

264
00:17:02.663 --> 00:17:04.033
It's not a good thing.

265
00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:07.903
I want to pray every day so these things don't happen.

266
00:17:07.903 --> 00:17:09.742
I feel the same,

267
00:17:09.742 --> 00:17:12.942
but whatever deity is in charge isn't listening.

268
00:17:12.942 --> 00:17:14.843
Things keep happening.

269
00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:18.282
Well done, both of you.

270
00:17:19.653 --> 00:17:22.583
You two should go and get drunk.

271
00:17:22.883 --> 00:17:24.153
I'll take the night shift...

272
00:17:24.153 --> 00:17:26.623
instead of paying for the drinks.

273
00:17:27.123 --> 00:17:28.192
Bye.

274
00:17:45.113 --> 00:17:46.173
Doctor Song.

275
00:17:55.423 --> 00:17:57.952
Is there a bump here?

276
00:18:03.623 --> 00:18:05.432
You turn the wrong way...

277
00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:08.603
and then trip up on perfectly level paved ground?

278
00:18:09.202 --> 00:18:11.532
Can I trust you?

279
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:13.932
Are you sure you can...

280
00:18:14.032 --> 00:18:16.272
decide where to go this Saturday?

281
00:18:17.403 --> 00:18:19.772
Will you take me to some weird place?

282
00:18:20.442 --> 00:18:23.313
No. That will never happen.

283
00:18:29.383 --> 00:18:32.292
I was so moved.

284
00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:34.762
- Someone cried. - Who?

285
00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:36.492
Who do you think?

286
00:18:36.492 --> 00:18:38.462
- Really? - Did you?

287
00:18:39.563 --> 00:18:42.403
I still can't forget it.

288
00:18:42.403 --> 00:18:45.133
When I saw the baby's head come out...

289
00:18:45.232 --> 00:18:49.772
Exactly. The moment of a birth. That emotional second.

290
00:18:50.502 --> 00:18:53.413
I was more moved by your incredible...

291
00:18:53.413 --> 00:18:54.982
improvement, Nurse Yoo.

292
00:18:55.913 --> 00:18:57.212
Stop it.

293
00:18:58.053 --> 00:18:59.353
It's true.

294
00:18:59.782 --> 00:19:02.022
What if Mr. Chu hadn't brought Doctor Song?

295
00:19:02.022 --> 00:19:04.623
- Even today... - Stop it.

296
00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:07.093
I don't want to think about it.

297
00:19:07.752 --> 00:19:10.462
You're really easily scared.

298
00:19:11.232 --> 00:19:13.292
- Don't cry. - Let's have a toast.

299
00:19:15.932 --> 00:19:18.303
I'm here too, you know.

300
00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:20.373
You left out your own captain.

301
00:19:27.012 --> 00:19:28.942
Oh dear.

302
00:19:29.282 --> 00:19:32.083
Everyone's so encouraged.

303
00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:35.583
How can I tell them we have to let her go?

304
00:19:37.022 --> 00:19:38.623
Give it some time.

305
00:19:39.992 --> 00:19:42.093
I'll figure out a way.

306
00:19:43.063 --> 00:19:46.633
Has Doctor Song gone somewhere?

307
00:19:46.762 --> 00:19:49.563
I haven't seen her all evening.

308
00:19:52.032 --> 00:19:54.472
- Do you think... - Think what?

309
00:19:55.643 --> 00:19:58.113
Did she hear something at the office?

310
00:19:58.512 --> 00:20:00.813
Do you think she already knows?

311

How is it going?

318
00:20:42.182 --> 00:20:43.383
Not easy, is it?

319
00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:46.093
What's this?

320
00:20:46.423 --> 00:20:49.363
Stop working on it alone and bring it downstairs.

321
00:20:49.363 --> 00:20:50.692
I'll help you.

323
00:21:02.942 --> 00:21:04.472
How did he do this?

324
00:21:11.113 --> 00:21:13.553
He used this function.

325
00:21:27.663 --> 00:21:29.732
(Don't bother me.)

326
00:22:10.373 --> 00:22:11.442
Bring it on.

327
00:22:12.012 --> 00:22:13.042
I can't yet.

328
00:22:13.472 --> 00:22:14.982
I came for a light exercise.

329
00:22:14.982 --> 00:22:16.682
Then I'll definitely win.

330
00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:19.712
Do you really want to play?

331
00:22:20.252 --> 00:22:21.323
Yes.

332
00:22:22.682 --> 00:22:24.992
I won't play fair anymore.

333
00:22:29.192 --> 00:22:30.192
Okay.

334
00:22:30.563 --> 00:22:31.563
Let's not.

335
00:23:09.462 --> 00:23:10.563
You're insane.

336
00:23:11.202 --> 00:23:14.073
You played too hard. What if your stitches get undone?

337
00:23:15.242 --> 00:23:16.903
You played hard too.

338
00:23:18.173 --> 00:23:21.173
Otherwise, it won't be fun to play with me.

339
00:23:21.782 --> 00:23:24.982
Do you know that you're a good man?

340
00:23:27.613 --> 00:23:28.982
What's gotten into you?

341
00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:31.722
That's what makes you...

342
00:23:35.363 --> 00:23:36.663
worse.

343
00:23:54.883 --> 00:23:55.982
I'm leaving.

344
00:24:04.083 --> 00:24:05.192
A good man.

345
00:24:06.952 --> 00:24:09.492
Even from a man's perspective, he's a good man.

346
00:24:11.932 --> 00:24:14.903
He took away the woman I loved for the first time,

347
00:24:16.002 --> 00:24:17.762
but I can't hate him.

348
00:24:20.702 --> 00:24:21.772
Punk.

349
00:24:37.323 --> 00:24:39.952
We arrive at the restaurant at 11:30am.

350
00:24:42.962 --> 00:24:45.163
The best dish at this restaurant is steak.

351
00:24:45.163 --> 00:24:46.893
Its rating is five stars.

352
00:24:57.403 --> 00:24:58.972
Its rating was five stars.

353
00:25:05.982 --> 00:25:07.053
Try it.

354
00:25:07.653 --> 00:25:09.053
It doesn't taste so bad.

355
00:25:25.472 --> 00:25:28.272
The steak was a failure, but I'm certain about the movie.

356
00:25:28.403 --> 00:25:31.272
The audience and critique both rated it a nine.

357
00:25:35.613 --> 00:25:38.952
I recognized it in him right off the bat.

358
00:25:38.952 --> 00:25:41.222
He was different from the get-go.

359
00:25:41.222 --> 00:25:43.522
His face practically glowed.

360
00:25:44.522 --> 00:25:46.053
That's so impressive.

361
00:25:46.053 --> 00:25:47.692
You're right.

362
00:25:49.893 --> 00:25:50.893
By the way,

363
00:25:51.563 --> 00:25:53.292
can you help me?

364
00:25:57.932 --> 00:25:58.972
You're right.

365
00:25:59.502 --> 00:26:00.603
The movie is okay.

366
00:26:13.982 --> 00:26:15.323
- Wait. - Yes, sir.

367
00:26:15.653 --> 00:26:17.423
The old man should pay for the meal.

368
00:26:17.923 --> 00:26:19.792
Me? Goodness.

369
00:26:19.792 --> 00:26:21.522
Why should I pay?

370
00:26:24.732 --> 00:26:26.363
Did you enjoy the movie?

371
00:26:27.663 --> 00:26:29.232
It was very moving.

372
00:26:30.663 --> 00:26:32.932
Next is a dolphin show.

373
00:26:36.573 --> 00:26:37.573
What's wrong?

374
00:26:37.772 --> 00:26:39.012
I'm not wrong.

375
00:26:39.242 --> 00:26:42.313
This is the way to the dolphin show.

376
00:26:59.363 --> 00:27:00.732
Have you seen the sky like that?

377
00:27:03.462 --> 00:27:04.502
No.

378
00:27:06.772 --> 00:27:09.073
I didn't realize that the sky was there.

379
00:27:12.843 --> 00:27:13.843
That's why...

380
00:27:14.982 --> 00:27:16.512
you shouldn't work so hard.

381
00:27:20.313 --> 00:27:22.883
Don't push yourself too hard.

382
00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:32.833
I hope that...

383
00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:38.073
At least when you're with me...

384
00:27:41.403 --> 00:27:42.403
I hope that...

385
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:47.173
you'll be relaxed...

386
00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:49.512
and at ease.

387
00:28:23.012 --> 00:28:24.012
Like now.
