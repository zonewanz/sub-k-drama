00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.820
(Episode 25)

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.190
That moment felt like a gift.

3
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.020
I was thankful for all the choices I've made...

4
00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.690
because they brought this moment to me.

5
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.130
The choices that seemed foolish at the time...

6
00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.829
were actually wise decisions.

7
00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.600
Even all the choices that I regretted...

8
00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.470
eventually proved to be right.

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.780
Everything made my heart flutter...

10
00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.610
and looked so lovely.

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.619
I was relieved...

12
00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.819
about everything.

13
00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:51.160
But there was one thing.

14
00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:53.990
Would he be doing well?

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.000
What?

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.000
You know, the man we met at the lake.

17
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.869
That police officer. He tried to take his own life.

18
00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.569
I've thought about him once in a while. I worry about him too.

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.679
Don't worry. He's doing well.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.380
Really? How do you know?

21
00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:13.780
Where does he live?

22
00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:18.789
That man sent us money again.

23
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.259
I neither know where he lives...

24
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.860
nor what his name is,

25
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.899
but I know that he's alive.

26
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440
So, you don't need to worry.

27
00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:41.739
I'm relieved. That's all I needed to know.

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.039
As long as he's alive.

29
00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.720
"Even if life deceives you,"

30
00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.750
"don't be sad or angry."

31
00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.160
"Your heart lives in the future."

32
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.789
"The present is always sad."

33
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.799
"Everything is momentary and will pass."

34
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.100
"And what passes..."

35
00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.299
"will become precious in the future."

36
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.799
My, they're such wise words.

37
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.840
My gosh, you totally startled me.

38
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.109
Hey, I'm hungry.

39
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.780
I want to eat something.

40
00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.250
Okay, I'll bring you food right away.

41
00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.419
Hey, you're not thinking of doing something crazy, right?

42
00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.819
I won't go anywhere.

43
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.930
I won't do anything crazy either.

44
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.799
My life...

45
00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.269
shouldn't end now.

46
00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.440
There's someone...

47
00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.780
I must meet later on in life.

48
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.449
Will we be able to recognize each other if we meet again?

49
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.150
I mean, we didn't recognize each other either.

50
00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.090
Wouldn't it be the same with him?

51
00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.060
I know, right?

52
00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.259
It's possible that we crossed paths but didn't recognize each other.

53
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.600
Why do you ask? Do you want to meet him?

54
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.970
Yes. What about you?

55
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.370
I do too.

56
00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.169
But do you think that he'll want to meet us as well?

57
00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.139
I'm not sure.

58
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.700
When we met him again later on, he said...

59
00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.999
that he had thought about us and missed us a lot more...

60
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.570
and that he had wanted...

61
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.239
to meet us again more desperately.

62
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.179
When he came to meet us after many twists and turns in life,

63
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.580
we couldn't recognize him for a pretty long time.

64
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.840
And like little waves,

65
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.809
small incidents that were scattered...

66
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.350
started coming together one by one and stepping towards us.

67
00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:39.049
Merging into high waves,

68
00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:44.559
they began...

69
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.330
guiding us towards  him.

70
00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.280
(Episode 25: We're on Our Way to Meet You Now)

71
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:15.989
Will there be no funeral?

72
00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:18.390
There's no one to come anyway.

73
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.460
You look hideous in that suit.

74
00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.270
I don't have anything black, so I threw on my brother's suit.

75
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.799
His limbs are unnecessarily long.

76
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.140
Yes, they are unnecessarily long indeed.

77
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.910
You've seen my brother?

78
00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.379
I've been to one of his trials.

79
00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:41.679
Seriously?

80
00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.419
Yes.

81
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.390
He compared justice to river...

82
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.090
and totally beat the opposing counsel.

83
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.890
It was so gratifying to watch.

84
00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:51.660
I felt thankful too.

85
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.600
Thankful? What for?

86
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.729
The opposing counsel...

87
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.299
was the person who did this to my dad.

88
00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:06.470
Who is it?

89
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.439
Prosecutor Lee Yu Beom.

90
00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:12.609
No.

91
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.119
He's a lawyer now.

92
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.059
(Passbook)

93
00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:36.999
It's not like you'll have more money if you put that in again.

94
00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:39.109
- Oh, hello. - Lawyer Lee.

95
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.479
Why does my account balance look like this when I got paid today?

96
00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.510
It's because it feels like forever to wait for the next payday,

97
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.410
but your money goes out at the speed of light.

98
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.410
Exactly.

99
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.220
Both of you should come work at my firm.

100
00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:54.150
I'll make sure the waiting doesn't feel like forever.

101
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.289
Are you serious?

102
00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.160
Tell me your expected salary range, and we'll negotiate.

103
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.789
Your position will be guaranteed until retirement,

104
00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.189
and you'll get to leave right on time every day.

105
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.330
I'd love that. I'd really love to work at your firm.

106
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.499
What about you, Mr. Choi?

107
00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:08.470
I already told you how I feel about it.

108
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.900
I'm not interested.

109
00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:13.239
I... I'm interested. I'm very interested.

110
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.739
For you, there's one condition.

111
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.840
You must persuade Mr. Choi and come with him.

112
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.580
I'll be waiting for you, Mr. Choi.

113
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.950
What kind of condition is that?

114
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.520
Am I just an extra?

115
00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.489
A freebie? Is this a buy-1-get-1-free deal?

116
00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:32.559
Ms. Moon.

117
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.160
Let's not tell Mr. Jung about what Lawyer Lee said to us.

118
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.330
Don't tell anyone else either.

119
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.770
I'm really disappointed in you.

120
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.140
Do I look like the type to spread such a thing?

121
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.140
Don't you know me?

122
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.510
Are you saying Yu Beom is trying to recruit Mr. Choi?

123
00:07:50.739 --> 00:07:53.780
Yes. He said he'd work around Mr. Choi's expected salary range.

124
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.820
He's trying so hard to lure him.

125
00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:58.889
Gosh, Mr. Choi has a strong sense of duty.

126
00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.149
There's no way that offer will...

127
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:02.019
There is. There is a thing called the right answer.

128
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.759
His position will be guaranteed until retirement,

129
00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.859
and he'll get his own south-facing office.

130
00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:07.430
He'll even get a company credit card.

131
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.830
Anyone in their right mind...

132
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.129
will submit a letter of resignation right away.

133
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.029
I know that he'd much rather work with me than work with Yu Beom...

134
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:16.769
No, he doesn't. You frustrate us because you're so slow.

135
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:18.710
All you do is dig like a groundhog.

136
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.369
You make him pull all-nighters and drag him out to sites.

137
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.139
My eyes are about to well up with tears because I feel so bad for him.

138
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.550
So what do you want me to do? Why are you telling me this anyway?

139
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.379
Be good to him before you lose him.

140
00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:32.190
Flatter him here and there and try to charm him.

141
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.649
Give him some gifts too.

142
00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:37.190
Gosh, forget it. If I have to force him to stay,

143
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.729
I don't want him to stay.

144
00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:40.460
I'm off.

145
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.930
That didn't work.

146
00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:56.979
Gosh, why is this box empty? Goodness.

147
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.680
Thank you.

148
00:09:05.249 --> 00:09:06.920
Ms. Moon told me everything.

149
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.190
I heard Yu Beom gave you an offer for a position.

150
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:12.190
Ms. Moon, I can't believe you told him already.

151
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.830
Mr. Jung, how can you tell him right away?

152
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.200
I think you should work at his firm if what he's offering is better.

153
00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:18.970
Oh, okay.

154
00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:21.570
Hold on a second.

155
00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:22.899
Sorry?

156
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:26.170
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

157
00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:28.540
- Gosh, I can... - Just stay still.

158
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.009
I don't want to force you to stay,

159
00:09:31.109 --> 00:09:34.509
and I can't promise you that I'll be better to you...

160
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.450
just to sugarcoat things.

161
00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:43.119
You're the one who will be making the choice after all.

162
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.590
I won't resent you even if you decide to leave.

163
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.430
What?

164
00:09:50.229 --> 00:09:51.259
Let's make a V.

165
00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:04.379
Please don't worry about me, and don't feel pressured to stay.

166
00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:06.009
Take your time with the decision.

167
00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:09.019
Okay.

168
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.229
(With my mentor)

169
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.529
(Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan)

170
00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:25.330
We really need to get started on the "Three-day Experience" story.

171
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.470
Things like deep-sea fishing...

172
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.570
or working at a grape farm are nothing new.

173
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.769
Let's try something more original.

174
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.210
How about experiencing pregnancy for three days?

175
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.210
The shape of what I'm wearing now is exactly the same...

176
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.779
as the body shape in the eighth month of pregnancy.

177
00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:42.450
We can wear this for three days and do day-to-day things...

178
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.519
like riding the subway to experience what it's like to be pregnant.

179
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.920
We'll be able to learn what society can do for pregnant women.

180
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.460
Okay, let's keep that idea. Anything else?

181
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.759
Well, what do you think about three days at the prosecution?

182
00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:56.259
We rarely get an opportunity to peek into prosecutors' daily lives.

183
00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.869
It's a good idea, but it's not doable.

184
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.529
They'll never give us permission to do that.

185
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.399
For confidentiality reasons and to protect suspects' human rights,

186
00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:05.810
they won't let us shoot. They'll list all sorts of reasons.

187
00:11:05.869 --> 00:11:06.909
They'll give us permission.

188
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.479
The district attorney of the Hangang office is media-friendly, you know.

189
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:11.639
I actually met him when he had tea with reporters recently.

190
00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:14.609
I explained the objectives, and he seemed pretty positive about it.

191
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.550
You should've said that first.

192
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.920
Then let's keep that one too.

193
00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:22.259
Du Hyun, don't you think it'll be more meaningful for a guy...

194
00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:24.119
to experience what it's like to be pregnant?

195
00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:26.930
Yes. Men have no idea what it's like,

196
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.359
so it'll more meaningful that way.

197
00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:32.170
Okay. Then you should spend three days at the prosecution, Hong Joo.

198
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:35.300
Du Hyun, you'll need to experience pregnancy.

199
00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:36.670
Sure. Pardon me?

200
00:11:37.499 --> 00:11:38.670
Why me?

201
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.340
What about all the underlings here?

202
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.109
You just said it yourself...

203
00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:43.509
it'll be more meaningful if a guy does it.

204
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.180
The one who understands it the best should do it. In other words, you.

205
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.450
Captain!

206
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.259
Du Hyun, you look so cool.

207
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.320
Du Hyun, you're my role model.

208
00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.590
Too bad.

209
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.330
You'll be named Reporter of the Year again.

210
00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:07.430
I'm in trouble. Spending three days at the prosecution will be so tough.

211
00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:09.970
Hey! The prosecution is...

212
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.540
Pregnant women have it much harder!

213
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:15.009
My, look at you. Du Hyun, you sure understand...

214
00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:17.580
the difficulties pregnant women face better than anyone else does.

215
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.249
I'll be so looking forward to your story.

216
00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.580
Give him a round of applause!

217
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.609
Best of luck!

218
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.320
May you be blessed.

219
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.649
May you be blessed.

220
00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.090
- I admire you! - All of you have gone crazy.

221
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.859
- It suits you! - Go for it!

222
00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:41.840
Mr. Choi, can you please not accept Yu Beom's offer?

223
00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:49.139
That sounds awkward.

224
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.450
Don't leave.

225
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.779
Will that sound too brazen?

226
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.590
"Please don't leave." Is that better?

227
00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:04.320
"Don't go to..."

228
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.330
Jae Chan.

229
00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:06.529
What's up?

230
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.729
Don't go to Yu Beom.

231
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.070
Gosh! I'm in trouble.

232
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.070
Hey, I touched the send button by mistake because of you!

233
00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:17.470
What? What did I do?

234
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.509
Gosh, I was rude in the text I just sent to Mr. Choi. What should I do?

235
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.479
Check it.

236
00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:26.050
I won't go.

237
00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:27.580
Nice, he said he won't go.

238
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.320
He won't go! He won't leave me.

239
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.220
I love you, Mr. Choi.

240
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:35.420
Jae Chan.

241
00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:41.690
What? What is it?

242
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.639
Why is Dae Gu even entrusting you with this?

243
00:13:52.909 --> 00:13:53.909
What is it?

244
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.340
I have a friend named Myung Dae Gu.

245
00:13:57.779 --> 00:13:59.479
He wants you to take a look at it.

246
00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:01.080
Myung Dae Gu?

247
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.920
This looks like someone's last will.

248
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.649
Yes. You know the serial killer who took his own life in jail, right?

249
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:07.850
That's his will.

250
00:14:08.989 --> 00:14:10.359
Why do you have this?

251
00:14:10.359 --> 00:14:11.989
He's Dae Gu's father.

252
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:14.989
He wants you to read through it.

253
00:14:14.989 --> 00:14:16.460
Me? Why?

254
00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:19.070
He thinks that his father died an extremely unfair death.

255
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.499
He's hoping you can clear his name.

256
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.269
Hey, who thinks being locked up in jail is fair?

257
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:24.340
Everyone thinks it's unfair.

258
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.609
But still, you should read it.

259
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.109
I've read it, and it doesn't seem right.

260
00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:31.109
And something else gives me a bad feeling.

261
00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:33.879
Yu Beom was the prosecutor in charge of the case.

262
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.420
This case even earned him an award from the Public Prosecutor General.

263
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.060
(My job was to save people, but I became a man who kills them.)

264
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.060
(There is no way for me to prove my innocence.)

265
00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:54.330
(June 16, 2016, Sincerely, Myung Yi Suk)

266
00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.570
The work I did...

267
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.909
for the corruption scandal and the serial murder case earned me...

268
00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:00.670
an award from the Public Prosecutor General.

269
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.239
All I did was put down a spoon on a table...

270
00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:06.080
that was already set by Mr. Choi, but I even got an award.

271
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.180
Gosh, that's not true.

272
00:15:34.909 --> 00:15:36.009
Shall we raid him now?

273
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.340
No, later.

274
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.749
Let's raid him and the dealer together when they meet up.

275
00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:11.879
(Power off)

276
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.590
(Please return my phone. I will pay you.)

277
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.460
(I'll give you 5,000 dollars. I won't report you to the police.)

278
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.600
(I'll give you 10,000 dollars. 1pm tomorrow at Chungil Underpass.)

279
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:38.770
10,000 dollars?

280
00:16:41.409 --> 00:16:44.340
What's in this phone? Why is this person willing to pay that much?

281
00:16:54.364 --> 00:16:57.596
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E25 While You Were Sleeping

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

282
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.300
Got you.

283
00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:12.639
Jae Chan.

284
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.399
You think that police officer may have dreams about us too?

285
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.709
Yes. Woo Tak and I have talked about how our dreams may have begun.

286
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.439
According to that rule,

287
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.080
he must be having dreams about us too.

288
00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:51.679
Rule? What rule?

289
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.909
The person who saved us in a life-or-death situation.

290
00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.480
I think we're having dreams about that person.

291
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.719
I mainly have dreams about Jae Chan,

292
00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.719
whereas he usually sees Hong Joo in his dreams.

293
00:18:00.219 --> 00:18:01.219
Could that be true?

294
00:18:01.219 --> 00:18:03.320
When I first heard his theory, I also thought it was nonsense,

295
00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:05.330
since I had no idea that you were Chestnut.

296
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.090
But it makes sense now because you're Chestnut.

297
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.959
You saved my life 13 years ago at the lake,

298
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.000
and I saved Woo Tak's life by preventing the car accident.

299
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.770
Oh, I get it. It does make sense.

300
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.540
But why do we have those dreams?

301
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:19.939
This is how I felt upon surviving the near-death experience.

302
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.139
"I could've really died."

303
00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.580
"I want to make sure I can repay him for saving my life."

304
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.480
That thought must be what started those dreams.

305
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.449
The dreams where we see the future of the person who saved our lives.

306
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.760
What do you think? Isn't it a plausible theory?

307
00:18:42.959 --> 00:18:43.959
It is.

308
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.300
(A dead body on a mattress)

309
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.840
We saved that police officer's life at the lake,

310
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.740
so according to that rule,

311
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.179
he must be able to foresee our future in his dreams.

312
00:18:56.179 --> 00:18:57.980
(Nam Hong Joo dies!)

313
00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.010
That's right.

314
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.750
Then he must know what you guys look like.

315
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.020
I'm sure he knows where you live too.

316
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.020
Well...

317
00:19:04.949 --> 00:19:06.350
- Probably. - No way.

318
00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:08.490
I really don't think it makes sense.

319
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.020
Had your hypothesis been right, he would've already come to meet us.

320
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.230
Do you think he would want to meet you?

321
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.990
It's not like he met you guys through something nice.

322
00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:16.300
Crossing paths again will only bring up painful memories.

323
00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:17.399
Do you think so?

324
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:27.840
Yes.

325
00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:29.409
What's the matter?

326
00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:33.280
What? It's nothing. Don't mind me.

327
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.919
Oh. Starting today, I'll be going to Criminal Division Three for a story.

328
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.320
- For the next three days. - Why?

329
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.719
You mean, our office? For three days?

330
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.219
Oh, it must be for "Three-day Experience".

331
00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:44.260
It's such an interesting segment.

332
00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.189
Does that mean you get to see Prosecutor Jung at his workplace?

333
00:19:50.659 --> 00:19:51.869
Hey, you!

334
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.869
All of it happened because of you!

335
00:19:54.699 --> 00:19:56.469
Goodness, is he an undercover inspector or what?

336
00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.169
- Gosh! - My gosh!

337
00:19:58.169 --> 00:19:59.439
Oh, no. Are you okay?

338
00:19:59.439 --> 00:20:00.439
You did it on purpose, right?

339
00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:02.609
He probably thinks that he's a groundhog or something.

340
00:20:02.609 --> 00:20:04.139
I forgot about it for a second.

341
00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:06.379
That's why no one is welcoming him.

342
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.080
Gosh...

343
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.619
I'll probably be glued to you for the next three days.

344
00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:12.689
To me?

345
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:15.260
The district attorney picked the most competent...

346
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.419
and good-looking prosecutor in the division as an interviewee.

347
00:20:17.419 --> 00:20:20.260
The most competent and good-looking prosecutor? That sounds like you.

348
00:20:25.869 --> 00:20:26.969
Will it be me?

349
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.270
Nice to meet you. I'm Prosecutor Shin Hee Min.

350
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.869
We've met before, right?

351
00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:33.939
I'm Nam Hong Joo from SBC. Thank you in advance for your help.

352
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:36.010
All right, Ms. Shin.

353
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.379
Please help Ms. Nam out so that she can show the viewers...

354
00:20:39.379 --> 00:20:40.750
everything about the prosecution.

355
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.250
Of course. Please don't worry.

356
00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:44.480
Please follow me.

357
00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:47.490
Have a good day.

358
00:20:50.659 --> 00:20:51.719
Goodness.

359
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.159
Oh, boy.

360
00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.899
She and Mr. Jung are close. You should've picked him instead.

361
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.199
- Why did you pick Ms. Shin? - Exactly.

362
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.070
Sir, I guess you didn't mean it when you said you're fond of Mr. Jung.

363
00:21:07.209 --> 00:21:09.209
Mr. Jung, that must've hurt your feelings.

364
00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:11.439
No, I'm fine.

365
00:21:11.439 --> 00:21:13.909
Goodness, you guys are so clueless.

366
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.050
I didn't pick him because I'm fond of him.

367
00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:19.389
They're head over heels for each other now.

368
00:21:19.389 --> 00:21:21.149
If she observes him for three days,

369
00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:24.020
she'll be left with shattered fantasy and disappointment.

370
00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:25.590
Why would her fantasy get shattered?

371
00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:27.189
What's wrong with Mr. Jung?

372
00:21:27.389 --> 00:21:30.030
Who has the most number of unsolved cases in our department?

373
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.199
Mr. Jung.

374
00:21:31.199 --> 00:21:33.199
Whose case reports have the most number of typos?

375
00:21:33.199 --> 00:21:34.199
Mr. Jung.

376
00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:37.439
Who's the one that spends a month on a simple theft case,

377
00:21:37.439 --> 00:21:39.469
which other prosecutors would finish in a week?

378
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.139
That's Mr. Jung too.

379
00:21:42.139 --> 00:21:44.379
Then tell me. Will her fantasy about him be shattered or not?

380
00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:45.609
It will be shattered.

381
00:21:46.709 --> 00:21:48.850
Are you grateful for what I did or not?

382
00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:50.750
Thank you.

383
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:54.790
Mr. Jung. Let's work harder, okay?

384
00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.090
Okay.

385
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.730
(Prosecutor's Office, Prosecutor: Shin Hee Min)

386
00:22:46.609 --> 00:22:49.639
You sold balloon flower root powder to cancer patients,

387
00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:50.879
saying that it's a miracle cure, right?

388
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.280
What? Ball... Balloon flower root?

389
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:58.280
I don't understand Korean very well.

390
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.290
Is there anybody who speaks English around here?

391
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.459
I'm a very good person.

392
00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:08.530
I'm a nice guy.

393
00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:12.270
How dare you call yourself a good person?

394
00:23:13.399 --> 00:23:16.500
When all you've done is take advantage of other people.

395
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.409
I know you speak Korean better than your English,

396
00:23:19.409 --> 00:23:23.540
so stop trying and speak Korean.

397
00:23:26.609 --> 00:23:28.679
Well, Prosecutor.

398
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.619
I'm telling you. I really sold them with good intentions,

399
00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:34.919
with good intentions only.

400
00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:36.859
That can't justify violation of the law.

401
00:23:36.889 --> 00:23:39.429
I honestly didn't know that it's considered a crime.

402
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.030
If I knew,

403
00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:43.399
I'd gladly accept the punishment.

404
00:23:43.399 --> 00:23:45.199
No one accepts punishment gladly.

405
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.230
It's not some kind of candy.

406
00:23:47.369 --> 00:23:49.270
It's meant to be bitter,

407
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:50.770
so accept it as it is.

408
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.609
She's so impressive.

409
00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.350
Just be glad that Ms. Shin is a woman.

410
00:23:59.609 --> 00:24:01.820
She'd be head over heels for her if she was a guy.

411
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.679
She would be indeed.

412
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.550
Hey, cheer up.

413
00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:08.820
I'll let you borrow Red whenever you need it.

414
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.189
- Seriously? - Yes.

415
00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.859
Thank you so much, Mr. Lee. You're the best.

416
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.899
Then how about you cover my night duty to show your gratitude?

417
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.330
Sure, do you have plans this evening?

418
00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:22.600
Yes, I do.

419
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600
With whom?

420
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:25.310
Well, you know. Bye.

421
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.439
- See you. - Whom are you meeting?

422
00:24:28.679 --> 00:24:29.679
Just someone.

423
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.480
Bye.

424
00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:40.990
I can take you out on a date today!

425
00:24:54.699 --> 00:24:55.840
You came at the perfect time.

426
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.169
Come join us.

427
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:58.169
All right.

428
00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:07.480
I want to thank both of you.

429
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.379
- Pardon? - For what?

430
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.350
For staying by my side even though I'm full of flaws.

431
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.119
What's he saying?

432
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.820
Mr. Choi.

433
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.560
I told you that I won't leave. I won't go anywhere, okay?

434
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.490
I'll stay by your side.

435
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.600
I'll work here until I retire, so stop going on about it already.

436
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.869
I can't help but cringe every time you're being like this.

437
00:25:25.969 --> 00:25:27.270
No, it's not about that.

438
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:30.240
Do you happen to know a man named Myung Yi Suk?

439
00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:32.840
Myung Yi Suk? I know about him too.

440
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.510
He's the notorious serial killer who killed people via intravenous drip.

441
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.909
He took his own life recently.

442
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.149
I heard that Yu Beom was in charge of the case at the Yeonju office.

443
00:25:40.209 --> 00:25:41.820
Did you work on the case with him, Mr. Choi?

444
00:25:41.949 --> 00:25:44.080
Yes, I did. Why do you ask?

445
00:25:44.449 --> 00:25:46.850
I happened to read his will and letters of appeal.

446
00:25:47.189 --> 00:25:49.159
There are a few things that I'm apprehensive about.

447
00:25:49.189 --> 00:25:51.320
Everything about that case was pretty clear.

448
00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:54.760
Criminals always come up with plausible stories and excuses.

449
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.129
You pity them and feel that they might have been wronged,

450
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.629
but you'll get in serious trouble if you fall for that.

451
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.570
Right.

452
00:26:20.219 --> 00:26:22.090
Punctuality really matters in transactions like this.

453
00:26:23.689 --> 00:26:26.490
What is going on here? Did that person fool me or what?

454
00:26:41.109 --> 00:26:42.379
Did you bring the phone?

455
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.280
Where's the money?

456
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.619
By the way, what's in that phone?

457
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.520
Why would you drop 10,000 dollars just to get it back?

458
00:26:58.459 --> 00:27:00.530
What's wrong? Were you being tailed?

459
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.359
- Darn it. - Guys, don't let that rat get away!

460
00:27:03.629 --> 00:27:05.899
- Hey! - That little... Get him.

461
00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:07.730
- Hey. - Gosh!

462
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.340
- Stop! - Get him!

463
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:12.669
Hey!

464
00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.240
You know the restaurant over there, right?

465
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.980
I heard they were featured in a TV show. Shall we check it out?

466
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.520
The light has turned green. It's fully charged now.

467
00:27:27.219 --> 00:27:28.820
- Kyung Han. - Yes?

468
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.159
I'm just wondering...

469
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.530
Isn't that guy Detective Ko?

470
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.859
Yes, it's him.

471
00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:35.899
What's he doing?

472
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.199
Hey, you punk!

473
00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:46.310
Hey, Detective Ko. What is going on?

474
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.409
- The gray shirt. - The gray one?

475
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:49.709
He's a stolen phone dealer.

476
00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:50.840
We must catch him!

477
00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:56.119
Gray... Gray shirt...

478
00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.050
Gosh.

479
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.990
Gray...

480
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.500
Hey, Woo Tak. He's wearing plaid pants.

481
00:28:30.879 --> 00:28:32.649
I'm Lieutenant Han Woo Tak from Sangku Division.

482
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:33.949
Please stop now.

483
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.139
Let go! Let go of me!

484
00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:50.969
I'm the victim.

485
00:28:50.969 --> 00:28:52.770
Then why did you try to run away?

486
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.070
Because they came after me.

487
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.409
