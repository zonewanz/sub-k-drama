Hello?

5
00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:26.126
Hello?

6
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.106
Ah Reum. Where are you?

7
00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:36.707
You missed me, right?

8
00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.216
What's going on?

The phone has been turned off.

11
00:00:48.317 --> 00:00:50.087
Please leave a message...

12
00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:53.496
Something happened. I'm sure of it.

13
00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:13.817
What?

14
00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:16.547
Choi Hyun Tae is missing.

15
00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:19.987
Mr. Koo. I'll send you a license plate number.

16
00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:21.357
Please track it.

(Yoon Ah Reum's location)

20
00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:47.193
We have Ah Reum's location.

21
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.523
Darn it. What was that?

22
00:02:12.523 --> 00:02:14.893
- Are you okay? - Yes. Let's go.

23
00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:28.734
He didn't get too far. We'll catch up soon.

24
00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:30.173
He didn't get too far. We'll catch up soon.

25
00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:43.784
He got us.

26
00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:57.104
He's on the no-fly list.

27
00:02:57.104 --> 00:02:58.664
He wouldn't go to the airport.

28
00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.803
If he isn't running, he'll hide.

29
00:03:00.803 --> 00:03:02.234
Is there a place he could hide?

30
00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:06.373
I'm sure he has a hideout. We must find it.

31
00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:07.474
A hideout?

32
00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:10.613
Okay.

33
00:03:12.683 --> 00:03:15.284
Mr. Song. Please look at Choi Hyun Tae's charges...

34
00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:16.553
for the past three months and locate him.

35
00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:06.034
Mom.

36
00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:07.873
Mom!

37
00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:29.394
Are you up?

38
00:04:38.363 --> 00:04:39.433
Okay.

39
00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:41.834
They checked three months of his credit card usage,

40
00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:45.104
and it looks like he was always around Ah Reum.

41
00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:47.774
Wait.

42
00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:51.613
I checked the CCTV around Ah Reum's house,

43
00:04:51.644 --> 00:04:53.854
and Choi Hyun Tae's unregistered car was seen.

44
00:04:54.984 --> 00:04:56.984
That means he must be somewhere in here.

45
00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:58.183
Yes.

46
00:05:00.423 --> 00:05:03.563
Every time I did, he'd find me and follow me.

47
00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:11.763
He was always following her.

48
00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:37.123
- That's Ah Reum's, right? - Pardon? Yes.

49
00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:49.743
Today is the first day we'll be living together.

50
00:05:51.573 --> 00:05:54.714
You have no idea how long I waited for this.

51
00:05:59.214 --> 00:06:01.214
The owner of unit 401 Choi Jin Suk.

52
00:06:01.214 --> 00:06:04.284
I looked it up and it's Hyun Tae's father.

53
00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:07.993
Mom?

54
00:06:08.854 --> 00:06:11.193
- Mom? - Mom?

55
00:06:11.493 --> 00:06:13.133
She's no longer around.

56
00:06:13.763 --> 00:06:15.894
In order to live with you,

57
00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:18.664
I sent her far away.

58
00:06:19.404 --> 00:06:20.573
Mom!

59
00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:23.743
- Mom! - Don't cry.

60
00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:29.443
It's such a happy day. Why are you crying?

61
00:06:31.084 --> 00:06:32.084
Stop.

62
00:06:33.513 --> 00:06:35.854
Your dad is...

63
00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:40.954
You have no idea how happy I am.

64
00:06:57.943 --> 00:06:59.844
The police will be here in 10 minutes...

65
00:06:59.844 --> 00:07:01.644
I'll be responsible, so just open it.

66
00:07:19.493 --> 00:07:22.094
Don't come near me. I'll kill you all!

67
00:07:22.493 --> 00:07:24.433
- Where is Ah Reum? - Just stay still.

68
00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:26.834
Why are you looking for Ah Reum?

69
00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:28.133
Where is she?

70
00:07:28.704 --> 00:07:30.803
Dr. Yeo! I'm in here!

71
00:07:30.803 --> 00:07:33.743
- You're crazy! - Stay back! Put it down.

72
00:07:33.743 --> 00:07:37.214
Why do you keep getting in my way?

73
00:07:37.914 --> 00:07:41.854
If it weren't for you, I'd be happy with Ah Reum!

74
00:07:41.854 --> 00:07:42.923
Nonsense.

75
00:07:43.354 --> 00:07:45.454
I became a prosecutor to catch people like you.

76
00:07:45.984 --> 00:07:47.923
You will never get to see Ah Reum again.

77
00:07:47.923 --> 00:07:50.193
I'll kill you!

78
00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:54.094
Ms. Ma!

79
00:07:56.534 --> 00:07:58.763
- You jerk! - Ah Reum! Ah Reum!

80
00:07:58.763 --> 00:07:59.933
Ms. Ma!

81
00:08:00.904 --> 00:08:04.604
You jerk, keep it down! Ms. Ma!

82
00:08:06.344 --> 00:08:08.214
Don't sway so much. Wake up.

83
00:08:08.513 --> 00:08:10.644
She's okay, right?

84
00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:13.183
Be careful. Be careful. Ms. Ma.

85
00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:17.524
I told you we should wait.

86
00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:20.094
- I'll be just behind you. - Do what you want.

87
00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:24.063
(Ambulance)

88
00:08:24.724 --> 00:08:25.794
I'll see you later.

89
00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:34.734
You told me last time...

90
00:08:36.273 --> 00:08:38.873
that you'll succeed although you failed then.

91
00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:41.743
I'll say the same thing right back at you.

92
00:08:42.883 --> 00:08:45.513
You received a ridiculous sentence five years ago,

93
00:08:46.214 --> 00:08:48.753
but this time, you'll rot for 20 years.

94
00:08:48.753 --> 00:08:50.824
It won't go your way.

95
00:08:50.824 --> 00:08:53.793
Attempted murder, kidnapping, and captivity.

96
00:08:53.793 --> 00:08:55.123
We have enough evidence.

97
00:08:55.393 --> 00:08:58.594
And I have no intention of going easy on you.

98
00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:03.863
You can look forward to it.

99
00:09:05.104 --> 00:09:06.974
Watch what kind of sentence I'll get you.

100
00:09:08.974 --> 00:09:11.204
- You jerk! - Take him away.

Mom... Mom?

104
00:09:25.424 --> 00:09:26.753
They caught him.

105
00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:29.253
Dr. Yeo got him.

106
00:09:30.094 --> 00:09:33.263
We don't have to run away anymore.

107
00:09:50.613 --> 00:09:53.113
Thanks to the prosecutors who threw themselves...

108
00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:54.454
for the investigation,

109
00:09:54.883 --> 00:09:57.324
we were able to catch the horrible criminal.

110
00:09:57.324 --> 00:09:58.824
I'm very glad.

111
00:09:59.283 --> 00:10:01.324
Us at Crimes Against Girls Unit believe...

112
00:10:01.324 --> 00:10:04.993
that we must focus on the message of this case.

113
00:10:05.293 --> 00:10:07.694
The assailant was a child sex offender.

114
00:10:07.694 --> 00:10:10.834
He served five years before he was released,

115
00:10:10.834 --> 00:10:13.334
and he went on to commit the same crime again.

116
00:10:13.434 --> 00:10:15.934
The young victim was still underage...

117
00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:17.903
after the five years,

118
00:10:17.903 --> 00:10:21.574
so she was exposed to a retaliatory offense.

119
00:10:21.714 --> 00:10:23.243
I hope this case will serve as a reason...

120
00:10:23.383 --> 00:10:26.043
to strengthen the sentencing guideline...

121
00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:27.613
against sexual offenses towards children...

122
00:10:27.613 --> 00:10:31.653
in order to avoid future retaliatory offenses.

123
00:10:31.984 --> 00:10:33.554
Due to the influence of this case,

124
00:10:33.554 --> 00:10:35.523
the support level for Kim Moon Sung...

125
00:10:35.523 --> 00:10:38.594
who is a candidate for Yeongpa mayor dropped.

126
00:10:38.594 --> 00:10:41.393
Cho Gap Soo who was running second...

127
00:10:41.393 --> 00:10:45.133
narrowed the gap to 1.7 percent.

128
00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:51.643
I never thought I'd find Min Ji Sook helpful.

129
00:10:51.643 --> 00:10:52.674
According to internal research,

130
00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:55.074
we're ahead by one percent.

131
00:10:57.613 --> 00:10:58.844
Should I get the election polling committee?

132
00:10:59.143 --> 00:11:02.054
We'll look into securing your rising popularity.

133
00:11:03.224 --> 00:11:06.753

Ouch...

It hurts.

150
00:12:48.924 --> 00:12:51.623
- Are you feeling better? - Yes.

151
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.663
It's a small gift.

152
00:13:11.383 --> 00:13:14.153
Must I be in your campaign for getting a tip-off?

153
00:13:14.153 --> 00:13:15.783
It doesn't seem fair.

154

155

It'll be beneficial for you too.

156
00:13:23.863 --> 00:13:27.263
Ms. Ma, what is your relation to Mr. Cho?

157
00:13:27.263 --> 00:13:28.934
Do you have a relationship?

158
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.903
No, there is no such thing.

159
00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:35.434
I only came to cheer her on.

160
00:13:35.704 --> 00:13:38.304
There are a lot of worries due to the increased...

162

to create a world where citizens can feel safe.

165
00:13:51.253 --> 00:13:54.993
I'll focus on creating such policies.

166
00:14:04.434 --> 00:14:06.503
What is Ma's room number?

167
00:14:06.503 --> 00:14:08.674
- It's 7101. - 7101.

168
00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:17.043
We must create policies for such cases.

169
00:14:17.043 --> 00:14:18.344
Yes, sir.

170
00:14:27.554 --> 00:14:28.793
You guys go ahead.

171
00:14:29.824 --> 00:14:30.824
Okay.

172
00:14:39.334 --> 00:14:40.403
Ms. Min.

173
00:14:40.704 --> 00:14:43.204
So this is where we meet.

174
00:14:45.043 --> 00:14:46.314
What brings you here?

175
00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:50.584
You have an excellent prosecutor under you.

176
00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:53.613
We had a great meeting.

177
00:14:54.513 --> 00:14:55.513
Bye, now.

178
00:15:01.653 --> 00:15:04.393
She didn't get stabbed for you.

179
00:15:06.564 --> 00:15:09.604
She's there to catch people who live well...

180
00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:11.633
even after committing crimes like you.

181
00:15:11.734 --> 00:15:13.704
You should go ahead first.

182
00:15:29.523 --> 00:15:32.783
Let's not be perverse.

183
00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:35.594
Don't act rashly...

184
00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:38.194
because I'm watching you.

185
00:15:42.594 --> 00:15:46.133
Haven't you barked enough? Just bite me.

186
00:15:48.403 --> 00:15:50.204
If you don't dare,

187
00:15:50.873 --> 00:15:52.604
they why do you keep barking?

188
00:15:54.243 --> 00:15:56.844
No one cares about a barking dog.

189
00:16:15.863 --> 00:16:16.934
Sir.

190
00:16:19.003 --> 00:16:20.074
What?

191
00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:25.604
(Kim Moon Sung Suggests Heo Jung Yup to Unify)

192
00:16:35.013 --> 00:16:36.924
Ma, how do you feel?

193
00:16:37.424 --> 00:16:38.454
Does it hurt a lot?

194
00:16:38.883 --> 00:16:42.753
I'm not sure. I'm dizzy and I have no strength.

195
00:16:42.863 --> 00:16:44.663
It must be the aftereffect of the surgery.

196
00:16:45.263 --> 00:16:46.834
You didn't even get stitches.

197
00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:50.003
The doctor said the knife just scraped you.

198
00:16:50.434 --> 00:16:53.674
Yeo, you shouldn't say it like that.

199
00:16:53.704 --> 00:16:55.974
She had a knife go in her.

200
00:16:56.243 --> 00:16:57.403
Exactly.

201
00:16:57.704 --> 00:17:00.113
On top of that, she got hit for you.

202
00:17:01.444 --> 00:17:03.684
- Ma did? - She did?

203
00:17:03.783 --> 00:17:04.843
Yes.

204
00:17:05.714 --> 00:17:07.114
It's nothing to be surprised about.

205
00:17:07.783 --> 00:17:09.853
My junior was in danger.

206
00:17:09.853 --> 00:17:13.493
It's what a senior should do.

207
00:17:14.753 --> 00:17:17.194
Are you sure you didn't trip while fleeing?

208
00:17:18.263 --> 00:17:19.734
Are you here?

209
00:17:21.134 --> 00:17:23.234
Were you that upset I did the briefing?

210
00:17:23.803 --> 00:17:24.864
Pardon?

211
00:17:25.234 --> 00:17:27.503
You interviewed without reporting me.

212
00:17:27.503 --> 00:17:30.444
On top of that, with a politician?

213
00:17:32.204 --> 00:17:33.974
He told me it'd be short.

214
00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:36.184
I'll look past it just this once.

215
00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:40.283
If you get involved again, you'll get in trouble.

216
00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:42.283
Yes, I'll remember that.

217
00:17:43.184 --> 00:17:44.424
How is your cut?

218
00:18:08.874 --> 00:18:10.043
Mr. Heo.

219
00:18:11.283 --> 00:18:13.684
Why don't we become friends?

220
00:18:17.184 --> 00:18:18.224
What did you say?

221
00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:22.753
You're interested in the energy industry.

222
00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:27.134
I'll get you a position at our party's...

223
00:18:27.434 --> 00:18:28.833
energy industry committee.

224
00:18:29.904 --> 00:18:33.174
I know you're pushing for a regulation-free zone...

225
00:18:33.273 --> 00:18:36.974
for your father-in-law's Taeyang Corporation...

226
00:18:37.243 --> 00:18:38.474
to be built in Yeongpa.

227
00:18:38.573 --> 00:18:42.043
I'll continue on with this pledge.

228
00:18:43.884 --> 00:18:47.114
I think I deserve to become your friend.

229
00:18:50.884 --> 00:18:53.353
How can I become friends with someone so lowly?

230
00:18:56.823 --> 00:18:59.293
I cannot become friends with detectives...

231
00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:02.833
who torture others sexually.

232
00:19:11.073 --> 00:19:13.374
What is this?

233
00:19:29.493 --> 00:19:32.664
Let me give you an advice.

234
00:19:33.493 --> 00:19:36.063
You shouldn't turn me into your enemy.

235
00:19:37.603 --> 00:19:39.573
Let's be friends while I'm still asking.

236
00:19:42.904 --> 00:19:46.003
That would be a lot better...

237
00:19:46.974 --> 00:19:48.174
for your well-being.

238
00:20:25.414 --> 00:20:29.114
Are you outside, Mr. Kim?

239
00:20:31.853 --> 00:20:32.924
Yes, sir.

240
00:20:34.093 --> 00:20:35.454
Get Mr. Baek...

241
00:20:36.424 --> 00:20:38.364
on the line right away.

242
00:20:49.303 --> 00:20:50.444
Yes, Mr. Cho.

243
00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:52.573
Make your round of calls...

244
00:20:53.743 --> 00:20:55.144
to the old men.

245
00:20:56.783 --> 00:20:59.583
It's time to collect the investment.

246
00:21:23.603 --> 00:21:26.474
Hey. Did you get those...

247
00:21:27.573 --> 00:21:28.843
from the hospital?

248
00:21:28.843 --> 00:21:30.984
No, they're from home.

249
00:21:33.714 --> 00:21:34.753
Home...

250
00:21:38.353 --> 00:21:39.384
Yes, Ms. Ma.

251
00:21:39.384 --> 00:21:41.493
Go buy me some slippers.

252
00:21:42.053 --> 00:21:45.164
- Pardon? - I was never sick before,

253
00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:47.664
but I realized you need a lot at the hospital.

254
00:21:48.864 --> 00:21:49.934
And?

255
00:21:50.303 --> 00:21:51.664
What do you mean, "And"?

256
00:21:52.364 --> 00:21:55.003
I got stabbed for you and am bedridden.

257
00:21:55.533 --> 00:21:57.303
Why are you acting like a bystander?

258
00:21:57.944 --> 00:21:59.714
You came empty handed last time too.

259
00:22:03.384 --> 00:22:06.714
All right. What else do you need?

260
00:22:12.924 --> 00:22:14.424
How disgusting.

261
00:22:28.934 --> 00:22:32.003
I'll forward the report on Mr. Na's case tomorrow.

262
00:22:32.043 --> 00:22:33.843
Can you review these documents?

263
00:22:37.214 --> 00:22:39.984
Toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, towel, and makeup.

264
00:22:40.184 --> 00:22:41.984
I need all the toiletries.

265
00:22:43.684 --> 00:22:45.684
This is the subway sexual harassment case...

266
00:22:47.194 --> 00:22:49.224
I need makeup for dry skin.

267
00:22:49.394 --> 00:22:52.063
The subway sexual harassment case's CCTV...

268
00:22:53.293 --> 00:22:54.634
footages were collected.

269
00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:57.263
I'll meet the victim, Ms. Choi, tomorrow.

270
00:22:57.734 --> 00:22:59.033
Do you think you'll get the arrest warrant?

271
00:22:59.603 --> 00:23:00.674
Yes.

272
00:23:03.803 --> 00:23:04.974
I'm sorry.

273
00:23:07.343 --> 00:23:09.614
Yeo, my phone charger too.

274
00:23:09.714 --> 00:23:11.783
Also some hair ties. Black.

275
00:23:46.454 --> 00:23:48.414
I need wet wipes and a tissue box.

276
00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:51.384
Right. Do you have any funny videos?

277
00:23:58.464 --> 00:24:00.234
(Ma Yi Deum)

278
00:24:00.234 --> 00:24:03.063
Why aren't you replying? Yeo?

279
00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:17.384
Yeo! Are you ignoring me?

280
00:24:33.894 --> 00:24:35.964
What is it now? What? What?

281
00:24:38.664 --> 00:24:39.674
What?

282
00:24:44.843 --> 00:24:46.843
This was cooked perfectly.

283
00:24:47.674 --> 00:24:49.684
It was seasoned well too.

284
00:24:50.243 --> 00:24:52.313
This is how a meal should taste.

285
00:24:52.684 --> 00:24:55.353
Hospital food is too healthy. It's not me.

286
00:24:55.853 --> 00:24:57.853
You're not at the hospital to eat.

287
00:24:58.424 --> 00:25:01.053
Of course, I am. I haven't had time off in ages.

288
00:25:11.333 --> 00:25:12.404
Is this everything?

289
00:25:14.573 --> 00:25:17.043
Yes, this is everything.

290
00:25:17.043 --> 00:25:18.103
How sad.

291
00:25:24.843 --> 00:25:25.914
Alcohol too?

292
00:25:26.484 --> 00:25:28.853
This isn't alcohol. It's to help me digest.

293
00:25:28.853 --> 00:25:31.184
You're not well. You shouldn't drink.

294
00:25:31.424 --> 00:25:32.853
One can is fine.

295
00:25:32.853 --> 00:25:34.593
You'll get an infection.

296
00:25:34.593 --> 00:25:36.323
I said one's okay.

297
00:25:36.323 --> 00:25:38.694
- I said no! - I said it's okay!

298
00:25:43.763 --> 00:25:45.563
I said one can is fine.

Let's go.

301
00:26:15.894 --> 00:26:17.003
Anyway,

302
00:26:18.063 --> 00:26:19.734
how many years did Choi Hyun Tae get?

303
00:26:20.234 --> 00:26:21.273
18 years.

304
00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:23.543
18 years? Then Ah Reum...

305
00:26:24.174 --> 00:26:25.543
will be 37.

306
00:26:26.273 --> 00:26:28.214
She's gotten so much more optimistic.

307
00:26:28.214 --> 00:26:29.813
She says she wants to be a cop.

308
00:26:30.813 --> 00:26:33.154
So that she can shoot Choi Hyun Tae.

309
00:26:36.484 --> 00:26:38.853
To protect other kids suffering as she did.

310
00:26:42.553 --> 00:26:43.624
Ms. Ma.

311
00:26:47.134 --> 00:26:48.234
Thank you.

312
00:26:48.864 --> 00:26:49.864
I mean it.

313
00:26:57.404 --> 00:26:58.444
Aren't you going?

314
00:26:58.974 --> 00:27:00.043
Yes.

315
00:27:00.414 --> 00:27:03.214
Keep that on. It's cold. You'll get sick.

316
00:27:06.384 --> 00:27:07.654
In that case,

317
00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:09.783
thanks.

318
00:27:10.124 --> 00:27:11.154
Go in.

319
00:27:13.323 --> 00:27:14.493
Ms. Ma.

320
00:27:17.924 --> 00:27:18.993
Well...

321
00:27:20.364 --> 00:27:22.164
I am thankful. I am.

322
00:27:22.694 --> 00:27:23.904
But starting tomorrow...

323
00:27:26.904 --> 00:27:28.503
please cut back on the texts.

324
00:27:28.803 --> 00:27:31.073
If you have to text, combine them into one.

325
00:27:31.073 --> 00:27:34.513
I can't focus on work because of your texts.

326
00:27:36.714 --> 00:27:37.783
Got it.

327
00:27:39.144 --> 00:27:40.154
Bye.

328
00:27:40.813 --> 00:27:41.884

(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

330
00:27:54.563 --> 00:27:57.164
Why did you call me here with the perpetrator?

331
00:27:58.333 --> 00:28:02.003
What happened to Young Woong makes me sick.

332
00:28:02.474 --> 00:28:04.944
You want me to sit face-to-face with him?

333
00:28:05.644 --> 00:28:06.773
My apologies.

334
00:28:07.343 --> 00:28:10.743
I asked both of you here to show you something.

335
00:28:12.644 --> 00:28:15.783
His hand was really rough.

336
00:28:15.984 --> 00:28:17.954
It scratched my leg.

337
00:28:17.954 --> 00:28:21.394
He smelled a lot like alcohol.

338
00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:22.993
What about it?

339
00:28:23.624 --> 00:28:25.063
Just a minute.

340
00:28:25.424 --> 00:28:28.263
Would you please show us your hands?

341
00:28:33.874 --> 00:28:38.374
You inspected chemicals before this job, correct?

342
00:28:38.374 --> 00:28:40.714
You touched so many strong chemicals...

343
00:28:40.714 --> 00:28:42.474
that your fingerprints are almost gone.

344
00:28:42.474 --> 00:28:43.513
Yes.

345
00:28:44.184 --> 00:28:47.454
Two years ago, you had liver surgery.

346
00:28:47.954 --> 00:28:50.684
Your colleagues say ever since then,

347
00:28:50.684 --> 00:28:52.853
you don't go near alcohol.

348
00:28:52.853 --> 00:28:53.924
That's right.

349
00:28:54.924 --> 00:28:56.694
To be honest,

350
00:28:57.924 --> 00:29:01.033
the kid was crying because his pants were wet.

351
00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:05.134
So I felt bad for him.

352
00:29:06.063 --> 00:29:07.103
And...

353
00:29:07.874 --> 00:29:09.904
he reminded me of my grandson,

354
00:29:10.204 --> 00:29:12.174
so I couldn't just ignore it.

355
00:29:13.243 --> 00:29:15.813
That's why I changed him.

356
00:29:19.853 --> 00:29:23.823
I'm sorry. Oh no.

357
00:29:25.283 --> 00:29:26.323
Ma'am.

358
00:29:27.023 --> 00:29:30.464
I have two children around Young Woong's age,

359
00:29:30.464 --> 00:29:31.793
so I know them well.

360
00:29:32.164 --> 00:29:35.563
You think most children are incapable of lying,

361
00:29:35.864 --> 00:29:39.263
but they often exaggerate with the slightest...

362
00:29:39.263 --> 00:29:40.404
bit of attention.

363
00:29:41.603 --> 00:29:42.803
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:44.874 --> 00:29:46.674
Does apologizing cut it?

365
00:29:47.474 --> 00:29:49.813
You nearly sent an innocent man to prison.

366
00:29:51.984 --> 00:29:53.414
- Seo. - Yes?

367
00:29:55.114 --> 00:29:56.253
Repent, okay?

368
00:29:56.984 --> 00:29:57.984
Okay.

369
00:30:16.204 --> 00:30:19.174
Everyone does that in the beginning.

370
00:30:19.404 --> 00:30:23.484
Consider it a step to becoming stronger.

371
00:30:24.484 --> 00:30:27.013
- Well... - Mr. Koo!

372
00:30:30.124 --> 00:30:31.124
Gosh.

373
00:30:32.053 --> 00:30:34.053
There's no need to...

374
00:30:34.053 --> 00:30:36.224
I really wanted to do well.

375
00:30:36.694 --> 00:30:39.364
I know. I do. But if you do this, I...

376
00:30:39.364 --> 00:30:42.164
Oh my gosh. What's going on here?

377
00:30:42.234 --> 00:30:43.263
Darn it!

378
00:30:43.664 --> 00:30:45.404
It's nothing like that!

379
00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:49.234
What does he mean? It's not like what?

380
00:30:49.974 --> 00:30:51.003
Right?

381
00:31:20.934 --> 00:31:24.204
- Eat this. - Thanks.

382
00:31:25.404 --> 00:31:26.573
What's gotten into you?

383
00:31:28.374 --> 00:31:30.543
You've done a lot.

384
00:31:46.464 --> 00:31:48.694
- That feels nice. - Does it?

385
00:32:16.493 --> 00:32:19.833
- Hello? - Send me some cases.

386
00:32:22.164 --> 00:32:23.904
Why are you doing this?

387
00:32:24.503 --> 00:32:27.103
I have a pile of documents to get approved today.

388
00:32:27.474 --> 00:32:29.273
I'm busy, so let's talk later.

389
00:32:29.374 --> 00:32:30.773
I may die.

390
00:32:31.843 --> 00:32:34.073
What's wrong? What is it?

391
00:32:34.073 --> 00:32:36.214
I'm bored to death.

392
00:32:40.813 --> 00:32:42.214
I mean,

393
00:32:42.783 --> 00:32:45.724
I watched all the movies and dramas you sent.

394
00:32:45.724 --> 00:32:48.053
I played games for two hours,

395
00:32:48.053 --> 00:32:50.093
but I still have too much time, and I feel empty.

396
00:32:50.394 --> 00:32:52.724
That makes me think all sort of stupid things,

397
00:32:53.664 --> 00:32:55.464
so I think working would be better.

398
00:32:56.864 --> 00:33:00.773
If you feel so empty, I suggest you read.

399
00:33:02.533 --> 00:33:03.704
Read...

400
00:33:04.103 --> 00:33:07.543
Yes. Read? Great.

401
00:33:08.144 --> 00:33:11.843
Books that formed my view on life are there.

402
00:33:11.944 --> 00:33:13.714
Please bring them carefully.

403
00:33:25.093 --> 00:33:26.664
(The Queen's Knight)

404
00:33:28.593 --> 00:33:30.234
Her view on life?

405
00:33:41.243 --> 00:33:42.414
Mom.

406
00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:52.684
Mom.

407
00:34:01.793 --> 00:34:05.204
- Take out the carrots. - You're so finicky.

408
00:34:05.204 --> 00:34:07.503
Gosh. You're still a kid.

409
00:34:07.773 --> 00:34:09.603
A baby. Here.

410
00:34:13.744 --> 00:34:16.614
My mom made really good gimbap too.

411
00:34:19.014 --> 00:34:20.154
Chew well.

412
00:34:34.534 --> 00:34:35.734
Hubby!

413
00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:43.904
- Me? - What took you so long?

414
00:34:43.904 --> 00:34:46.143
I've been waiting, Hubby.

415
00:34:55.353 --> 00:34:57.683
What are you talking about?

416
00:34:58.784 --> 00:35:00.694
Your husband is handsome.

417
00:35:01.453 --> 00:35:04.424
- And tall. - And you're a prosecutor?

418
00:35:05.023 --> 00:35:06.634
I'm so jealous.

419
00:35:07.393 --> 00:35:09.503
I stay with him because I'm so nice.

420
00:35:10.534 --> 00:35:12.364
Are we married now too?

421
00:35:12.703 --> 00:35:14.734
Sorry. Let's be married for just 20 minutes.

422
00:35:15.003 --> 00:35:16.074
20 minutes?

423
00:35:17.674 --> 00:35:19.373
- Any kids? - Sorry?

424
00:35:19.714 --> 00:35:23.083
- Not yet? - We'll try soon. Right?

425
00:35:23.514 --> 00:35:24.514
Try?

426
00:35:24.514 --> 00:35:26.884
Good. I'm sure you'll get one soon.

427
00:35:27.214 --> 00:35:28.514
You're newlyweds.

428
00:35:28.813 --> 00:35:30.984
Mom. Stop that.

429
00:35:34.753 --> 00:35:36.523
I'm so embarrassed.

430
00:35:45.034 --> 00:35:47.103
What? "Try"?

431
00:35:47.973 --> 00:35:49.074
Try?

432
00:35:49.433 --> 00:35:51.973
You're married, and now you're having kids?

433
00:35:51.973 --> 00:35:54.944
What? Don't you need a mother-in-law?

434
00:35:55.214 --> 00:35:56.284
Mother-in-law?

435
00:36:11.364 --> 00:36:13.134
I heard you got hurt instead of Jin Wook.

436
00:36:13.134 --> 00:36:14.933
I was grateful and worried.

437
00:36:15.234 --> 00:36:18.804
It's okay. It's only natural as his senior.

438
00:36:19.404 --> 00:36:21.273
She wanted to thank you in person.

439
00:36:22.174 --> 00:36:24.203
It was nothing. You didn't have to.

440
00:36:26.273 --> 00:36:28.813
Your mother must've been pretty scared.

441
00:36:30.744 --> 00:36:32.583
Yes, well... Sure.

442
00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:37.753
I'd like to meet her while I'm here.

443
00:36:37.753 --> 00:36:38.953
Did she step away?

444
00:36:39.183 --> 00:36:41.893
- Yes, well... - Mom.

445
00:36:42.094 --> 00:36:43.964
You said you brought food. Where is it?

446
00:36:44.194 --> 00:36:46.023
Sure. Here.

447
00:36:46.563 --> 00:36:47.694
Here. Take them out.

448
00:36:48.433 --> 00:36:50.003
I'll pick that up.

449
00:36:54.873 --> 00:36:57.574
(Missing)

450
00:36:59.404 --> 00:37:00.973
Doctor. Doctor!

451
00:37:01.773 --> 00:37:05.614
I have to see my Yi Deum. I'm not crazy! I mean it!

452
00:37:06.253 --> 00:37:07.953
You know that too.

453
00:37:09.054 --> 00:37:11.484
Please, please let me out.

454
00:37:12.023 --> 00:37:14.324
I really, really have to go.

455
00:37:15.623 --> 00:37:17.094
My daughter is waiting.

456
00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:19.494
My poor Yi Deum...

457
00:37:19.764 --> 00:37:22.634
I'm all my dear Yi Deum has!

458
00:37:23.034 --> 00:37:24.634
Doctor!

459
00:37:26.203 --> 00:37:27.734
Please, let me out.

460
00:37:27.804 --> 00:37:29.904
We know you're hiding from your creditors.

461
00:37:32.503 --> 00:37:33.744
If you take good care...

462
00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:36.244
of Kim Mi Jung,

463
00:37:36.884 --> 00:37:38.543
we'll protect you as well.

464
00:38:13.253 --> 00:38:16.054
Please transfer her to somewhere quiet.

465
00:38:17.223 --> 00:38:18.484
I will.

466
00:38:30.804 --> 00:38:31.833
Are you tired?

467
00:38:33.304 --> 00:38:34.304
No.

468
00:38:36.203 --> 00:38:38.304
Jin Wook. There's nothing...

469
00:38:41.744 --> 00:38:43.913
going on with you and her, right?

470
00:38:45.183 --> 00:38:47.583
Why? Do you wish there were?

471
00:38:48.014 --> 00:38:49.154
If not, that's fine.

472
00:39:00.793 --> 00:39:02.264
You should go.

473
00:39:06.304 --> 00:39:07.333
Get back safely.

474
00:39:15.973 --> 00:39:17.344
It's been a while, doctor.

475
00:39:19.114 --> 00:39:20.554
Your son won't find out...

476
00:39:21.453 --> 00:39:23.424
what happened 14 years ago, will he?

477
00:39:24.384 --> 00:39:27.723
That would put you in a bad spot as well.

478
00:39:31.163 --> 00:39:32.563
What do you mean?

479
00:39:33.134 --> 00:39:35.293
Nothing happened 14 years ago.

480
00:39:35.433 --> 00:39:37.103
That's all I know.

481
00:39:47.473 --> 00:39:48.773
I'm sure...

482
00:39:50.143 --> 00:39:51.413
you'll need to reach me.

483
00:39:53.853 --> 00:39:56.523
(Baek Sang Ho)

484
00:40:38.523 --> 00:40:39.563
It's okay.

485
00:40:41.594 --> 00:40:43.163
I can go home now.

486
00:40:46.304 --> 00:40:47.473
Okay.

487
00:40:48.734 --> 00:40:52.074
Thank you for everything. I won't bug you anymore.

488
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:01.614
Sure.

489
00:41:02.514 --> 00:41:03.654
That's good.

490
00:41:20.433 --> 00:41:22.473
(Seo Yoo Ri 2, Ms. Son 3, Ma Yi Deum 0)

491
00:41:38.123 --> 00:41:39.694
What you couldn't eat last time.

492
00:41:51.003 --> 00:41:53.003
Drink slowly.

493
00:41:54.174 --> 00:41:56.904
Okay. I'm ready now.

494
00:41:58.103 --> 00:41:59.103
For what?

495
00:41:59.103 --> 00:42:02.273
I'm ready to accept your feelings for me.

496
00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:04.284
My what feelings?

497
00:42:04.614 --> 00:42:07.614
Must I really say that myself?

498
00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:11.884
You must know better about how you feel.

499
00:42:13.453 --> 00:42:14.554
Don't tell me...

500
00:42:15.253 --> 00:42:17.893
I'm supposed to tell you that I love you.

501
00:42:18.163 --> 00:42:19.663
I don't know about love.

502
00:42:20.994 --> 00:42:22.563
To be honest,

503
00:42:22.933 --> 00:42:25.833
it was really tiresome trying to pretend...

504
00:42:25.833 --> 00:42:27.973
I didn't know you liked me all this time.

505
00:42:29.203 --> 00:42:32.373
I don't want to play games anymore, so...

506
00:42:33.143 --> 00:42:35.543
let's come clean today.

507
00:42:35.543 --> 00:42:36.583
Hold on.

508
00:42:36.884 --> 00:42:40.014
I have many things to rebut right now,

509
00:42:41.214 --> 00:42:43.953
but first, the "you liked me" part.

510
00:42:45.083 --> 00:42:47.424
What proof do you have to get such a misconception?

511
00:42:48.494 --> 00:42:50.824
Fine. Then first,

512
00:42:51.994 --> 00:42:55.094
why were you so good to me at the hospital?

513
00:42:55.864 --> 00:42:57.964
You even made well-done short ribs for me.

514
00:42:58.163 --> 00:43:01.804
You made me do it, and you demanded well-done ribs.

515
00:43:02.473 --> 00:43:04.844
You said you get sick if they are under-cooked.

516
00:43:06.103 --> 00:43:07.643
Why did your mother come?

517
00:43:08.244 --> 00:43:10.844
She came because you told her...

518
00:43:10.844 --> 00:43:12.344
that you liked me.

519
00:43:12.344 --> 00:43:14.353
To see the woman her son likes.

520
00:43:14.514 --> 00:43:16.723
My mother likes to visit people in hospitals.

521
00:43:16.723 --> 00:43:18.223
There was no ulterior motive.

522
00:43:18.284 --> 00:43:21.054
That's not right. That's it.

523
00:43:22.793 --> 00:43:23.893
That night.

524
00:43:24.663 --> 00:43:27.563
The night you let me sleep at your place.

525
00:43:30.703 --> 00:43:33.103
You came in the middle off the night...

526
00:43:33.103 --> 00:43:35.634
and stroked my face like this.

527
00:43:36.304 --> 00:43:37.473
Mom.

528
00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:39.744
Mom.

529
00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:51.784
You wanted to kiss me but held back, right?

530
00:43:53.793 --> 00:43:56.563
- Well... That was... - I'm right.

531
00:43:57.764 --> 00:43:58.924
- You are not. - I am too.

532
00:43:58.924 --> 00:44:00.194
You are not.

533
00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:23.083
What the... Was she just drunk?

534
00:44:34.793 --> 00:44:39.773
(Witch's Court)

535
00:45:17.804 --> 00:45:21.344
I was sexually assaulted.

536
00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:48.473
What is that?

537
00:45:48.703 --> 00:45:51.174
You should forget everything you see now.

538
00:45:51.643 --> 00:45:54.043
We'll deposit 100,000 dollars tomorrow.

539
00:45:55.014 --> 00:45:57.384
Confidentiality about this place is incorporated.

540
00:46:02.813 --> 00:46:04.023
I understand.

541
00:46:26.773 --> 00:46:29.683
- Hi. What happened was... - Quiet, Min Ho.

542
00:46:32.444 --> 00:46:35.253
Isn't he Hyungjae Group's youngest son?

543
00:46:36.723 --> 00:46:40.494
And this is your younger brother, correct?

544
00:46:42.554 --> 00:46:44.994
He hit a lady, and she was badly injured.

545
00:46:57.904 --> 00:47:00.014
No. I didn't hit her.

546
00:47:01.973 --> 00:47:04.714
Why did you call me here?

547
00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:08.453
Everyone knows about his reputation.

548
00:47:08.953 --> 00:47:11.223
I hear the group has a lawyer just for him.

549
00:47:11.424 --> 00:47:14.253
Tae Kyoo lied to the lady that he was Min Ho.

550
00:47:15.953 --> 00:47:17.123
He's smart.

551
00:47:17.223 --> 00:47:19.393
Why did you bring a lawyer?

552
00:47:19.424 --> 00:47:21.764
It's just assault, and not that serious.

553
00:47:21.764 --> 00:47:23.734
Even if she files charges, 500,000 dollars will do.

554
00:47:24.634 --> 00:47:26.933
Nice. New girl.

555
00:47:32.404 --> 00:47:33.844
Get it together, Tae Kyoo.

556
00:47:40.054 --> 00:47:42.853
You just deliver my uncle's bags. Behave.

557
00:47:42.853 --> 00:47:45.154
- Hey. - That's right.

558
00:47:47.424 --> 00:47:49.223
He's your brother, right?

559
00:47:51.123 --> 00:47:52.324
I forgot.

560
00:47:53.634 --> 00:47:54.694
Sorry.

561
00:48:01.534 --> 00:48:03.904
Sang Ho. Are you okay?

562
00:48:04.804 --> 00:48:06.174
He must be drunk.

563
00:48:07.973 --> 00:48:09.944
It's happens when guys drink.

564
00:48:10.683 --> 00:48:11.813
But Min Ho.

565
00:48:12.953 --> 00:48:15.554
Don't come here again. If Mr. Cho finds out,

566
00:48:16.353 --> 00:48:17.953
you and Tae Kyoo will both be hurt.

567
00:48:19.523 --> 00:48:20.554
Okay.

568
00:48:24.723 --> 00:48:25.723
Thank you in advance.

569

(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

570
00:48:52.523 --> 00:48:53.554
Hey.

571
00:48:53.893 --> 00:48:56.094
Hello, Ms. Ma.

572
00:49:06.174 --> 00:49:07.333
Did you sleep well?

573
00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:09.433
Probably not.

574
00:49:10.003 --> 00:49:11.873
- What... - How could you?

575
00:49:13.543 --> 00:49:16.413
Your crush said she'd give you a chance.

576
00:49:21.183 --> 00:49:22.284
Ms. Ma?

577
00:49:23.824 --> 00:49:26.353
- Let me speak too. - Sure. Go ahead.

578
00:49:27.253 --> 00:49:30.494
I slept well. I never had a crush.

579
00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:32.994
I never said I liked you either.

580
00:49:34.163 --> 00:49:36.134
Then why did you accept my kiss...

581
00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:37.964
if you didn't even have a crush on me?

582
00:49:39.433 --> 00:49:40.973
- The kiss, I acknowledge. - Exactly.

583
00:49:40.973 --> 00:49:42.273
I acknowledge only that.

584
00:49:45.674 --> 00:49:49.074
What the... Is he saying he likes me or not?

585
00:49:50.643 --> 00:49:51.813
Is he playing hard-to-get?

586
00:49:52.744 --> 00:49:53.813
Yeo.

587
00:49:54.683 --> 00:49:56.853
(Request for No Punishment)

588
00:49:59.484 --> 00:50:01.453
I didn't know things would get so out of hand.

589
00:50:01.853 --> 00:50:03.994
Please pretend I never said anything.

590
00:50:07.234 --> 00:50:09.563
You don't want him to be punished?

591
00:50:10.304 --> 00:50:13.134
You told the police you were sexually assaulted.

592
00:50:13.433 --> 00:50:16.174
I did that because I was angry at my boyfriend...

593
00:50:16.174 --> 00:50:17.643
after a fight.

594
00:50:18.344 --> 00:50:19.744
I love him.

595
00:50:19.913 --> 00:50:22.744
Did he demand you settle, and threaten or hit...

596
00:50:22.744 --> 00:50:24.984
No. Nothing of the sort.

597
00:50:25.543 --> 00:50:27.384
Like I said, we love each other.

598
00:50:33.623 --> 00:50:35.194
Have a nice day.

599
00:50:38.364 --> 00:50:39.494
My goodness.

600
00:50:39.663 --> 00:50:42.364
What a melodramatic lovers' quarrel.

601
00:50:43.364 --> 00:50:44.663
Let's close the case.

602
00:51:00.154 --> 00:51:01.313
Ms. Jin Yun Hee?

603
00:51:04.054 --> 00:51:06.853
The money should be in your account.

604
00:51:07.623 --> 00:51:09.824
- Thanks. - You're pretty good.

605
00:51:10.824 --> 00:51:12.223
Is it a lot of experience?

606
00:51:13.034 --> 00:51:14.094
Pardon?

607
00:51:15.063 --> 00:51:18.203
Don't say anything stupid to other people later.

608
00:51:19.134 --> 00:51:20.433
Don't worry.

609
00:51:22.534 --> 00:51:25.074
If you run your mouth,

610
00:51:25.503 --> 00:51:27.214
you'll regret it.

611
00:51:29.473 --> 00:51:30.643
Sure.

612
00:51:35.853 --> 00:51:36.924
Yun Hee.

613
00:51:48.833 --> 00:51:49.933
Where did you park?

614
00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:52.264
I took the subway today.

615
00:51:52.534 --> 00:51:54.574
- Then me too. - Hey, Yi Deum.

616
00:52:06.884 --> 00:52:09.253
- Oh my, gosh. - Hey, Yoo Mi.

617
00:52:09.924 --> 00:52:12.994
You'll burn a hole through him. Stop staring.

618
00:52:13.253 --> 00:52:15.723
I will not. This is just how I look at people.

619
00:52:17.094 --> 00:52:20.663
She and I've been close since Janghyeon-dong.

620
00:52:21.494 --> 00:52:22.933
I pretty much raised her.

621
00:52:23.563 --> 00:52:25.734
You didn't visit me at all at the hospital.

622
00:52:26.234 --> 00:52:28.103
Friday Saturday are peak. I had no choice.

623
00:52:28.404 --> 00:52:30.103
I barely had time to come today.

624
00:52:30.103 --> 00:52:32.674
So why did it have to be today?

625
00:52:34.043 --> 00:52:36.043
I'm so glad I came today. It was worthwhile.

626
00:52:40.083 --> 00:52:42.453
You really can't drink at all, Jin Wook?

627
00:52:45.054 --> 00:52:48.094
No, he can't. Not at all. He's weak like that.

628
00:52:48.494 --> 00:52:50.563
Aren't you taking a tonic?

629
00:52:54.563 --> 00:52:56.304
Let's take a picture.

630
00:52:56.364 --> 00:52:58.234
I want to commemorate meeting a cute prosecutor.

631
00:52:58.634 --> 00:52:59.933
Take our picture for me.

632
00:53:00.674 --> 00:53:03.404
You're making him uncomfortable. Enough.

633
00:53:03.804 --> 00:53:05.404
He doesn't look it.

634
00:53:05.404 --> 00:53:06.973
I won't leave until you take it.

635
00:53:09.313 --> 00:53:10.344
Fine.

636
00:53:12.984 --> 00:53:14.714
Okay. This way.

637
00:53:18.824 --> 00:53:19.893
Okay.

638
00:53:23.364 --> 00:53:25.094
1, 2...

639
00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:28.663
Here.

640
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:32.203
It came out nicely.

641
00:53:33.234 --> 00:53:35.003
Want to see something cool?

642
00:53:35.873 --> 00:53:36.944
Look.

643
00:53:42.884 --> 00:53:44.043
Isn't it awesome?

644
00:53:45.643 --> 00:53:47.753
Don't you think we look so good together?

645
00:53:48.054 --> 00:53:50.083
I'm going to post this.

646
00:53:50.453 --> 00:53:51.784
Hashtag dream man.

647
00:53:52.054 --> 00:53:54.694
(First)

648
00:53:56.523 --> 00:53:58.694
I'll send you the photo. Give me your number.

649
00:54:20.054 --> 00:54:22.614
(First time we met)

650
00:54:34.464 --> 00:54:36.163
Yes.

651
00:54:36.933 --> 00:54:39.034
I received the 200,000 dollars.

652
00:54:40.634 --> 00:54:44.973
But if you'd help me with another 300,000 dollars,

653
00:54:45.473 --> 00:54:47.473
I'll make sure that...

654
00:54:47.473 --> 00:54:51.344
You bribed my driver and got the dash cam video.

655
00:54:54.514 --> 00:54:55.884
Should I talk too?

656
00:54:57.083 --> 00:54:59.694
Cho Gap Soo's breadline, Hyungjae Group?

657
00:55:07.293 --> 00:55:09.293
I invited another friend.

658
00:55:10.234 --> 00:55:12.433
Please have a seat, sir.

659
00:55:12.634 --> 00:55:13.703
Sure.

660
00:55:16.273 --> 00:55:17.473
It's nice to meet you.

661
00:55:17.904 --> 00:55:20.114
I'm a chief prosecutor, Oh Soo Chul.

662
00:55:20.973 --> 00:55:24.813
I think he took about 200,000 dollars.

663
00:55:24.813 --> 00:55:26.884
How many years do you think he'll get?

664
00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:31.484
For 200,000 dollars, it'll begin at 10 years.

665
00:55:32.253 --> 00:55:34.853
He'll be disqualified from the election for sure.

666
00:55:45.703 --> 00:55:49.203
Now, am I qualified to be...

667
00:55:50.344 --> 00:55:51.873
your friend?

668
00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:00.784
Are you from Janghyeon-dong?

669
00:56:01.114 --> 00:56:02.114
Pretty much.

670
00:56:02.753 --> 00:56:04.683
I was born in Yeongpa, but I lived...

671
00:56:04.784 --> 00:56:07.353
in Janghyeon-dong since I was one.

672
00:56:08.324 --> 00:56:11.123
Have you heard of it? Have you ever visited?

673
00:56:11.293 --> 00:56:14.793
Yes. I did. When I was a senior in high school.

674
00:56:15.134 --> 00:56:17.634
When you were a senior? Why?

675
00:56:18.203 --> 00:56:19.933
I had to find someone.

676
00:56:21.134 --> 00:56:25.244
An older lady asked me to find her family for her.

677
00:56:26.574 --> 00:56:27.614
Who?

678
00:56:28.344 --> 00:56:30.413
It's a long story,

679
00:56:30.984 --> 00:56:33.313
but anyway, she ran a noodle soup restaurant.

680
00:56:33.313 --> 00:56:35.654
She had been searching ever since.

681
00:56:42.023 --> 00:56:43.163
Hold on.

682
00:56:45.924 --> 00:56:47.433
You met whom?

683
00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:56.034
(Independent 3. Heo Jung Yup)

684
00:56:56.034 --> 00:56:57.074
So...

685
00:56:59.514 --> 00:57:02.674
I, Heo Jung Yup, wish to withdraw...

686
00:57:03.313 --> 00:57:05.244
my candidacy for Mayor...

687
00:57:06.984 --> 00:57:08.813
of Yeongpa.

688
00:57:14.194 --> 00:57:17.424
Heo Jung Yup announced his withdrawal today.

689
00:57:17.424 --> 00:57:20.264
Thus, people wonder for which candidate...

690
00:57:20.264 --> 00:57:23.603
the 8.5 percent that supported him will vote.

691
00:57:35.473 --> 00:57:36.784
What's going on?

692
00:57:36.784 --> 00:57:38.143
What's happening?

693
00:57:47.154 --> 00:57:48.694
From this day forth,

694
00:57:49.824 --> 00:57:52.623
I support Cho Gap Soo in the race.

695
00:57:56.063 --> 00:57:57.534
Thank you.

696
00:58:04.473 --> 00:58:05.703
I'm candidate number 1,

697
00:58:07.373 --> 00:58:08.844
Cho Gap Soo.

698
00:58:12.083 --> 00:58:13.484
You met whom?

699
00:58:15.953 --> 00:58:19.123
That lady with a noodles place in Janghyeon-dong.

700
00:58:19.453 --> 00:58:22.924
Was her name by chance... No, no, no.

701
00:58:22.924 --> 00:58:25.694
I'm sure that's the name. I'm positive.

702
00:58:25.694 --> 00:58:27.393
What's wrong? Are you okay?

703
00:58:28.264 --> 00:58:30.534
That lady that you met.

704
00:58:33.534 --> 00:58:34.873
She's my mom.

705
00:58:35.333 --> 00:58:36.873
She disappeared 20 years ago.

706
00:59:06.433 --> 00:59:08.703
(Witch's Court)

707
00:59:09.203 --> 00:59:11.404
It sounds so similar to my mom.

708
00:59:11.404 --> 00:59:12.844
This was not the face.

709
00:59:12.844 --> 00:59:14.473
There's a way to find Kim Min Jung.

710
00:59:14.514 --> 00:59:16.413
Mr. Koo. I'll send you a government ID number.

711
00:59:16.413 --> 00:59:17.514
Please run an identity check.

712
00:59:17.683 --> 00:59:19.514
- How did it go? - I took care of it.

713
00:59:19.514 --> 00:59:22.614
This is a human rights violation and defamation.

714
00:59:22.614 --> 00:59:24.023
Just as expected.

715
00:59:24.284 --> 00:59:25.683
Go with me somewhere?

716
00:59:26.083 --> 00:59:27.424
He's a new attorney.

717
00:59:27.424 --> 00:59:29.023
Why do they sell their bodies,

718
00:59:29.023 --> 00:59:30.594
not caring that they're hurting themselves?

719
00:59:30.793 --> 00:59:32.994
Adults who buy kids with money are the problem.

720
00:59:33.194 --> 00:59:35.534
About Kim Mi Jung, whom we mentioned earlier.

721
00:59:35.534 --> 00:59:37.503
Don't you have something to say to me?
