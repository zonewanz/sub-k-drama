3
00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:14.023
Take care of Ms. Han...

4
00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:15.793
You've been asking for the Special Unit...

5
00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:17.264
Let's go up together.

6
00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:19.764
You're incredible.

7
00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:22.063
Do you want to succeed this badly?

8
00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.664
I don't care what you say.

9
00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:24.964
Drop the charges.

10
00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:26.234
I'm Ma Yi Deum.

11
00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.144
I will testify as to what happened that day.

12
00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:30.703
He shoved her up against the wall, and kissed her.

13
00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:33.873
I also saw Ms. Han stomp on his left foot...

14
00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:35.513
with her heel.

15
00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:37.013
What are you doing?

16
00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.954
It was contrary to what you promised me.

17
00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:43.683
I can't bring you success, but I can ruin you.

18
00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:45.854
I can't get into the Special Unit anyway.

19
00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:47.894
You shouldn't either! That's only fair!

20
00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:50.363
Let's meet under better circumstances next time.

21
00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:51.994
That won't happen.

22
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:53.433
Let's not meet again.

23
00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:54.433
Congratulations.

24
00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.233
You're finally a PWNF.

25
00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:58.833
Prosecutor With No Future.

26
00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:01.433
Says who? I haven't given up on my future.

27
00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.603
What's a Crimes Against Girls Unit?

28
00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:04.973
Oh, CAGU?

29
00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:07.544
Ms. Min Ji Sook started that unit.

30
00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:09.144
Oh my gosh.

31
00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:10.984
The icon of justice, conviction, and demotion.

32
00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:13.314
This is insane.

33
00:01:13.314 --> 00:01:14.553
Ms. Ma?

34
00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:17.223
You hate being here?

35
00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:18.853
How could I not?

36
00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:20.924
- I volunteered. - Awesome!

37
00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.794
There are a lot of rumors about you.

38
00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:25.863
This means you won't have a chance in front...

39
00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:27.163
of the camera for winning a case.

40
00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:29.934
So a male TA raped a female professor?

41
00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:31.704
I didn't do it.

42
00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:32.773
He's the victim.

43
00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:33.833
You're dating, correct?

44
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:35.504
Woo Sung had the same ring.

45
00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:36.904
Does he know as well...

46
00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:38.204
that the call was recorded?

47
00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:39.374
Are you telling me...

48
00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:41.273
to become a female rapist?

49
00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:42.814
I refuse.

50
00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:44.344
But I'll forever be the loser...

51
00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:45.883
who was assaulted by a woman.

52
00:01:45.883 --> 00:01:47.954
If I'm unlucky, they'll find out that I'm gay.

53
00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:49.954
Can you live my life for me?

54
00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:51.784
We should just punish the assailant.

55
00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:53.993
Must we consider the victim's situation?

56
00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:57.094
The victim went along with being framed...

57
00:01:57.323 --> 00:01:58.493
in order to protect that secret.

58
00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.564
You are homosexual, and like men, correct?

59
00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:02.663
Your Honor.

60
00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.734
Prosecution is violating the witness' privacy.

61
00:02:09.973 --> 00:02:11.103
Your Honor.

62
00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:13.214
I will submit a recording...

63
00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:17.584
of the defendant trying to rape the victim.

64
00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:22.114
Prosecution. You'll submit what?

65
00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:23.983
Ms. Ma.

66
00:02:24.254 --> 00:02:27.723
We knew the victim was homosexual.

67
00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:29.524
On top of that,

68
00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.124
we knew that the lover of the witness...

69
00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:34.834
recorded the phone call about the rape that night.

70
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.703
However, the victim was concerned about...

71
00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:41.034
his sexual orientation being revealed at court.

72
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.504
That is why we did not submit it as evidence.

73
00:02:44.473 --> 00:02:46.314
As you just heard,

74
00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:50.244
the defense violated the victim's privacy.

75
00:02:50.784 --> 00:02:53.184
We decided there is no reason to hesitate.

76
00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:56.084
I will hand in the evidence.

77
00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:01.823
Let's hear it.

78
00:03:02.154 --> 00:03:03.323
Yes, Your Honor.

79
00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.973
I know your thesis is excellent.

80
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:19.643
Professor.

81
00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:21.473
You have a nice body.

82
00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:26.353
Professor!

83
00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:27.913
Professor!

84
00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.054
Professor!

85
00:03:36.193 --> 00:03:38.293
- Professor! - No!

86
00:03:39.293 --> 00:03:42.064
It's a lie. It's a fabrication!

87
00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:44.434
I'm being framed! No!

88
00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:47.133
I'm being framed! You. Woo Sung.

89
00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:49.004
Tell the truth!

90
00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:51.543
Lies!

91
00:03:51.973 --> 00:03:53.573
It's all lies!

92
00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:55.214
Let go!

93
00:03:56.143 --> 00:03:58.643
- Let go! - Keep it down!

94
00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:04.284
(Episode 3)

95
00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:05.383
The verdict is out.

96
00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:07.193
A year and half in jail and 3 years' probation.

97
00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:09.364
The victim is gay. This case is interesting.

98
00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:12.793
The headline should say, "The First Female Rapist".

99
00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:15.033
A female assailant and a homosexual victim.

100
00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:55.073
What a way to stab someone in the back.

101
00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:57.403
- Sorry? - It was you, wasn't it?

102
00:04:57.674 --> 00:04:59.573
You leaked to the defense that Woo Sung was gay.

103
00:05:00.974 --> 00:05:03.443
Well... Regardless, we won.

104
00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:05.583
"Regardless, we won?"

105
00:05:06.484 --> 00:05:08.054
Didn't you see how he looked...

106
00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:09.984
when it came up earlier?

107
00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:11.624
I did.

108
00:05:11.984 --> 00:05:13.953
Don't you think about...

109
00:05:13.953 --> 00:05:15.224
how he must feel right now?

110
00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:18.794
Why must I do that?

111
00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:21.364
What?

112
00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:24.504
I'm a prosecutor, not a lawyer.

113
00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:25.773
Ms. Ma!

114
00:05:28.874 --> 00:05:30.304
Are you a psychopath?

115
00:05:32.744 --> 00:05:33.974
A psychopath?

116
00:05:35.174 --> 00:05:36.383
Ma.

117
00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:53.734
Woo Sung.

118
00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:57.533
Woo Sung.

119
00:06:27.664 --> 00:06:28.864
What happened?

120
00:06:29.564 --> 00:06:32.164
How did they find out about Woo Sung?

121
00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.273
When did you prepare the recording?

122
00:06:36.643 --> 00:06:39.443
- The thing is... - Long time no see,

123
00:06:40.174 --> 00:06:41.273
Ms. Min.

124
00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:48.583
It's been a while, Chief Cho...

125
00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:52.994
Should I be calling you mayor candidate Cho?

126
00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:01.234
Ms. Min.

127
00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:05.164
You haven't changed in the last 20 years.

128
00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:10.573
You can't improve if you only look back.

129
00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:13.443
Same goes for you.

130
00:07:13.773 --> 00:07:15.883
You're still shameless and brazen.

131
00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:21.984
Let's not fight...

132
00:07:22.783 --> 00:07:24.153
in front of the kids.

133
00:07:29.794 --> 00:07:32.164
You're the prosecutor from earlier, right?

134
00:07:33.033 --> 00:07:35.164
I enjoyed the trial.

135
00:07:39.674 --> 00:07:41.934
You need to bring up your game, Heo.

136
00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:45.773
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:54.114
It was you in the washroom, right?

138
00:07:56.624 --> 00:07:58.383
- Pardon? - The phone.

139
00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:01.593
You left it outside for me to see.

140
00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:03.224
You sent a fake text.

141
00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:04.593
Am I wrong?

142
00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:07.664
I don't remember doing such a thing.

143
00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.504
Of course not.

144
00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:17.104
Did such a thing happen?

145
00:08:18.044 --> 00:08:19.174
Yes.

146
00:08:19.914 --> 00:08:22.684
I didn't know it was a trap she made.

147
00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:24.244
I learned my lesson.

148
00:08:24.914 --> 00:08:26.354
I'll be careful from now.

149
00:08:31.084 --> 00:08:33.393
All right, then. See you next time.

150
00:08:58.584 --> 00:09:00.254
Ms. Sun will take her appeal...

151
00:09:00.754 --> 00:09:02.653
to Kang and Oh.

152
00:09:03.354 --> 00:09:05.124
Did you hear?

153
00:09:06.324 --> 00:09:08.423
Yes. I know, sir.

154
00:09:09.063 --> 00:09:11.763
Then you must know that my offer for you...

155
00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:13.864
at Sunwoo Foundation is no longer valid.

156
00:09:14.234 --> 00:09:15.293
Yes.

157
00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:17.834
If you do, then you can walk back.

158
00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:20.533
Remind yourself of your beginning.

159
00:09:33.883 --> 00:09:35.984
What a funny girl.

160
00:09:36.383 --> 00:09:37.624
Are you talking about Heo?

161
00:09:39.494 --> 00:09:42.694
Have you heard of the fishing prosecutor?

162
00:09:44.124 --> 00:09:45.194
Pardon?

163
00:09:45.964 --> 00:09:48.364
They leaked information about the victim...

164
00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:51.334
as if it would become a useful evidence...

165
00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:55.004
and used it as bait on the defense.

166
00:09:55.874 --> 00:09:57.173
Is there such a prosecutor?

167
00:09:58.204 --> 00:09:59.273
There is.

168
00:10:00.844 --> 00:10:04.183
She's under that stubborn Min Ji Sook.

169
00:10:05.283 --> 00:10:06.984
Isn't it funny?

170
00:10:07.354 --> 00:10:10.124
I'll look into her.

171
00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:14.893
A prosecutor isn't in a detective agency!

172
00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:15.964
What?

173
00:10:15.994 --> 00:10:18.224
I've considered the secondary damages.

174
00:10:18.594 --> 00:10:20.893
- And? - You know better than me.

175
00:10:20.994 --> 00:10:23.364
You know how rape trials are run in Korea.

176
00:10:24.364 --> 00:10:26.033
A man in his 40s approached...

177
00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:28.204
a teenage girl saying he'll make her an idol...

178
00:10:28.204 --> 00:10:29.543
and then raped her.

179
00:10:30.803 --> 00:10:33.614
It was a case handled by your team.

180
00:10:36.313 --> 00:10:38.143
The court saw it as voluntary sex,

181
00:10:38.143 --> 00:10:39.183
and he was released as a free man.

182
00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:42.783
There was DNA evidence and a witness testimony.

183
00:10:42.854 --> 00:10:44.354
But the verdict can change with few drops of tears...

184
00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:45.854
from the assailant.

185
00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:48.254
On top of that, this case had a female assailant.

186
00:10:48.354 --> 00:10:49.763
We didn't have evidence...

187
00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:51.124
to show that she attempted to rape him.

188
00:10:51.124 --> 00:10:54.263
Without the recording, it was 100 percent sure...

189
00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:55.734
she would be found innocent.

190
00:10:56.633 --> 00:10:58.334
You're saying you had no other choice?

191
00:10:58.334 --> 00:11:01.474
I decided we must win even if I have to cheat.

192
00:11:01.874 --> 00:11:04.104
Ms. Sun is the assailant and that is a fact.

193
00:11:04.204 --> 00:11:05.273
Fact.

194
00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:09.013
Then what will you do about this?

195
00:11:10.444 --> 00:11:13.484
There's nothing about a hard-working student...

196
00:11:13.484 --> 00:11:15.283
that was almost raped by his professor.

197
00:11:15.824 --> 00:11:18.283
They're only making it into a gossip.

198
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.923
Didn't you expect this with the recording?

199
00:11:24.023 --> 00:11:25.194
Ma.

200
00:11:25.563 --> 00:11:28.633
You must think that you're talented.

201
00:11:29.163 --> 00:11:30.234
You're not.

202
00:11:30.663 --> 00:11:32.263
It's because you're incompetent...

203
00:11:32.263 --> 00:11:34.933
you keep turning towards ways to cheat!

204
00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:37.974
Let me ask you something.

205
00:11:40.013 --> 00:11:41.714
When you first came to CAGU,

206
00:11:41.714 --> 00:11:42.844
you told me...

207
00:11:42.844 --> 00:11:45.984
that you applied somewhere due to personal reasons.

208
00:11:46.653 --> 00:11:47.653
Yes.

209
00:11:47.653 --> 00:11:49.624
What is that personal reason?

210
00:11:50.254 --> 00:11:51.454
Are you dying to move up?

211
00:11:51.683 --> 00:11:54.293
Do you have someone to avenge?

212
00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:57.464
Must I tell you that much?

213
00:11:57.464 --> 00:11:58.523
No.

214
00:11:58.523 --> 00:12:01.763
I'm telling you this place isn't where you can...

215
00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.263
take your personal issues out!

216
00:12:05.334 --> 00:12:07.033
Just write a statement of reasons and leave.

217
00:12:08.374 --> 00:12:10.643
What? A statement?

218
00:12:10.643 --> 00:12:11.643
You don't want to?

219
00:12:12.413 --> 00:12:14.574
Should I write it to the disciplinary committee?

220
00:12:26.254 --> 00:12:29.224
Miss, you have to pay first.

221
00:12:32.263 --> 00:12:33.364
How much is it?

222
00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:42.543
What is it?

223
00:12:42.903 --> 00:12:45.604
Can't a psychopath hold up her own bag?

224
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.744
- We need to talk. - Ms. Min gave me a talk.

225
00:12:49.183 --> 00:12:51.614
I'll decline if you're planning to add.

226
00:12:52.614 --> 00:12:53.954
The trial...

227
00:12:53.954 --> 00:12:55.383
Don't talk about the trial.

228
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.584
I know it's bad timing, but...

229
00:12:56.584 --> 00:12:59.023
Then don't talk about it!

230
00:12:59.023 --> 00:13:00.523
- Ms. Ma. - Stop it!

231
00:13:00.523 --> 00:13:02.153
When are you moving?

232
00:13:03.694 --> 00:13:05.793
- Pardon? - Your move.

233
00:13:06.063 --> 00:13:07.633
Are you even looking?

234
00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:09.704
Moving?

235
00:13:10.063 --> 00:13:11.763
I have a lot of people that want to move in,

236
00:13:11.763 --> 00:13:13.004
but you haven't mentioned about leaving,

237
00:13:13.004 --> 00:13:14.504
so I'm in a bind.

238
00:13:14.874 --> 00:13:18.474
Also, seeing you after work feels like...

239
00:13:18.803 --> 00:13:21.273
I'm still at work. It's uncomfortable.

240
00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:24.084
I'm sure you find it uncomfortable too.

241
00:13:24.313 --> 00:13:25.584
Yes, well...

242
00:13:25.584 --> 00:13:27.413
Great. I'm glad.

243
00:13:28.283 --> 00:13:30.254
You should look around and let me know.

244
00:13:31.324 --> 00:13:32.324
All right, then.

245
00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:50.474
Gosh.

246
00:13:51.273 --> 00:13:53.344
That newborn punk.

247
00:13:53.344 --> 00:13:55.883
How can he say that while looking at me?

248
00:13:56.944 --> 00:13:58.013
Gosh.

249
00:13:59.653 --> 00:14:01.354
When I was a newbie like him,

250
00:14:01.354 --> 00:14:04.053
I told my boss he's like my vitamin...

251
00:14:04.053 --> 00:14:06.194
and that he gives me energy.

252
00:14:06.724 --> 00:14:08.694
I was always sugarcoating everything.

253
00:14:08.694 --> 00:14:10.494
That guy has a high IQ,

254
00:14:10.494 --> 00:14:12.533
but he has zero talent in socializing.

255
00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:15.594
I'm getting beat by my boss...

256
00:14:16.004 --> 00:14:17.364
and my underling.

257
00:14:29.813 --> 00:14:32.413
When you first came to CAGU, you told me...

258
00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:35.754
that you applied somewhere due to personal reasons.

259
00:14:36.683 --> 00:14:38.584
What is that personal reason?

260
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.494
Are you dying to move up?

261
00:14:40.824 --> 00:14:41.954
Do you have someone...

262
00:14:41.954 --> 00:14:43.464
to avenge?

263
00:15:16.293 --> 00:15:19.234
(Missing)

264
00:15:23.903 --> 00:15:26.673
Who keeps on taking them off?

265
00:15:26.673 --> 00:15:30.344
(2003)

266
00:15:30.903 --> 00:15:33.714
I posted five copies here yesterday.

267
00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:35.244
But when I was passing by to make a delivery,

268
00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:36.744
they were all gone again!

269
00:15:37.683 --> 00:15:38.984
It's driving me crazy.

270
00:15:39.084 --> 00:15:40.183
Do you think...

271
00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:42.183
it's the person that kidnapped her?

272
00:15:42.183 --> 00:15:43.653
The one that stole the posters.

273
00:15:44.023 --> 00:15:46.923
- What? - What if he lives here?

274
00:15:46.923 --> 00:15:48.153
If the woman he kidnapped...

275
00:15:48.153 --> 00:15:50.523
is all over the neighborhood,

276
00:15:50.523 --> 00:15:52.933
he must feel guilty. He would be uncomfortable.

277
00:15:53.163 --> 00:15:54.393
That makes sense.

278
00:15:55.464 --> 00:15:58.303
Let's go to the station and ask for CCTV footages.

279
00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:01.803
That's the kidnapper!

280
00:16:09.313 --> 00:16:10.984
(Ham Se Na)

281
00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:16.653
Ma Yi Deum.

282
00:16:17.523 --> 00:16:19.454
I heard you posted a complaint online...

283
00:16:20.293 --> 00:16:21.694
saying that my dad was incompetent...

284
00:16:21.694 --> 00:16:23.293
and couldn't find your mom.

285
00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:25.324
What about it?

286
00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:27.433
I didn't make it up.

287
00:16:27.433 --> 00:16:29.633
My dad is being transferred far away.

288
00:16:30.204 --> 00:16:31.834
I have to transfer schools!

289
00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:37.273
That's why he should have found her.

290
00:16:37.744 --> 00:16:40.344
He should have told me why he failed at least.

291
00:16:40.543 --> 00:16:42.143
After three months, he left the case...

292
00:16:42.143 --> 00:16:43.383
until it became eight years old.

293
00:16:43.584 --> 00:16:45.183
Now, it's a cold case.

294
00:16:46.153 --> 00:16:47.553
It's dereliction of duty.

295
00:16:47.553 --> 00:16:48.553
What?

296
00:16:50.053 --> 00:16:51.683
My dad is not a superhero.

297
00:16:52.354 --> 00:16:54.793
Your mom ran away and is hiding.

298
00:16:54.793 --> 00:16:56.793
How can my dad find her?

299
00:16:57.893 --> 00:16:58.893
What?

300
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:00.563
Hey.

301
00:17:02.633 --> 00:17:04.904
Who says she ran away?

302
00:17:05.803 --> 00:17:06.974
Do you have evidence?

303
00:17:07.134 --> 00:17:08.533
The neighbors...

304
00:17:09.603 --> 00:17:11.444
are keeping it quiet because they pity you.

305
00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:12.974
Your mom...

306
00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:15.073
left you behind and ran away.

307
00:17:16.783 --> 00:17:18.914
Why would she leave me?

308
00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:20.583
Why?

309
00:17:20.783 --> 00:17:22.184
Hey!

310
00:17:22.184 --> 00:17:24.553
- Hey! - Stop it!

311
00:17:24.853 --> 00:17:26.494
Let go!

312
00:17:27.023 --> 00:17:29.063
Se Na. Gosh. Where's...

313
00:17:29.063 --> 00:17:30.123
Mom.

314
00:17:31.964 --> 00:17:33.994
What happened?

315
00:17:33.994 --> 00:17:35.803
I got a report saying kids were fighting,

316
00:17:35.803 --> 00:17:36.803
and it was Se Na.

317
00:17:36.803 --> 00:17:39.103
Who did this to you? Who?

318
00:17:43.773 --> 00:17:45.004
Was it you?

319
00:17:46.613 --> 00:17:49.144
What do you have against my family?

320
00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:51.914
You went on protests to find your mom,

321
00:17:51.914 --> 00:17:53.053
then you wrote a complaint online...

322
00:17:53.053 --> 00:17:54.783
and made my husband get reappointed.

323
00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.724
Now, you're beating my daughter?

324
00:17:56.724 --> 00:17:58.254
Well, the thing is...

325
00:17:58.254 --> 00:17:59.994
Yi Deum got hurt too.

326
00:17:59.994 --> 00:18:00.994
I didn't.

327
00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:02.823
Be quiet. You're the same.

328
00:18:05.224 --> 00:18:06.234
Look at that.

329
00:18:06.934 --> 00:18:09.033
She doesn't even say sorry.

330
00:18:09.563 --> 00:18:11.404
It's because you're so evil...

331
00:18:11.404 --> 00:18:12.934
that your mom ran away!

332
00:18:12.934 --> 00:18:14.803
How would you know?

333
00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.303
Did you see my mom run away?

334
00:18:17.303 --> 00:18:18.373
Stop it!

335
00:18:19.214 --> 00:18:20.714
Go home with Se Na.

336
00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:21.974
Now!

337
00:18:25.714 --> 00:18:27.853
Let's go. Gosh.

338
00:18:34.793 --> 00:18:36.164
You should go home too.

339
00:18:39.194 --> 00:18:40.194
Mister.

340
00:18:41.234 --> 00:18:43.904
I didn't write the complaint to harm you.

341
00:18:45.004 --> 00:18:46.704
I just wanted to find my mom.

342
00:18:47.504 --> 00:18:49.103
I miss her.

343
00:18:49.644 --> 00:18:53.343
I just want to know if she's alive.

344
00:18:54.373 --> 00:18:55.474
That's why...

345
00:18:57.444 --> 00:19:01.013
Just assume that she's alive and well somewhere.

346
00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:03.954
Runaway moms always come back...

347
00:19:05.254 --> 00:19:06.553
at least once...

348
00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:08.053
to see their kids.

349
00:19:08.053 --> 00:19:09.293
That's not true!

350
00:19:09.293 --> 00:19:11.563
My mom didn't run away!

351
00:19:14.994 --> 00:19:17.504
She's not showing up because she's alive.

352
00:19:17.803 --> 00:19:19.704
If she died, we would have found the body.

353
00:19:28.313 --> 00:19:29.313
No...

354
00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:32.384
You'll never find her if you do this.

355
00:19:32.384 --> 00:19:35.553
Someone who saw her might pass by tomorrow.

356
00:19:35.553 --> 00:19:36.553
Forget it.

357
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:39.123
I'm going to find her myself.

358
00:19:39.293 --> 00:19:40.994
How?

359
00:19:42.093 --> 00:19:43.164
I don't know.

360
00:19:43.694 --> 00:19:45.994
I'll join the police or become the president.

361
00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.263
I'll find her myself.

362
00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:51.204
If she was kidnapped, I'll catch the culprit.

363
00:19:53.674 --> 00:19:54.734
If...

364
00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:57.573
she really ran away,

365
00:20:01.773 --> 00:20:04.144
I'm going to succeed and make her come to me.

366
00:20:05.684 --> 00:20:09.353
(Missing)

367
00:20:15.623 --> 00:20:16.894
Don't cry, Ma Yi Deum.

368
00:20:17.224 --> 00:20:18.593
You don't get anything out of crying.

369
00:20:46.754 --> 00:20:47.894

371

This is crazy.

372
00:21:14.984 --> 00:21:17.083
You look so beautiful.

373
00:21:17.454 --> 00:21:18.623
From this side, you look like Gianna Jun.

374
00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:19.994
From here, you're like Song Hye Kyo.

376

Whatever.

377
00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:26.234
Isn't this a bit too risque?

378
00:21:26.234 --> 00:21:29.164
Not at all, ma'am.

379
00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:31.434
You have a nice figure,

380
00:21:31.434 --> 00:21:33.273
and a pretty shoulder line,

381
00:21:33.273 --> 00:21:36.704
so it looks much better to show it off.

382
00:21:38.644 --> 00:21:41.373
Still, I think something more modest is better.

383

Many professors from your hospital will come.

384
00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:45.583
I guess.

385
00:21:46.254 --> 00:21:47.313
I like them all,

386
00:21:47.313 --> 00:21:48.553
so get what you want.

I'm sorry, I'm 5 minutes late.

400

Are you taking a trip?

No, ma'am.

402
00:23:03.194 --> 00:23:04.964
It's embarrassing...

403
00:23:07.664 --> 00:23:09.664
Did you see that everyone?

404
00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:12.734
This is the danger of ingesting sodium at night.

Let's get to work.

406
00:23:15.204 --> 00:23:17.144
Yes, ma'am. I'll start over.

407
00:23:17.504 --> 00:23:18.803
This is the sex video case...

408
00:23:18.803 --> 00:23:20.244
from last week.

409
00:23:21.343 --> 00:23:22.543
The victim is Song Ga Young,

410
00:23:22.543 --> 00:23:24.184
a kindergarten teacher in her 30s.

411
00:23:24.184 --> 00:23:26.414
She's getting married next month.

412
00:23:27.684 --> 00:23:29.754
The prime suspect, Sang Gyoon Kim,

413
00:23:29.754 --> 00:23:32.793
is her ex-boyfriend from two years ago.

414
00:23:32.793 --> 00:23:35.053
He is currently in between jobs.

415
00:23:35.053 --> 00:23:36.394
A suspect?

416
00:23:36.394 --> 00:23:39.194
Maybe he got angry that his ex was engaged...

417
00:23:39.363 --> 00:23:41.194
and posted it online.

418
00:23:41.194 --> 00:23:44.134
He claims he is also a victim.

419
00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:45.363
After checking the video,

420
00:23:45.363 --> 00:23:47.603
we confirmed that his face is shown briefly as well.

421
00:23:47.603 --> 00:23:50.303
Still, who looks at the guy's face?

422
00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:52.174
They remember only the girl's face.

423
00:23:52.813 --> 00:23:54.144
Right, Mr. Koo?

424
00:23:57.043 --> 00:23:58.813
I don't watch, so I wouldn't know.

425
00:23:59.254 --> 00:24:00.313
Really?

426
00:24:09.093 --> 00:24:10.994
Ever since I joined CAGU,

427
00:24:12.434 --> 00:24:13.793
I quit porn.

428
00:24:14.363 --> 00:24:16.063
Especially with regular people's videos,

429
00:24:16.303 --> 00:24:18.734
it feels like I'm sinning just by watching.

430
00:24:20.103 --> 00:24:21.103
Okay.

431
00:24:21.474 --> 00:24:22.504
Anyway,

432
00:24:22.904 --> 00:24:24.504
our investigation will prove...

433
00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:26.043
whether or not he's a victim.

434
00:24:27.444 --> 00:24:29.013
Everyone, say something.

435
00:24:30.184 --> 00:24:32.043
I predict it will be difficult.

436
00:24:32.214 --> 00:24:33.613
It will be punishable...

437
00:24:33.613 --> 00:24:35.414
according to Criminal Law on Sexual Assault.

438
00:24:35.754 --> 00:24:37.583
But she consented to filming the video.

439
00:24:37.583 --> 00:24:39.654
There is no proof it was uploaded intentionally.

440
00:24:39.654 --> 00:24:42.424
I also vote for it'll be difficult.

441
00:24:42.823 --> 00:24:45.063
Even if we prove a crime was committed,

442
00:24:45.063 --> 00:24:46.194
it's his first offense,

443
00:24:46.194 --> 00:24:48.333
so it'll likely end with just a fine.

444
00:24:48.464 --> 00:24:50.934
If you're all going to say such thoughtless things,

445
00:24:50.934 --> 00:24:52.033
go home.

446
00:24:52.634 --> 00:24:54.674
Do you think this law is a joke?

447
00:24:55.204 --> 00:24:56.444
Because people get fined,

448
00:24:56.444 --> 00:24:58.573
you think it's like public urination?

449
00:24:58.974 --> 00:25:00.914
Imagine a video of your nude body...

450
00:25:00.914 --> 00:25:03.214
is circulating online.

451
00:25:03.214 --> 00:25:04.214
Will you...

452
00:25:04.944 --> 00:25:06.513
just fine the person because it is...

453
00:25:06.513 --> 00:25:08.013
his first offense and there isn't much evidence?

454
00:25:09.023 --> 00:25:11.984
Circulating illegally filmed videos...

455
00:25:11.984 --> 00:25:13.994
is like murdering a person's character.

456
00:25:16.164 --> 00:25:17.724
As long as it's our case,

457
00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.533
I want to create precedent that a first offender...

458
00:25:19.533 --> 00:25:21.134
can be punished severely.

459
00:25:21.464 --> 00:25:22.533
Who'll do it?

460
00:25:28.603 --> 00:25:30.773
I'll give it a shot.

461
00:25:35.373 --> 00:25:36.444
Ma?

462
00:25:38.414 --> 00:25:40.654
As sort of a penance for yesterday's trial.

463
00:25:40.754 --> 00:25:42.583
With a new heart and new conviction,

464
00:25:43.053 --> 00:25:44.654
I'll make a new start.

465
00:25:48.424 --> 00:25:50.563
I'll be thoughtful and considerate...

466
00:25:50.563 --> 00:25:54.593
so the victim does not cry twice again.

467
00:25:59.103 --> 00:26:00.634
You can't do it alone.

468
00:26:01.504 --> 00:26:02.843
Yeo will work with you.

469
00:26:06.813 --> 00:26:08.444
What? No?

470
00:26:08.714 --> 00:26:09.813
Then don't do it.

471
00:26:09.813 --> 00:26:12.553
I don't want to be stabbed in the back again.

472
00:26:12.553 --> 00:26:15.013
No, ma'am. I'll work hard.

473
00:26:15.013 --> 00:26:16.023
Okay.

474
00:26:18.123 --> 00:26:20.254
Let's talk later.

475
00:26:24.323 --> 00:26:27.664
Our emotions were running high yesterday,

476
00:26:27.734 --> 00:26:29.803
but when you get a good night's sleep,

477
00:26:29.863 --> 00:26:31.934
you return to being sane.

478
00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:34.004
In light of that,

479
00:26:35.103 --> 00:26:36.404
don't you want to say something?

480
00:26:39.513 --> 00:26:40.513
Were you offended...

481
00:26:40.513 --> 00:26:42.144
that I called you a psychopath?

482
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:43.313
Yes, very offended.

483
00:26:43.313 --> 00:26:44.914
It was very rude,

484
00:26:44.914 --> 00:26:47.484
but we work together, so if you apologize,

485
00:26:47.884 --> 00:26:49.323
I'll let it slide.

486
00:26:51.954 --> 00:26:53.593
I'm so magnanimous.

487
00:26:53.593 --> 00:26:54.593
I don't know.

488
00:26:55.053 --> 00:26:56.194
You don't know?

489
00:26:56.194 --> 00:26:58.263
You were the rude one, to be honest.

490
00:26:59.063 --> 00:27:01.134
- I was? - To Woo Sung.

491
00:27:01.934 --> 00:27:03.204
Did you apologize?

492
00:27:03.603 --> 00:27:05.033
Of course, not.

493
00:27:05.204 --> 00:27:07.174
Do you know how terrifying coming out is...

494
00:27:07.174 --> 00:27:08.373
for homosexuals?

495
00:27:08.373 --> 00:27:09.773
Of course, not.

496
00:27:09.773 --> 00:27:11.904
You probably think you don't need to know.

497
00:27:11.904 --> 00:27:14.043
- What are you... - You may have won...

498
00:27:14.043 --> 00:27:16.384
the trial, but you killed a person.

499
00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.684
That's why I don't need to apologize...

500
00:27:19.154 --> 00:27:21.353
for calling you a psychopath.

501
00:27:27.424 --> 00:27:28.494
Does that hurt?

502
00:27:28.694 --> 00:27:31.194
Losing a trial hurts 100 times more.

503
00:27:31.194 --> 00:27:32.694
What? Apologize?

504
00:27:33.293 --> 00:27:34.664
To a prosecutor,

505
00:27:34.664 --> 00:27:36.404
winning is apologizing.

506
00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:38.164
Ms. Ma.

507
00:27:38.164 --> 00:27:40.033
It's so frustrating...

508
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.603
working with an older rookie.

509
00:27:41.603 --> 00:27:43.273
I'll stick to you...

510
00:27:43.273 --> 00:27:45.773
and rearrange that brain of yours.

511
00:27:45.773 --> 00:27:46.813
Just wait.

512
00:27:50.214 --> 00:27:51.384
I put my place up for rent.

513
00:27:51.684 --> 00:27:52.783
I'll leave right away,

514
00:27:52.783 --> 00:27:54.954
so refund my deposit right away, okay?

515
00:28:02.394 --> 00:28:03.664
Why is there so much?

516
00:28:03.664 --> 00:28:04.763
Hidden camera cases.

517
00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:07.533
They cracked down on hidden cameras last month.

518
00:28:07.934 --> 00:28:11.164
Sex-trafficking cases of minors are backed up.

519
00:28:11.404 --> 00:28:12.934
What's this case about...

520
00:28:12.934 --> 00:28:14.474
that it's so thick?

521
00:28:14.474 --> 00:28:15.803
This one...

522
00:28:16.043 --> 00:28:18.504
is a bit ambiguous and preposterous.

523
00:28:18.803 --> 00:28:20.174
It's unclear who's the principal...

524
00:28:20.174 --> 00:28:21.474
of the crime.

525
00:28:22.043 --> 00:28:25.144
They should be here soon for questioning.

526
00:28:27.954 --> 00:28:28.954
Excuse me.

527
00:28:35.023 --> 00:28:36.994
I'm very sorry.

528
00:28:37.924 --> 00:28:41.494
I didn't know he was taking such photos.

529
00:28:41.664 --> 00:28:43.164
He kept asking for my phone,

530
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:45.434
so I thought he was watching cartoons.

531
00:28:45.434 --> 00:28:47.533
In other words,

532
00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:49.444
this kid...

533
00:28:49.704 --> 00:28:53.273
took upskirt photos using your phone.

534
00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:55.644
Is that it?

535
00:28:55.944 --> 00:28:56.944
Yes.

536
00:28:57.684 --> 00:28:59.654
He's very mischievous.

537
00:29:00.013 --> 00:29:01.954
I would've scolded him if I had known sooner.

538
00:29:03.984 --> 00:29:05.853
I'm too busy working,

539
00:29:07.353 --> 00:29:08.694
and he has no mom, so...

540
00:29:10.994 --> 00:29:12.894
It's tough raising a kid.

541
00:29:15.763 --> 00:29:18.204
Daddy, don't cry.

542
00:29:18.204 --> 00:29:20.234
Daddy's fine.

543
00:29:23.904 --> 00:29:24.904
Son.

544
00:29:25.744 --> 00:29:27.174
Do you like Thunderman?

545
00:29:28.513 --> 00:29:30.543
Taking pictures up women's skirts...

546
00:29:30.543 --> 00:29:32.353
is a very bad thing.

547
00:29:32.714 --> 00:29:33.853
If you do it again,

548
00:29:33.853 --> 00:29:35.684
Thunderman will punish you.

549
00:29:37.083 --> 00:29:38.083
Okay?

550
00:29:41.323 --> 00:29:43.123
Thank you very much.

551
00:29:51.763 --> 00:29:53.373
Why did you just let him go?

552
00:29:54.174 --> 00:29:56.474
Do you really believe that the kid did it?

553
00:29:57.373 --> 00:29:59.414
He said he did it without his dad knowing.

554
00:30:03.444 --> 00:30:05.384
You didn't see them because they just came,

555
00:30:05.384 --> 00:30:08.053
but he received over 80 citations from officers...

556
00:30:08.053 --> 00:30:09.954
making rounds on the subway.

557
00:30:09.954 --> 00:30:12.394
And although it's old, he was caught...

558
00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:15.424
secretly taking photos and paid a fine.

559
00:30:15.424 --> 00:30:17.464
Yes? So what?

560
00:30:17.724 --> 00:30:20.234
You want me to accuse him based on gut feelings...

561
00:30:20.234 --> 00:30:21.863
and send him to jail?

562
00:30:22.704 --> 00:30:23.734
What about the kid?

563
00:30:24.033 --> 00:30:26.634
They're divorced, so he doesn't even have a mom.

564
00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:29.444
You're the type...

565
00:30:29.444 --> 00:30:30.944
that gets weak when you see a child.

566
00:30:30.944 --> 00:30:32.273
Whatever.

567
00:30:32.674 --> 00:30:33.773
If you irks you so much,

568
00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:36.984
you can bring me evidence yourself.

569
00:30:36.984 --> 00:30:40.113
But I'll be nice and process this case.

570
00:30:40.984 --> 00:30:43.083
What? What? What is it?

571
00:30:45.323 --> 00:30:47.224
Insufficient evidence. No culpability.

572
00:30:47.224 --> 00:30:49.123
Non-indictment.

573
00:30:49.793 --> 00:30:50.894
It's work for me.

574
00:30:51.293 --> 00:30:52.763
(Video Recorded Interrogation Room)

575
00:30:57.563 --> 00:30:59.033
Ta-da.

576
00:30:59.573 --> 00:31:00.803
Happy 100 days.

577
00:31:06.414 --> 00:31:07.843
I have another gift.

578
00:31:07.974 --> 00:31:09.884
- What is it? - Come here.

579
00:31:10.484 --> 00:31:11.484
What...

580
00:31:12.754 --> 00:31:15.414
You have to delete this, okay?

581
00:31:15.414 --> 00:31:17.184
Okay.

582
00:31:18.424 --> 00:31:19.494
What is it?

583
00:31:19.754 --> 00:31:20.924
The gift is...

584
00:31:20.924 --> 00:31:21.954
Yes?

585
00:31:24.563 --> 00:31:25.833
You're so sexy.

586
00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:30.303
It was all over the web already.

587
00:31:30.964 --> 00:31:32.434
They called me Gangnam Single Lady.

588
00:31:33.434 --> 00:31:35.333
When was the video filmed?

589
00:31:36.504 --> 00:31:38.043
On our 100th day anniversary.

590
00:31:39.214 --> 00:31:43.013
Could you explain in more detail please?

591
00:31:44.714 --> 00:31:46.954
It was two summers ago.

592
00:31:47.313 --> 00:31:49.523
You only recently saw the video.

593
00:31:50.023 --> 00:31:53.194
Did you not know that the video was circulating?

594
00:31:54.154 --> 00:31:55.323
Of course, not.

595
00:31:55.964 --> 00:31:58.894
I didn't even imagine that the video was around.

596
00:31:59.763 --> 00:32:01.964
We deleted it...

597
00:32:02.093 --> 00:32:03.763
right away.

598
00:32:04.734 --> 00:32:07.174
Who saves sex videos nowadays?

599
00:32:08.234 --> 00:32:09.474
I only did it...

600
00:32:09.504 --> 00:32:12.174
because he said he'd delete it right away.

601
00:32:12.174 --> 00:32:15.013
And I saw him delete it.

602
00:32:15.444 --> 00:32:18.083
Did you find any other videos?

603
00:32:19.053 --> 00:32:20.283
I don't know yet.

604
00:32:21.414 --> 00:32:22.823
But I think there are.

605
00:32:23.454 --> 00:32:26.353
He always wanted to take pictures and videos.

606
00:32:26.853 --> 00:32:28.323
So we fought a lot.

607
00:32:28.954 --> 00:32:30.763
I was nervous when we broke up...

608
00:32:31.224 --> 00:32:33.063
that there were pictures that I didn't know about.

609
00:32:34.033 --> 00:32:37.603
But he started dating right after we broke up.

610
00:32:38.033 --> 00:32:39.404
So I was relaxed.

611
00:32:40.404 --> 00:32:41.603
But he uploaded this.

612
00:32:41.734 --> 00:32:44.273
Kim Sang Gyoon claims he's a victim as well...

613
00:32:44.704 --> 00:32:46.843
and that someone else leaked the video.

614
00:32:46.944 --> 00:32:50.184
Give me a break. That jerk is a demon.

615
00:32:51.484 --> 00:32:54.613
He lied about deleting it and kept it! I'm positive.

616
00:33:04.964 --> 00:33:05.994
Delete it.

617
00:33:12.634 --> 00:33:14.704
Okay. You confirmed that it's gone, right?

618
00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:16.474
Right?

619
00:33:17.773 --> 00:33:18.873
But...

620
00:33:23.684 --> 00:33:24.884
Ta-da.

621
00:33:27.353 --> 00:33:29.523
It isn't even that high-tech.

622
00:33:30.154 --> 00:33:32.424
If you set up auto back-up to the cloud,

623
00:33:32.494 --> 00:33:34.623
deleting it locally is useless.

624
00:33:34.754 --> 00:33:36.293
They're so smart.

625
00:33:36.664 --> 00:33:39.833
Are you saying this is how Sang Gyoon uploaded it?

626
00:33:39.863 --> 00:33:42.164
It is still just a deduction.

627
00:33:42.234 --> 00:33:43.704
What about the video?

628
00:33:44.533 --> 00:33:45.634
Do we have the results?

629
00:33:45.873 --> 00:33:47.174
I looked,

630
00:33:47.504 --> 00:33:50.404
and Kim Sang Gyoon's face was slightly blurred,

631
00:33:50.873 --> 00:33:53.974
but that alone is a big ambiguous.

632
00:33:54.013 --> 00:33:55.783
So there's nothing concrete.

633
00:33:56.484 --> 00:33:58.783
Why did you call us here to tell us nothing?

634
00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:04.853
Well, I was just about to start telling you.

635
00:34:05.023 --> 00:34:06.123
What is it?

636
00:34:07.324 --> 00:34:09.623
Just in case, I checked...

637
00:34:09.793 --> 00:34:12.864
the ip address in China, the original source.

638
00:34:13.034 --> 00:34:14.964
I tracked the ip address,

639
00:34:14.964 --> 00:34:17.103
and found an unexpected file.

640
00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:18.933
Another video?

641
00:34:21.433 --> 00:34:24.603
Well, it was posted on an illegal site...

642
00:34:25.004 --> 00:34:27.473
and was asked to be removed.

643
00:34:27.674 --> 00:34:30.143
They didn't delete it all and parts of it remained.

644
00:34:30.284 --> 00:34:32.654
What's the guarantee that it was the same guy?

645
00:34:34.154 --> 00:34:36.054
Why don't you watch first?

646
00:34:38.554 --> 00:34:39.554
Okay.

647
00:34:49.534 --> 00:34:52.203
But he started dating right after we broke up.

648
00:34:52.504 --> 00:34:53.873
So I was relaxed.

649
00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:56.773
What? Did Kim Sang Gyoon film another one?

650
00:34:56.904 --> 00:34:58.404
A second victim.

651
00:34:58.703 --> 00:35:00.773
Can you find out who she is?

652
00:35:01.913 --> 00:35:02.944
Me?

653
00:35:04.444 --> 00:35:05.543
Well,

654
00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:08.313
if there is a record of her request to delete it,

655
00:35:08.313 --> 00:35:11.284
I can probably find out if I get it from Ms. Song.

656
00:35:11.924 --> 00:35:14.893
Is Kim Sang Gyoon still MIA, Ms. Song?

657
00:35:14.953 --> 00:35:17.364
I called all morning, but he wouldn't answer.

658
00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:19.264
I think he blocked our number.

659
00:35:19.393 --> 00:35:20.893
He won't cooperate?

660
00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:23.364
We'll get a warrant and put out an APB on him.

661
00:35:30.103 --> 00:35:31.873
There's a good chance Kim Sang Gyoon...

662
00:35:32.074 --> 00:35:34.174
approached girls with the intention...

663
00:35:34.344 --> 00:35:36.214
of filming sex videos.

664
00:35:36.614 --> 00:35:39.614
As in, there are probably more victims.

665
00:35:40.453 --> 00:35:42.384
At a scale this big,

666
00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:44.953
shouldn't we consider distribution too?

667
00:35:45.754 --> 00:35:47.054
Here it is.

668
00:35:55.594 --> 00:35:57.163
Enter it into my GPS for me.

669
00:36:03.203 --> 00:36:04.703
What a pain.

670
00:36:06.674 --> 00:36:07.873
Name, Oh Min Jung.

671
00:36:08.174 --> 00:36:11.284
She was a famous hair designer in Apgujeong,

672
00:36:11.543 --> 00:36:14.583
but she quit her job and moved here.

673
00:36:20.353 --> 00:36:21.424
Hello.

674
00:36:21.754 --> 00:36:23.864
We're here to see Oh Min Jung.

675
00:36:25.594 --> 00:36:27.234
Oh Min Jung?

676
00:36:29.063 --> 00:36:30.364
There's no one by that name.

677
00:36:32.004 --> 00:36:34.373
- Who are you? - I'm...

678
00:36:39.143 --> 00:36:40.473
Please finish up.

679
00:36:41.714 --> 00:36:42.714
Okay.

680
00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:48.384
When I moved here, I changed my name.

681
00:36:50.683 --> 00:36:54.194
In apartment complexes, rumors spread quickly.

682
00:36:55.054 --> 00:36:56.523
Don't worry too much.

683
00:36:56.663 --> 00:36:58.694
We'll leave after asking a couple of questions.

684
00:36:59.433 --> 00:37:01.594
How did you meet Kim Sang Gyoon?

685
00:37:02.094 --> 00:37:03.734
I dated that jerk...

686
00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:05.904
while I was on a break from the baby's dad.

687
00:37:06.404 --> 00:37:08.304
We dated maybe three months.

688
00:37:09.643 --> 00:37:10.973
I liked him at first.

689
00:37:11.243 --> 00:37:14.014
He was younger, cute, and nice.

690
00:37:14.743 --> 00:37:18.014
He said he'd propose if he passed his test.

691
00:37:18.714 --> 00:37:22.313
I was stupid and did anything he wanted.

692
00:37:22.754 --> 00:37:23.953
What he wanted?

693
00:37:25.824 --> 00:37:26.953
Videos.

694
00:37:27.824 --> 00:37:29.764
He liked filming videos.

695
00:37:30.223 --> 00:37:32.163
At first, I played along like a game,

696
00:37:32.433 --> 00:37:35.264
but it got annoying because it was nonstop.

697
00:37:36.404 --> 00:37:38.804
I thought he was a pervert and that scared me too.

698
00:37:39.703 --> 00:37:41.074
Is that why you broke up?

699
00:37:41.674 --> 00:37:42.703
No.

700
00:37:43.674 --> 00:37:46.944
I caught him cheating with a girl he met at a club.

701
00:37:48.313 --> 00:37:50.114
He was just too much,

702
00:37:50.984 --> 00:37:52.243
so I asked him to break up.

703
00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:55.284
Then the videos popped up just before your wedding.

704
00:37:57.384 --> 00:37:58.453
Yes,

705
00:38:01.723 --> 00:38:04.194
A friend texted during the families' dinner.

706
00:38:05.223 --> 00:38:07.594
She said a strange video was circulating online,

707
00:38:08.134 --> 00:38:09.333
and that it looked like me,

708
00:38:13.174 --> 00:38:15.134
and to delete it before my fiance found out.

709
00:38:17.603 --> 00:38:19.844
I considered calling the police at first.

710
00:38:21.074 --> 00:38:24.543
But they'll only begin the investigation...

711
00:38:24.884 --> 00:38:28.683
if you submit screenshots of the photos and videos.

712
00:38:29.424 --> 00:38:31.023
My wedding was a month later,

713
00:38:31.784 --> 00:38:33.694
and I was pregnant with my first.

714
00:38:34.793 --> 00:38:36.424
Getting rid of it was priority,

715
00:38:36.893 --> 00:38:40.063
so I hired a company to delete the files.

716
00:38:41.493 --> 00:38:44.603
Do you know...

717
00:38:45.134 --> 00:38:47.203
why I'm telling you this?

718
00:38:50.473 --> 00:38:52.543
You said this happened to someone else too?

719
00:38:52.773 --> 00:38:53.844
Yes.

720
00:38:53.973 --> 00:38:56.313
- It'll go to court? - Yes, correct.

721
00:38:57.784 --> 00:38:59.183
Speaking of which,

722
00:39:01.353 --> 00:39:02.953
I won't testify.

723
00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:06.324
Don't call for me.

724
00:39:07.154 --> 00:39:08.324
Ms. Oh.

725
00:39:10.924 --> 00:39:14.393
I depleted my account to pay the fixer.

726
00:39:15.034 --> 00:39:16.804
I almost died.

727
00:39:17.264 --> 00:39:19.603
I still get sick when I think about it.

728
00:39:20.603 --> 00:39:23.404
Just hearing his name gives me chills.

729
00:39:23.773 --> 00:39:26.973
I pity the woman, but don't come back.

730
00:39:43.094 --> 00:39:44.123
What is it?

731
00:39:45.594 --> 00:39:46.964
Kim Sang Gyoon was arrested.

732
00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:49.203
They're bringing him in.

733
00:40:03.384 --> 00:40:06.884
He got caught for running from a sobriety test.

734
00:40:06.884 --> 00:40:09.384
- Was he drinking? - No. He panicked...

735
00:40:09.384 --> 00:40:10.754
when he heard about the arrest warrant.

736
00:40:10.754 --> 00:40:13.424
I can finally see what he looks like.

737
00:40:18.864 --> 00:40:19.964
Look.

738
00:40:20.694 --> 00:40:23.264
What psycho would post videos of himself...

739
00:40:24.634 --> 00:40:26.504
doing it with his girlfriend?

740
00:40:27.273 --> 00:40:29.504
It's clear what happens if you get caught.

741
00:40:30.473 --> 00:40:31.703
What happens?

742
00:40:32.944 --> 00:40:35.214
It's a special crime under sexual assault.

743
00:40:35.683 --> 00:40:39.353
"If you use a camera to record..."

744
00:40:40.683 --> 00:40:42.284
Stuff like that.

745
00:40:42.654 --> 00:40:43.984
Up to 5 years in jail...

746
00:40:43.984 --> 00:40:45.924
or a fine of up to 10,000 dollars.

747
00:40:47.654 --> 00:40:48.723
Right?

748
00:40:50.694 --> 00:40:52.893
You know it well, so why did you do it?

749
00:40:53.464 --> 00:40:54.464
Pardon?

750
00:40:54.793 --> 00:40:58.364
Were you angry about Ga Young getting married?

751
00:40:58.933 --> 00:41:00.904
You're still unemployed,

752
00:41:01.004 --> 00:41:03.143
preparing to be a civil servant...

753
00:41:03.143 --> 00:41:05.273
while working part time for 1,000 dollars a month.

754
00:41:05.813 --> 00:41:08.913
Your ex-girlfriend was marrying a wealthy doctor,

755
00:41:10.014 --> 00:41:12.114
so you wanted to post the video for revenge?

756
00:41:13.183 --> 00:41:14.583
That's too cliche.

757
00:41:15.514 --> 00:41:18.453
- What? - We broke up long ago.

758
00:41:18.924 --> 00:41:20.893
It's been like two years already.

759
00:41:21.654 --> 00:41:23.694
I can barely remember her face.

760
00:41:23.864 --> 00:41:25.464
Why would I get revenge?

761
00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:28.993
Also,

762
00:41:30.864 --> 00:41:33.433
why do you treat me like I'm the perp?

763
00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:40.574
If I'm 30 years old...

764
00:41:41.413 --> 00:41:43.884
and make only 1,000 a month,

765
00:41:45.143 --> 00:41:48.413
I'm just a pervert that uploads sex videos?

766
00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:51.123
What was that?

767
00:42:03.703 --> 00:42:04.804
What about this?

768
00:42:09.373 --> 00:42:10.603
Remember her?

769
00:42:12.574 --> 00:42:13.574
I don't know.

770
00:42:14.473 --> 00:42:16.583
You have a camera at the same spot...

771
00:42:17.114 --> 00:42:19.384
and even the ip address is the same.

772
00:42:20.514 --> 00:42:22.214
You filmed them the same way,

773
00:42:22.214 --> 00:42:23.884
and sent the files from the same ip address.

774
00:42:23.884 --> 00:42:25.924
We can easily give you a harsh punishment.

775
00:42:26.694 --> 00:42:29.493
If we trace your bank account to obtain proof...

776
00:42:29.493 --> 00:42:31.324
of payment received,

777
00:42:31.694 --> 00:42:34.163
we can get you for distribution too.

778
00:42:38.864 --> 00:42:40.074
Sang Gyoon.

779
00:42:41.504 --> 00:42:45.043
Do you think we called you here to make jokes?

780
00:42:45.373 --> 00:42:47.043
You're quite frustrating.

781
00:42:47.543 --> 00:42:49.014
Come on.

782
00:42:50.043 --> 00:42:52.683
Who gets paid cash for uploading videos?

783
00:42:53.754 --> 00:42:55.254
You get e-currency.

784
00:42:56.083 --> 00:42:57.623
When business is good,

785
00:42:57.984 --> 00:42:59.594
you make over 10,000 dollars.

786
00:43:02.293 --> 00:43:04.094
The younger the girls,

787
00:43:05.023 --> 00:43:06.594
the better it sells.

788
00:43:11.004 --> 00:43:14.273
That's what I read once on the internet.

789
00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:17.643
Also,

790
00:43:19.273 --> 00:43:22.273
do you have proof that I spoofed my ip address?

791
00:43:25.183 --> 00:43:26.384
Do you?

792
00:43:28.054 --> 00:43:30.583
You have no way to find out how it leaked.

793
00:43:31.884 --> 00:43:33.953
That why you're trying to get me to confess.

794
00:43:35.254 --> 00:43:36.324
Right?

795
00:43:37.493 --> 00:43:38.694
Mr. Kim.

796
00:43:38.893 --> 00:43:41.034
You must like to make things bigger.

797
00:43:41.364 --> 00:43:43.433
I guess you seek out punishment.

798
00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:45.333
The more the better.

799
00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:49.674
Don't be rude.

800
00:43:50.674 --> 00:43:54.143
If a woman I never met before lectures me,

801
00:43:55.643 --> 00:43:57.413
I get upset.

802
00:43:57.543 --> 00:43:58.714
Oh my.

803
00:43:59.183 --> 00:44:01.754
Did you see me as a woman?

804
00:44:12.393 --> 00:44:14.034
You are a woman.

805
00:44:25.743 --> 00:44:27.114
Arrest him?

806
00:44:27.273 --> 00:44:29.413
We can hold him for 48 hours after arrest.

807
00:44:29.614 --> 00:44:32.353
We have to find the digital evidence...

808
00:44:32.413 --> 00:44:34.054
and arrest him once he have the original.

809
00:44:34.214 --> 00:44:35.853
Let's wait for the warrant.

810
00:44:36.054 --> 00:44:38.583
If the court complaints about how it was obtained,

811
00:44:39.154 --> 00:44:40.594
it will be inadmissible.

812
00:44:40.623 --> 00:44:42.493
Didn't you see how he was acting?

813
00:44:42.694 --> 00:44:45.364
He sexually harassed me without batting an eye.

814
00:44:45.933 --> 00:44:47.993
If we let him go now, he'll delete evidence.

815
00:44:48.563 --> 00:44:49.964
Let's get going.

816
00:44:50.234 --> 00:44:52.973
I'll get the warrant somehow.

817
00:45:10.984 --> 00:45:13.824
Did you check their adderesses?

818
00:45:14.194 --> 00:45:16.694
Time is not on our side for digital evidences.

819
00:45:16.793 --> 00:45:17.824
But...

820
00:45:17.824 --> 00:45:19.563
someone may be inside.

821
00:45:19.764 --> 00:45:22.163
You restrain his housemate first.

822
00:45:22.764 --> 00:45:26.333
The rest of you, pack up all electrics. Okay?

823
00:45:26.433 --> 00:45:27.603
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

824
00:45:41.784 --> 00:45:43.384
Aren't we done yet?

825
00:45:47.154 --> 00:45:48.324
Is there more left?

826
00:45:48.594 --> 00:45:50.663
They want to eat and start over.

827
00:45:50.924 --> 00:45:53.734
What do you want? Gomtang or jjajangmyeon?

828
00:46:11.014 --> 00:46:13.853
Expecting guests. Clean thoroughly.

829
00:46:25.223 --> 00:46:27.634
(Expecting guests. Clean thoroughly.)

830
00:46:28.134 --> 00:46:29.404
What's he talking about?

831
00:46:55.194 --> 00:46:56.623
Who is it?

832
00:47:17.183 --> 00:47:18.784
He's onto us. Break it down.

833
00:47:18.784 --> 00:47:20.614
Yes, sir. Let's go.

834
00:47:20.654 --> 00:47:22.554
Please hurry. Hurry.

835
00:47:34.734 --> 00:47:35.964
Why?

836
00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:39.674
Why?

837
00:47:57.154 --> 00:47:58.223
It's open.

838
00:48:03.864 --> 00:48:05.493
Don't move.

839
00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:16.543
It isn't me.

840
00:48:23.643 --> 00:48:24.683
Are you hurt?

841
00:48:25.284 --> 00:48:26.583
No, well...

842
00:48:55.143 --> 00:48:56.643
It doesn't look like it can be recovered.

843
00:48:56.743 --> 00:48:57.844
I know.

844
00:48:58.014 --> 00:49:01.183
The hard disk was probably damaged.

845
00:49:01.313 --> 00:49:02.754
How long will it take to recover?

846
00:49:03.223 --> 00:49:04.953
It'll take at least at a couple of days.

847
00:49:05.054 --> 00:49:07.453
Then we have to let him go.

848
00:49:07.493 --> 00:49:09.694
We have no choice, since we lack evidence.

849
00:49:10.964 --> 00:49:13.534
I'll work as quickly I assume.

850
00:49:19.504 --> 00:49:21.804
You idiot.

851
00:49:22.504 --> 00:49:25.243
- I told you erase it. - Shut it!

852
00:49:25.674 --> 00:49:27.743
This is all your fault.

853
00:49:33.384 --> 00:49:36.254
You're a punk who shoots videos secretly.

854
00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:38.083
How dare you harass a prosecutor?

855
00:49:38.254 --> 00:49:41.824
I'll take you in as soon as I find evidence.

856
00:49:42.223 --> 00:49:44.324
Wait quietly within a five-mile radius.

857
00:49:45.163 --> 00:49:46.194
Got that?

858
00:49:57.473 --> 00:49:59.743
Mommy. Let's hurry up and watch Thunderman.

859
00:49:59.743 --> 00:50:03.384
Okay, We're on our way to see Thunderman.

860
00:50:05.683 --> 00:50:09.353
I'm the stupid one to think I could rest.

861
00:50:09.583 --> 00:50:11.324
Okay. Slow down.

862
00:50:12.393 --> 00:50:15.353
- Thunderman! - I'm sorry.

863
00:50:16.293 --> 00:50:18.924
I'm sorry.

864
00:50:20.234 --> 00:50:22.333
What happens if you're loud in public places?

865
00:50:22.333 --> 00:50:24.804
- Will you arrest us? - Will you arrest us?

866
00:50:24.864 --> 00:50:26.674
Don't use words like that.

867
00:50:26.674 --> 00:50:28.933
You always say that to Dad.

868
00:50:29.103 --> 00:50:30.603
"I'll arrest you."

869
00:50:30.944 --> 00:50:32.643
"You'll be indicted."

870
00:50:32.643 --> 00:50:35.944
- That's right. - I did not.

871
00:50:36.884 --> 00:50:39.554
It's yesterday's Thunderman!

872
00:50:39.554 --> 00:50:41.683
- Where? - You're right!

873
00:50:42.183 --> 00:50:46.194
Protecting the Earth, Thunder power!

874
00:50:46.523 --> 00:50:47.623
You can do it, right?

875
00:51:20.754 --> 00:51:23.023
You've been using your kid all this time.

876
00:51:24.793 --> 00:51:25.864
You...

877
00:51:27.234 --> 00:51:28.694
were caught in the act.

878
00:51:28.694 --> 00:51:31.964
That's not it. That... That's not it.

879
00:51:32.234 --> 00:51:34.304
My boy So Joon... I mean...

880
00:51:34.304 --> 00:51:36.004
I'm very sorry.

881
00:51:36.004 --> 00:51:37.944
- Hey, apologize. - Shut your mouth.

882
00:51:37.944 --> 00:51:40.473
I'm very sorry.

883
00:52:02.764 --> 00:52:04.464
(Ma Yi Deum)

884
00:52:04.464 --> 00:52:05.773
(Ma Yi Deum)

885
00:52:07.904 --> 00:52:09.373
(Ma Yi Deum, prosecutor)

886
00:52:15.273 --> 00:52:16.743
Good work.

887
00:52:17.784 --> 00:52:20.183
Thank you. Good night.

888
00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:21.614
Aren't you taking the bus?

889
00:52:25.324 --> 00:52:26.523
I drove.

890
00:52:26.523 --> 00:52:29.023
You have a car and we live in the same building,

891
00:52:29.023 --> 00:52:31.364
but you won't offer a ride even just to be nice.

892
00:52:33.234 --> 00:52:35.163
- Go with me. - Forget it.

893
00:52:35.333 --> 00:52:36.433
You mean it?

894
00:52:38.734 --> 00:52:40.174
Look at him.

895
00:53:00.654 --> 00:53:03.094
I got in only to be nice.

896
00:53:03.094 --> 00:53:04.993
I'm a very private person,

897
00:53:04.993 --> 00:53:08.234
and don't like carpooling with colleagues.

898
00:53:08.234 --> 00:53:10.163
Okay. I'm sure.

899
00:53:10.534 --> 00:53:12.674
I'm so tired.

900
00:53:15.873 --> 00:53:16.944
But...

901
00:53:17.404 --> 00:53:19.574
don't you get it now?

902
00:53:19.574 --> 00:53:22.214
Why prosecutors hate going into CAGU.

903
00:53:23.284 --> 00:53:25.484
Well... Sure.

904
00:53:25.884 --> 00:53:27.054
It's like...

905
00:53:28.484 --> 00:53:31.424
you see the worst in people.

906
00:53:32.924 --> 00:53:34.824
I mean, think about it.

907
00:53:35.223 --> 00:53:37.094
We get paid the same,

908
00:53:37.563 --> 00:53:39.433
but some look good uncovering slush funds...

909
00:53:39.433 --> 00:53:42.194
and exposing corporate corruption,

910
00:53:43.063 --> 00:53:44.864
but I'm chasing a punk...

911
00:53:44.864 --> 00:53:47.504
who posts videos of his girlfriend online.

912
00:53:48.174 --> 00:53:50.074
This won't even help my career...

913
00:53:50.074 --> 00:53:52.174
once I stop being a prosecutor.

914
00:53:53.373 --> 00:53:55.413
This is the absolute worst.

915
00:53:55.413 --> 00:53:57.413
Hold on. Ms. Ma.

916
00:53:57.813 --> 00:53:59.884
Weren't you talking about the victims?

917
00:54:01.284 --> 00:54:02.284
Sorry?

918
00:54:03.384 --> 00:54:06.754
Weren't you saying you can relate to them...

919
00:54:06.754 --> 00:54:08.554
when you saw them nervous about the videos?

920
00:54:08.554 --> 00:54:10.094
You didn't feel compassion towards them?

921
00:54:10.723 --> 00:54:11.964
Compassion is one thing.

922
00:54:11.964 --> 00:54:13.333
Why would I relate?

923
00:54:14.063 --> 00:54:15.634
Isn't it natural?

924
00:54:15.634 --> 00:54:16.634
Why?

925
00:54:16.933 --> 00:54:19.574
I'll never shoot a video like that even If I date.

926
00:54:20.873 --> 00:54:21.873
Come in.

927
00:54:22.603 --> 00:54:23.904
It's facing the sun,

928
00:54:23.904 --> 00:54:25.203
so it's bright...

929
00:54:25.203 --> 00:54:26.543
and quiet.

930
00:54:26.743 --> 00:54:30.014
And because a woman lives alone here,

931
00:54:30.014 --> 00:54:31.284
it's very clean.

932
00:54:31.284 --> 00:54:33.884
It's spotless...

933
00:54:35.413 --> 00:54:38.083
The cleaning services are good lately.

934
00:54:38.083 --> 00:54:40.154
You call them up,

935
00:54:40.154 --> 00:54:42.764
and they make it spotless.

936
00:54:43.993 --> 00:54:45.324
Where's the bathroom?

937
00:54:45.523 --> 00:54:48.034
The bath... That way.

938
00:54:48.464 --> 00:54:49.804
Excuse me.

939
00:54:51.404 --> 00:54:54.634
Hello? Yes. Thank you for calling.

940
00:54:54.634 --> 00:54:56.444
Yes.

941
00:55:06.913 --> 00:55:09.353
I mean, even if you're in love.

942
00:55:09.353 --> 00:55:10.723
You can't trust anyone.

943
00:55:10.723 --> 00:55:12.453
How could you film a video like that?

944
00:55:12.453 --> 00:55:15.594
I won't let him take out even a selfie stick.

945
00:55:16.824 --> 00:55:18.563
You're never dated, have you?

946
00:55:18.864 --> 00:55:20.634
What?

947
00:55:21.793 --> 00:55:24.103
Haven't you ever wanted to capture in a photo...

948
00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:26.373
the happy moment you were sharing?

949
00:55:26.734 --> 00:55:28.674
Why did this turn to relationship?

950
00:55:28.674 --> 00:55:30.373
I'm talking about a crime.

951
00:55:30.373 --> 00:55:32.714
I'm talking about a crime too.

952
00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:34.674
You can do anything when you're in love.

953
00:55:34.674 --> 00:55:35.984
You too.

954
00:55:35.984 --> 00:55:38.413
You can shoot videos and take pictures.

955
00:55:38.543 --> 00:55:40.054
But imagine...

956
00:55:40.054 --> 00:55:41.953
that video you made with love...

957
00:55:41.953 --> 00:55:45.284
spread online and is being watched by strangers.

958
00:55:45.654 --> 00:55:48.853
Imagine how Ga Young and Min Jung feel.

959
00:55:49.194 --> 00:55:50.194
Can't you relate?

960
00:55:50.194 --> 00:55:52.563
I'm always careful so I don't relate.

961
00:55:52.563 --> 00:55:54.864
Because feeling emotions for victims...

962
00:55:54.864 --> 00:55:56.304
only complicate things...

963
00:55:56.304 --> 00:55:58.304
and doesn't help the investigation.

964
00:56:00.703 --> 00:56:01.703
Sure.

965
00:56:02.743 --> 00:56:04.004
Okay.

966
00:56:13.183 --> 00:56:14.554
Where did he hide it?

967
00:56:14.554 --> 00:56:15.884
Let me think.

968
00:56:17.824 --> 00:56:19.123
Maybe not.

969
00:56:24.563 --> 00:56:25.663
First floor.

970
00:56:25.663 --> 00:56:27.634
Go up first.

971
00:56:28.094 --> 00:56:29.603
I need to stop by the convenience store.

972
00:56:29.603 --> 00:56:30.764
Okay.

973
00:56:52.953 --> 00:56:53.953
Finally home.

974
00:57:37.764 --> 00:57:38.764
What the...

975
00:57:41.074 --> 00:57:42.103
What's this?

976
00:59:48.793 --> 00:59:51.134
(Witch's Court)

977
00:59:51.404 --> 00:59:53.634
He just turned himself in.

978
00:59:53.703 --> 00:59:54.933
It was awesome.

979
00:59:54.973 --> 00:59:56.143
You're going to watch it?

980
00:59:56.143 --> 00:59:57.203
It's evidence.

981
00:59:57.203 --> 00:59:58.203
Where's the tablet PC?

982
00:59:58.203 --> 00:59:59.743
- I threw it away! - Ms. Ma!

983
00:59:59.743 --> 01:00:01.114
You'll give that punk prosecutor...

984
01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:02.484
my case?

985
01:00:02.484 --> 01:00:04.683
Who's the one who lost to that punk?

986
01:00:04.743 --> 01:00:07.284
We can win this trial.

987
01:00:07.284 --> 01:00:10.054
You're acting like a video exists,

988
01:00:10.054 --> 01:00:12.594
when it does not, to corner the accused.

989
01:00:12.594 --> 01:00:14.054
Please answer.

990
01:00:14.054 --> 01:00:16.063
Ma Yi Deum is Kwak Young Shil's child.

991
01:00:16.063 --> 01:00:17.063
That's not all.

992
01:00:17.063 --> 01:00:18.793
The male prosecutor in the department...

993
01:00:19.034 --> 01:00:21.264
Want to sleep at my place tonight?
