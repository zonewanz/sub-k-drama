00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:09.683
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:13.886
What's wrong?

3
00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:18.297
So?

4
00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:21.227
"So"?

5
00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:25.137
It's an occupational disease.

6
00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:27.267
Someone is watching us.

7
00:00:40.546 --> 00:00:41.946
I'm trying to leave evidence.

8
00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.067
- Aren't you going to date anyone? - I should be asking you that.

9
00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:57.196
I feel like you'll be really popular among women.

10
00:00:57.196 --> 00:00:59.067
I recently got rejected.

11
00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:01.506
I also got turned down by a woman right before I came to Paris.

12
00:01:02.537 --> 00:01:04.476
She said work comes before love.

13
00:01:07.207 --> 00:01:08.476
I want a family of my own.

14
00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:10.877
I feel like...

15
00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:13.047
I'd be able to live happily with you.

16
00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.646
I have a man that I love.

17
00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:20.056
He called me.

18
00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:22.787
(On Jung Sun)

19
00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:24.256
Do you want to pick up the phone?

20
00:01:24.696 --> 00:01:26.556
It was his last phone call.

21
00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:31.336
Your problem is that you think too much.

22
00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:36.207
How long are you going to be on your own with shapeless emotions?

23
00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:39.006
Your reality right now is me.

24
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.136
Do you want to sleep together?

25
00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:17.576
Sure.

26
00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:27.287
(Temperature of Love)

27
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:40.937
- 5, 4, 3, - 4, 3,

28
00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:44.337
- 2, 1. - 2, 1.

29
00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:22.907
Hyun Soo, what are you doing?

30
00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:25.777
Are you sleeping already?

31
00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:27.486
I have to sleep.

32
00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:31.516
You didn't even spend time with me.

33
00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:33.657
I need to sleep.

34
00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:35.456
We said we'd sleep together.

35
00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:38.226
Help me understand what you're saying.

36
00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:41.627
Kyung, please let me be just for today.

37
00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.296
Today was the best day of my life.

38
00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:50.176
Okay.

39
00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:41.527
What should I do?

40
00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:43.426
It's okay. Calm down.

41
00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:45.757
Why are you crying?

42
00:04:45.757 --> 00:04:48.926
I started this so we could have fun. You can't cry.

43
00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:51.267
I lose all my strength after I cry.

44
00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:53.767
Then it reminds me of things that make me sad.

45
00:05:01.777 --> 00:05:04.847
It sometimes helps to cry, Joy.

46
00:05:07.787 --> 00:05:08.947
You sound exactly the same.

47
00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:12.986
We should eat now. Should I cook?

48
00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:14.527
No, let's just order in.

49
00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:19.856
Come outside.

50
00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:21.066
My gosh, he's outside.

51
00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:23.837
I look like a mess, don't I? I didn't even wash my hair.

52
00:05:23.897 --> 00:05:26.907
I'll keep him occupied. Hurry up, and put some makeup on.

53
00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:28.736
Okay, I'll be right out.

54
00:05:28.736 --> 00:05:30.207
- Okay. Hurry up. - Wait.

55
00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:32.876
Let me see.

56
00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:44.287
- Hyun Soo. - Yes?

57
00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:47.157
He just left after leaving this in front of our house.

58
00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:48.426
What is it?

59
00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:03.476
Hyun Soo, I know you like spicy food.

60
00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:04.936
Eat this while you work.

61
00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:07.507
The caramel is for when you're running low on sugar.

62
00:06:27.496 --> 00:06:29.027
Gosh, it's so cute.

63
00:06:29.027 --> 00:06:30.597
That's so cute.

64
00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:32.236
Can I have a bite?

65
00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:51.816
What are you doing here?

66
00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:53.316
I took a cab here.

67
00:06:53.926 --> 00:06:55.626
How can you just leave after leaving me tteokbokki?

68
00:06:55.926 --> 00:06:57.257
What else was I supposed to do?

69
00:06:58.757 --> 00:07:00.496
Well, you weren't really meant to do anything.

70
00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:02.967
Should I give you a ride back?

71
00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:07.606
No, it's okay. You must be really tired from cooking.

72
00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:10.577
Okay. Bye, then.

73
00:07:12.337 --> 00:07:13.746
My gosh, seriously.

74
00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.876
When did you learn how to play hard to get?

75
00:07:17.277 --> 00:07:19.116
That's why you should choose your answers wisely.

76
00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:20.947
Fine.

77
00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:23.486
Let's go.

78
00:07:30.056 --> 00:07:31.426
Are you staying home today again?

79
00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:33.827
No, Mr. Park said he wants to see me.

80
00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.197
What about you?

81
00:07:35.197 --> 00:07:36.267
I will be working.

82
00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:45.337
My gosh.

83
00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.496
It's been a while since you last came.

84
00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:13.767
I'll explain to you our new seasonal menu.

85
00:08:14.007 --> 00:08:16.777
It's a lunch course with 2 kinds of snacks, and 4 kinds of main menus.

86
00:08:16.777 --> 00:08:19.207
Then you'll be ending your meal with a dessert.

87
00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:33.757
- Min Ho, come over here. - Okay.

88
00:08:42.296 --> 00:08:44.767
Ms. Lee Ga Young. When you made a reservation, you said that...

89
00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:46.836
- you're allergic to nuts, right? - Yes, I did.

90
00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:51.076
(Allergic to nuts)

91
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.576
Ha Sung, there's a batch of puree made for people who are allergic.

92
00:08:57.576 --> 00:08:59.647
Bring me that. Also, bring me some macadamia puree.

93
00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:01.346
- Yes, Chef. - Kyung Soo.

94
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.747
We need to make four servings of Root Vegetable Salad.

95
00:09:02.747 --> 00:09:03.787
Yes, Chef.

96
00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:05.916
(Root Vegetable Salad: A salad made with root vegetables)

97
00:09:06.686 --> 00:09:07.887
This is for the customer who's allergic to nuts.

98
00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:09.186
Use this to plate the right puree for her.

99
00:09:10.397 --> 00:09:11.527
What are you doing, Ha Sung?

100
00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:13.157
Yes, Chef.

101
00:09:39.586 --> 00:09:40.857
Ha Sung, check the lobster!

102
00:09:41.027 --> 00:09:42.627
Okay, Sous-chef!

103
00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:46.497
Here.

104
00:09:58.576 --> 00:09:59.576
Chef.

105
00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:08.487
Where's the plate for our allergic customer? I told you to separate it.

106
00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:10.186
It's on the far-right side.

107
00:10:15.027 --> 00:10:16.027
Are you sure this is it?

108
00:10:17.157 --> 00:10:18.227
Yes.

109
00:10:43.287 --> 00:10:45.487
- This is for the allergic customer. - Okay.

110
00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:51.997
- You're right. - Here's your meal.

111
00:10:55.997 --> 00:10:56.997
It looks delicious.

112
00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:14.316
Hello, Mr. Park.

113
00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:17.787
Hey, it's been a while.

114
00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:19.216
Please sit down.

115
00:11:32.037 --> 00:11:34.806
Your look matches the chilly weather today.

116
00:11:39.877 --> 00:11:41.946
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

117
00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:45.176
Let's produce this.

118
00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.117
It's the first melodrama script you ever brought to me.

119
00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:51.086
I only recently stopped writing for "Unruly Detectives".

120
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.816
You wrote this way before that.

121
00:11:53.257 --> 00:11:55.556
I liked reading this script because it felt really unique.

122
00:11:56.627 --> 00:11:58.497
I'd be honored if you decide to produce this.

123
00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:01.666
Then let's do it. You can continue writing the next script for this.

124
00:12:03.737 --> 00:12:04.796
Okay.

125
00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:10.737
Hong Ah is going to be using...

126
00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:12.436
the studio you used to use.

127
00:12:19.716 --> 00:12:21.787
I'll write at home before things get organized.

128
00:12:23.316 --> 00:12:24.357
One more thing.

129
00:12:26.117 --> 00:12:28.826
Hong Ah will be joining the writing team for "Unruly Detectives".

130
00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:35.296
I'm sure Hong Ah...

131
00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:37.696
will be of great help to the writing team.

132
00:12:40.836 --> 00:12:42.907
"Unruly Detectives" is everyone's project now.

133
00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:44.507
We can't just let it fail.

134
00:12:44.607 --> 00:12:45.637
But...

135
00:12:46.176 --> 00:12:48.806
I don't want her to change the original storyline of my script.

136
00:12:49.247 --> 00:12:50.777
I can't promise you that.

137
00:12:51.216 --> 00:12:52.546
That's up to Hong Ah.

138
00:12:54.186 --> 00:12:55.816
I'll try talking to her myself.

139
00:12:59.857 --> 00:13:00.857
What are you doing today?

140
00:13:02.727 --> 00:13:03.796
I should work.

141
00:13:05.127 --> 00:13:08.066
I see that you've been working when I was busy trying to get back up.

142
00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:13.336
I'll repay you by writing a great script.

143
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.592
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E17 Temperature of Love "Torn Between Love & Friendship"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

144
00:13:37.257 --> 00:13:39.997
I wanted to see you, but didn't expect to see you here.

145
00:13:40.727 --> 00:13:43.367
I wanted to see you too. We must have a connection.

146
00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:46.267
Aren't you here to see Mr. Park?

147
00:13:46.537 --> 00:13:48.806
Yes. I came to sign the contract.

148
00:13:49.137 --> 00:13:51.137
It won't take long to sign.

149
00:13:51.137 --> 00:13:52.436
Can you wait a little?

150
00:13:55.046 --> 00:13:56.877
(Ji Hong Ah)

151
00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:01.346
(Park Jung Woo)

152
00:14:10.596 --> 00:14:11.897
I look forward to working with you.

153
00:14:13.527 --> 00:14:14.596
Me too.

154
00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:21.166
- This is really nutty and good. - Right?

155
00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:22.436
It's fresh too.

156
00:14:22.607 --> 00:14:25.336
I think this is the best fine dining restaurant.

157
00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:26.576
This is so good.

158
00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:31.346
- No. No. - What?

159
00:14:31.617 --> 00:14:32.647
What's wrong?

160
00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:35.216
I feel strange.

161
00:14:35.747 --> 00:14:36.916
It's itchy.

162
00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:39.716
You're having an allergic reaction. Excuse me! Excuse me!

163
00:14:42.426 --> 00:14:44.257
What's wrong with her? Didn't you take out the nuts?

164
00:14:44.527 --> 00:14:46.227
Call 911! Hurry!

165
00:14:46.227 --> 00:14:47.227
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:47.326 --> 00:14:48.627
- Call 911 now. - Okay.

167
00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:54.537
Chef, you have to come out.

168
00:14:54.737 --> 00:14:56.706
Did you take out the macadamia nuts for table five?

169
00:15:05.647 --> 00:15:06.676
Oh, no!

170
00:15:08.987 --> 00:15:10.416
Were you intending to kill her?

171
00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:12.017
How can you call yourself a chef?

172
00:15:12.617 --> 00:15:14.257
- I'm sorry. - Did you call 911?

173
00:15:14.357 --> 00:15:15.426
Yes, we did.

174
00:15:15.727 --> 00:15:17.596
This won't do. She can't wait for the ambulance.

175
00:15:18.157 --> 00:15:20.527
Let's take her to the hospital. Bring my car keys.

176
00:15:20.826 --> 00:15:21.897
Okay.

177
00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:24.336
Here, here.

178
00:15:30.676 --> 00:15:32.576
- Won Joon, you take over here. - Okay.

179
00:15:47.727 --> 00:15:48.857
Did you order for me?

180
00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:51.157
I did.

181
00:15:53.296 --> 00:15:54.367
Thank you.

182
00:15:57.066 --> 00:15:58.397
You're so strange.

183
00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:01.166
Life seems so easy for you.

184
00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:03.977
You must remember only the things you want to remember.

185
00:16:05.076 --> 00:16:09.306
Nothing appears good to you because of your situation. I'll understand.

186
00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:12.377
My perspective isn't skewed. I'm more peaceful than ever.

187
00:16:15.247 --> 00:16:16.586
"Unruly Detectives"...

188
00:16:17.487 --> 00:16:19.987
I sent you all my finished scripts.

189
00:16:20.857 --> 00:16:22.456
Don't borrow anything from my story.

190
00:16:22.887 --> 00:16:24.056
But Hyun Soo,

191
00:16:24.757 --> 00:16:28.527
if the characters are the same, the story may end up being similar.

192
00:16:29.066 --> 00:16:30.997
They aren't things only you can think of.

193
00:16:31.237 --> 00:16:32.336
Still, don't do it.

194
00:16:32.497 --> 00:16:34.367
You can avoid it. You're smart.

195
00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:39.137
It's all copyrighted, so the law is on my side.

196
00:16:40.037 --> 00:16:41.747
I have evidence that I sent you all the scripts.

197
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.216
You're being too fussy.

198
00:16:46.676 --> 00:16:49.787
If this show doesn't do well, On Entertainment will see damages too.

199
00:16:50.487 --> 00:16:52.816
Mr. Park did so much for you.

200
00:16:54.987 --> 00:16:56.686
You always get the main point.

201
00:16:58.196 --> 00:17:00.426
I feel like giving in when I think of Mr. Park.

202
00:17:01.596 --> 00:17:03.936
But I become more resolute when I think of you.

203
00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:06.366
Hyun Soo.

204
00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:09.207
Did you forget what you did to me just a while ago?

205
00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:11.437
How could you treat me as if nothing happened?

206
00:17:11.636 --> 00:17:13.747
I resolve everything face to face. I don't hold things in.

207
00:17:13.977 --> 00:17:15.207
It was all resolved that day.

208
00:17:15.447 --> 00:17:17.177
Then let me fuss about it now.

209
00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:21.717
It's uncomfortable to ask this,

210
00:17:22.787 --> 00:17:25.056
so I held it in even though I wanted to ask.

211
00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:29.326
Even when you said bad things about Jung Sun.

212
00:17:29.326 --> 00:17:31.257
When did I say bad things about Jung Sun?

213
00:17:32.227 --> 00:17:33.497
He's a playboy.

214
00:17:34.027 --> 00:17:36.027
He studied abroad since he was little.

215
00:17:36.626 --> 00:17:38.967
Furthermore, France is much more liberal than here.

216
00:17:38.967 --> 00:17:40.467
You can't ignore a person's environment.

217
00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:42.866
Do you have any idea how much he flirted with me at first?

218
00:17:42.866 --> 00:17:45.477
Even if he likes you, you shouldn't say yes to him.

219
00:17:45.707 --> 00:17:47.247
What are you talking about?

220
00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:49.247
It's what you said about Jung Sun.

221
00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:51.846
Don't you remember?

222
00:17:53.517 --> 00:17:54.517
No, I don't.

223
00:17:56.116 --> 00:17:58.556
As you know, I have great memory.

224
00:17:59.017 --> 00:18:00.257
You do.

225
00:18:02.257 --> 00:18:04.257
I really liked you and valued you.

226
00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:08.396
I accepted your words about Jung Sun.

227
00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:12.237
And I stopped the feelings I had for him.

228
00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:19.437
I loved him, but I took it lightly.

229
00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:24.646
And I paid a huge price for it.

230
00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:32.386
I still wanted to understand you, since you were in a bad situation.

231
00:18:33.386 --> 00:18:35.656
You kept losing competitions, but people had a lot of expectations.

232
00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:38.257
I thought you'd change once things got better for you.

233
00:18:38.896 --> 00:18:41.096
You and I had good times together.

234
00:18:41.896 --> 00:18:44.896
I still like you, but...

235
00:18:47.336 --> 00:18:48.606
I was jealous.

236
00:18:49.037 --> 00:18:51.007
I hated that I got jealous over you.

237
00:18:51.437 --> 00:18:52.737
I hated myself,

238
00:18:53.177 --> 00:18:55.646
so I hated you more for making me hate myself.

239
00:18:56.277 --> 00:18:57.447
But...

240
00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:01.217
I liked spending time with you, so I tried to be nicer to you.

241
00:19:01.947 --> 00:19:03.586
But then when I saw you succeed,

242
00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:05.917
I felt small and hated myself.

243
00:19:07.287 --> 00:19:09.427
And I kept hating you more. What was I supposed to do?

244
00:19:10.227 --> 00:19:12.056
You could have just not seen me.

245
00:19:12.056 --> 00:19:13.697
I tried,

246
00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:17.237
but I wanted to know what you were up to.

247
00:19:17.497 --> 00:19:20.066
I'd hate you, I'd try, I'd hate you again, and I'd try again.

248
00:19:23.477 --> 00:19:25.636
But now that things are better for me,

249
00:19:27.546 --> 00:19:29.606
I won't have any more of those internal conflicts.

250
00:19:36.116 --> 00:19:37.386
I am appalled.

251
00:19:48.697 --> 00:19:50.767
Gosh. Why isn't Hyun Soo coming?

252
00:19:51.197 --> 00:19:52.997
But don't you work?

253
00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:54.537
I'm waiting.

254
00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.136
But I feel like you're less nice, Writer Hwangbo.

255
00:19:59.136 --> 00:20:01.376
What do you mean by that?

256
00:20:01.947 --> 00:20:03.846
You're saying strange things.

257
00:20:04.146 --> 00:20:05.316
I'm hungry.

258
00:20:06.376 --> 00:20:08.787
- Before I never had to say that... - Oh, come on!

259
00:20:08.947 --> 00:20:11.187
Why are you so pitiful, Director Kim?

260
00:20:12.556 --> 00:20:15.156
I like ramyeon and dumplings.

261
00:20:15.326 --> 00:20:16.356
Oh, my gosh.

262
00:20:16.356 --> 00:20:17.997
A boiled egg would be nice too.

263
00:20:18.257 --> 00:20:21.866
You just love boiled eggs. You're so countrified.

264
00:20:23.437 --> 00:20:24.896
Aren't you from Seoul?

265
00:20:28.037 --> 00:20:29.566
Before my mom ran away,

266
00:20:30.136 --> 00:20:32.007
she boiled a dozen eggs for me.

267
00:20:33.007 --> 00:20:35.046
When I was little I used to hate eggs.

268
00:20:35.707 --> 00:20:37.146
But I love them now.

269
00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:41.346
Why are you telling me that? It's too personal.

270
00:20:41.346 --> 00:20:42.646
It just came out.

271
00:20:43.146 --> 00:20:45.156
I bet you seduced a lot of women with that.

272
00:20:45.316 --> 00:20:46.616
They always fall for it.

273
00:20:47.086 --> 00:20:49.227
Pity is the best pickup line.

274
00:20:50.527 --> 00:20:53.027
You sell off your family story to pick up women?

275
00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:55.667
Hyun Soo is here.

276
00:20:57.136 --> 00:20:58.197
Goodness.

277
00:20:59.066 --> 00:21:01.136
We almost died waiting for you.

278
00:21:01.237 --> 00:21:02.267
Why would you wait?

279
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:04.207
Your piece...

280
00:21:04.677 --> 00:21:05.777
I'm going to direct it.

281
00:21:07.106 --> 00:21:09.106
You're going into a show already?

282
00:21:09.406 --> 00:21:11.376
It's a script I wrote before, "Kind Soup".

283
00:21:11.747 --> 00:21:13.386
Mr. Park wants to produce it.

284
00:21:13.846 --> 00:21:14.917
Do it with me, Hyun Soo.

285
00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:18.386
I read the script again. It's so fun.

286
00:21:18.856 --> 00:21:19.917
That's why I came here.

287
00:21:22.856 --> 00:21:24.296
- Hyun Soo, we need to talk. - Okay.

288
00:21:24.697 --> 00:21:26.556
What's wrong? What's with this hesitancy?

289
00:21:26.826 --> 00:21:28.126
I'm good at shooting romance.

290
00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:30.566
There's no better director for it.

291
00:21:31.267 --> 00:21:33.636
You have to work with directors who like your work.

292
00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:36.667
I love it.

293
00:21:37.677 --> 00:21:40.447
Hyun Soo, you can't have him direct it.

294
00:21:40.677 --> 00:21:42.447
He gets weirdly artsy.

295
00:21:42.646 --> 00:21:44.677
He'll turn the romance script into a thriller.

296
00:21:45.477 --> 00:21:47.386
And what about the lighting?

297
00:21:47.386 --> 00:21:51.017
Everyone's faces will be lit in green!

298
00:21:53.586 --> 00:21:54.586
Writer Hwangbo,

299
00:21:55.586 --> 00:21:56.826
I almost cried.

300
00:21:58.197 --> 00:22:00.027
- Director Kim. - That's not it.

301
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:01.066
Okay.

302
00:22:01.296 --> 00:22:03.997
If you want it that bad, I'll do it. Don't worry.

303
00:22:05.796 --> 00:22:09.136
Thank you for your constructive criticism on my directing.

304
00:22:10.106 --> 00:22:11.437
Give me boiled eggs now.

305
00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:16.146
Okay.

306
00:22:28.856 --> 00:22:31.427
This is really good, but it's not enough.

307
00:22:32.156 --> 00:22:33.997
You can always make more for yourself, Writer Hwangbo.

308
00:22:33.997 --> 00:22:35.767
This was given to us.

309
00:22:35.997 --> 00:22:38.136
We gave up the few we have for you.

310
00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:40.366
Oh is that the case?

311
00:22:40.366 --> 00:22:42.667
You gave up a few for me because I'm worth it?

312
00:22:42.667 --> 00:22:44.277
You should have said so.

313
00:22:45.136 --> 00:22:47.306
What's wrong with you?

314
00:22:47.306 --> 00:22:48.677
Because your reaction is funny.

315
00:22:50.217 --> 00:22:51.217
Bingo.

316
00:22:53.816 --> 00:22:55.346
Why do you want to work on this piece?

317
00:22:56.247 --> 00:22:57.356
It's a little unique.

318
00:22:57.717 --> 00:23:00.187
The emotions between the couple is alive, and it's exciting.

319
00:23:00.957 --> 00:23:02.257
I like that it's a sad ending.

320
00:23:02.987 --> 00:23:04.356
I'm going to fix it into a happy ending.

321
00:23:04.356 --> 00:23:06.356
No, you have to stick with the sad ending.

322
00:23:07.366 --> 00:23:10.767
But how did you come up with the nickname Kind Soup?

323
00:23:11.336 --> 00:23:13.366
Oh gosh, wait. I had something I needed to do,

324
00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:14.406
but I couldn't.

325
00:23:14.406 --> 00:23:15.937
Hey, Hyun Soo.

326
00:23:24.177 --> 00:23:25.177
What are you doing?

327
00:23:41.227 --> 00:23:42.366
She had trouble breathing...

328
00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:44.566
because of an airway obstruction due to allergic reactions.

329
00:23:45.037 --> 00:23:46.767
I gave her a shot, and she's becoming stable again.

330
00:23:46.906 --> 00:23:48.336
You don't need to worry anymore.

331
00:23:49.737 --> 00:23:50.836
Thank you.

332
00:23:51.237 --> 00:23:52.606
When can she get discharged?

333
00:23:53.076 --> 00:23:54.777
I'll tell you after I see how she recovers.

334
00:24:04.017 --> 00:24:05.257
I'm really sorry.

335
00:24:06.017 --> 00:24:08.287
Since this happened after you started appearing on TV,

336
00:24:08.287 --> 00:24:09.826
I can't help but blame this on that.

337
00:24:11.556 --> 00:24:13.596
We liked it better when there were less customers.

338
00:24:14.497 --> 00:24:15.866
You're not full of vanity, are you?

339
00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:17.697
No.

340
00:24:18.836 --> 00:24:20.667
I'll pay for the entire hospital fee.

341
00:24:21.037 --> 00:24:23.066
You can also charge me for all the additional treatments.

342
00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:42.356
Let's clean up, and take a break for a while.

343
00:24:42.626 --> 00:24:43.727
Then let's get ready for dinnertime.

344
00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:47.727
I did as I was told and left the plate at the far-right side.

345
00:24:47.826 --> 00:24:48.927
So it wasn't my fault.

346
00:24:49.796 --> 00:24:51.197
Then are you saying it was Chef On's fault?

347
00:24:51.467 --> 00:24:52.737
I never said that.

348
00:24:53.167 --> 00:24:54.406
I'm just saying that it wasn't my fault.

349
00:24:55.437 --> 00:24:57.606
I'm responsible for everything that happens in the kitchen.

350
00:24:59.906 --> 00:25:01.406
Our customer's okay now.

351
00:25:01.406 --> 00:25:02.546
It was an allergic reaction.

352
00:25:03.207 --> 00:25:04.417
Thank you for taking care of it.

353
00:25:05.316 --> 00:25:07.247
I need to be clear about what happened today,

354
00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:09.417
so that we can prevent this from happening again.

355
00:25:12.116 --> 00:25:14.326
Ha Sung said he left the plate on the far-right side.

356
00:25:14.727 --> 00:25:15.787
Who moved it?

357
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:17.197
I... I...

358
00:25:18.296 --> 00:25:21.197
I think I moved it when I was placing the desserts.

359
00:25:21.296 --> 00:25:22.796
I'm really sorry.

360
00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:27.106
Then I just trusted what Ha Sung told me...

361
00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:28.806
and confirmed the dish without checking it myself.

362
00:25:30.777 --> 00:25:32.277
There was a problem with our communication.

363
00:25:32.537 --> 00:25:34.806
Let's not forget to lock eyes when we communicate even if we're busy.

364
00:25:35.447 --> 00:25:37.277
- Okay, Chef. - Okay, Chef.

365
00:25:40.346 --> 00:25:42.086
(Mom)

366
00:25:42.086 --> 00:25:43.457
What are you doing?

367
00:25:46.687 --> 00:25:48.556
I'm eating tteokbokki.

368
00:25:52.156 --> 00:25:55.866
(What are you doing?)

369
00:26:01.136 --> 00:26:04.106
Hello, I'm Chef On Jung Sun.

370
00:26:04.537 --> 00:26:06.846
You don't have a fixed schedule for the next shoot, do you?

371
00:26:07.346 --> 00:26:10.376
No, not yet. You'll be competing against the chef that wins...

372
00:26:10.376 --> 00:26:11.917
the upcoming episode.

373
00:26:13.346 --> 00:26:15.316
I'd like to get off the show now.

374
00:26:15.717 --> 00:26:17.856
I just called you in advance to let you know beforehand.

375
00:26:18.217 --> 00:26:20.427
I wanted to let you know before you fixed the next schedule.

376
00:26:21.326 --> 00:26:22.356
Why?

377
00:26:22.626 --> 00:26:24.896
It'll be good for you to appear on TV.

378
00:26:25.027 --> 00:26:26.497
Didn't the sales for your restaurant increase?

379
00:26:27.697 --> 00:26:28.967
It increased a lot.

380
00:26:29.497 --> 00:26:31.037
But it's because of something else.

381
00:26:32.396 --> 00:26:36.106
Okay. I'll call you back after I discuss it with the director.

382
00:26:55.727 --> 00:26:57.727
(Lee Hyun Soo)

383
00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:04.066
(What are you doing?)

384
00:27:05.997 --> 00:27:07.007
What are you doing?

385
00:27:10.777 --> 00:27:12.707
I'm drinking water.

386
00:27:13.606 --> 00:27:16.876
I wrote this three years ago, so we need to do new research.

387
00:27:17.316 --> 00:27:19.076
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

388
00:27:19.076 --> 00:27:21.116
We can collect information from Chef On.

389
00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:25.987
I noticed that his restaurant is full of good-looking chefs.

390
00:27:26.856 --> 00:27:28.386
I'm so excited.

391
00:27:38.267 --> 00:27:39.336
I'm drinking water.

392
00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:41.336
He's drinking water.

393
00:27:42.136 --> 00:27:43.167
Who is?

394
00:27:44.136 --> 00:27:46.336
Is that a subject someone can even talk about?

395
00:27:46.947 --> 00:27:47.977
Exactly.

396
00:27:48.707 --> 00:27:50.546
What's the big deal about drinking water?

397
00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:53.987
I have something to tell you.

398
00:28:02.326 --> 00:28:04.126
I know I saw you this morning, but I came to see you again.

399
00:28:05.656 --> 00:28:07.467
Welcome. I'm sorry.

400
00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:10.136
I don't have much time because I need to get ready for dinnertime.

401
00:28:11.136 --> 00:28:12.197
It's okay.

402
00:28:13.866 --> 00:28:15.007
Please have a seat.

403
00:28:15.967 --> 00:28:17.306
It feels as if this place is my home.

404
00:28:18.707 --> 00:28:19.737
Here.

405
00:28:20.076 --> 00:28:21.707
I hope you like it.

406
00:28:31.687 --> 00:28:33.527
They say people run away if you buy them shoes.

407
00:28:33.987 --> 00:28:35.987
I bought them so that you'd come running to me.

408
00:28:39.497 --> 00:28:40.566
Aren't you going to try them on?

409
00:28:40.796 --> 00:28:42.826
You're supposed to try on presents at the spot.

410
00:28:52.306 --> 00:28:53.876
How did you know my size?

411
00:28:54.306 --> 00:28:56.846
Here's a hint. You need to be careful of your close friends.

412
00:28:58.546 --> 00:29:00.287
- Won Joon told you? - Yes.

413
00:29:02.787 --> 00:29:03.816
How does it look?

414
00:29:06.556 --> 00:29:07.626
I like it.

415
00:29:07.757 --> 00:29:10.096
I should be the one to like it. Why are you liking it for me?

416
00:29:10.156 --> 00:29:12.227
I need to like it first because I'm the one who gave it to you.

417
00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:15.296
I lost.

418
00:29:16.267 --> 00:29:17.767
Thank you for this and everything else.

419
00:29:18.467 --> 00:29:20.306
I was caught in a complicated situation,

420
00:29:20.306 --> 00:29:21.667
but you just made me feel better.

421
00:29:22.707 --> 00:29:24.576
I'm glad to hear that I made you feel better.

422
00:29:26.507 --> 00:29:27.576
What happened?

423
00:29:28.707 --> 00:29:30.477
Things are still quite complicated,

424
00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:31.876
so I can't tell you anything yet.

425
00:29:32.217 --> 00:29:34.247
Okay, Mr. Cold-hearted.

426
00:29:37.017 --> 00:29:38.757
Then I'll you something first.

427
00:29:40.586 --> 00:29:42.126
I'm going to be writing for a drama again.

428
00:29:42.356 --> 00:29:43.856
There's a script that I had written a long time ago.

429
00:29:45.757 --> 00:29:46.967
You could say that...

430
00:29:49.066 --> 00:29:51.566
I wrote this script based on my experience.

431
00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:54.066
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

432
00:29:54.406 --> 00:29:57.106
"Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls".

433
00:29:58.136 --> 00:29:59.737
Is Kind Soup supposed to be me?

434
00:30:00.007 --> 00:30:01.376
That's right.

435
00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:04.247
When did I not pick up? You're the one who didn't pick up.

436
00:30:05.376 --> 00:30:07.616
Do you think you're allowed to write whatever you want?

437
00:30:07.616 --> 00:30:09.787
Yes. That's why I enjoy writing.

438
00:30:11.586 --> 00:30:13.727
I used my imagination as a writer.

439
00:30:16.757 --> 00:30:19.257
But I don't really like the title.

440
00:30:20.497 --> 00:30:21.497
Why not?

441
00:30:22.267 --> 00:30:23.497
It feels it'll have a sad-ending.

442
00:30:26.336 --> 00:30:27.767
Are you expecting someone?

443
00:30:44.487 --> 00:30:45.517
It's my mom.

444
00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:47.626
What should I do?

445
00:30:50.957 --> 00:30:52.156
Do you feel pressured?

446
00:30:53.697 --> 00:30:55.667
Well, not exactly.

447
00:30:57.136 --> 00:30:58.937
But I'm scared.

448
00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:00.207
Why?

449
00:31:01.737 --> 00:31:03.406
Because I want her to like me.

450
00:31:04.836 --> 00:31:08.346
You don't need to act a certain way to make someone like you.

451
00:31:08.447 --> 00:31:09.707
Even if that's my mom.

452
00:31:10.247 --> 00:31:11.316
Okay?

453
00:31:12.517 --> 00:31:13.717
Okay.

454
00:31:23.697 --> 00:31:25.957
What were you doing? What took you so long to open the door?

455
00:31:26.427 --> 00:31:28.326
I heard you were here. I got worried when you didn't open...

456
00:31:28.326 --> 00:31:29.596
Hello.

457
00:31:39.406 --> 00:31:41.277
Why are you wearing different shoes on each foot?

458
00:31:41.977 --> 00:31:43.247
Did you get a present from her?

459
00:31:44.646 --> 00:31:47.316
I'll be off now. You two can talk.

460
00:31:47.417 --> 00:31:49.316
- I'll walk you out. - No, it's okay.

461
00:31:49.747 --> 00:31:51.616
Aren't you going to introduce her to me?

462
00:31:54.056 --> 00:31:55.886
Forget it if she's not anyone special.

463
00:31:59.396 --> 00:32:01.927
She's my girlfriend. Her name's Lee Hyun Soo.

464
00:32:04.066 --> 00:32:05.967
Hyun Soo, she's my mom.

465
00:32:08.207 --> 00:32:09.437
Hello.

466
00:32:10.306 --> 00:32:11.576
You already said hello to me earlier.

467
00:32:11.777 --> 00:32:13.277
You must enjoy greeting people.

468
00:32:14.076 --> 00:32:15.806
I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous.

469
00:32:15.947 --> 00:32:16.977
Mom.

470
00:32:17.447 --> 00:32:18.477
Yes, Son?

471
00:32:18.677 --> 00:32:19.846
You know my personality, right?

472
00:32:21.687 --> 00:32:22.747
Yes, of course.

473
00:32:24.886 --> 00:32:26.156
Let's drink tea together.

474
00:32:26.457 --> 00:32:29.687
Jung Sun will have to leave to prepare for dinnertime anyway.

475
00:32:34.626 --> 00:32:35.667
Okay.

476
00:32:37.167 --> 00:32:40.606
(Episode 18 will air shortly.)
