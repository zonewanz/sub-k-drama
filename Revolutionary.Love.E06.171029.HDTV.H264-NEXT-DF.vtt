<i>[Episode 6]</i>
You know these cleaners...

3
00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:23.912
The image of them eating meals with us?

4
00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:25.031
Fine!

5
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:29.253
I don't think it's right to
discriminate either.

6
00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:30.513
- But, you know...
- Yes?

7
00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.424
It's only hard at the beginning.

8
00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:35.365
Once you allow just one thing...

9
00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:37.893
there are so many problems that follow.

10
00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:40.165
You are correct... so right.

11
00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.744
Have a drink. Have a drink.

12
00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:45.906
Will they be satisfied with
eating meals there?

13
00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.275
- CEO Min.
- Yes?

14
00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:48.412
You know how it is.

15
00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:53.994
They'll ask for days off, bonuses,
break rooms, this, and that.

16
00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:58.893
They'll make requests for all of that
and it'll be such a pain for me.

17
00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:02.466
We can't allow that to happen.
That cannot happen.

18
00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.728
So, CEO Min.

19
00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:09.650
You need to hire the right
people to begin with.

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.951
What if young people get together
and form a labor union?

21
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:18.618
Ah, yes.

22
00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:23.895
<i>I love you.</i>

23
00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:38.532
I love you.

24
00:02:16.768 --> 00:02:17.783
Joon.

25
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.700
You... why are you here?

26
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.962
How? Why? Why? Why?

27
00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:25.875
Don't you remember last night?

28
00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:28.765
Last night?

29
00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:35.955
You need to take
responsibility for me now.

30
00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.630
Why do I have to do that?
Why do I have to take responsibility?

31
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.162
What... what did I do?

32
00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:43.272
Don't you remember
what you said to me last night?

33
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:45.788
What did I say?

34
00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.920
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

35
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.044
What is that?

36
00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.663
Come on now.

37
00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:55.363
You know.

38
00:02:55.363 --> 00:02:57.480
- I don't know.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep.

39
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.773
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

40
00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:07.982
This isn't right.

41
00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:16.758
No.

42
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.533
Get away. Get away!

43
00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:44.867
Seriously, I don't know.

44
00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:58.026
I'm going insane.

45
00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:06.902
Oh, I must be crazy!

46
00:04:30.296 --> 00:04:32.859
<i>I love you. I love you. I love you.</i>

47
00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:34.686
Ah, I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

48
00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:54.542
Joon!

49
00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:57.892
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:57.892 --> 00:04:59.659
You slept in so I came to wake you.

51
00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.322
That's what I'm saying.

52
00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:03.152
What?

53
00:05:03.152 --> 00:05:05.253
Well, you know.

54
00:05:05.253 --> 00:05:07.162
I don't know. I'm late.

55
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:12.522
Wait for me!

56
00:05:13.378 --> 00:05:16.229
I'm crazy, so crazy.

57
00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:28.133
I don't know.

58
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.897
Joon!

59
00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:33.046
What's with her?

60
00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:34.346
Must be because she's late.

61
00:05:34.346 --> 00:05:35.541
These are yours.

62
00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:41.484
Get it together.

63
00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:45.008
Joon, wait for me!

64
00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:01.212
- Joon.
- Huh?

65
00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:04.483
Are you sick or something?
You don't look so good.

66
00:06:04.483 --> 00:06:06.645
Ah, no. It's nothing.

67
00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:12.834
Sorry.

68
00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:15.626
Is it a cold?

69
00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:22.953
Gosh, drive carefully.

70
00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:01.750
- Hold on, Joon.
- Huh?

71
00:07:06.183 --> 00:07:08.866
What.. what are you doing?

72
00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:16.743
I think you have a fever.

73
00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:17.780
A fever?

74
00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:22.945
I'm totally okay.

75
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.825
Oh, we're here.
Let's get out.

76
00:07:29.373 --> 00:07:32.255
What a terrible driver!

77
00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:35.349
Joon.

78
00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:37.630
Why aren't they here?

79
00:07:39.162 --> 00:07:40.674
Someone's here, someone's here.

80
00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:48.969
Why is that guy here?

81
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.198
He isn't the CEO
of this cleaning company, is he?

82
00:07:54.388 --> 00:07:59.289
I heard from the section chief that
an unfortunate event occurred yesterday.

83
00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:04.553
When one or two muddy the waters and
our clients start to become unhappy

84
00:08:04.553 --> 00:08:06.762
they will not re-sign
their contract with us.

85
00:08:13.717 --> 00:08:16.688
Hey, why do you have come
into the same one as me?

86
00:08:16.688 --> 00:08:18.698
Are you all right?
You don't look so well.

87
00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:22.356
<i>How could you all protest
in front of the company employees?</i>

88
00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:25.667
What if your actions cause
Gangsu Group to terminate the contract?

89
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:28.267
That means all of you
here will get fired.

90
00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:30.396
It will only cause pain for all of you.

91
00:08:32.038 --> 00:08:34.518
I won't make this long.

92
00:08:34.518 --> 00:08:38.047
Who is the person
who caused the problem yesterday?

93
00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:39.169
Step forward.

94
00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:46.610
I want the leader to come out!

95
00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:52.553
We're sorry we're late.

96
00:08:53.552 --> 00:08:54.632
What do we do?

97
00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:00.062
Wait.

98
00:09:01.632 --> 00:09:02.922
What's with you two?

99
00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:05.384
You...

100
00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:13.395
They are the ones who didn't
know their place yesterday.

101
00:09:19.164 --> 00:09:23.034
What? The chairman's second son?

102
00:09:23.034 --> 00:09:25.472
What is the meaning of this?

103
00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:30.212
Is this a test from Gangsu Group with
the upcoming contract renewal?

104
00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:33.053
Well, I never received any such orders.

105
00:09:35.683 --> 00:09:37.323
What's going on?

106
00:09:37.323 --> 00:09:39.054
Oh, Chief!

107
00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:42.005
I'm glad you're here.

108
00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:43.183
What's the problem?

109
00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:47.203
Ah, well to be honest...

110
00:09:47.203 --> 00:09:48.823
I should've introduced myself earlier.

111
00:09:48.823 --> 00:09:51.223
I am CEO Min Sang Ho
of Hangang Services.

112
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.405
Yes. It's an honor.

113
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.645
The thing is, Sir...

114
00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.953
Don't worry about it
too much. Go on as usual.

115
00:10:07.953 --> 00:10:09.577
Yes, I will.

116
00:10:09.577 --> 00:10:14.145
Regarding any issues
caused by Mister Byun Hyuk

117
00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:17.198
I'll do what I can to handle
the public opinion.

118
00:10:17.198 --> 00:10:18.938
All you need to do is say the word.

119
00:10:18.938 --> 00:10:21.366
What do you mean handle public opinion?

120
00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:24.766
Are you implying this
is all a show for the public?

121
00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:27.538
Pardon? Of course, not.

122
00:10:27.538 --> 00:10:29.568
That wasn't my intent at all.

123
00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:31.747
He won't need special
treatment as the employer's son.

124
00:10:31.747 --> 00:10:34.718
Treat Hyuk like any other employee.

125
00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.188
The same?

126
00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:39.486
Yes, the same.

127
00:10:39.486 --> 00:10:42.746
The same without any special treatment.

128
00:10:42.746 --> 00:10:46.536
If I hear that he's getting
special "Golden Spoon" treatment

129
00:10:46.536 --> 00:10:49.860
I won't stand for it.

130
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.882
Do you understand my meaning?

131
00:10:51.882 --> 00:10:55.872
Yes, I understand your meaning.

132
00:10:55.872 --> 00:11:00.443
It would be an honor if I could
meet with you another time.

133
00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.641
Yeah.

134
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:26.496
Push, pop, push, pop, push, pop.

135
00:11:27.944 --> 00:11:30.054
Joon, did you see?

136
00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:31.345
Today is all clear!

137
00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:33.025
Flush, flush!

138
00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.236
You did well.

139
00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:37.427
Can you come out for a bit?

140
00:11:40.406 --> 00:11:42.386
Gosh, seriously.

141
00:11:46.577 --> 00:11:50.938
Are the facilities managers
doing their jobs or not?

142
00:11:50.938 --> 00:11:53.696
They should figure out
the source of the problem and fix it.

143
00:11:53.696 --> 00:11:56.295
Is it the toilet or the drain?

144
00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:57.693
Don't you agree, Joon?

145
00:11:57.693 --> 00:12:00.026
That's how management usually is.

146
00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:03.198
Rather than taking countermeasures,
they work harder on the aftermath.

147
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:06.347
That includes your older brother.

148
00:12:07.876 --> 00:12:09.457
Come on, Joon.

149
00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:13.659
Including my brother
in that group is upsetting to me.

150
00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:15.669
My older brother
isn't that kind of person.

151
00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:17.000
You trust your brother that much?

152
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.198
Of course. I may not trust my father.

153
00:12:19.198 --> 00:12:20.579
I can trust my brother though.

154
00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:25.018
Even if everyone turns on me,
he will be on my side until the end.

155
00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:27.385
Yeah? Really?

156
00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:29.196
Of course, really.

157
00:12:33.026 --> 00:12:36.184
That's a relief if it's true.

158
00:12:36.184 --> 00:12:37.881
Joon, Mister Byun.

159
00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:39.215
- Come have some coffee.
- Okay.

160
00:12:39.215 --> 00:12:40.783
- Come on.
- Okay.

161
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:47.707
Her nuance makes me feel uneasy.

162
00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:50.736
Joon!

163
00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:59.646
What should I do with them?

164
00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.304
What are you conflicted about?

165
00:13:01.304 --> 00:13:02.961
He said don't treat them any differently.

166
00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:05.533
Ah, I see. I understand.

167
00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:07.712
I'll fire them all today.

168
00:13:08.792 --> 00:13:12.143
No need to do that and
make things noisy.

169
00:13:12.143 --> 00:13:15.062
- What?
- Make them quit on their own.

170
00:13:16.252 --> 00:13:17.880
You can do that, right?

171
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.980
Ah... yes. I can.

172
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.345
I understand.

173
00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:34.135
Do you have a list of the VJs
who do eating programs?

174
00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:37.145
Yes, about 100.

175
00:13:37.145 --> 00:13:39.574
What about magazine
editors and reporters?

176
00:13:39.574 --> 00:13:41.643
Yes, we're waiting to hear from them.

177
00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:45.068
Oh, it'll resolve itself
if you wait, won't it?

178
00:13:45.068 --> 00:13:48.487
Call them yourself
and check. Hurry it up.

179
00:13:48.487 --> 00:13:50.327
Yes, Section Chief.

180
00:13:50.327 --> 00:13:53.728
We don't have much time until
the event, so be on your toes.

181
00:13:53.728 --> 00:13:55.879
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes.

182
00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.148
Also, Section Chief Kwon.

183
00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:00.055
Yes?

184
00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:02.674
For the sampling event of
the new food product...

185
00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:05.704
Section Chief Kwon,
you can plan the entire thing.

186
00:14:08.803 --> 00:14:10.515
Me?

187
00:14:10.515 --> 00:14:12.905
Yes, I'm talking about you.

188
00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:18.886
Take charge and plan
the event so that it's a success.

189
00:14:18.886 --> 00:14:20.755
Yes, I'll work hard.

190
00:14:22.105 --> 00:14:25.279
Don't work hard.

191
00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.097
You need to do it well.

192
00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:40.982
<i>[Father] </i>

193
00:14:51.043 --> 00:14:53.688
Yes, Managing Director.
I did as you told me.

194
00:15:01.444 --> 00:15:03.723
<i>[Employee Profile]</i>

195
00:15:06.678 --> 00:15:10.573
<i>[Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

196
00:15:19.346 --> 00:15:22.636
Oh, Jae Hoon.
Sorry to call when you're busy.

197
00:15:22.636 --> 00:15:24.625
What is it?

198
00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.014
Well, the thing is...

199
00:15:32.305 --> 00:15:35.230
I came to see Hyuk, Section Chief Kwon.

200
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:40.220
I heard he had an odd job here,
so I came to see for myself.

201
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.732
Where is my Hyuk?

202
00:15:42.732 --> 00:15:43.740
Hm?

203
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.625
Where is he?

204
00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:06.549
What is this?

205
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.860
Why are we suddenly in charge of this?

206
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.029
People's jobs can change
depending on the situation.

207
00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:14.289
Why are you arguing about it?

208
00:16:14.289 --> 00:16:16.559
Did CEO Min tell you to do this?

209
00:16:19.448 --> 00:16:23.367
Well, who told you to go
eat in the employee cafeteria?

210
00:16:24.682 --> 00:16:28.827
You're telling me this is
because we ate in the cafeteria?

211
00:16:28.827 --> 00:16:31.712
So, is CEO Min is giving us
a taste of our own medicine?

212
00:16:31.712 --> 00:16:32.946
Forget it.

213
00:16:32.946 --> 00:16:35.904
You are all in charge
of this today, so just know that.

214
00:16:35.904 --> 00:16:38.834
It's no fun if you walk off on the job.

215
00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:41.066
You know the terms
of your contract very well.

216
00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:43.140
So, you shouldn't need
much explanation, right?

217
00:16:45.217 --> 00:16:47.106
That guy...

218
00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:50.651
What is so wrong
about eating in the cafeteria?

219
00:16:50.651 --> 00:16:52.697
Does this make sense?

220
00:16:52.697 --> 00:16:55.606
Seems like this is about Mister Byun.

221
00:16:55.606 --> 00:16:58.555
He's getting revenge
for the brick on his head, right?

222
00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:02.122
Still, he is the chairman's
son. I doubt it.

223
00:17:02.122 --> 00:17:04.235
My goodness.

224
00:17:04.235 --> 00:17:06.653
By the way, where is Mister Byun?

225
00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:09.704
You're right.
They took him somewhere else.

226
00:17:09.704 --> 00:17:11.214
I don't see him at all.

227
00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:19.064
What? Mister... Mister Byun Hyuk?

228
00:17:19.064 --> 00:17:21.985
Yes, his mother is looking for him.

229
00:17:21.985 --> 00:17:23.566
Where is Hyuk now?

230
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.215
Ah, wait... wait... wait a moment.

231
00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:35.110
Yes, Manager Jung.
It's me, Section Chief Gong.

232
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.617
Yes, about Mister... Mister Byun Hyuk.

233
00:17:37.617 --> 00:17:40.400
Yes, yes. The chairman's second son.

234
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.891
Can you get him over here now?

235
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:44.700
Oh, about that...

236
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.112
I received orders that I shouldn't treat
him special as the employer's son.

237
00:17:49.112 --> 00:17:50.882
Where is he right now?

238
00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:54.805
What? What did you say?

239
00:17:54.805 --> 00:17:56.865
Where?

240
00:18:01.284 --> 00:18:02.787
Ah... ah.

241
00:18:20.778 --> 00:18:22.980
What is it? Section Chief Gong!

242
00:18:25.525 --> 00:18:28.246
What... what are we to do?

243
00:18:31.474 --> 00:18:32.515
What?

244
00:18:55.296 --> 00:18:57.861
<i>Oh, Mom!</i>

245
00:18:57.861 --> 00:19:00.752
Oh... oh my, oh my, oh my!

246
00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:04.583
Oh my, oh my, oh my!

247
00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:05.919
Hyuk!

248
00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:09.464
Oh my, oh my! Oh my, hey. Oh my!

249
00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:10.507
Get down.

250
00:19:10.507 --> 00:19:12.785
Mom, I'm flying.

251
00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:15.052
No, no. Don't do that. Get down.

252
00:19:15.052 --> 00:19:16.394
Oh no! No!

253
00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:18.243
Hey!

254
00:19:18.243 --> 00:19:21.071
No, no Hyuk! Get down. Get down!

255
00:19:21.071 --> 00:19:24.147
No, no! You can't do that! No!

256
00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:26.739
Stop that. Stop that and come down!

257
00:19:29.092 --> 00:19:30.457
Honey!

258
00:19:31.552 --> 00:19:34.112
Honey, honey, honey!

259
00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:38.438
What brings you here?

260
00:19:38.438 --> 00:19:40.112
What do you mean?

261
00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:42.912
How could say such a thing like
nothing's going on?

262
00:19:42.912 --> 00:19:47.352
Are you this calm knowing what our
Hyuk is doing right now?

263
00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.622
He's probably cleaning something.

264
00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:53.213
It's not just regular cleaning!

265
00:19:53.213 --> 00:19:55.362
He's working hard at his job.

266
00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:58.233
Don't sway him and weaken him.

267
00:19:58.233 --> 00:20:02.062
Because you always protect him...

268
00:20:02.062 --> 00:20:04.592
Hyuk has always been weak.

269
00:20:04.592 --> 00:20:06.332
Weak?

270
00:20:06.332 --> 00:20:09.824
Is that why you hung Hyuk
out there like that?

271
00:20:11.362 --> 00:20:14.653
Hung him out? What are you talking about?

272
00:20:29.273 --> 00:20:32.171
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

273
00:20:32.171 --> 00:20:36.586
Oh! He's cleaning the exterior today.

274
00:20:36.586 --> 00:20:38.610
This kid is tougher than I thought.

275
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.066
Father!

276
00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:42.004
Yeah.

277
00:20:42.004 --> 00:20:45.519
My goodness.
How can you say that after seeing him?

278
00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:48.499
What if there's an accident
while he's out there?

279
00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:52.898
Gangsu!

280
00:20:52.898 --> 00:20:53.996
Keep it up.

281
00:20:57.329 --> 00:21:00.105
What is our Hyuk going to do?

282
00:21:00.105 --> 00:21:02.477
I'm going to go insane!

283
00:21:02.477 --> 00:21:04.640
Find out who it is right now.

284
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.921
Find out right now who put my child
on that dangerous thing.

285
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:10.780
Picture.

286
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.590
- Gangsu!
- I like it.

287
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.516
Honey!

288
00:21:16.632 --> 00:21:18.773
One, two, three.

289
00:21:20.285 --> 00:21:22.439
<i>Stay still.</i>

290
00:21:22.439 --> 00:21:24.918
<i>One, two, three.</i>

291
00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:29.649
What? Cleaning the exterior?

292
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.310
Must you guys do
dangerous things like that?

293
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.888
That man, CEO Min, is crazy.

294
00:21:37.888 --> 00:21:39.949
CEO Min?

295
00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:41.398
What are you talking about?

296
00:21:41.398 --> 00:21:45.428
Hey, explain to me what's going on.

297
00:21:45.428 --> 00:21:46.909
And where are you right now?

298
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:49.118
You don't need to know.
I'll figure it out.

299
00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:54.445
- Joon.
- I have to hang up.

300
00:21:59.376 --> 00:22:01.478
CEO Min?

301
00:22:01.478 --> 00:22:03.315
Joon, are you okay?

302
00:22:03.315 --> 00:22:05.644
Your cough doesn't sound good.

303
00:22:05.644 --> 00:22:08.236
It's okay, just a passing cold.

304
00:22:08.236 --> 00:22:11.078
Who was that on the phone?

305
00:22:11.078 --> 00:22:14.525
Apparently, Hyuk is cleaning
the exterior of the building.

306
00:22:14.525 --> 00:22:15.600
- What?
- What?

307
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.754
The exterior of the building?

308
00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:20.139
I think I need to go
upstairs for a moment.

309
00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:22.369
We were told to stay put.
Do you think it'll be okay?

310
00:22:22.369 --> 00:22:25.367
Isn't cleaning the exterior
of the building a bit severe?

311
00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:28.907
All right, we'll finish up here.
Go on upstairs.

312
00:22:28.907 --> 00:22:31.046
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

313
00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:32.615
Sorry.

314
00:22:32.615 --> 00:22:34.806
Is the manager crazy?

315
00:22:34.806 --> 00:22:38.996
What's he thinking putting a kid
with no experience out there?

316
00:22:38.996 --> 00:22:41.095
Seriously now.

317
00:22:51.555 --> 00:22:53.832
I feel queasy.

318
00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:57.531
I like land. I missed you.

319
00:23:00.141 --> 00:23:03.141
Quit now if you can't do it.

320
00:23:03.141 --> 00:23:04.950
Who said I can't do it?

321
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.428
But, how can you give
that dangerous job to a beginner?

322
00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:10.239
What if there was an accident?

323
00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:12.604
Do you think I enjoy
doing this to you people?

324
00:23:12.604 --> 00:23:16.628
I have a son and daughter too.
Do you think I enjoy harassing you?

325
00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.527
The higher-ups are
ordering it. What can I do?

326
00:23:18.527 --> 00:23:20.776
Do I have any power?

327
00:23:20.776 --> 00:23:23.170
So, can you all stop bothering me?

328
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.247
Just quit on your own.

329
00:23:26.247 --> 00:23:28.388
If you two quit...

330
00:23:28.388 --> 00:23:32.756
I'll put Mister Lee, Mister Kim, and
Madam Ahn back in their old places.

331
00:23:32.756 --> 00:23:35.698
Don't hold out and make others suffer.

332
00:23:35.698 --> 00:23:36.938
Think it over.

333
00:23:43.698 --> 00:23:47.008
Get downstairs now!
I told you not to leave your work.

334
00:23:50.717 --> 00:23:52.758
What a load of crap.

335
00:23:56.339 --> 00:23:58.658
<i>Do you trust your brother that much?</i>

336
00:23:58.658 --> 00:24:02.935
Don't you know facilities management is
managed by management and administration?

337
00:24:02.935 --> 00:24:05.244
The highest person there
is your older brother.

338
00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:07.157
The higher-ups are
ordering it. What can I do?

339
00:24:07.157 --> 00:24:08.253
Do I have any power?

340
00:24:16.944 --> 00:24:18.053
Hyuk.

341
00:24:19.974 --> 00:24:21.705
You were there?

342
00:24:26.622 --> 00:24:30.405
How could a father do that?

343
00:24:30.405 --> 00:24:32.728
Is he only my son? It's his son too.

344
00:24:32.728 --> 00:24:34.296
How absurd.

345
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.130
Oh, my Hyuk!

346
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.550
Ta-da.

347
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:46.274
I rode a gondola.

348
00:24:48.162 --> 00:24:50.486
At first, it was very scary.

349
00:24:50.486 --> 00:24:54.668
After I was on it for five minutes,
I thought, "Oh, it's not bad."

350
00:24:54.668 --> 00:24:56.938
I was actually well-suited for it.

351
00:24:56.938 --> 00:24:59.586
I'm actually into extreme things.

352
00:24:59.586 --> 00:25:03.517
I really like bungee
jumping and skydiving.

353
00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:10.387
So, let's not quit for them.

354
00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:20.332
If we quit like they want us to,
how should I put it...

355
00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:22.027
Um...

356
00:25:22.027 --> 00:25:23.833
It would be shameful.

357
00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:26.328
That's right! Also...

358
00:25:26.328 --> 00:25:30.358
How should I put it? It's kind of...

359
00:25:30.358 --> 00:25:34.138
It feels like we'd be giving into
something unjust, so you're angry?

360
00:25:34.138 --> 00:25:36.907
Yes, that's exactly it!

361
00:25:36.907 --> 00:25:39.155
Joon, you always know how I feel.

362
00:25:39.155 --> 00:25:41.178
Oh, how unusual.

363
00:25:41.178 --> 00:25:43.300
You have that kind
of strength too, Byun Hyuk?

364
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.528
What do you mean?

365
00:25:44.528 --> 00:25:47.350
I'm someone who walked into
the prosecutor's office on my own.

366
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.459
You saw it too.

367
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:51.835
My spirit, courage, and passion.

368
00:25:51.835 --> 00:25:54.224
I saw a bit of bluffing.

369
00:25:54.224 --> 00:25:55.544
Hey now.

370
00:25:55.544 --> 00:25:59.363
You can't talk of my sincere
passion for you like that.

371
00:26:01.217 --> 00:26:05.198
Because of you and for you,
I've come this far.

372
00:26:16.477 --> 00:26:19.864
What did he say?
Because of that girl?

373
00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:26.631
Oh, your face is red again.

374
00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:32.601
Red? Red? Who is red?

375
00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:35.765
I'm not red. Oh, it's hot.

376
00:26:39.576 --> 00:26:42.229
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

377
00:26:42.229 --> 00:26:44.024
Oh yeah? You're hungry?

378
00:26:44.024 --> 00:26:47.232
Then we should go. Let's go eat now.

379
00:26:47.232 --> 00:26:48.333
What are you doing?

380
00:26:52.405 --> 00:26:54.136
You're coughing? You really have a cold?

381
00:26:54.136 --> 00:26:55.977
Who is that girl?

382
00:26:58.262 --> 00:27:01.367
She's already close to him,
a girl like Pyunggang.

383
00:27:02.694 --> 00:27:03.794
It can't be.

384
00:27:05.092 --> 00:27:08.570
<i>A protest? What complete nonsense.</i>

385
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:12.081
We just wanted to eat a meal.
How is that a protest?

386
00:27:12.081 --> 00:27:14.636
They're just service
company contractors too.

387
00:27:14.636 --> 00:27:16.906
Do they think they're
some high ranked people?

388
00:27:16.906 --> 00:27:19.864
Let's not sit here.
Let's go up to eat lunch.

389
00:27:19.864 --> 00:27:21.309
Joon?

390
00:27:21.309 --> 00:27:23.088
No thanks.

391
00:27:23.088 --> 00:27:26.797
I don't want to cause problems and
put people in difficult positions.

392
00:27:27.853 --> 00:27:29.052
Goodness.

393
00:27:34.761 --> 00:27:36.804
Let's just finish our job.

394
00:27:40.047 --> 00:27:41.809
I just can't understand it.

395
00:27:41.809 --> 00:27:44.728
We have the meal tickets and
we only want to use them to eat.

396
00:27:44.728 --> 00:27:46.278
What is so complicated?

397
00:27:46.278 --> 00:27:47.631
What can we do?

398
00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:51.285
Big corporations like this don't
hire cleaners like us directly.

399
00:27:51.285 --> 00:27:52.355
Why?

400
00:27:52.355 --> 00:27:56.755
Because of things like
insurance, benefits, retirement.

401
00:27:56.755 --> 00:28:00.167
There's so much
to take care of for employees.

402
00:28:00.167 --> 00:28:03.315
That's why they use contract
services for convenience.

403
00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:08.446
Then can they be hired by
Gangsu Group if they change their mind?

404
00:28:08.446 --> 00:28:11.138
If the company changes
its mind, then yes.

405
00:28:11.138 --> 00:28:13.225
There wouldn't be a need
for a service contractor.

406
00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:15.305
Then we could eat
in the employee cafeteria too?

407
00:28:15.305 --> 00:28:19.767
Of course, if that's the company
policy, we could eat there.

408
00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:21.649
Eureka.

409
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:24.979
These are all the forms
of discrimination that we don't see.

410
00:28:24.979 --> 00:28:30.261
Though we're so used to it that
we don't even feel it anymore.

411
00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:31.976
You're right.

412
00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:34.850
Let's just buy lots of kimbap.

413
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.001
Oh, I'm hungry.

414
00:28:37.001 --> 00:28:38.655
- Come on.
- Get up.

415
00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:41.043
They can hire them directly.

416
00:28:42.323 --> 00:28:44.094
If only the company decides to...

417
00:28:52.056 --> 00:28:53.379
Oh, Joon!

418
00:28:53.379 --> 00:28:55.277
- Joon!
- What's wrong?

419
00:28:55.277 --> 00:28:56.352
Joon.

420
00:29:06.398 --> 00:29:08.138
- Oh no!
- Joon!

421
00:29:08.138 --> 00:29:09.609
Joon!

422
00:29:10.646 --> 00:29:13.734
No! Watch out!

423
00:29:13.734 --> 00:29:15.546
Joon, what do we do?

424
00:29:15.546 --> 00:29:17.075
Joon!

425
00:29:18.853 --> 00:29:20.677
Are you okay, Joon?

426
00:29:20.677 --> 00:29:21.925
- Joon.
- Joon!

427
00:29:21.925 --> 00:29:23.169
Joon!

428
00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:24.862
- Joon.
- Joon!

429
00:29:24.862 --> 00:29:26.207
Are you all right?

430
00:29:26.207 --> 00:29:27.493
Joon!

431
00:29:27.493 --> 00:29:29.769
- Joon.
- Joon!

432
00:29:29.769 --> 00:29:31.400

00:30:12.301 --> 00:30:14.417
What now? Did you cause a problem?

440
00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:15.976
Joon passed out.

441
00:30:15.976 --> 00:30:18.455

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:20.055

Okay.

What? No, that's my name.

No, you need to write the patient's name.

No.

00:32:11.568 --> 00:32:14.477
- Any allergies?
- No.

468
00:32:14.477 --> 00:32:16.257

In the ER.

474
00:32:40.952 --> 00:32:43.929
Seeing that she has a fever,
it seems she has a slight cold.

475
00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:45.848
She also has overexertion.

476
00:32:45.848 --> 00:32:47.421
Overexertion?

477
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:50.861
There's nothing else particularly
wrong, so she can finish the IV

478
00:32:50.861 --> 00:32:53.078
then pick up medication.

479
00:32:53.078 --> 00:32:55.749
She must rest for things like this.

480
00:32:55.749 --> 00:32:58.295
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

481
00:33:10.135 --> 00:33:11.641
According to the cleaning manager...

482
00:33:13.985 --> 00:33:15.650
the higher-ups ordered him to do it.

483
00:33:16.662 --> 00:33:19.786
Was that person CEO Min
of the cleaning company?

484
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:23.991
I still don't understand it though.

485
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:25.412
Even so...

486
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:32.011
Why would CEO Min be so
harsh with me and Joon?

487
00:33:32.011 --> 00:33:33.199
Is it possibly because of....

488
00:33:34.477 --> 00:33:36.546
that brick incident?

489
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:46.549
Are you that slow?

490
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:48.731
Or are you just pretending?

491
00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:54.219
Even if he disliked you and Joon,
he knows you're the chairman's son.

492
00:33:54.219 --> 00:34:00.121
Would it make sense for CEO Min
to do that without anyone backing him?

493
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.351
Is the person backing CEO Min...

494
00:34:05.953 --> 00:34:07.160
my older brother?

495
00:34:30.212 --> 00:34:31.821
Do you think you can handle it?

496
00:34:49.783 --> 00:34:51.261
Attempted murder?

497
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:52.466
Yes.

498
00:34:52.466 --> 00:34:56.806
But, it was never, ever
my intent to call the police.

499
00:34:56.806 --> 00:35:00.743
I didn't know that it was your brother,
the second son of Gangsu Group either.

500
00:35:01.738 --> 00:35:05.576
The second son of Gangsu Group
working in a construction site.

501
00:35:05.576 --> 00:35:07.417
Who could imagine that?

502
00:35:10.384 --> 00:35:13.585
You two have an amusing
relationship of bad fate.

503
00:35:14.852 --> 00:35:16.480
Yes.

504
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.634
So, I wanted to resolve
the misunderstanding...

505
00:35:18.634 --> 00:35:21.216
No need to worry over
one measly service employee.

506
00:35:22.634 --> 00:35:28.042
Well, thanks to your injured
forehead, we managed to meet.

507

Ah.

508

That's an honor.

No matter what you need done
from now on, please use me.

510
00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:39.113
Hangang Services doesn't
only provide cleaning.

511
00:35:39.113 --> 00:35:41.701
We are experts at cleaning up
any other pesky things.

512
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.812
For example?

513
00:35:45.873 --> 00:35:49.274
Anything you don't wish
to dirty your hands with.

514
00:35:49.274 --> 00:35:53.897
Something unclear or messy,
anything that's bothersome.

515

My goodness. It sounds like
you're talking about Hyuk.

516
00:35:59.946 --> 00:36:02.013
It makes me feel awkward to hear it.

517
00:36:04.431 --> 00:36:08.040
Whatever the case,
just give me your orders.

Please accept this drink.

519

Woo Sung.

520

Thanks.

521

This is an employee application.

522

There are open applications
coming up at the company for interns.

523
00:38:04.392 --> 00:38:07.113
I'm just frustrated seeing you like this.

524
00:38:07.113 --> 00:38:09.966
Why suffer instead of going down
an easier, more comfortable path?

525
00:38:09.966 --> 00:38:11.857
What's an easy and comfortable path?

526
00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:17.694
A career that you can
show off to others about?

527
00:38:17.694 --> 00:38:21.674
Or a high salary?

528
00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:23.413
Ask other people.

529
00:38:23.413 --> 00:38:26.379
Ask them which of us is right.

530
00:38:26.379 --> 00:38:29.629
Don't be delusional that you're right.

531
00:38:29.629 --> 00:38:34.109
In the end, people live
according to their beliefs.

532
00:38:36.627 --> 00:38:38.803
You continue to choose
to work hard labor jobs.

533

What are these beliefs of yours?

I'm all right.

I went to the ER for a cold.

How embarrassing.

544
00:40:20.866 --> 00:40:25.451
It wasn't just a cold.
You had overexerted yourself too.

545
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:27.712
A cold and overexertion.

546

And you were down in the garbage
room working where the air was bad.

If you think about it...

Hey, why is that your fault?

It's CEO Min's fault
for abusing his power.

00:40:45.152 --> 00:40:47.129
Anyway, that makes it my fault.

- Hyuk.
- So, I was thinking, Joon...

I think that...

I should quit.

You said we shouldn't quit.
You said so yourself.

557
00:41:02.183 --> 00:41:04.212
You said that it would be shameful.

558
00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:05.859
That it was giving in to injustice.

559
00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:11.277
If I quit, you, Mister Kim,
Mister Lee, and Madam Ahn...

What about your promise to your father?

562

He'll assume I can only go that far.

563
00:41:20.701 --> 00:41:23.203
I was always that kind of son.

564

Whether you continue
to work or not, that is your choice.

I don't want to hear
that you did it because of us.

Honestly... it's just an excuse.

00:48:53.404 --> 00:48:57.475
If we don't work now and
just leave, what can you do about it?

655
00:48:57.475 --> 00:48:59.406
They will say the cleaning job is a mess.

656
00:48:59.406 --> 00:49:01.622
The company employees
will complain loudly.

657
00:49:01.622 --> 00:49:04.852
If you don't empty trash for half a day,
the place is overflowing with it.

658
00:49:04.852 --> 00:49:06.687
Can you re-sign
the contract, at that rate?

659
00:49:06.687 --> 00:49:10.165
- That's right.
- No, you can't!

660
00:49:10.165 --> 00:49:11.305
Of course.

661
00:49:11.305 --> 00:49:13.346
Are you threatening me?

662
00:49:13.346 --> 00:49:15.683
You're the one making
threats, Manager Jung.

663
00:49:15.683 --> 00:49:18.810
- When did I do that?
- You just did!

664
00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.167
Why you people...

665
00:49:20.167 --> 00:49:22.335
Are going to take
an organized group action?

666
00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:25.031
Should we? Should we, Manager Jung?

667
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:27.498
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

668
00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:29.636
- Let's go for it!
- Come on.

669
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:34.058
Act like a manager if you're the manager.

670
00:49:34.058 --> 00:49:35.825
You think you're all that if
you're manager?

671
00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.285
What? An organized group action?

672
00:49:41.285 --> 00:49:44.705
Yes, they've gone mad
because of that girl Baek Joon.

673
00:49:44.705 --> 00:49:46.395
They all refuse to work.

Good morning, CEO Min.

677
00:49:55.498 --> 00:49:59.080
- Seriously, this punk.
- What?

678
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.234
Excuse me? Me?

679
00:50:02.234 --> 00:50:04.353
Are you talking to me?

680
00:50:04.353 --> 00:50:05.743
Let's talk later.

681
00:50:09.064 --> 00:50:10.172
What's with you?

682
00:50:10.172 --> 00:50:12.113
I came to see you, CEO Min.

683
00:50:12.113 --> 00:50:13.843
Your door happened to be open.

684
00:50:16.593 --> 00:50:17.973
What's your business with me?

685
00:50:19.024 --> 00:50:22.823
I just had one thing
I wanted you to know.

686
00:50:22.823 --> 00:50:23.940
What?

687
00:50:31.002 --> 00:50:35.872
You won't be able to renew your
contract with Gangsu Group.

688
00:50:35.872 --> 00:50:36.892
What?

689
00:50:36.892 --> 00:50:38.792
I'll stop you from
renewing that contract.

690
00:50:41.114 --> 00:50:45.776
Gosh... what are going on about so
early in the morning, you punk?

691
00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:50.466
Hey, you've been tossed out by your
family, so how will you stop it?

692
00:50:50.466 --> 00:50:52.576
You're dressed in this cleaner's uniform.

693
00:50:52.576 --> 00:50:55.451
You picked up money
from construction. What can you do?

694
00:50:55.451 --> 00:50:58.241
Then who are trusting
to act so foolishly?

695
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:03.852
Your older brother
told me to stomp you out.

696
00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:04.892
Satisfied?

697
00:51:08.837 --> 00:51:12.140
Do you think you can handle it?

698
00:51:14.955 --> 00:51:17.038
I'll have to handle it.

699
00:51:17.038 --> 00:51:18.091
What can I do about it?

700
00:51:19.457 --> 00:51:20.526
What?

701
00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:34.640
He'll handle it.

702
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.248
Hyuk said that?

703
00:51:36.248 --> 00:51:37.917
Yes.

704
00:51:37.917 --> 00:51:40.426
There is a problem in the building
management, as well.

705
00:51:40.426 --> 00:51:44.707
Byun Hyuk and someone else, Baek Joon,
have mobilized my company employees.

706
00:51:44.707 --> 00:51:46.968
They are taking a group action.

707
00:51:46.968 --> 00:51:49.973
The plan on protesting during
the sampling event tomorrow.

708
00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:52.312
What should I do?

709
00:51:52.312 --> 00:51:57.254
Should I take care
of it before it gets noisy?

710
00:51:57.254 --> 00:51:58.830
No.

711
00:51:58.830 --> 00:51:59.991
Excuse me?

712
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:04.473
Leave them alone.

713
00:52:08.535 --> 00:52:10.745
What do you mean?

714
00:52:10.745 --> 00:52:13.444
It seems like Hyuk
is determined for once.

715
00:52:13.444 --> 00:52:16.955
Leave him and let's see what he does.

716
00:52:16.955 --> 00:52:21.174
But, the CEO will be at
the sampling event tomorrow.

717
00:52:21.174 --> 00:52:23.935
Not just the CEO,
but external parties too.

718
00:52:23.935 --> 00:52:26.457
There will be reporters with cameras.

719
00:52:26.457 --> 00:52:27.620
Will it be okay?

720
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.928
Hyuk says he will handle it.

721
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.727
Leave him alone to do what he wants.

722
00:52:38.928 --> 00:52:42.127
The event will be ruined and
Hyuk will be taken care of.

723
00:52:42.127 --> 00:52:44.187
Two birds with one stone, right?

724
00:52:53.027 --> 00:52:55.069
Just pretend you didn't know.

725
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:59.218
Since Hyuk will cause the problem,
you won't get in trouble.

726

Where have you been
all this time? The event is tomorrow.

727
00:53:11.803 --> 00:53:14.674
Will the event run smoothly?

728
00:53:14.674 --> 00:53:16.105
I'm sorry.

729
00:53:16.105 --> 00:53:18.165
I'm sure he'll do well.

730
00:53:18.165 --> 00:53:20.603
He has great personnel record.

731
00:53:20.603 --> 00:53:24.464
All of the projects he's
taken on have succeeded.

732
00:53:24.464 --> 00:53:29.305
Also, he wouldn't mess up
the first event he takes on here.

733
00:53:29.305 --> 00:53:30.424
Isn't that right?

734
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.844
I will do my best, Director.

735

to the Managing Director and team, right?

Are cleaning employees not human?

Does it make sense that we
can't even get worker's compensation?

754

This happened because you fought
to get us cafeteria meal tickets.

We wouldn't be humans

Yes, of course.

your father and your brother.

816
00:58:52.693 --> 00:58:57.374
Even if you stop now,
no one would say a thing.

817
00:59:01.544 --> 00:59:03.334
That's why I have to do it.

818
00:59:06.787 --> 00:59:08.630
Because they are my father and brother.

819
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:13.947
So, no one else can do this.

820
00:59:15.146 --> 00:59:16.695
I have to do it, Joon.

821
00:59:21.765 --> 00:59:23.311
<i>Yes.</i>

822
00:59:23.311 --> 00:59:27.506
<i>I have go up against my father
and my older brother.</i>

823
00:59:27.506 --> 00:59:29.744
<i>I never dreamed of doing such a thing.</i>

824
00:59:29.744 --> 00:59:32.599
<i>I never dared to imagine it.</i>

825
00:59:32.599 --> 00:59:36.689
<i>This miracle of getting courage
I did not have before.</i>

826
00:59:36.689 --> 00:59:39.900
<i>It is because of you.</i>

827
00:59:57.537 --> 00:59:58.856
Oh, hello.

828
00:59:58.856 --> 01:00:00.952
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

829
01:00:00.952 --> 01:00:02.186
- Please go in.
- Yes. Okay.

830
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.242
Thank you all for coming.

831
01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:09.838
- Hello.
- Yes.

832
01:00:14.407 --> 01:00:16.356
I think this will be good.

833
01:00:16.356 --> 01:00:18.528
It has to be this time.

834
01:00:18.528 --> 01:00:19.930
Our stock prices need to rebound.

835
01:00:25.901 --> 01:00:27.782
- I'm so nervous.
- Me too.

836
01:00:27.782 --> 01:00:29.448
I'm so nervous.

837
01:00:29.448 --> 01:00:31.269
My heart's racing.

838
01:00:31.269 --> 01:00:32.784
- Where's Hyuk?
- Oh, Hyuk.

839
01:00:32.784 --> 01:00:34.410
Oh, you're here?

840
01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.124
All right, now.

841
01:00:36.124 --> 01:00:37.956
Should we do a cheer?

842
01:00:37.956 --> 01:00:39.233
Okay. Sounds good.

843
01:00:39.233 --> 01:00:41.093
- From practice...
- To doing it!

844
01:00:41.093 --> 01:00:42.852
- From doing it...
- To practice!

845
01:00:42.852 --> 01:00:45.994
Oh yeah!

846
01:00:45.994 --> 01:00:47.162
Let's go.

847
01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:52.023
Oh yeah! Yeah!

848
01:01:17.865 --> 01:01:19.921
Here you go.

849
01:01:19.921 --> 01:01:21.168
Should I try it?

850
01:01:21.168 --> 01:01:22.235
Yes.

851
01:01:34.218 --> 01:01:36.160
Please try this.

852
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.423
Hello.

853
01:01:37.423 --> 01:01:39.222
Get a shot of that.

854
01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.755
It looks very good.

855
01:01:42.755 --> 01:01:45.081
Not the meat, but the rice...

856
01:01:47.242 --> 01:01:50.784
This is what you wanted.

857
01:01:50.784 --> 01:01:53.126
It looks good. Look at the plating.

858
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.794
Do you have a picture of that?

859
01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:56.903
Of course, please enjoy.

860
01:01:56.903 --> 01:01:58.646
Lots of people are here.

861
01:01:58.646 --> 01:02:00.959
I think this tastes good.

862
01:02:13.211 --> 01:02:14.568
There's an event here.

863
01:02:14.568 --> 01:02:15.802
Oh, it's me.

864
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:18.425
He must not have known.

865
01:02:37.329 --> 01:02:38.602
- Let's go!
- Good luck.

866
01:02:38.602 --> 01:02:41.523
- Yes.
- Oh yeah!

867
01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.519
Move.

868
01:02:58.889 --> 01:03:00.968
Hello there!

869
01:03:00.968 --> 01:03:03.093
Hello everyone.

870
01:03:03.093 --> 01:03:05.890
We will be putting on show for you.

871
01:03:12.818 --> 01:03:15.490
What is that? Huh?

872
01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.550
What's this?

873
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:18.519
Did they invite performers?

874
01:03:18.519 --> 01:03:19.655
I don't know.

875
01:03:19.655 --> 01:03:22.206
I guess the strategic planning team
prepared something fun.

876
01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.126
Oh my goodness.

877
01:03:35.126 --> 01:03:38.093
That guy there. Isn't that Hyuk?

878
01:03:38.093 --> 01:03:39.961
- Hyuk?
- Oh dear.

879
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:41.193
It is him.

880
01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:44.021
Let's start.

881
01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:46.622
One, two...

882
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.729
Wow, not bad.

883
01:04:06.811 --> 01:04:10.628
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

884
01:04:10.628 --> 01:04:14.188
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

885
01:04:14.188 --> 01:04:17.160
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

886
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.639
<i>In front of love...</i>

887
01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.043
Hey, Section Chief Kwon.
What's going on?

888
01:04:21.043 --> 01:04:22.454
Who the heck are those people?

889
01:04:22.454 --> 01:04:24.023
I really don't know.

890
01:04:24.023 --> 01:04:27.175
Hey, you're in charge,
so who else would know?

891
01:04:27.175 --> 01:04:28.724
Stop them now!

892
01:04:30.438 --> 01:04:34.155
<i>The best drink in this world</i>

893
01:04:34.155 --> 01:04:36.785
<i>is your sweet lips.</i>

894
01:04:36.785 --> 01:04:40.566
<i>The red sun shining for you</i>

895
01:04:40.566 --> 01:04:43.863
<i>I only love you.</i>

896
01:04:43.863 --> 01:04:47.211
<i>I am burning hot.
Just look at me.</i>

897
01:04:47.211 --> 01:04:50.012
<i>I am in you.</i>

898
01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:53.660
<i>I like how sexy you are.
You're not shy at all.</i>

899
01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.898
<i>I like how forward you are.</i>

900
01:04:55.981 --> 01:04:57.137
I'm so sorry, CEO Byun.

901
01:04:57.137 --> 01:04:59.668
I'll stop them now. What are
you doing, Section Chief Kwon?

902
01:04:59.668 --> 01:05:03.204
Hey, hey, hey. Just leave them, okay?

903
01:05:05.438 --> 01:05:08.602
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

904
01:05:08.602 --> 01:05:11.552
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

905
01:05:11.552 --> 01:05:15.086
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

906
01:05:15.086 --> 01:05:18.644
<i>In front of love, I am melting.</i>

907
01:05:22.124 --> 01:05:25.501
<i>The way you smile
is worth a million.</i>

908
01:05:25.501 --> 01:05:28.519
<i>It makes me faint.</i>

909
01:05:28.519 --> 01:05:31.959
<i>The best drink in this world</i>

910
01:05:31.959 --> 01:05:34.305
<i>is your sweet lips.</i>

911
01:05:34.914 --> 01:05:37.809
He's better than I imagined.

912
01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.579
- Right, Sis?
- Yes, isn't he?

913
01:05:39.579 --> 01:05:42.343
Woohoo. He's pretty good.

914
01:05:42.343 --> 01:05:44.117
My goodness.

915
01:05:44.117 --> 01:05:47.247
Who knew he had that kind of talent?

916
01:05:47.762 --> 01:05:50.697
<i>I like how sexy you are.
You're not shy at all.</i>

917
01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:54.590
<i>I like how forward you are.</i>

918
01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:58.095
<i>You are so honest. </i>

919
01:05:58.095 --> 01:06:01.787
<i>I like that about you.</i>

920
01:06:02.863 --> 01:06:06.541
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

921
01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:09.651
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

922
01:06:09.651 --> 01:06:11.528
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

923
01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:13.682
Why you punk...

924
01:06:13.682 --> 01:06:14.950
Come on.

925
01:06:15.941 --> 01:06:19.738
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

926
01:06:19.738 --> 01:06:22.718
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

927
01:06:22.718 --> 01:06:26.247
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

928
01:06:26.247 --> 01:06:29.434
<i>In front of love, I am melting.</i>

929
01:06:37.365 --> 01:06:39.229
- Yes.
- Good job.

930
01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:40.445
Thank you. Thank you.

931
01:06:40.445 --> 01:06:44.303
We are Gangsu Food's cleaners
who are in charge of the hygiene.

932
01:06:44.303 --> 01:06:47.398
We are here performing a congratulatory
song for the new product.

933
01:06:47.398 --> 01:06:52.563
Please give a big round of applause
to the performance from our cleaners.

934
01:06:52.563 --> 01:06:56.626
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

935
01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:03.697
Father, I would've stopped him
if I had known in advance.

936
01:07:03.697 --> 01:07:05.934
I didn't know Hyuk would do
something so foolish.

937
01:07:05.934 --> 01:07:08.744
I'll make sure to discipline him.

938
01:07:08.744 --> 01:07:12.265
Everyone, Gangsu Foods is
a company that makes food.

939
01:07:12.265 --> 01:07:15.345
Hygiene is a basic thing
when it comes to food.

940
01:07:15.345 --> 01:07:18.965
So, our cleaning employees are in the
building where you earn your livelihoods.

941
01:07:18.965 --> 01:07:23.836
They are always doing their
very best for Gangsu Foods.

942
01:07:34.276 --> 01:07:35.805
With that in mind...

943
01:07:36.796 --> 01:07:41.376
Gangsu Group cherishes
our cleaning employees.

944
01:07:42.465 --> 01:07:43.925
They are considerate of them.

945
01:07:49.055 --> 01:07:51.927
Therefore, CEO Byun Gang Su...

946
01:07:52.894 --> 01:07:57.226
has decided to not use external
contractors for cleaning services.

947
01:07:57.226 --> 01:07:58.934
He will hire them directly.

948
01:07:58.934 --> 01:08:03.204
He decided to make that
announcement on this very day.

949
01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:04.742
What?

950
01:08:04.742 --> 01:08:06.459
Is that true?

951
01:08:06.459 --> 01:08:07.776
Hyuk didn't mention that.

952
01:08:07.776 --> 01:08:09.872
That doesn't make sense.

953
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.943
Hyuk.

954
01:08:13.978 --> 01:08:15.387
- What's going on?
- Hey.

955
01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:17.245
What's going on, Byun Hyuk?

956
01:08:17.245 --> 01:08:18.742
I've never heard that before.

957
01:08:18.742 --> 01:08:21.057
Is that true? Is it?

958
01:08:21.057 --> 01:08:23.290
- This never came up.
- He's not that kind of person.

959
01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:25.397
A temporary employee
into a full-time employee?

960
01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:26.978
All of those employees?

961
01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:28.305
Is it true?

962
01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:30.009
- Really?
- Hold on.

963
01:08:30.009 --> 01:08:32.045
CEO Byun Gang Su.

964
01:08:32.045 --> 01:08:37.626
I truly thank you for this
very meaningful decision.

965
01:08:37.626 --> 01:08:40.117
He never mentioned that.

966
01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:41.723
- It must be true.
- Really? Oh my.

967
01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:43.152
CEO Byun Gang Su!

968
01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:46.396
Thank you!

969
01:08:46.396 --> 01:08:49.772
Give him a round of applause!

970
01:08:49.772 --> 01:08:51.129
Woo!

971
01:08:54.326 --> 01:08:57.120
That little punk.

972
01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.045
- CEO!
- Is that true?

973
01:08:59.045 --> 01:09:00.817
Please give us a comment.

974
01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:02.678
Just one comment.

975
01:09:02.678 --> 01:09:04.446
Did you know about this?

976
01:09:04.446 --> 01:09:06.317
Hyuk, you little rascal.

978
01:09:14.009 --> 01:09:15.610
Why did you do it?

<i>you changed the color
of my heart into your color.</i>
