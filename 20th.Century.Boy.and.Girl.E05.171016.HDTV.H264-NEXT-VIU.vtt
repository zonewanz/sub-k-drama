00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:09.637
(In 1999)

2
00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:13.867
In 1999, close friends who were all born in 1983...

3
00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.537
lived in Seoul Mansion, Seoul.

4
00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:18.008
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

5
00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:23.848
- That must be them! - Let's go.

6
00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:35.498
(I love you Anthony.)

7
00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:38.297
- Anthony! - Anthony!

8
00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:41.938
- Anthony! - Anthony!

9
00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:44.907
- Anthony! - Anthony!

10
00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:48.407
Sa Jin Jin was a big fan of Anthony.

11
00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:03.858
Han Ah Reum, a rascal,

12
00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:05.787
was a spoiled brat.

13
00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:10.597
(Mid-term Exam Results)

14
00:01:10.927 --> 00:01:13.998
How many A's do you have? You're incredible.

15
00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:17.297
Jang Young Shim, the genius.

16
00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:19.438
- Gosh, this is so pretty. - Look at this.

17
00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:22.037
- Oh, my. - It's really pretty.

18
00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:23.677
Look at this. Try it on.

19
00:01:23.677 --> 00:01:26.507
- This looks great on you. - It doesn't go along with her.

20
00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:29.647
What do you think about this? Isn't this pretty?

21
00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:30.847
Look at this one.

22
00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:32.188
- No, this one. - What about this?

23
00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:33.748
- This is better. - No, this one is prettier.

24
00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:35.218
This one is the prettiest.

25
00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:39.058
And Gong Ji Won, the only boy member of the group.

26
00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:44.397
Mom, I'm going to school!

27
00:01:46.698 --> 00:01:49.097
- Bye! - Ah Reum is so diligent.

28
00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:53.838
- Hello. - Hello, Ah Reum.

29
00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:59.147
- Wait! - Young Shim is eating again.

30
00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:02.147
Hurry up, Young Shim.

31
00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:03.547
- Gosh, you scared me. - Wait!

32
00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:06.787
You don't need to do that to look pretty.

33
00:02:07.957 --> 00:02:09.458
- Hello. - Hello, Jin Jin.

34
00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:10.757
- Hello. - Hello.

35
00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:13.188
- Let's go! - We're late!

36
00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:14.528
Hurry.

37
00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:16.298
- I nearly forgot about him. - Gosh, he scared me.

38
00:02:16.827 --> 00:02:18.327
- Don't forget me. - You should have come quicker.

39
00:02:18.327 --> 00:02:19.567
- Ji Won. - Yes, sir?

40
00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.637
- Hurry up, won't you? - Don't sit over there.

41
00:02:22.637 --> 00:02:24.167
- Here. - Gosh.

42
00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.167
Ji Won, why do you look so sullen?

43
00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:27.407
Stand next to them. Go.

44
00:02:27.838 --> 00:02:29.477
Hurry. Hurry up.

45
00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:32.678
I'm going to take the picture now. 1, 2, 3.

46
00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:35.077
They called themselves the "Four Bongos"...

47
00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:36.477
and stayed close together.

48
00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:38.648
The name came from the van they took...

49
00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:40.588
to and from school every day.

50
00:02:40.887 --> 00:02:42.588
One day...

51
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:01.738
Girls!

52
00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:09.877
- Where are we? - We're on the way to the tunnel.

53
00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:11.488
What tunnel?

54
00:03:11.488 --> 00:03:13.548
It's a magical tunnel.

55
00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:15.018
- Magical? - Magical?

56
00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:16.817
Do you know the story about Lee Mong Ryong?

57
00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:18.127
- Yes. - Yes.

58
00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:20.458
He went to take the civil service exam in Hanyang...

59
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:21.958
through that tunnel.

60
00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.327
That's how he could live happily ever after with Chun Hyang.

61
00:03:24.327 --> 00:03:26.398
- What are you talking about? - That doesn't make sense.

62
00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:29.137
Cha In Pyo too. He married Shin Ae Ra...

63
00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:30.398
after he passed through this tunnel.

64
00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:31.808
- No way. - No way.

65
00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:34.637
But Romeo failed.

66
00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:37.007
- Why? - He couldn't hold his breath.

67
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:39.007
Love will come true to those who can hold their breaths...

68
00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:40.548
until the end of this tunnel.

69
00:03:40.817 --> 00:03:43.518
- That's how he died? - No, that's not what I meant.

70
00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:46.548
The curse stopped his love from coming true.

71
00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:47.857
- No way. - No way.

72
00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:49.588
- You're a liar. - You're a liar.

73
00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.127
It's the tunnel!

74
00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:34.298
Oh, my.

75
00:04:34.798 --> 00:04:36.368
They didn't know it then...

76
00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:38.767
that not being able to hold her breath...

77
00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.308
would bring her such an unfortunate result.

78
00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:45.608
The curse did not even allow one romantic relationship for her.

79
00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:49.277
The Bongo's Curse...

80
00:04:49.277 --> 00:04:52.288
is probably the reason why Jin Jin never dated anyone.

81
00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:58.228
Did I talk too much about groundless rumors?

82
00:04:58.228 --> 00:05:00.327
No, it was interesting.

83
00:05:00.327 --> 00:05:02.428
I had been curious about why Sa Jin Jin...

84
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:03.928
never dated anyone.

85
00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.498
I want to know more about you, Hee Jin.

86
00:05:05.897 --> 00:05:07.668
I heard you play an instrument.

87
00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:08.837
I play cello.

88
00:05:09.298 --> 00:05:11.567
I studied at The Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory...

89
00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:14.238
and I'm the vice chairwoman of Hanyang Symphony Orchestra.

90
00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:15.738
Tchaikovsky?

91
00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:18.108
It's boring to talk about me, isn't it?

92
00:05:19.207 --> 00:05:21.647
You improve if you try hard every day.

93
00:05:22.178 --> 00:05:26.387
The cello maestro Rostropovich who practiced for...

94
00:05:26.387 --> 00:05:28.118
five hours a day said that.

95
00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:32.627
Rostropovich.

96
00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:34.498
Rost...

97
00:05:35.728 --> 00:05:40.127
This is just... Rostropovich.

98
00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:42.567
Rostropovich.

99
00:05:43.868 --> 00:05:45.837
It's my motto as well.

100
00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:48.007
The best of his performances...

101
00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:50.538
has to be the Cello Suite he performed...

102
00:05:50.538 --> 00:05:52.848
in front of the fallen Berlin Wall.

103
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.418
There are many skilled performers,

104
00:05:55.418 --> 00:05:58.817
but he was the only one who performed with humanism.

105
00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:00.618
Wait, that's wrong.

106
00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:05.058
There's him and now you too.

107
00:06:06.457 --> 00:06:08.757
To your health.

108
00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:16.668
- Is it the co-pilot? - No. Why has Jin Jin never dated?

109
00:06:19.168 --> 00:06:20.707
The Bongo's Curse.

110
00:06:21.637 --> 00:06:23.707
What about you and me then?

111
00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:25.908
Why have we never dated when we held our breaths?

112
00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:28.918
We haven't met our better halves yet.

113
00:06:30.317 --> 00:06:32.748
Don't wrap me into the same category as you.

114
00:06:32.748 --> 00:06:34.757
We're built differently.

115
00:06:36.887 --> 00:06:40.558
- Is it the co-pilot? - No. He wants a date with Jin Jin.

116
00:06:43.058 --> 00:06:44.598
- Is it the co-pilot? - No.

117
00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:46.567
He wants Jin Jin's number.

118
00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:49.337
- The co-pilot? - I said no.

119
00:06:56.077 --> 00:06:57.978
(Game invitation)

120
00:06:58.678 --> 00:07:00.077
Is this from the co-pilot?

121
00:07:00.377 --> 00:07:02.118
I said yes already.

122
00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:07.217
Why did he send you that?

123
00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:11.188
It's the easiest question ever. The answer's so obvious.

124
00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:12.358
What is it?

125
00:07:13.127 --> 00:07:16.957
He's trying to get me worked up.

126
00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:18.897
To get me to contact him.

127
00:07:21.967 --> 00:07:25.038
- Do you agree or not? - How meaningless.

128
00:07:25.038 --> 00:07:28.108
- You've never dated before. - I'm the queen of melodramas.

129
00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:30.848
This is why they say you shouldn't spend...

130
00:07:30.848 --> 00:07:33.108
your whole life studying at your desk.

131
00:07:34.348 --> 00:07:37.887
This message is not that simple.

132
00:07:38.017 --> 00:07:39.118
Is it not?

133
00:07:39.217 --> 00:07:43.188
This is a notification of love.

134
00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:46.928
The prelude to love.

135
00:07:47.658 --> 00:07:51.668
In other words, it's a love letter.

136
00:07:55.467 --> 00:08:01.837
(The third story: Love Letter)

137
00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:09.848
(Episode 5)

138
00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:34.408
- See you. - Bye.

139
00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:40.847
Oh, Sa Jin Jin.

140
00:08:44.288 --> 00:08:45.617
Have you never dated?

141
00:08:52.087 --> 00:08:53.727
How did that happen?

142
00:09:12.747 --> 00:09:15.447
Hello, everyone. Korea's greatest actress.

143
00:09:15.918 --> 00:09:17.278
Please meet Sa Jin Jin.

144
00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:20.188
Hello.

145
00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:22.558
- Hello. - Hi, nice to meet you.

146
00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:25.558
- Please greet our viewers. - Hello, I'm Sa Jin Jin.

147
00:09:26.327 --> 00:09:27.428
It's nice to be here.

148
00:09:32.128 --> 00:09:35.367
That's so strange. Why don't you have a boyfriend?

149
00:09:36.398 --> 00:09:37.508
Are you lying?

150
00:09:38.967 --> 00:09:40.467
I swear I'm not.

151
00:09:40.778 --> 00:09:44.747
You may not be interested, but many men must have bothered you a lot.

152
00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:47.548
They do.

153
00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:50.018
But I...

154
00:09:50.477 --> 00:09:52.888
prefer to hang out with my friends...

155
00:09:53.688 --> 00:09:56.587
and go to late-night movies alone.

156
00:09:57.658 --> 00:09:58.957
That silly girl.

157
00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:02.857
I thought she had a great guy...

158
00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:04.967
hidden away even from us.

159
00:10:05.497 --> 00:10:06.497
Oh, dear.

160
00:10:09.768 --> 00:10:10.808
Honey.

161
00:10:12.538 --> 00:10:15.278
Do you think something's wrong with her?

162
00:10:37.827 --> 00:10:39.298
Why is dating so hard for you?

163
00:10:40.967 --> 00:10:42.367
I must be bad at it.

164
00:10:45.067 --> 00:10:46.438
Maybe you aren't ready.

165
00:10:47.538 --> 00:10:51.008
- What did I do with my life? - No, it's not like that.

166
00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:52.747

Falling in love with someone else...

168
00:10:58.947 --> 00:11:01.688
isn't something you can do if you're sane.

How did that happen?

172
00:11:47.467 --> 00:11:49.438
Dating alone isn't that hard.

173

It's tough to start.

176
00:12:00.817 --> 00:12:02.247
the beginning of love?

177
00:12:11.288 --> 00:12:12.388

- Yes. - What a relief.

179
00:12:15.928 --> 00:12:18.367
- What is? - He isn't dead.

180
00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:22.168
We tried so hard to find him.

181
00:12:22.168 --> 00:12:25.008
We joined every online website and social media service.

182
00:12:25.008 --> 00:12:26.138
That's right.

183
00:12:26.138 --> 00:12:28.378
We found nothing, so we thought he was dead.

184

There was no way to find him.

185
00:12:31.077 --> 00:12:33.747
He has no siblings, and I bet his mom doesn't use the internet.

186
00:12:33.747 --> 00:12:36.477
Is he back in Korea? What for?

187
00:12:37.847 --> 00:12:40.548
- I don't know. - Where was he? Was he with his mom?

- I don't know. - What does he do?

189

Does he work nearby?

190
00:12:43.457 --> 00:12:44.628
I didn't ask.

00:24:22.688 --> 00:24:25.628
You know my number too, right? It ends with 0710.

331
00:24:33.328 --> 00:24:37.638
(In 2000)

332
00:24:48.118 --> 00:24:49.277
Jin Jin.

333
00:24:54.957 --> 00:24:56.158
What are you doing here?

334
00:25:02.658 --> 00:25:04.197
What is it? You're all weird.

335
00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:11.707
Will you...

336
00:25:15.007 --> 00:25:16.078
go out with me?

337
00:25:24.487 --> 00:25:27.757
(1st Day)

338
00:25:36.098 --> 00:25:39.027
(22nd Day)

339
00:25:46.967 --> 00:25:48.608

(100th Day)

341
00:26:02.757 --> 00:26:04.527
(1st Day)

342
00:26:04.527 --> 00:26:05.957
You know my number too, right?

343
00:26:06.388 --> 00:26:07.727
It ends with 0710.

344
00:26:11.098 --> 00:26:13.098
What's wrong? Do you have work tomorrow?

345
00:26:15.037 --> 00:26:16.338
Yes, but it's just a narration recording.

346
00:26:16.338 --> 00:26:18.608
Then you don't need to worry about looking fat. Why don't you eat?

347
00:26:23.578 --> 00:26:26.247
You look worried.

348
00:26:26.247 --> 00:26:27.848
No, I'm not.

349
00:26:27.848 --> 00:26:29.547
Yes, you are. What's wrong?

350
00:26:29.547 --> 00:26:31.017
What is it? Tell us.

351
00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:35.888
Well, it's about Gong Ji Won...

352
00:26:35.888 --> 00:26:37.658
Yes, I heard he got married.

353
00:26:38.158 --> 00:26:39.188
Really?

354
00:26:39.688 --> 00:26:42.557
Gosh, he should have invited us to events like that.

355
00:26:42.557 --> 00:26:44.467
So did he come to Korea with his wife?

356
00:26:44.467 --> 00:26:45.598
Probably.

357
00:26:46.297 --> 00:26:48.138
What were you going to say about him?

358
00:26:50.598 --> 00:26:54.108
I had a little car accident in the parking lot.

359
00:26:54.108 --> 00:26:55.408
I found out it was Gong Ji Won's car.

360
00:26:56.138 --> 00:26:57.447
What kind of car does he drive?

361
00:26:58.078 --> 00:26:59.878
Didn't you get hurt? Are you all right?

362
00:27:00.247 --> 00:27:01.578
What's wrong? Did your car get damaged?

363
00:27:01.578 --> 00:27:04.388
- Why do you look worried? - I'm not worried.

364
00:27:04.618 --> 00:27:07.188
- I'm just saying it happened. - Hey, give it to me.

365
00:27:07.618 --> 00:27:08.787
- What? - Your phone.

366
00:27:08.787 --> 00:27:11.588
If you were in an accident, you must know his phone number.

367
00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:13.987
Let's look at his profile picture. Hurry. Give it to me.

368
00:27:16.128 --> 00:27:17.328
All right, let's see it.

369
00:27:17.328 --> 00:27:19.068
I want to see if there's a picture of his wife.

370
00:27:19.467 --> 00:27:21.068
She looked glamorous.

371
00:27:21.068 --> 00:27:22.868
But I think she did a bit of surgery on her eyes and nose.

372
00:27:23.697 --> 00:27:24.938
- Did you see her? - Yes.

373
00:27:25.138 --> 00:27:26.467
Where?

374
00:27:26.967 --> 00:27:28.977
Jin Jin, your mom is asking for you.

375
00:27:28.977 --> 00:27:30.507
She wants you to introduce yourself to her friend.

376
00:27:30.777 --> 00:27:31.878
Go on.

377
00:27:32.447 --> 00:27:34.447
All... All right.

378
00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:39.088
Where did you see his wife?

379
00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:40.318
On the internet.

380
00:27:40.318 --> 00:27:42.717
I'm like the Sherlock Holmes of portal sites.

382
00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:51.928
Here it is. Gosh, what's this?

383
00:27:51.928 --> 00:27:53.828
It's so like him.

384
00:27:55.598 --> 00:27:57.138
0710?

385

(Gong Ji Won)

386
00:27:58.467 --> 00:27:59.868
He's using the same last four digits as before.

387
00:27:59.868 --> 00:28:01.977
- What? - Don't you remember?

388
00:28:01.977 --> 00:28:04.947
His house phone number used to be 297-0710.

389
00:28:04.947 --> 00:28:08.818
Of course. You're the one with good memory.

390
00:28:10.378 --> 00:28:11.618
You're really great.

391
00:28:15.858 --> 00:28:17.358
- Hey! - Gosh, you startled me. What?

392
00:28:17.358 --> 00:28:18.588
What is it?

393
00:28:21.057 --> 00:28:23.457
"I couldn't answer the text because I was watching a movie."

394
00:28:23.457 --> 00:28:24.967
"It would be an honor for me..."

395
00:28:24.967 --> 00:28:26.568
"if you invite me to the get-together."

396
00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:29.598
Why does he keep poking around?

397
00:28:30.537 --> 00:28:31.967
If the fire isn't starting,

398
00:28:31.967 --> 00:28:34.707
I should pour some oil on it, right?

399
00:28:34.977 --> 00:28:36.277
- Yes. - It's starting again.

400
00:28:37.777 --> 00:28:38.908
What are you talking about?

401
00:28:39.477 --> 00:28:41.947
- You know she has a condition. - What condition?

402
00:28:42.517 --> 00:28:44.318
A condition that will kill her if she doesn't ask people out.

403
00:28:47.118 --> 00:28:49.188
I'm in love with someone.

404
00:28:49.188 --> 00:28:50.757
He's a student activist in the student council.

405
00:28:50.888 --> 00:28:54.158
- Don't leave love - Don't leave love

406
00:28:54.297 --> 00:28:57.257
- Honor, nor your name - Honor, nor your name

407
00:29:19.388 --> 00:29:21.487
Ah Reum, there's a letter for you.

408
00:29:30.527 --> 00:29:32.267
"I received your letter."

409
00:29:33.027 --> 00:29:35.997
"However, I cannot accept your heart."

410
00:29:37.267 --> 00:29:38.838
"I'm married to this nation."

411
00:29:39.807 --> 00:29:40.977
"Good luck."

412
00:29:44.047 --> 00:29:47.207
I'm truly in love with the captain of the cheerleading team.

413
00:29:47.207 --> 00:29:50.717
This time, show him your heart. Try your best.

The door opens, and you come in

416
00:30:01.227 --> 00:30:04.068
I knew at first sight

417
00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:09.237

(In 2005)

419

I'm really, truly in love with someone.

420
00:30:18.148 --> 00:30:21.217
He's a freshman in my department. I'm going to ask him out right away.

421
00:30:21.217 --> 00:30:25.017
Don't go empty-handed when you ask someone out.

422
00:30:44.368 --> 00:30:46.507
- Who is she? - What's that beef bone soup?

423
00:30:46.507 --> 00:30:48.608
- What is that? - That's not right.

424
00:30:48.608 --> 00:30:50.578
- What is that? - It's beef bone soup.

425
00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:52.247
- Gosh, that's so weird. - He's going to decline.

426
00:30:52.247 --> 00:30:54.047
- It looks delicious. - Look at her face.

427
00:30:54.148 --> 00:30:55.178
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:59.618 --> 00:31:01.088
- What are you doing? - Get the soup.

429
00:31:09.898 --> 00:31:11.868
It's a serious condition.

430
00:31:11.928 --> 00:31:14.838
- Do you think there's a cure? - No, it's incurable.

431

Then let's set a date.

432

Yes, Mom.

I don't feel like eating in the morning. Don't worry.

436

This weekend could be a little hard. I need to do something.

437
00:31:46.068 --> 00:31:48.537
I need to go there next week anyway.

438
00:31:50.297 --> 00:31:52.507
Mom, I need to get another phone call. I'm hanging up.

439
00:31:53.168 --> 00:31:54.207

This is so sad.

445
00:32:08.418 --> 00:32:11.557
You should drop a few tears in this scene.

446
00:32:11.557 --> 00:32:14.858
They record everything. It would make you look sincere.

Not really.

How about President Choi from AT?

He's suspected to have been involved in the Kim Young Sil affairs.

which specialist we'd select.

456

In that case,

457
00:32:48.098 --> 00:32:49.428
we should search a little more.

Yes.

You know, about Sa Jin Jin.
