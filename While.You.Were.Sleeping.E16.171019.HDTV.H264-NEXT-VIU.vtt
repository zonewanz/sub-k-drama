1
00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:08.094
Did you think the culprit was Do Hak Young when you...

2
00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:10.163
first encountered the incident?

3
00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.193
- Yes, I did. - Why is that?

4
00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:16.764
I saw the CCTV footage through news, and it was Hak Young.

5
00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:19.133
There was nobody else caught on the camera, right?

6
00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:22.344
No, there was nobody else.

7
00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:26.443
We checked all the CCTVs from the stairs, lifts,

8
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.383
and corridors before the incident. But there was nobody else.

9
00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:30.913
Not even on the dash cameras.

10
00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:32.953
Yes, I heard that.

11
00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:36.084
That is why I misunderstood that the culprit is Hak Young.

12
00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:41.794
Misunderstood? Why do you think you misunderstood?

13
00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:45.163
It could have been an accident.

14
00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:47.463
An accident?

15
00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:50.363
If I were Do's lawyer, I would have insisted it that way.

16
00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:55.504
The victim must have died from excessive bleeding on head...

17
00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:58.943
when she slipped and hit the table. A misfortunate accident.

18
00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:00.074
Nonsense.

19
00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:04.284
Then the picture drawn by blood on the floor can't be explained.

20
00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:06.314
You don't have any evidence that Do drew that.

21
00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:07.524
If not Do, who else?

22
00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:10.853
There were only Do and Yoo at the scene on the day.

23
00:01:11.953 --> 00:01:14.324
If Yoo drew that, there must have been some blood stains left.

24
00:01:14.393 --> 00:01:16.123
But when we checked, she didn't have any stains on her body.

25
00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:20.193
So didn't Do. He didn't have any stains on his hands, feet, neck,

26
00:01:20.193 --> 00:01:21.734
and even the shoes. There was none.

27
00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:23.534
And this fact keeps him from being convicted.

28
00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:25.274
That's because...

29
00:01:25.403 --> 00:01:28.403
The blood stains must've been erased by someone. He had enough time...

30
00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:30.373
to shower and wash the clothes before his confession.

31
00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:31.474
That is an assumption.

32
00:01:32.213 --> 00:01:33.943
An assumption can't be evidence.

33
00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:41.484
Then how can you explain the drawing by blood?

34
00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:42.724
What did Do Hak Young say about that?

35
00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:44.693
He said he doesn't know about it.

36
00:01:46.193 --> 00:01:47.564
He can't just say he doesn't know about it.

37
00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:50.064
To walk free, he has to prove that he didn't draw the picture.

38
00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:52.064
No. The prosecutor must prove...

39
00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:54.734
that Hak Young drew it, so that he can be charged.

40
00:01:56.663 --> 00:01:58.603
You don't know what it's drawn by, do you?

41
00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:00.334
Look.

42
00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:03.603
Do Hak Young was the only one who went into the house that time.

43
00:02:03.603 --> 00:02:05.373
What can we prove more?

44
00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:07.113
He must have used a tool to draw that.

45
00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:08.443
What kind of tool?

46
00:02:08.883 --> 00:02:10.544
Are you playing with me?

47
00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:12.383
We don't know what that is, so I just referred to it as a tool.

48
00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:14.453
You have to mention that specific tool on the arraignment.

49
00:02:14.883 --> 00:02:17.383
If you don't, you can't specify a charge.

50
00:02:18.024 --> 00:02:21.423
Not specifying can lead this to be dismissed in the trial.

51
00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:27.734
What is this policeman? Is he a lawyer?

52
00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:30.264
This looks more like a trial than an investigation.

53
00:02:30.663 --> 00:02:34.173
The policeman will take over Prosecutor Jung soon.

54
00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:37.574
Why doesn't he ask why the culprit ran away without a reason?

55
00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:38.774
Ran away.

56
00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:40.474
Why did he run away then?

57
00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:43.643
They can hear us!

58
00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:45.213
I'm sorry, sir.

59
00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:47.683
If he's innocent, why didn't he explain himself instead of fleeing?

60
00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:49.724
Because you still went after him even when he's innocent.

61
00:02:50.554 --> 00:02:53.524
He thought that he might end up in jail even when he's innocent.

62
00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:01.463
You made Do to confess when he came to your house...

63
00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:02.633
on the 25th of last month, didn't you?

64
00:03:02.863 --> 00:03:05.004
No, I told him to run away.

65
00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:09.074
If you really killed Yoo Su Kyung, then run away.

66
00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:11.913
I won't say a word.

67
00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:13.613
- Hey, Woo Tak! - Instead,

68
00:03:15.744 --> 00:03:17.183
if you are innocent, turn yourself in.

69
00:03:18.984 --> 00:03:20.054
Trust the law.

70
00:03:22.824 --> 00:03:24.594
When I told him that, he turned himself in.

71
00:03:24.994 --> 00:03:26.524
He said he will trust the law.

72
00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.734
Is Do Hak Young really the culprit?

73
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:36.903
What on earth are you trying to say?

74
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.103
There is no other suspect except Do Hak Young.

75
00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:42.074
We can't assume an answer just because we don't have one.

76
00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:48.744
Why do you believe that Do Hak Young is innocent?

77
00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:51.153
When Hak Young first came to my house,

78
00:03:51.713 --> 00:03:53.683
he asked me to help him prove his innocence.

79
00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:58.693
So you should prove my innocence in every way you can.

80
00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:00.494
When I met him earlier,

81
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.923
he asked me if I'm looking for the real culprit.

82
00:04:02.994 --> 00:04:04.264
What did the prosecutor say?

83
00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:06.433
Is he looking for the culprit?

84
00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:08.133
Those words...

85
00:04:08.703 --> 00:04:11.304
are what you say to prove you are innocent anyway.

86
00:04:11.304 --> 00:04:14.103
If he was guilty, he wouldn't have asked me to prove...

87
00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:16.244
that he's innocent. He would've asked me to make him innocent.

88
00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:18.443
He wouldn't have asked me to find the real culprit.

89
00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:20.474
He would have asked me to make up some alibi.

90
00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:23.284
That's true.

91
00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:25.483
What does he mean by that?

92
00:04:25.483 --> 00:04:27.153
Why is he agreeing to him?

93
00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:29.983
Prosecutor Jung is losing to the policeman.

94
00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:32.523
- He totally lost. - By the way,

95
00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:34.793
even I think it's strange.

96
00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:38.664
If he really killed her, he wouldn't have asked like that.

97
00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.333
He would have just insisted it wasn't him.

98
00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:42.363
Be quiet!

99
00:04:47.173 --> 00:04:49.874
Do Hak Young has a motive to kill Yoo.

100
00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:52.244
Can you fix it well this time?

101
00:04:52.244 --> 00:04:56.284
Can you rate me well this time?

102
00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:58.184
I will rate you well if you fix well.

103
00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:01.954
Yoo rated poorly on Do's service.

104
00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:04.423
She even asked him to throw away some trash on his way out.

105
00:05:05.253 --> 00:05:08.863
So this made Do Hak Young mad, and he killed her out of anger.

106
00:05:08.863 --> 00:05:09.963
Then why would he throw away...

107
00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:13.063
the trash after killing her?

108
00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.034
If throwing away trash made him so mad that he killed her,

109
00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.403
he would have just left it there.

110
00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:22.704
Why did he even bring out the trash to throw away for her?

111
00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:25.273
There is no reason.

112
00:05:25.813 --> 00:05:28.213
Yes, that makes sense.

113
00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:31.483
He's right. Why did he throw away the trash for her?

114
00:05:33.753 --> 00:05:35.124
I... I mean...

115
00:05:35.124 --> 00:05:37.523
Even you agree to the policeman?

116
00:05:37.624 --> 00:05:38.894
No, sir. I meant...

117
00:05:38.954 --> 00:05:41.063
The police's saying some sensible words.

118
00:05:41.063 --> 00:05:42.363
Stop grumbling!

119
00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:44.164
I'm sorry, sir. It's my neck.

120
00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:54.943
What's the matter? You're not confident now?

121
00:05:55.844 --> 00:05:59.374
Do you really think Do Ha Young killed Yoo Su Kyung, Mr. Choi?

122
00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:02.043
We worked really hard to get the evidence, but we couldn't.

123
00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:04.184
Do you remember the lying detector?

124
00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:05.813
It said that it can't determine the lie.

125
00:06:05.883 --> 00:06:08.724
If he were the real culprit, it should have said "lying".

126
00:06:08.923 --> 00:06:11.423
- You're right. - Do Hak Young only stayed...

127
00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:13.494
for 13 minutes at her house according to the CCTV.

128
00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:15.923
You think it's possible to kill, clean, wipe, draw a picture...

129
00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:17.463
with blood, remove stains in 13 minutes?

130
00:06:17.963 --> 00:06:19.633
Do you think it's possible?

131
00:06:19.633 --> 00:06:22.003
I know, it sounds odd.

132
00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:25.633
But there's nobody else that seems like a culprit except him.

133
00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:27.773
This doesn't directly prove that Do killed her.

134
00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:31.474
But the chief won't make you set the guy free from the prison.

135
00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:34.113
Prosecutors work individually.

136
00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:36.713
If we follow the principal, I don't need anyone's approval.

137
00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:39.554
If I just undo his imprisonment...

138
00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:40.583
You will be fired.

139
00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:42.354
And I will be fired too.

140
00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:46.224
I know so many prosecutors who got fired for doing things alone.

141
00:06:46.494 --> 00:06:49.124
What can I do now? Should I just prosecute him?

142
00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:53.063
Prosecutor Jung.

143
00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.264
How about you be more modest?

144
00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.874
Am I being rude?

145
00:07:01.043 --> 00:07:05.344
Why do you think you are the only one that sees the truth?

146
00:07:07.414 --> 00:07:08.914
From today's investigation,

147
00:07:09.443 --> 00:07:12.684
just show your seniors what you saw.

148
00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:17.184
Then they might be able to see the truth since they're seniors.

149
00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:23.764
This is why he called us here.

150
00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:26.793
He wanted to show and persuade us.

151
00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:35.144
I'm sure they will agree with what you are thinking.

152
00:07:35.673 --> 00:07:36.903
They will think with you together.

153
00:07:41.313 --> 00:07:42.344
(Cancellation of Arrest)

154
00:07:56.023 --> 00:07:57.164
Sir.

155
00:07:57.994 --> 00:08:00.193
Give me some time to think alone, will you?

156
00:08:00.693 --> 00:08:02.633
I know what you all are trying to say.

157
00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:06.534
Goodness.

158
00:08:09.974 --> 00:08:13.173
I hope this case doesn't go like Kang Dae Hee's.

159
00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:15.613
But who defended for Kang?

160
00:08:15.684 --> 00:08:16.943
It's you, Yu Beom.

161
00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:22.454
I told you that I'm on Jung's side too.

162
00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:28.193
He'll do well without your support.

163
00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:30.264
Jae Chan can never do this alone.

164
00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.633
This doesn't mean Jae Chan lacks in anything.

165
00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:35.764
This case is just hard.

166
00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:42.874
The evidence he has is not enough.

167
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.213
We need full evidence to charge the suspect.

168
00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:49.043
A prosecutor alone can't make the evidence full.

169
00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:52.813
You should help out, Hong Joo.

171
00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:08.664
You didn't know Do's father is a former convicted drug dealer.

172
00:09:10.403 --> 00:09:11.934
Do also followed his father's crime path...

173
00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:15.003
when he was a student.

174
00:09:15.403 --> 00:09:18.744
Assault and theft. He wasn't a good boy.

175
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.113
He was a trash.

176
00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:27.083
Tell people what you saw.

177
00:09:28.624 --> 00:09:29.824
Then you will have...

178
00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:32.753
the evidence fill up by itself.

179
00:09:34.494 --> 00:09:35.824
What do you mean?

180
00:09:36.224 --> 00:09:39.793
Do's case is a very popular topic to write about among...

181
00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:41.833
you reporters.

182
00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:46.773
You will need more useful sources,

183
00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:49.043
and I think this can be the one.

184
00:09:49.104 --> 00:09:51.014
Other media will go after him if you just provide them...

185
00:09:51.043 --> 00:09:53.244
with his personal information.

186
00:09:53.273 --> 00:09:56.784
Then you'll have many reporters who will work as detectives.

Do Hak Young is an ex-convict of assault.

Is he a psychopath?

00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:06.354
Goodness. Do Hak Young went to our school.

190
00:10:06.354 --> 00:10:08.624
His picture must be in the yearbook.

191

I found Do's picture in the graduation yearbook.

When the news gets released,

200

thousands of people will share information about him.

201
00:10:36.753 --> 00:10:40.023
Do's every related person will share every little detail.

202
00:10:48.863 --> 00:10:50.633
Do Hak Young will be the notorious killer,

203
00:10:50.633 --> 00:10:53.903
and people will demand the prosecutor to charge him.

204
00:10:54.104 --> 00:10:55.773
You're asking me to manipulate the media.

205
00:10:55.974 --> 00:10:58.244
Manipulate? That's too vulgar.

206
00:11:00.213 --> 00:11:02.644
I meant you shouldn't go against the public.

207
00:11:06.983 --> 00:11:08.483
He is the culprit without doubt.

208
00:11:09.324 --> 00:11:10.923
We can't just let him go.

209
00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:13.054
Do you think we should?

210
00:11:16.963 --> 00:11:18.693
Following the law...

211
00:11:19.264 --> 00:11:21.063
won't make Jae Chan win.

212
00:11:24.403 --> 00:11:26.173
Hong Joo, you should...

213
00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.374
help him out to fill the evidence.

214
00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:34.543
So Jae Chan can charge him.

215
00:13:07.233 --> 00:13:08.443
Where is he?

216
00:13:08.574 --> 00:13:09.604
He's not here.

217
00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:35.434
Sir?

218
00:13:35.534 --> 00:13:37.574
What are you doing?

219
00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:38.673
Get out of there!

222
00:13:53.383 --> 00:13:56.054
I will try to pull him out.

223
00:13:56.224 --> 00:13:58.494
You should pull us up from the back. Do you understand?

224
00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:12.273
Why do we have to?

225
00:14:12.704 --> 00:14:17.104
He looks like a weak man who can't even swim.

226
00:14:18.713 --> 00:14:19.874
I can swim.

227
00:14:22.543 --> 00:14:23.613
No, I mean...

228
00:14:25.514 --> 00:14:27.184
why should I rescue that man?

229
00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:29.954
Of course you must save him.

230
00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:31.054
Why don't we let him drown?

231
00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:33.523
That guy is the brother of the guy who killed our father.

232
00:14:33.724 --> 00:14:35.664
I hate him so much. Why should I rescue him?

233
00:14:36.363 --> 00:14:38.333
Let him go to the fiery pit and meet his brother there!

234
00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:39.863
Let him ask...

235
00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:42.833
why his brother killed our father!

236
00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:47.903
You're crazy. We should let him drown because you hate him?

237
00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:49.704
Is that your reason?

238
00:14:51.313 --> 00:14:52.344
Yes!

239
00:14:53.613 --> 00:14:56.744
I hate him so much! Let him drown to death!

240

241

He's just like us.

242
00:15:00.054 --> 00:15:01.583
He also can't believe what happened yesterday.

243
00:15:01.923 --> 00:15:04.494
He also wants to turn back the time to stop what happened.

244
00:15:04.854 --> 00:15:08.063
He must have wished that this was all just a dream.

245
00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:16.034
Go and rescue him. You should rescue him and me...

It went okay.

So is Do charged?

258
00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.868
I didn't ask as a reporter. It's off the record.

259
00:16:43.438 --> 00:16:44.837
I couldn't charge him.

Woo Tak won over you, didn't he?

264
00:17:03.558 --> 00:17:04.958
Listen to me.

265
00:17:05.998 --> 00:17:09.228
I thought Do was the culprit in the beginning.

266
00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:12.067
So I tried to bring the pieces together to prove this.

But they didn't fit right into one picture.

268
00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:17.567
- They didn't? - No.

269
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.507
We conducted autopsy on the body, but it's all too clean.

270
00:17:20.908 --> 00:17:22.647
There was no blood that shows resistance.

271
00:17:22.947 --> 00:17:25.277
I seized and searched his house,

272
00:17:25.507 --> 00:17:27.078
but there was no blood at all.

273
00:17:27.418 --> 00:17:30.188
But it all made sense...

00:17:30.848 --> 00:17:32.518
when I started to think that Do wasn't the culprit.

Yoo Su Kyung fainted many times due to otolithiasis.

That's why she retired early.

277
00:17:39.357 --> 00:17:41.098
So did she die because she fainted...

278
00:17:41.098 --> 00:17:43.768
from otolithiasis after Do left her house?

279
00:17:45.427 --> 00:17:48.067
Yes. That makes the autopsy result correct.

280
00:17:48.737 --> 00:17:52.208
It says that she died of a cerebral haemorrhage and she had no scars.

281
00:17:57.748 --> 00:17:59.578
The fact that Do threw away the trash for her makes sense too.

282
00:18:00.118 --> 00:18:02.377
She didn't have any blood stains on her clothes. Everything makes sense.

283
00:18:04.118 --> 00:18:05.987
What about that drawing on the flood drawn by blood?

284
00:18:05.987 --> 00:18:07.158
How would you explain that?

285
00:18:07.458 --> 00:18:08.958
That's the toughest to explain.

286
00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:11.627
When I analyzed the drawing drawn by blood,

287
00:18:11.728 --> 00:18:12.897
it was drawn in one single stroke.

288
00:18:12.998 --> 00:18:15.027
Drawn in one single stroke? Without stopping?

289
00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:18.498
Do couldn't have done that all in 13 minutes without stains on him.

290
00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:21.038
Do you think it was possible for him to draw...

291
00:18:21.498 --> 00:18:22.638
without getting any stain on his feet?

292
00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.208
Then who drew that?

293
00:18:27.877 --> 00:18:28.908
I don't know too.

294
00:18:29.578 --> 00:18:30.947
But I know that it wasn't Do.

295
00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.877
It must be something we missed.

296
00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:59.877
Because we couldn't find it, Do Hak Young got into this trap.

297
00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:08.118
Hey, let's go now.

298
00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:13.918
So you are letting him go? He's the prime suspect!

299
00:19:14.458 --> 00:19:15.487
Yes.

300
00:19:17.188 --> 00:19:18.558
I'm so incompetent, right?

301
00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.328
I lost by Woo Tak's words,

302
00:19:21.658 --> 00:19:23.697
and I'm losing the prime suspect.

303
00:19:24.527 --> 00:19:26.697
I'm sorry. I can't say no to that.

304
00:19:37.408 --> 00:19:38.408
I like you.

305
00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:43.047
What?

306
00:19:43.047 --> 00:19:45.987
I like you so much that I hate the fact...

307
00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:47.757
that I disappointed you.

308
00:19:51.558 --> 00:19:54.927
What's wrong with you? Why are you telling me that at this moment?

309
00:20:00.498 --> 00:20:02.908
So I wanted to charge Do Hak Young no matter what.

310
00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:05.938
But I can't charge an innocent man.

311
00:20:06.938 --> 00:20:08.737
It might destroy one's life.

312
00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:17.348
I really like you a lot,

313
00:20:18.248 --> 00:20:21.388
but my feelings can't be compared to his entire life.

314
00:20:22.828 --> 00:20:23.857
My feelings are nothing.

315
00:20:32.228 --> 00:20:34.737
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

316
00:21:13.677 --> 00:21:14.708
What's this?

317
00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.147
I thought you would need it.

318
00:21:23.147 --> 00:21:24.547
You look like someone.

319
00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:27.357
- Who? - The boy who hit me long ago.

320
00:21:27.558 --> 00:21:29.987
A boy hit you? What a crazy jerk.

321
00:21:30.828 --> 00:21:33.228
I don't know his name and where he lives,

322
00:21:33.658 --> 00:21:35.458
but he's not that bad.

323
00:21:35.458 --> 00:21:37.828
He's a crazy guy to hit a girl. That's not normal.

324
00:21:38.197 --> 00:21:39.797
Don't even get in touch with such guys.

325
00:21:39.938 --> 00:21:42.967
This is unpleasant. I don't look like someone like that.

326
00:21:42.967 --> 00:21:46.478
Okay. Okay. You don't look like that boy.

(Indictment without detention for theft and assault)

330
00:22:28.918 --> 00:22:32.047
Hong Joo, did you meet up with Lawyer Lee?

331
00:22:32.147 --> 00:22:34.018
Yes, I did.

332
00:22:34.087 --> 00:22:35.087
What did he say?

333
00:22:36.527 --> 00:22:38.257
He gave me some documents about Do Hak Young.

334
00:22:38.388 --> 00:22:40.297
What are they about? Have you gone through them?

335
00:22:40.297 --> 00:22:43.328
Yes, these are the records of him when he was a student.

336
00:22:43.668 --> 00:22:46.697
Of course, I knew he was a bad one. I knew he committed crimes.

337
00:22:46.897 --> 00:22:48.438
So? Can you make a story out of it?

338
00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:56.908
You're crazy. We should let him drown because you hate him?

339
00:22:57.908 --> 00:23:01.248
Go and rescue him. You should rescue him and me...

340
00:23:01.918 --> 00:23:03.018
if you don't want to regret later.

341
00:25:05.308 --> 00:25:06.607
Wake up!

342
00:25:06.808 --> 00:25:09.177
Hey, wake up!

343
00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:18.717
No, wake up!

344
00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.418
Please wake up!

345
00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:26.527
Get up now!

346
00:25:31.527 --> 00:25:33.197
Wake up!

347
00:25:33.837 --> 00:25:35.768
Get up!

348
00:25:37.668 --> 00:25:39.237
Wake up!

349
00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:45.647
Wake up!

350
00:26:15.578 --> 00:26:16.578
Thank you.

351
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:18.748
Thank you for saving me.

352
00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:47.237
This story...

353
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:49.877
won't be featured.

354
00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:53.047
Why not? It's Do's records when he was a kid.

355
00:26:53.177 --> 00:26:56.118
Yes, but it's irrelevant to the current case.

356
00:26:56.188 --> 00:26:58.987
There will be confusion to the prosecutor's investigation.

357
00:26:59.458 --> 00:27:00.458
Are you sure about this?

358
00:27:01.188 --> 00:27:03.558
Yes, sir. Do you want to take a look at it?

359
00:27:04.728 --> 00:27:07.658
That's okay. I trust your words.

360
00:27:16.737 --> 00:27:18.938
(Cancellation of Arrest)

361
00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:26.848
Okay, I have made up my mind.

362
00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:30.118
Here you go.

363
00:27:39.697 --> 00:27:40.797
Thank you, sir.

364
00:27:43.627 --> 00:27:46.938
I'll be scolded by the prosecutor general.

365
00:27:48.897 --> 00:27:52.007
Lawyer Lee, Do's freed from arrest.

366
00:27:53.408 --> 00:27:55.107
Jung Jae Chan, that crazy guy!

367
00:28:00.018 --> 00:28:02.748
Write up a press release, and request for media interviews.

368
00:28:02.748 --> 00:28:03.748
Yes, sir.

369
00:28:08.217 --> 00:28:09.987
I shouldn't go easy on him.

370
00:28:16.297 --> 00:28:17.368
Yes, Reporter Hwang.

371
00:28:18.768 --> 00:28:20.668
I'm Lawyer Lee from Haegang.

372
00:29:07.518 --> 00:29:09.217
- Are you okay? - Are you all right?

373
00:29:09.317 --> 00:29:11.388
- Over here. - My goodness.

374
00:29:11.388 --> 00:29:14.217
Jae Chan, you can't die.

375
00:29:14.317 --> 00:29:16.527
Somebody help!

376
00:29:17.257 --> 00:29:19.087
Please call an ambulance!

377
00:29:38.708 --> 00:29:40.848
The sweetest dream I have ever dreamed in my life...

378
00:29:42.688 --> 00:29:45.188
turned into the most horrible one.
