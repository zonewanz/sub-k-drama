1
00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.052
(One Night Two Days)

2
00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:04.321
(Yuchi-ri)

3
00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:06.321
(One Night Two Days and "Invincible Youth")

4
00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:08.591
(Three teams go off to help the locals.)

5
00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.021
(Dong Gu and Yu Ra harvest chives.)

6
00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:11.822
(Joon Ho and Narsha plant napa cabbage.)

7
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:13.932
(The other three teams...)

8
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.031
(won a blank check thanks to Chae Yeon.)

9
00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:20.172
We did it.

10
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:22.202
(They went on a shopping spree...)

11
00:00:22.902 --> 00:00:25.602
(and had the time of their lives.)

12
00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.879
Do you know when Shin Young will be back?

13
00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.678
We're back.

14
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.479
- Here.
- You're quite late.

15
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.107
- Didn't you go shopping?
- Hold on.

16
00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:35.079
- We're back.
- Hold on.

17
00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:36.847
You need to be fit to have fun.

18
00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:38.417
He won me this!

19
00:00:38.418 --> 00:00:39.619
I see.

20
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:40.689
You must've had fun.

21
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.250
(Joon Ho had fun at the cabbage field.)

22
00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.019
- Here.
- Thanks.

23
00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.558
I guess we should apologize first.

24
00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.229
(Tae Hyun suddenly apologizes.)

25
00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.329
- So what did you do?
- We stayed behind...

26
00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:52.928
and played a game where...

27
00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:55.467
we flung bottle caps across the table.

28
00:00:55.468 --> 00:00:58.538
- Chae Yeon...
- Ms. Chae Yeon.

29
00:00:58.668 --> 00:00:59.748
She won five dollars twice.

30
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.239
No, once.

31
00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:03.079
- Wait.
- No, twice.

32
00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.708
(They know what Tae Hyun's up to.)

33
00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:08.148
We asked for another chance...

34
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:09.879
in exchange for five dollars.

35
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:11.818
She took that opportunity...

36
00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:13.889
and flushed it down the drain.

37
00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:15.419
(What?)

38
00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.587
(Candid Camera is back!)

39
00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:19.588
(Defconn's on board.)

40
00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.665
(The others can't keep
their face straight.)

41
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.097
How much did you win then?

42
00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:24.659
Well, we had 15 dollars.

43
00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:27.228
Yes, and we took photos for five dollars.

44
00:01:27.898 --> 00:01:30.097
What? Say that again.

45
00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:31.668
Just think about it.

46
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:33.168
We could only afford ramyeon.

47
00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:34.608
That's more than enough!

48
00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:35.609
We bought enough.

49
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.837
We bought 12 with 10 dollars.

50
00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:40.508
I could've won us a blank check,

51
00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:43.778
but the bottle cap just kept on rolling.

52
00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:45.548
I smell makgeolli on your breath.

53
00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.688
Don't be absurd.

54
00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.688
- Makgeolli...
- We only had one bottle.

55
00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.718
Hold on a second.

56
00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.918
(She pretends to have not drunk any.)

57
00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.728
As an apology, hand them each a photo.

58
00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:57.298
I'll take one with your face cut out.

59
00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.828
So you're saying you had fun by yourselves.

60
00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.697
- Oh, please.
- That's not the case.

61
00:02:01.698 --> 00:02:04.067
There was nothing we could buy anyway.

62
00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:05.567
- Why not?
- Hold on.

63
00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:06.738
You could've bought apples.

64
00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:07.937
Not enough though.

65
00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:10.377
- Tteokbokki.
- Cucumber and gochujang.

66
00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:12.478
- That's right.
- It was five dollars,

67
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.378
but we had to take a picture.

68
00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.448
- The sticker photo...
- But we did hard labor.

69
00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.117
We worked all afternoon.

70
00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:21.218
You should be put to
trial for what you did.

71
00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:24.457
- I mean...
- How can you say that...

72
00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:26.627
- when it's her photo?
- This is embezzlement.

73
00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:29.228
- Of course.
- You can have her photo.

74
00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.258
That is a deal breaker.

75
00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.259
(That does change everything.)

76
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.728
- We should give him one.
- See?

77
00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.099
- Unbelievable.
- Narsha, stop frowning.

78
00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.068
- My back hurts.
- Gosh.

79
00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.407
Isn't there any dinner then?

80
00:02:39.408 --> 00:02:40.568
Can we at least eat something?

81
00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.108
Ramyeon is our best dish anyway.

82
00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.108
We bought 12 packets of ramyeon...

83
00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.407
and five packs of instant rice.

84
00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.707
- Aren't there eight?
- It's not enough.

85
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.177
Can't you see how many there are?

86
00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:50.318
But there's...

87
00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.647
Isn't that enough though?

88
00:02:51.648 --> 00:02:53.418
We won't eat as much then.

89
00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.747
You shouldn't...

90
00:02:54.748 --> 00:02:57.118
- eat so much then.
- I'll only eat half.

91
00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.828
It's settled then.

92
00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.989
You promised that you wouldn't eat.

93
00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:03.859
- We won't eat much.
- Only a little.

94
00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.497
We're sorry, so we won't eat as much.

95
00:03:07.498 --> 00:03:08.699
- Okay?
- Let's go.

96
00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.837
(Sound of insects...)

97
00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:13.208
(fills the moonlit sky.)

98
00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.108
When is Shin Young getting back?

99
00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.009
It's like I sent my wife away.

100
00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.807
Why would you call her that?

101
00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:20.707
Did you ask about Shin Young?

102
00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:22.849
- But...
- Where's the ramyeon?

103
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.188
(Joon Ho first checks the ramyeon.)

104
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:27.919
(There are only a few.)

105
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.819
I only see five packets!

106
00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:32.957
Are there only five?

107
00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.058
Did we only buy five?

108
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.329
Of course we didn't.

109
00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.758
(It's as if he lost his whole world.)

110
00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.599
- You're kidding.
- What's going on?

111
00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.998
- I'm sure there's more.
- Right.

112
00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:43.668
- Is this really it?
- What else did you do?

113
00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.437
- We'll skip dinner.
- What else did you do?

114
00:03:45.438 --> 00:03:47.837
- I bet they already ate.
- Tell me.

115
00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:49.608
We're sorry.

116
00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.638
What was it? Was it sundae?

117
00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.608
We ate only what the locals gave us.

118
00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.418
- How could you?
- Did you buy the food?

119
00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.717
No, the locals gave it to us.

120
00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:58.448
- Then...
- It wasn't our plan.

121
00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.489
We only ate sundae.

122
00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.117
Where did all the money go then?

123
00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:02.718
Is that all you can buy with 10 dollars?

124
00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:05.729
Like I said, we took photos,

125
00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.328
but the first batch came out wrong.

126
00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.488
(No one can look as devastated.)

127
00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.098
- We worked so hard.
- Since we're sorry,

128
00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.728
we'll serve you dinner tonight.

129
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.668
- Let's sit first.
- Right.

130
00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.168
- Sure.
- Have a seat.

131
00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.268
Let's sit for now.

132
00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:18.498
Can we have another pot for them?

133
00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:20.969
How could you possibly think of eating too?

134
00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:22.177
(Joon Ho took the bait.)

135
00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.278
- Are you kidding me?
- You must be joking.

136
00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.508
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

137
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.818
- Look at Joon Ho.
- I'm only asking.

138
00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.318
I'm sorry, but we already ate a lot.

139
00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:33.687
Are you serious?

140
00:04:33.688 --> 00:04:35.195
But we worked hard while you were gone.

141
00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.387
What did you do at the market then?

142
00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:38.088
What did you eat right off the bat?

143
00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:39.327
- Tell us.
- We heard that...

144
00:04:39.328 --> 00:04:41.887
the market is famous for its buckwheat.

145
00:04:41.888 --> 00:04:42.997
- Buckwheat?
- Buckwheat?

146
00:04:42.998 --> 00:04:44.757
- Buckwheat?
- We ate buckwheat crepe.

147
00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:46.367
- Really?
- Yes, and noodles.

148
00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:47.398
It's only four dollars.

149
00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:49.798
We also ate sundae and makgeolli.

150
00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:51.067
- Gyeong Ree wanted to.
- Sundae and makgeolli.

151
00:04:51.068 --> 00:04:54.039
- What?
- That's quite a lot.

152
00:04:54.568 --> 00:04:56.279
When did you take the photos then?

153
00:04:56.308 --> 00:04:58.077
- Well...
- When we were full.

154
00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:00.007
- That's right.
- When you were full?

155
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.149
(They're dumbfounded.)

156
00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.747
But despite all that, you
wanted to eat with us.

157
00:05:04.748 --> 00:05:05.918
I should've known better.

158
00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.617
Defconn, take that.

159
00:05:08.618 --> 00:05:10.317
- So that's that.
- Right.

160
00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:12.827
You could've at least bought some flour.

161
00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:15.497
Can't you let us have some flour?

162
00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:16.697
Thank you.

163
00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:18.528
They're giving us flour.

164
00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.368
Are you going to cook then?

165
00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:24.498
Narsha, you genuinely look angry.

166
00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:25.709
Your guess is right.

167
00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.308
- Let's write it here.
- I'm infuriated.

168
00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:34.279
Lastly, Chae Yeon wants to say something.

169
00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:36.018
- What is it?
- Are you hungry too?

170
00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:39.117
We'll cook dinner for you.

171
00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:40.248
- Right.
- Sure.

172
00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:41.418
Go ahead.

173
00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.687
(Yes, cook us ramyeon.)

174
00:05:42.688 --> 00:05:44.418
Narsha, don't look so angry.

175
00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.589
(Is it that obvious?)

176
00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:48.728
Is this it?

177
00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:49.898
We should have some pork.

178
00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.098
- Let's have some food.
- Yes!

179
00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.298
(This is what we bought!)

180
00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:55.768
There's more.

181
00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:57.497
- What's all that?
- See?

182
00:05:57.498 --> 00:05:58.807
There's more.

183
00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:00.338
There's a lot.

184
00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:01.469
There's a lot of food.

185
00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:05.108
(A lot of rice, ingredients, and fruit)

186
00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:07.279
(They even have huge portions of meat.)

187
00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:08.448
Did you buy all of this?

188
00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.678
Truth be told, Chae Yeon...

189
00:06:11.018 --> 00:06:13.187
won us a blank check.

190
00:06:13.188 --> 00:06:14.789
- Really?
- Are you serious?

191
00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:16.218
Now stop frowning already.

192
00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.459
- Is this for real?
- We were lying all along.

193
00:06:20.188 --> 00:06:21.789
(Then let's applaud!)

194
00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.567
- Chae Yeon, Chae Yeon.
- Chae Yeon, Chae Yeon.

195
00:06:25.568 --> 00:06:27.868
- Go, Chae Yeon.
- Show them.

196
00:06:28.068 --> 00:06:29.668
- Guys!
- Really?

197
00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.938
Take a look at this!

198
00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:33.637
(A round of applause)

199
00:06:33.638 --> 00:06:35.169
Here you go!

200
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:36.479
(This is for real.)

201
00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.409
We bought 200 dollars worth of beef.

202
00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.178
(She can't hide her smile.)

203
00:06:42.578 --> 00:06:44.317
- Yes!
- You fooled us.

204
00:06:44.318 --> 00:06:46.589
- I know.
- It was a surprise.

205
00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:49.418
- I was furious.
- Me too.

206
00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.827
Narsha stated that she was furious.

207
00:06:52.828 --> 00:06:54.058
That you should air.

208
00:06:55.128 --> 00:06:56.497
(She's sorry and embarrassed.)

209
00:06:56.498 --> 00:06:58.158
I was irritated since it was our dinner.

210
00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.969
- Of course.
- We had so much money...

211
00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:01.598
that we ate sundae for the fun of it.

212
00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.367
- Sure.
- Of course.

213
00:07:03.368 --> 00:07:04.898
That you should eat.

214
00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.538
What Chae Yeon wants, you should have.

215
00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:07.969
You're the best.

216
00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.077
The ending was dramatic thanks to her.

217
00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:11.908
It was nothing but dramatic.

218
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:13.308
That's right.

219
00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:15.718
Could you rinse the lettuce for us?

220
00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:16.719
Of course.

221
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.049
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

222
00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:20.388
There's one more.

223
00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.088
- Really?
- We only need one.

224
00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:23.449
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

225
00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.089
(Laughing triumphantly)

226
00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:30.498
- Rinse the lettuce.
- Are you that happy?

227
00:07:30.698 --> 00:07:31.698
Of course.

228
00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:34.628
- He hates helping out.
- But I'm the lady here.

229
00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.469
- I'm sorry.
- That and the ramyeon.

230
00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:39.738
This is unexpected. I really thought...

231
00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:41.708
- you had ate.
- How could we?

232
00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:43.908
Defconn, I'm sorry about earlier.

233
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:45.239
You should be deeply sorry.

234
00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.317
Anyway, Chae Yeon said
we should have a feast.

235
00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:51.248
I trust you on the grill!

236
00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:54.618
Yu Ra, this is your favorite.

237
00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:56.919
I'm so happy right now.

238
00:07:57.318 --> 00:07:59.328
Chae Yeon, we owe you.

239
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.489
I sure will sleep well tonight.

240
00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:03.459
I wouldn't have if I were angry.

241
00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:05.299
Should we rinse all of these?

242
00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:06.798
- Right?
- Let's rinse...

243
00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:08.268
- these first.
- Let's empty this.

244
00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.468
This should do it.

245
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:12.568
(The rinsed lettuce goes in the pot.)

246
00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:16.077
Are we going to boil this instead?

247
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.078
No, we're grilling it.

248
00:08:17.078 --> 00:08:18.838
(They're all busy getting
ready for dinner.)

249
00:08:19.678 --> 00:08:21.348
Everyone's hungry.

250
00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:22.848
You're all doing great.

251
00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:24.447
You're really good at this.

252
00:08:24.448 --> 00:08:26.318
Give her a round of applause.

253
00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:27.649
(What's going on?)

254
00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.159
They're making up for not doing anything.

255
00:08:31.018 --> 00:08:33.527
Sometimes it's best to stay out of the way.

256
00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:35.288
He's right about that.

257
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:36.799
(They're just goofing around.)

258
00:08:37.298 --> 00:08:39.069
- These too?
- Yes.

259
00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:40.898
(They're doing great.)

260
00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:43.738
We have dongchimi.

261
00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:44.768
Are you serious?

262
00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:46.908
Joon Ho, look at this.

263
00:08:47.538 --> 00:08:48.778
- What's that?
- Jeon.

264
00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:51.008
Like this.

265
00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:53.709
Are you really going to eat alone?

266
00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:56.819
There's only 2. We only bought 2.

267
00:08:57.219 --> 00:08:58.818
You sure bought a lot.

268
00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:00.219
What's this you have?

269
00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:02.018
(Every man for himself)

270
00:09:03.118 --> 00:09:04.718
- Can we eat this?
- Of course.

271
00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:07.127
- Let's move this.
- Chae Yeon did it all.

272
00:09:07.128 --> 00:09:08.757
- My gosh.
- This is amazing.

273
00:09:08.758 --> 00:09:10.329
It's really good.

274
00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:12.368
- Well...
- Why aren't you helping?

275
00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:13.498
I'm the supervisor.

276
00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:15.497
In a way, I'm the conductor.

277
00:09:15.498 --> 00:09:16.538
(Maestro Joon Ho)

278
00:09:17.368 --> 00:09:19.108
Ha Ra on the dongchimi.

279
00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:20.309
(Ha Ra, dongchimi!)

280
00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:22.628
(It's like she's following Joon Ho's lead.)

281
00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:27.277
Narsha on dish cleaning.

282
00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:28.408
(Narsha, dish cleaning!)

283
00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:30.678
(They wash the lettuce leaves.)

284
00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:32.917
Watch this.

285
00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:34.488
Defconn, grill!

286
00:09:34.489 --> 00:09:35.489
(Defconn grills.)

287
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.689
The pork looks amazing.

288
00:09:38.689 --> 00:09:40.589
(Pork is spread out on the pan.)

289
00:09:40.888 --> 00:09:43.859
Who are you? What are you in charge of?

290
00:09:44.028 --> 00:09:45.028
I'm the assistant.

291
00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:48.497
See how I don't miss anything?

292
00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:50.439
(I'm not goofing around.)

293
00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:52.637
Can I taste that?

294
00:09:52.638 --> 00:09:54.407
- Did you buy that too?
- This.

295
00:09:54.408 --> 00:09:57.179
- Have you tried it?
- No, I haven't.

296
00:09:57.778 --> 00:09:58.778
It's so good.

297
00:09:58.779 --> 00:09:59.978
(Delicious!)

298
00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:01.647
- Is it good?
- Yes.

299
00:10:01.648 --> 00:10:02.648
It's so good!

300
00:10:03.118 --> 00:10:05.748
- Chae Yeon made it.
- Three cheers for her!

301
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:07.547
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah.

302
00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:09.688
- Hurrah!
- Chae Yeon, hurrah!

303
00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:11.359
- Yes!
- Good job.

304
00:10:12.229 --> 00:10:16.157
I'm watching you, so don't you slack off.

305
00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:17.228
(They all pitch in.)

306
00:10:17.229 --> 00:10:19.198
Like this.

307
00:10:19.199 --> 00:10:21.098
- Isn't it good?
- Jong Min.

308
00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:23.838
- Jong Min.
- I'm feeding the workers.

309
00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:26.708
- He's feeding the others.
- I'm over here though.

310
00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:27.839
Do you want some too?

311
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:30.108
Jong Min, I'm over here.

312
00:10:30.109 --> 00:10:31.309
(Sweating)

313
00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:33.449
Why aren't you paying her more attention?

314
00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:35.048
You're her partner.

315
00:10:35.248 --> 00:10:36.849
I've known her for a long time.

316
00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:39.819
- Why ignore me?
- I really wasn't.

317
00:10:40.288 --> 00:10:42.559
I like how the pork is nice and thick.

318
00:10:44.189 --> 00:10:45.189
Can I try some?

319
00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:46.589
They're not ready yet.

320
00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:48.627
They're ready enough.

321
00:10:48.628 --> 00:10:50.127
If I grill them more, they'll burn.

322
00:10:50.128 --> 00:10:51.358
Really? Don't we need sauce?

323
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.497
Is that so?

324
00:10:52.498 --> 00:10:54.569
- That's right.
- How about this?

325
00:10:54.929 --> 00:10:55.969
I just made it.

326
00:10:56.368 --> 00:10:58.497
- Okay.
- Minced garlic with...

327
00:10:58.498 --> 00:11:00.907
- gochujang and doenjang.
- Are they ready?

328
00:11:00.908 --> 00:11:01.969
All right then.

329
00:11:03.239 --> 00:11:04.839
Something tastes delicious!

330
00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:06.708
I bet it's this.

331
00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:08.047
- Really?
- Try some.

332
00:11:08.048 --> 00:11:09.579
I see you're not new to cooking.

333
00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:11.548
Ssamjang tastes great this way.

334
00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:14.148
- Did you just make this?
- Of course.

335
00:11:15.489 --> 00:11:17.418
(Doenjang, gochujang, and minced garlic)

336
00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:19.929
(Pour in sugar.)

337
00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:23.398
(Drizzle in tasty sesame oil.)

338
00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:26.199
(Made by Yu Ra)

339
00:11:27.168 --> 00:11:28.397
- It's so good.
- Really?

340
00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:30.199
Yes. I love how it's balanced.

341
00:11:30.498 --> 00:11:31.538
What are you up to now?

342
00:11:31.798 --> 00:11:33.808
They're taking longer than expected.

343
00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:34.838
Here?

344
00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:36.839
- See what they're up to.
- Sure.

345
00:11:39.008 --> 00:11:40.209
Isn't this too much?

346
00:11:40.548 --> 00:11:42.008
(Are they only eating chilies?)

347
00:11:42.278 --> 00:11:43.348
Are we going to grill these?

348
00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:44.948
- Right.
- Here.

349
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:45.949
I think these are enough.

350
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:46.988
(They wrap it up as Joon Young suggests.)

351
00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:48.017
Let's go.

352
00:11:48.018 --> 00:11:50.589
Are the chilies any good?

353
00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:51.959
They're good.

354
00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:55.088
(The youngest busily sets
the table with food.)

355
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.428
What about the kimchi jjigae?

356
00:11:56.429 --> 00:11:58.828
- Are we 12 people?
- Yes.

357
00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:59.829
A table for 12.

358
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:03.068
Thanks to the ladies, we're having a feast.

359
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:04.897
- I know.
- Everything's better.

360
00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:07.268
We never set the table this neatly.

361
00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:11.908
(The dinner table is set
with hard work and love.)

362
00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:14.008
Look at the color on these.

363
00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:17.578
(Golden-brown and
mouthwatering samgyeopsal)

364
00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:20.348
- A lot are new.
- We should eat these.

365
00:12:20.349 --> 00:12:22.517
- What now?
- He's making ramyeon.

366
00:12:22.518 --> 00:12:23.558
- Jong Min.
- Can I shut this?

367
00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:24.618
It's really good.

368
00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:27.329
- We should eat already.
- Right.

369
00:12:27.758 --> 00:12:29.099
- Come on.
- Can we eat?

370
00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:31.699
My gosh.

371
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.267
(Defconn's samgyeopsal
and Yu Ra's ssamjang)

372
00:12:35.268 --> 00:12:36.438
The meat.

373
00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:37.699
It's really delicious.

374
00:12:39.868 --> 00:12:42.038
(She eats the same combination as well.)

375
00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:43.608
Now the kimchi.

376
00:12:43.609 --> 00:12:46.278
(Why bother describing the taste?)

377
00:12:47.579 --> 00:12:49.449
(She drinks cool dongchimi juice.)

378
00:12:50.819 --> 00:12:52.417
(My gosh)

379
00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:53.748
That's good.

380
00:12:54.319 --> 00:12:55.518
What about it?

381
00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:57.218
(Her eyes lit up.)

382
00:12:57.219 --> 00:12:59.888
- Unbelievable.
- Coming up next is beef.

383
00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:03.128
(2nd round is beef.)

384
00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:04.359
(Darn!)

385
00:13:04.599 --> 00:13:06.127
- It came.
- What came?

386
00:13:06.128 --> 00:13:07.497
My love for meat.

387
00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:08.898
(His love for meat is back.)

388
00:13:11.298 --> 00:13:13.338
Guys, try some beef.

389
00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:15.007
(Gyeong Ree arrives with a wrap.)

390
00:13:15.008 --> 00:13:16.838
- Defconn.
- Where's the garlic?

391
00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:18.708
- Are you kidding me?
- It's the least I can do.

392
00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:20.609
- That's hot.
- It's delicious.

393
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:23.048
- Have some more.
- It's really good.

394
00:13:23.479 --> 00:13:26.219
(He never leaves his post by the stove.)

395
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:29.989
(Whether others eat pork or beef, )

396
00:13:30.788 --> 00:13:33.329
(he only cares about the kimchi jjigae.)

397
00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:35.998
(Is this not it?)

398
00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:38.459
Dong Gu, here you go.

399
00:13:38.768 --> 00:13:39.828
Thanks.

400
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:41.029
(Gyeong Ree's special service)

401
00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:46.339
Here's one for slacking off today.

402
00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:47.838
Thanks.

403
00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.208
There you go.

404
00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:50.277
(The brat always gets one more.)

405
00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:51.637
- Smile.
- It's a bit greasy.

406
00:13:51.638 --> 00:13:52.948
Don't you agree?

407
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:56.047
Ha Ra and Narsha don't look angry anymore.

408
00:13:56.048 --> 00:13:57.079
(Smiling)

409
00:13:57.319 --> 00:13:59.819
- You two startled me.
- They seem happier now.

410
00:13:59.918 --> 00:14:01.818
We were pulling your legs too.

411
00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:02.859
That's right.

412
00:14:03.618 --> 00:14:05.488
We're not that mean.

413
00:14:05.489 --> 00:14:06.627
How's the meat?

414
00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:07.958
- Good.
- Is it good?

415
00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:09.458
- It's great.
- It's good meat.

416
00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:11.458
- Have some beef too.
- Beef?

417
00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:12.998
Don't you guys never get to eat?

418
00:14:13.998 --> 00:14:15.968
- This is a 1st for us.
- Yes, a 1st.

419
00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:18.338
- The beef is delicious.
- Isn't it?

420
00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:20.239
- Really?
- Who wants a big piece?

421
00:14:20.939 --> 00:14:22.108
- A big piece.
- Me!

422
00:14:22.109 --> 00:14:23.138
- Me.
- Me!

423
00:14:23.408 --> 00:14:26.047
- It's this big.
- I give up.

424
00:14:26.048 --> 00:14:27.179
- Me.
- Eat it as it is.

425
00:14:27.248 --> 00:14:28.308
- Here.
- Let me.

426
00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:29.917
- I can eat it.
- Really?

427
00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:31.247
- There's more.
- Really?

428
00:14:31.248 --> 00:14:32.387
Look at this.

429
00:14:32.388 --> 00:14:33.887
- That I can eat.
- Really?

430
00:14:33.888 --> 00:14:35.088
Come and join us.

431
00:14:35.089 --> 00:14:37.989
The piece needs to be big
to enjoy the texture.

432
00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:39.458
Narsha's up for the challenge.

433
00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.189
- Come on.
- Isn't it too big?

434
00:14:41.288 --> 00:14:44.528
- Be careful.
- Don't forget to chew.

435
00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:46.768
My goodness.

436
00:14:47.998 --> 00:14:50.037
(Biting)

437
00:14:50.038 --> 00:14:51.168
Are you sure about this?

438
00:14:52.739 --> 00:14:54.668
- Narsha...
- Why make her do this?

439
00:14:54.908 --> 00:14:56.809
I didn't. It actually was for me.

440
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.007
We're not using this so...

441
00:14:58.008 --> 00:15:00.578
It's like she only has this chance to eat.

442
00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:01.748
Why would you do that?

443
00:15:04.849 --> 00:15:05.888
Make sure you chew.

444
00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:09.589
- It was for me.
- We can eat together.

445
00:15:09.689 --> 00:15:12.158
- Is he eating too?
- Yes, of course.

446
00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:14.728
There's really a lot.

447
00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:16.027
We've never eaten like this.

448
00:15:16.028 --> 00:15:18.099
- Guys.
- This is amazing.

449
00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:19.798
- No way.
- This is great.

450
00:15:20.268 --> 00:15:21.928
- Who made the jjigae?
- I did.

451
00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:22.968
Really?

452
00:15:22.969 --> 00:15:24.998
(Kimchi jjigae to refresh their palates)

453
00:15:26.239 --> 00:15:27.868
- Here we go.
- Are you sure?

454
00:15:29.209 --> 00:15:30.679
Gosh, it's good.

455
00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:32.448
Good job, Dong Gu.

456
00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:33.478
(The spicy jjigae calls for steamed rice.)

457
00:15:33.479 --> 00:15:34.479
This is amazing.

458
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.825
- Did you add canned tuna?
- It's good.

459
00:15:35.849 --> 00:15:37.048
Yes, I did.

460
00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:40.449
- I hate canned tuna.
- Then don't eat it.

461
00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:42.657
- Gosh.
- Let me have it then.

462
00:15:42.658 --> 00:15:46.429
Wait a second. I'll manage around it.

463
00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:49.328
- I see you're full.
- He must be.

464
00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:50.329
That's why it tastes good.

465
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.798
- Is that ramyeon?
- Ramyeon?

466
00:15:52.168 --> 00:15:55.268
- Ramyeon, let's go.
- Coming right up!

467
00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.398
Why are the staff being so nice to us?

468
00:15:57.538 --> 00:15:59.469
- The sauce is like...
- Jong Min.

469
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:00.938
Hello, sir.

470
00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:03.708
- I just stopped by.
- Are you hungry, sir?

471
00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:04.908
Come on over.

472
00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:06.808
Ma'am!

473
00:16:06.809 --> 00:16:08.479
- Give me one.
- Narsha.

474
00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:09.748
Yes?

475
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:12.547
Is that how you greet your father?

476
00:16:12.548 --> 00:16:14.547
- Dad!
- You weren't like this.

477
00:16:14.548 --> 00:16:16.387
- Open up.
- That's a big one.

478
00:16:16.388 --> 00:16:17.388
(He eats Ha Ra's lettuce wrap.)

479
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:19.257
- We sure are a big group.
- Isn't it delicious?

480
00:16:19.258 --> 00:16:20.858
We're now making ramyeon.

481
00:16:20.859 --> 00:16:23.397
- Please enjoy.
- Of course.

482
00:16:23.398 --> 00:16:25.699
(Chae Yeon brings Defconn a wrap.)

483
00:16:25.868 --> 00:16:26.929
My gosh. Thank you.

484
00:16:27.668 --> 00:16:30.569
You should make him a lettuce wrap too.

485
00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:32.309
Right.

486
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.368
Go ahead and eat.

487
00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:35.978
Chae Yeon!

488
00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:38.679
(Chae Yeon!)

489
00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:41.979
(What's going on?)

490
00:16:42.979 --> 00:16:45.179
(The two come up with a plan.)

491
00:16:45.248 --> 00:16:46.589
I don't know where it went to.

492
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:48.017
(Dong Gu provides Cheongyang chili.)

493
00:16:48.018 --> 00:16:49.338
(We should add in minced garlic.)

494
00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:52.229
(She gets some that's
right next to Defconn.)

495
00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:57.798
(This'll be fun.)

496
00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:00.098
I'm slightly jealous though.

497
00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:02.868
- Right?
- He's a lucky man.

498
00:17:02.869 --> 00:17:04.297
We rarely get fooled.

499
00:17:04.298 --> 00:17:06.439
- Chae Yeon!
- How can he not eat it?

500
00:17:06.808 --> 00:17:07.808
Of course.

501
00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:09.077
Have fun then.

502
00:17:09.078 --> 00:17:10.238
Thank you.

503
00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:12.178
- Enjoy the food too.
- Thank you.

504
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:13.247
Sure.

505
00:17:13.248 --> 00:17:15.747
- It'll get mushy soon.
- Of course.

506
00:17:15.748 --> 00:17:18.517
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

507
00:17:18.518 --> 00:17:20.448
- Thank you.
- Good job!

508
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:21.518
We can do it!

509
00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:23.919
- Right.
- Well...

510
00:17:24.459 --> 00:17:26.088
(Why aren't you leaving?)

511
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.229
- This I should say.
- What is it?

512
00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:30.158
- One...
- One Night...

513
00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:31.159
- Two...
- That's right.

514
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.567
- Say it with me.
- Over there, sir.

515
00:17:33.568 --> 00:17:34.628
One...

516
00:17:34.629 --> 00:17:36.267
- Two!
- It's One Night.

517
00:17:36.268 --> 00:17:38.138
You should say Night. One!

518
00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:39.139
- Night.
- Two.

519
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.169
- Two.
- Days!

520
00:17:40.608 --> 00:17:43.238
- Yes.
- Yes!

521
00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:45.408
- I wish you the best.
- Thank you.

522
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:47.048
- Bye.
- Thank you.

523
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:50.048
- Look at that.
- It's rice.

524
00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:53.087
What a feast.

525
00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:54.347
(Chae Yeon delivers a bowl to each.)

526
00:17:54.348 --> 00:17:57.489
It's better with Cheongyang chili in it.

527
00:17:58.659 --> 00:18:01.057
- It's refreshing.
- I know.

528
00:18:01.058 --> 00:18:02.357
I bet it's spicy.

529
00:18:02.358 --> 00:18:03.557
It's really good though.

530
00:18:03.558 --> 00:18:05.229
My stomach's about to burst.

531
00:18:05.699 --> 00:18:08.067
I know I'm full, but I can't help it.

532
00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:09.668
(Ramyeon isn't the end though.)

533
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:10.939
What's that?

534
00:18:11.139 --> 00:18:12.567
It's really good.

535
00:18:12.568 --> 00:18:13.608
He watches "Men in Black".

536
00:18:14.239 --> 00:18:16.838
I must've eaten too many lettuce wraps.

537
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:18.179
Look, peaches.

538
00:18:19.008 --> 00:18:20.107
(They're as big as pears.)

539
00:18:20.108 --> 00:18:22.347
Aren't those pears? Should we peel them?

540
00:18:22.348 --> 00:18:23.449
Bring it to your face.

541
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:25.448
- Gosh.
- No way.

542
00:18:25.449 --> 00:18:27.318
- It's as big as her head.
- Hers is tiny.

543
00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:29.419
I haven't seen peaches that big before.

544
00:18:29.788 --> 00:18:31.757
Look at Tae Hyun peeling those.

545
00:18:31.758 --> 00:18:33.557
- Right.
- Are you sure about this?

546
00:18:33.558 --> 00:18:35.128
Here you go. Have this.

547
00:18:35.129 --> 00:18:37.998
Why are you doubting me when I never did?

548
00:18:38.498 --> 00:18:40.098
Here you go.

549
00:18:40.528 --> 00:18:41.729
- I'm trusting you.
- Sure.

550
00:18:42.068 --> 00:18:43.297
- You should.
- Of course you should.

551
00:18:43.298 --> 00:18:45.807
I didn't add any chilies.

552
00:18:45.808 --> 00:18:46.888
I didn't do anything funny.

553
00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:48.537
(He laughs suspiciously.)

554
00:18:48.538 --> 00:18:50.978
- What's wrong?
- Chae Yeon!

555
00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:52.008
What did he add?

556
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.548
I just put in a lot of garlic.

557
00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:56.418
- Is there an extra knife?
- Defconn.

558
00:18:56.419 --> 00:18:58.118
How could you do that to her?

559
00:18:58.119 --> 00:19:00.488
- Unbelievable.
- How could you?

560
00:19:00.489 --> 00:19:03.087
- She's only a girl.
- She's barely 20.

561
00:19:03.088 --> 00:19:04.118
She's crying.

562
00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:05.188
(Crying)

563
00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:07.287
Her breath reeks of garlic.

564
00:19:07.288 --> 00:19:09.357
- Unbelievable.
- No way.

565
00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:10.558
It'll chase away cancer.

566
00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:13.027
- What?
- How could you?

567
00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.268
I only put in a little.

568
00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:15.699
I guess you went overboard again.

569
00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:17.938
I'm really sorry.

570
00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:19.337
It's because his first
love didn't work out.

571
00:19:19.338 --> 00:19:21.007
(He doesn't understand women at all.)

572
00:19:21.008 --> 00:19:22.908
The peaches are like mangoes.

573
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:23.938
They're delicious.

574
00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:25.748
- They're extremely juicy.
- No way.

575
00:19:26.078 --> 00:19:27.678
It's from the elders.

576
00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:29.848
Look at the color. They're almost golden.

577
00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:31.318
They're really big.

578
00:19:31.949 --> 00:19:33.287
This is the best.

579
00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:34.728
I haven't had better peaches before.

580
00:19:35.489 --> 00:19:36.517
It's amazing.

581
00:19:36.518 --> 00:19:37.689
- Here.
- My gosh.

582
00:19:39.489 --> 00:19:41.787
- Do you want more?
- This is incredible.

583
00:19:41.788 --> 00:19:42.828
Amazing.

584
00:19:44.028 --> 00:19:45.098
Unbelievable.

585
00:19:45.798 --> 00:19:46.828
It's to die for.

586
00:19:47.169 --> 00:19:49.297
This is the best out of everything today.

587
00:19:49.298 --> 00:19:50.668
- It's like pudding.
- It melts in your mouth.

588
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:51.698
Doesn't it disappear?

589
00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:53.037
(Everyone's mesmerized.)

590
00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:54.768
- How can this be?
- This is impossible.

591
00:19:54.939 --> 00:19:56.537
This is delicious.

592
00:19:56.538 --> 00:19:57.608
You wouldn't believe it.

593
00:19:58.639 --> 00:20:00.548
(Ha Ra delivers it herself.)

594
00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:04.078
- It's delicious.
- Who else wants it?

595
00:20:04.979 --> 00:20:06.018
It's really good.

596
00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:07.449
Do you want some?

597
00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:08.817
- Really?
- Here.

598
00:20:08.818 --> 00:20:10.258
(She hands out a slice to everyone.)

599
00:20:11.518 --> 00:20:13.888
(Her heart is as sweet as the peaches.)

600
00:20:13.889 --> 00:20:14.959
Look at Ha Ra.

601
00:20:17.058 --> 00:20:18.097
We should just eat it.

602
00:20:18.098 --> 00:20:19.997
- Let's try it out.
- Right.

603
00:20:19.998 --> 00:20:22.497
(Joon Ho gets one ready for someone.)

604
00:20:22.498 --> 00:20:24.399
Is there a smaller one?

605
00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:26.409
It's impossible to not eat any.

606
00:20:27.308 --> 00:20:29.807
- Everything was great.
- When they're sliced...

607
00:20:29.808 --> 00:20:30.837
(He spots the clueless Ha Ra.)

608
00:20:30.838 --> 00:20:33.979
Don't sell yourself short
and have a proper slice.

609
00:20:34.278 --> 00:20:35.448
- Here.
- I like this better.

610
00:20:35.449 --> 00:20:38.547
She's right. The ends are sometimes better.

611
00:20:38.548 --> 00:20:41.548
(Ha Ra, watch out!)

612
00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:44.058
He sprinkled salt on it.

613
00:20:44.818 --> 00:20:46.858
(Oh no...)

614
00:20:47.989 --> 00:20:50.629
I can't believe she actually ate it.

615
00:20:51.229 --> 00:20:52.568
No way.

616
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:55.468
- Help her.
- It's way too salty.

617
00:20:55.469 --> 00:20:57.098
- Spit it out.
- Give her a tissue.

618
00:20:57.239 --> 00:20:58.668
It's dangerous to eat that.

619
00:20:58.669 --> 00:21:00.107
- How could you?
- Spit it out.

620
00:21:00.108 --> 00:21:02.008
- Spit it out.
- Ha Ra!

621
00:21:02.838 --> 00:21:03.978
Unbelievable!

622
00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:06.277
- How could you?
- My gosh.

623
00:21:06.278 --> 00:21:08.278
- You're unbelievable.
- You gave her salt.

624
00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:10.317
(Joon Ho is the worst.)

625
00:21:10.318 --> 00:21:12.989
- It's so good.
- I knew something was up.

626
00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:16.389
Write mean comments, and I'll sue you.

627
00:21:17.558 --> 00:21:18.659
I'll sue you.

628
00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:20.929
(Laughing)

629
00:21:22.058 --> 00:21:23.828
I'll take action against every one of them.

630
00:21:24.328 --> 00:21:25.669
Every one of them.

631
00:21:26.199 --> 00:21:27.528
We won't stop you.

632
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.138
That was hilarious.

633
00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:30.537
Should I get the grapes?

634
00:21:30.538 --> 00:21:31.899
Do we have grapes too?

635
00:21:32.108 --> 00:21:33.468
Get the grapes!

636
00:21:33.469 --> 00:21:35.138
Let's play rock-paper-scissors then.

637
00:21:35.139 --> 00:21:36.537
I'll just rinse them.

638
00:21:36.538 --> 00:21:38.008
Ha Ra's the best.

639
00:21:38.608 --> 00:21:40.108
She's good in the kitchen.

640
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:43.449
(Once they are rinsed, )

641
00:21:44.248 --> 00:21:46.949
(they're pulled off from the stem.)

642
00:21:48.889 --> 00:21:50.988
(Rinse again and they sparkle like gem.)

643
00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:52.128
- Good job.
- Look at that.

644
00:21:52.129 --> 00:21:53.458
- They're pretty.
- They're like gems.

645
00:21:53.459 --> 00:21:55.059
(Rinse again and they sparkle like gem.)

646
00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:57.659
- Which one?
- Joon Ho, can you catch?

647
00:21:57.828 --> 00:21:58.899
Of course.

648
00:21:59.199 --> 00:22:00.428
He's good at that.

649
00:22:00.429 --> 00:22:01.468
Really?

650
00:22:01.469 --> 00:22:02.498
In 1, 2, 3.

651
00:22:03.568 --> 00:22:05.638
(Goal in!)

652
00:22:05.639 --> 00:22:07.469
Did he really catch it?

653
00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:09.107
Be careful.

654
00:22:09.108 --> 00:22:10.178
No way.

655
00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:11.538
He comes from the zoo.

656
00:22:11.808 --> 00:22:13.148
- What?
- He's so good at this.

657
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:14.348
Unbelievable.

658
00:22:14.548 --> 00:22:15.678
- That's right.
- Hold on a second.

659
00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:16.847
He's good at these things.

660
00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:17.949
In 1, 2, 3.

661
00:22:18.048 --> 00:22:21.048
(Was it good luck the first time?)

662
00:22:21.748 --> 00:22:22.757
(Well?)

663
00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.057
(That's pure talent.)

664
00:22:24.058 --> 00:22:26.688
- No way.
- What did I tell you?

665
00:22:26.689 --> 00:22:28.058
What is this?

666
00:22:28.798 --> 00:22:29.857
Salt and sesame oil.

667
00:22:29.858 --> 00:22:31.929
(Salt and sesame oil)

668
00:22:33.098 --> 00:22:34.898
(Payback!)

669
00:22:34.899 --> 00:22:35.899
No way.

670
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.398
He almost swallowed it hole.

671
00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:38.439
That's what you get.

672
00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:39.607
This is for Shin Young.

673
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:41.038
(Take that!)

674
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:43.038
What comes around goes around.

675
00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:46.648
- See?
- That was unbelievable.

676
00:22:46.649 --> 00:22:49.518
They aren't big, but they're so juicy.

677
00:22:49.949 --> 00:22:51.148
- It's so good.
- Right.

678
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:52.518
- My gosh.
- They're so sweet.

679
00:22:52.818 --> 00:22:54.017
I know.

680
00:22:54.018 --> 00:22:55.817
Aren't they extremely juicy?

681
00:22:55.818 --> 00:22:56.959
They're so sweet!

682
00:22:57.189 --> 00:22:58.988
You should all eat one too.

683
00:22:58.989 --> 00:23:00.788
Come on and join us.

684
00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:03.429
(Smiling)

685
00:23:03.798 --> 00:23:04.898
Look at Ha Ra.

686
00:23:04.899 --> 00:23:06.198
(Ha Ra's at your service.)

687
00:23:06.199 --> 00:23:07.199
My gosh.

688
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.098
Would you look at that?

689
00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:11.338
She's like a fruit store owner.

690
00:23:11.768 --> 00:23:13.837
Since she's handing out
to those over there,

691
00:23:13.838 --> 00:23:15.578
they've all gone over to that side.

692
00:23:15.639 --> 00:23:17.908
They're all gravitating towards her.

693
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:21.247
Look at how they're getting in line.

694
00:23:21.248 --> 00:23:22.347
Even them.

695
00:23:22.348 --> 00:23:24.118
He's too shy to hold up his chin.

696
00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:25.679
(Although he's shy, he doesn't resist.)

697
00:23:26.889 --> 00:23:28.958
They're opening up their mouths...

698
00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:30.219
before she's even there.

699
00:23:30.788 --> 00:23:32.287
Isn't that weird?

700
00:23:32.288 --> 00:23:34.489
- They can't wait.
- Since when?

701
00:23:35.258 --> 00:23:37.557
I can't believe they're all opening up.

702
00:23:37.558 --> 00:23:38.558
Tell me about it.

703
00:23:39.229 --> 00:23:41.497
Seong just came out of nowhere.

704
00:23:41.498 --> 00:23:42.938
He came running.

705
00:23:42.939 --> 00:23:44.267
Where were you just now?

706
00:23:44.268 --> 00:23:46.638
- Well...
- How about this?

707
00:23:46.639 --> 00:23:48.909
How about this?

708
00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:51.379
Excuse me.

709
00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:53.478
(Shut it!)

710
00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:55.879
Goodness. Did you see that?

711
00:23:56.048 --> 00:23:57.118
(Joon Ho, here you go!)

712
00:23:57.119 --> 00:23:58.449
Unbelievable.

713
00:23:59.788 --> 00:24:00.848
That's enough.

714
00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:04.189
Ms. Koo really knows how to run the place.

715
00:24:04.719 --> 00:24:07.428
- She really does.
- Thank you.

716
00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:08.488
Her parents own an orchard.

717
00:24:08.489 --> 00:24:09.728
Yes, it's in Bundang.

718
00:24:09.729 --> 00:24:11.159
Isn't that right?

719
00:24:11.328 --> 00:24:13.297
Do you think I'm blind?

720
00:24:13.298 --> 00:24:14.699
(I can see you.)

721
00:24:17.469 --> 00:24:18.538
(Embarrassed)

722
00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:21.308
How stupid do you think I am?

723
00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:24.838
He hasn't lost his appetite just yet.

724
00:24:25.748 --> 00:24:27.148
Did you see her just now?

725
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:28.979
(Ha Ra was too obvious.)

726
00:24:29.348 --> 00:24:32.318
Didn't you see that our eyes locked too?

727
00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:34.817
Unbelievable.

728
00:24:34.818 --> 00:24:36.758
I thought you wouldn't see that.

729
00:24:37.088 --> 00:24:38.488
(He's dumbfounded.)

730
00:24:38.489 --> 00:24:40.788
- Don't though.
- She's still that upset.

731
00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:45.098
Chae Yeon saved these for Shin Young.

732
00:24:45.328 --> 00:24:46.469
Now bring me salt.

733
00:24:47.998 --> 00:24:49.198
What?

734
00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:50.337
- No, don't.
- Go on.

735
00:24:50.338 --> 00:24:52.308
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

736
00:24:52.768 --> 00:24:54.268
Anyway, thank you, Chae Yeon.

737
00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:56.077
- That's right.
- Go, Chae Yeon!

738
00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:57.238
(Chae Yeon, thank you.)

739
00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.639
Nice!

740
00:24:59.348 --> 00:25:00.478
(They enjoyed a feast thanks to her.)

741
00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:02.078
She's a lucky charm.

742
00:25:03.719 --> 00:25:05.648
("Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors")

743
00:25:05.649 --> 00:25:06.788
Shin Young.

744
00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:08.419
- This is for you.
- What's that?

745
00:25:08.588 --> 00:25:10.287
Take a look.

746
00:25:10.288 --> 00:25:12.827
(Ha Ra brings her what Chae Yeon saved.)

747
00:25:12.828 --> 00:25:14.058
They're delicious.

748
00:25:14.989 --> 00:25:16.928
- Is it still fresh?
- Of course.

749
00:25:16.929 --> 00:25:18.357
- They're delicious.
- You taste it first.

750
00:25:18.358 --> 00:25:19.429
Sure thing.

751
00:25:20.469 --> 00:25:21.698
(Ha Ra tastes the food first.)

752
00:25:21.699 --> 00:25:23.097
She sure is quick-witted.

753
00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:26.709
I would've ate the fruit without thinking.

754
00:25:28.139 --> 00:25:29.178
(Isn't there any meat?)

755
00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:31.139
- Have you had dinner?
- Isn't it good?

756
00:25:31.608 --> 00:25:33.679
Chae Yeon saved these for you.

757
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:34.909
Really?

758
00:25:35.578 --> 00:25:36.848
That's sweet of you.

759
00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:39.288
(We ate all the meat though.)

760
00:25:40.449 --> 00:25:41.489
Shin Young.

761
00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:43.787
Defconn, I'm back.

762
00:25:43.788 --> 00:25:45.528
We missed you.

763
00:25:46.189 --> 00:25:47.628
Did you know we won first place?

764
00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:48.629
(We won first place.)

765
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.698
- We won first place.
- Really?

766
00:25:49.699 --> 00:25:51.098
- Of course.
- Nice.

767
00:25:51.858 --> 00:25:52.869
Eolssu!

768
00:25:54.828 --> 00:25:57.398
Where's Jong Min, the Fart King?

769
00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:58.538
He went to take a dump.

770
00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:00.007
Did you know this?

771
00:26:00.008 --> 00:26:02.908
He started farting as soon
as you were all gone.

772
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:04.777
- Who did?
- Jong Min.

773
00:26:04.778 --> 00:26:06.879
- He must've held it in.
- Normally he doesn't.

774
00:26:07.578 --> 00:26:09.378
- I see.
- I was really surprised.

775
00:26:09.379 --> 00:26:10.848
He can fart on cue.

776
00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:12.247
It's time for tea.

777
00:26:12.248 --> 00:26:13.787
(They were alone 10 minutes ago.)

778
00:26:13.788 --> 00:26:14.818
It's time for tea.

779
00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:15.919
There you go.

780
00:26:16.788 --> 00:26:18.418
(In this case, tea is his farts.)

781
00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:20.459
He starts farting now that we're alone.

782
00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:22.458
Jong Min's back.

783
00:26:22.459 --> 00:26:23.959
Jong Min, hurry up.

784
00:26:24.028 --> 00:26:25.828
(Jong Min, hurry up.)

785
00:26:26.699 --> 00:26:28.369
(Ha Ra, I'm coming!)

786
00:26:28.969 --> 00:26:30.368
(His steps are lighter
after taking a dump.)

787
00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:31.568
He's so annoying.

788
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:33.409
(The gang is back together.)

789
00:26:34.409 --> 00:26:35.778
You two are unbelievable.

790
00:26:37.008 --> 00:26:38.608
Your head is twice the size of Ha Ra's.

791
00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:40.978
Shouldn't his efforts get at least...

792
00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:42.818
a smile from Ha Ra?

793
00:26:43.179 --> 00:26:44.847
He changed clothes twice,

794
00:26:44.848 --> 00:26:46.888
showered and brushed his teeth.

795
00:26:46.889 --> 00:26:48.648
Ha Ra doesn't hate him though.

796
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:51.389
I feel like she's had enough of him.

797
00:26:51.558 --> 00:26:52.798
I bet I'm the first of my kind.

798
00:26:53.258 --> 00:26:54.288
(Laughing)

799
00:26:54.459 --> 00:26:57.928
Since it's already quite late,

800
00:26:57.929 --> 00:26:59.468
we should get into it right away.

801
00:26:59.469 --> 00:27:02.139
For today's "Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors",

802
00:27:02.598 --> 00:27:04.138
we'll play "Today Is Girl's Day,".

803
00:27:04.139 --> 00:27:06.037
"Save Gyeong Ree and Narsha."

804
00:27:06.038 --> 00:27:07.939
And I.

805
00:27:08.338 --> 00:27:09.478
No way!

806
00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:10.778
(Goosebumps)

807
00:27:12.078 --> 00:27:13.178
Unbelievable.

808
00:27:13.179 --> 00:27:14.308
Girl's Day?

809
00:27:14.409 --> 00:27:15.547
The song sounds like DIA.

810
00:27:15.548 --> 00:27:16.847
- Right.
- We're all in there.

811
00:27:16.848 --> 00:27:18.517
What about Yu Ra?

812
00:27:18.518 --> 00:27:19.718
- You didn't say her name.
- Girl's Day.

813
00:27:19.719 --> 00:27:21.118
I said Girl's Day instead.

814
00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:22.279
She's a member of Girl's Day.

815
00:27:22.959 --> 00:27:25.388
We'll be partnering up once again...

816
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:26.788
and play three games in total.

817
00:27:27.328 --> 00:27:29.497
The winners of each game...

818
00:27:29.498 --> 00:27:32.868
will sleep indoors at Driver Lee's house.

819
00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:36.198
The rest will sleep outdoors at...

820
00:27:36.199 --> 00:27:37.538
the camp site.

821
00:27:37.598 --> 00:27:38.698
Where?

822
00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:40.007
The place we ate?

823
00:27:40.008 --> 00:27:41.638
- Yes.
- We're sleeping there?

824
00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:43.008
That's right.

825
00:27:43.108 --> 00:27:44.879
- It's not bad.
- My gosh.

826
00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:46.008
Tell me you're lying.

827
00:27:46.449 --> 00:27:50.178
The first game is "The Gyeong Ree".

828
00:27:50.179 --> 00:27:51.218
"The Gyeong Ree"?
- What?

829
00:27:51.219 --> 00:27:52.219
Do we have to salute?

830
00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:54.618
Can you guess what game it'll be?

831
00:27:54.619 --> 00:27:56.719
- What is she good at?
- Just like her name,

832
00:27:56.989 --> 00:27:58.517
- she's good with numbers.
- Right.

833
00:27:58.518 --> 00:27:59.828
- Dancing sexily?
- You got it.

834
00:27:59.989 --> 00:28:01.629
You'll be doing sums in your head.

835
00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:03.998
- Oh no.
- I'm bad at that!

836
00:28:04.659 --> 00:28:06.729
(The teams will decide where to sit.)

837
00:28:07.998 --> 00:28:11.198
(They'll be asked in the order.)

838
00:28:11.199 --> 00:28:13.738
(The objective is to...)

839
00:28:13.739 --> 00:28:17.107
(answer correctly and in 3 seconds.)

840
00:28:17.108 --> 00:28:19.808
(The questions will get harder each round.)

841
00:28:20.848 --> 00:28:23.648
Where we sit is most important.

842
00:28:23.649 --> 00:28:25.218
That's right. Let's play
rock-paper-scissors.

843
00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:26.648
It's best to sit next to someone stupid.

844
00:28:26.649 --> 00:28:27.848
(Next to someone stupid)

845
00:28:29.088 --> 00:28:30.118
(I'm not as stupid as I was.)

846
00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:32.489
I'm going to sit next to Jong Min then.

847
00:28:33.028 --> 00:28:34.257
Let's decide who sits where.

848
00:28:34.258 --> 00:28:36.129
I entered an arithmetic competition once.

849
00:28:36.828 --> 00:28:38.728
(Arithmetic?)

850
00:28:38.729 --> 00:28:40.398
Even the ceiling lights makes a plus sign.

851
00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.798
Let's decide who sits where then.

852
00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:45.969
Since I need to play the game to,

853
00:28:46.169 --> 00:28:47.908
we have invited a referee...

854
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:50.608
to make sure everything's fair.

855
00:28:50.639 --> 00:28:51.708
It's been a while.

856
00:28:51.709 --> 00:28:52.747
(Kwon Gi Jong, Referee)

857
00:28:52.748 --> 00:28:54.807
It's hard to have him as a referee now...

858
00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:56.848
since he's actually become an actor.

859
00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:58.577
- Really?
- Of course.

860
00:28:58.578 --> 00:29:00.489
"The Best Hit".
- That's right.

861
00:29:00.588 --> 00:29:01.818
Who are you?

862
00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:03.087
(He appeared on the series "The Best Hit".)

863
00:29:03.088 --> 00:29:04.587
(His uniform says it all.)

864
00:29:04.588 --> 00:29:06.787
- I'm not sure.
- He wants some water.

865
00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:07.827
Really?

866
00:29:07.828 --> 00:29:09.158
(He utilized his character
on One Night Two Days.)

867
00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:10.159
You're out!

868
00:29:10.828 --> 00:29:12.998
Let's decide where everyone sits first.

869
00:29:13.098 --> 00:29:15.898
Shin Young's the MC, so
we'll sit in the middle.

870
00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:16.899
- Okay.
- Good.

871
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.145
The rest will play rock-paper-scissors.

872
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:20.468
No, we're all playing rock-paper-scissors.

873
00:29:20.469 --> 00:29:22.337
- But I'm the MC.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

874
00:29:22.338 --> 00:29:24.678
What? Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

875
00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:27.078
The members of One Night Two Days...

876
00:29:27.108 --> 00:29:29.048
will play rock-paper-scissors.

877
00:29:29.078 --> 00:29:31.118
- Since we start from...
- We'll start from there.

878
00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:32.724
- That's the worst spot.
- Raise your hand.

879
00:29:32.748 --> 00:29:35.149
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

880
00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:38.308
(Everyone put out scissors but Joon Young.)

881
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:40.027
Joon Young!

882
00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.587
- Just stay there.
- You can stay there.

883
00:29:41.588 --> 00:29:43.497
- Just stay there.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

884
00:29:43.498 --> 00:29:45.128
(Jong Min goes to the second spot.)

885
00:29:45.129 --> 00:29:46.668
- Okay.
- You lost.

886
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:48.067
- I put out scissors.
- No, you didn't.

887
00:29:48.068 --> 00:29:49.567
- You lost.
- Let me play once more.

888
00:29:49.568 --> 00:29:51.567
- Get lost.
- Go to your spot.

889
00:29:51.568 --> 00:29:53.508
- What a good job.
- She's kicking him.

890
00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:56.778
It's going well.

891
00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:58.778
Rock-paper-scissors.

892
00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:00.448
- Yes!
- It's me.

893
00:30:00.449 --> 00:30:01.449
Yes.

894
00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:02.559
- I love this spot.
- Here?

895
00:30:02.778 --> 00:30:05.149
It's a good spot.

896
00:30:06.288 --> 00:30:07.288
It's good for us.

897
00:30:07.489 --> 00:30:08.548
Rock-paper-scissors.

898
00:30:08.788 --> 00:30:09.888
Yes!

899
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:11.489
Rock-paper-scissors.

900
00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:13.587
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

901
00:30:13.588 --> 00:30:15.597
- We made it.
- Yes.

902
00:30:15.598 --> 00:30:18.798
Now, let's start with Joon Young's team.

903
00:30:18.998 --> 00:30:21.567
It doesn't seem to be his day today.

904
00:30:21.568 --> 00:30:22.939
He's unlucky these days.

905
00:30:22.969 --> 00:30:23.969
(I'm not alone.)

906
00:30:24.369 --> 00:30:27.668
Whoever knows the answer can answer.

907
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:28.938
(They fail if one of them
says the wrong answer.)

908
00:30:28.939 --> 00:30:31.038
If both say the answer and
one's answer is wrong,

909
00:30:31.209 --> 00:30:32.547
they still fail.

910
00:30:32.548 --> 00:30:34.209
- Okay.
- Here we go.

911
00:30:34.548 --> 00:30:36.518
49 plus 4 is?

912
00:30:37.348 --> 00:30:38.989
- 53.
- Correct.

913
00:30:39.719 --> 00:30:41.818
57 plus 4 is?

914
00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:44.488
- 61.
- Correct.

915
00:30:44.489 --> 00:30:46.429
24 plus 5 is?

916
00:30:46.588 --> 00:30:48.189
- 29.
- Correct.

917
00:30:48.798 --> 00:30:50.429
19 plus 9 is?

918
00:30:51.858 --> 00:30:53.267
- 28.
- Correct.

919
00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:55.369
47 plus 7 is?

920
00:30:55.838 --> 00:30:57.998
- 54.
- Correct.

921
00:30:58.199 --> 00:31:00.169
33 plus 8 is?

922
00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:02.578
- 41.
- Incorrect.

923
00:31:04.308 --> 00:31:06.479
- Why?
- How can it be 41?

924
00:31:06.748 --> 00:31:09.548
- He said, "33 plus 8".
- Wasn't it "33 plus 8"?

925
00:31:09.578 --> 00:31:10.878
33 plus...

926
00:31:10.879 --> 00:31:13.449
(Listen carefully.)

927
00:31:14.719 --> 00:31:17.219
He said the question wrong. You are right.

928
00:31:17.818 --> 00:31:19.189
(What?)

929
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:20.788
Sir.

930
00:31:21.489 --> 00:31:23.159
You sleep outdoors.

931
00:31:23.598 --> 00:31:25.398
How difficult is it to simply read?

932
00:31:25.399 --> 00:31:27.399
I've become farsighted these days.

933
00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:30.038
I think it's time for you to retire.

934
00:31:30.268 --> 00:31:31.869
I knew he was doing too well.

935
00:31:32.838 --> 00:31:33.838
I know.

936
00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:35.409
The letters are too small.

937
00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:38.208
- He's showing it to us.
- He's showing it to us.

938
00:31:38.209 --> 00:31:39.578
He said the letters are small.

939
00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:40.878
All right.

940
00:31:40.879 --> 00:31:41.978
He looks so sad.

941
00:31:41.979 --> 00:31:43.648
Is it getting harder?

942
00:31:43.649 --> 00:31:45.787
Yes. This time, it's going
to be a little harder.

943
00:31:45.788 --> 00:31:47.787
- Okay.
- Please be easy on us.

944
00:31:47.788 --> 00:31:48.818
Here we go.

945
00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:51.459
23 plus 45 is?

946
00:31:54.358 --> 00:31:55.389
Time over.
- 68.

947
00:31:55.598 --> 00:31:56.898
- Time over.
- You're out.

948
00:31:56.899 --> 00:31:58.398
You're out.

949
00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:01.199
It was too late.
- 23 plus 45 is?

950
00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:04.898
- 68.
- Correct.

951
00:32:04.899 --> 00:32:05.969
(He's quite smart.)

952
00:32:06.709 --> 00:32:08.269
(See? I entered an arithmetic contest.)

953
00:32:08.469 --> 00:32:11.139
32 plus 51 is?

954
00:32:12.209 --> 00:32:13.547
32... What?

955
00:32:13.548 --> 00:32:15.678
- Out.
- You're out.

956
00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:17.548
(They couldn't say a word.)

957
00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:20.588
It's difficult.
- 32 plus 51 is?

958
00:32:21.219 --> 00:32:22.557
84.

959
00:32:22.558 --> 00:32:24.087
- Wrong.
- It's 3, not 4.

960
00:32:24.088 --> 00:32:26.429
You're out.
- 32 plus 51 is?

961
00:32:26.659 --> 00:32:28.388
- 83.
- Correct.

962
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:29.398
Okay.

963
00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:31.399
19 plus 67 is?

964
00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:34.229
88.

965
00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:35.369
Wrong.

966
00:32:35.899 --> 00:32:38.568
- Who are the losers?
- Wait a minute.

967
00:32:38.739 --> 00:32:40.537
Many teams have failed just now, right?

968
00:32:40.538 --> 00:32:42.107
They all failed at the same time.

969
00:32:42.108 --> 00:32:44.077
I can't hear what they're saying.

970
00:32:44.078 --> 00:32:46.179
Those who will sleep indoors, come out.

971
00:32:46.278 --> 00:32:50.077
Whichever team answers
the question first wins.

972
00:32:50.078 --> 00:32:51.878
- The one who says...
- Whoever says it first.

973
00:32:51.879 --> 00:32:53.988
The answer first will sleep indoors. I see.

974
00:32:53.989 --> 00:32:55.287
Good.

975
00:32:55.288 --> 00:32:57.918
You focus on the last number.
I'll on the first.

976
00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:59.557
- Then I can't add them.
- Right.

977
00:32:59.558 --> 00:33:00.828
Right, you need to add them.

978
00:33:01.088 --> 00:33:03.429
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

979
00:33:03.798 --> 00:33:05.469
- Let me start.
- Okay.

980
00:33:05.869 --> 00:33:09.298
Can you do it?
- 278 plus 19 is?

981
00:33:10.338 --> 00:33:12.169
292.

982
00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:16.378
290... Was it 78?

983
00:33:16.379 --> 00:33:17.777
295.

984
00:33:17.778 --> 00:33:19.179
Wrong.
- 293.

985
00:33:19.308 --> 00:33:20.949
I know. 296.

986
00:33:21.449 --> 00:33:23.278
Let me give you another one.

987
00:33:23.449 --> 00:33:25.347
478 plus 42 equals?

988
00:33:25.348 --> 00:33:28.087
- Could you say it again?
- 478 plus 42 equals?

989
00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:29.458
Hang on a second.

990
00:33:29.459 --> 00:33:30.719
500.

991
00:33:30.818 --> 00:33:32.788
510...

992
00:33:32.959 --> 00:33:34.787
500.
- 510...

993
00:33:34.788 --> 00:33:36.228
510...
- 512.

994
00:33:36.229 --> 00:33:37.658
500.
- 510...

995
00:33:37.659 --> 00:33:38.968
510. 510.

996
00:33:38.969 --> 00:33:39.997
Wrong.

997
00:33:39.998 --> 00:33:41.468
- 510...
- Let's do it again.

998
00:33:41.469 --> 00:33:43.067
- Give us another one.
- Let's start over.

999
00:33:43.068 --> 00:33:44.767
Give us another one.
- 520.

1000
00:33:44.768 --> 00:33:47.668
- It's 521.
- Next question.

1001
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:49.438
Give us another question.

1002
00:33:49.439 --> 00:33:51.378
Another question.
- 520!

1003
00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:52.547
Let's start over.

1004
00:33:52.548 --> 00:33:53.548
Sir!

1005
00:33:54.379 --> 00:33:56.518
- What are you doing?
- Sir.

1006
00:33:56.949 --> 00:33:59.388
Sir, give us another question.

1007
00:33:59.389 --> 00:34:00.787
Give us another question.

1008
00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:02.989
- The time was over.
- Okay.

1009
00:34:03.288 --> 00:34:05.528
Be quiet.
- 453 plus 24 equals?

1010
00:34:06.558 --> 00:34:08.357
- 492!
- Incorrect.

1011
00:34:08.358 --> 00:34:10.227
Well...
- 400...

1012
00:34:10.228 --> 00:34:11.658
It's 470 and something.

1013
00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:13.397
- 475.
- Wrong.

1014
00:34:13.398 --> 00:34:14.968
477.
- 476.

1015
00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.738
478.
- 470...

1016
00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:17.768
477.
- 475.

1017
00:34:17.769 --> 00:34:18.809
476.

1018
00:34:19.269 --> 00:34:20.968
477!
- 8!

1019
00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.377
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

1020
00:34:23.378 --> 00:34:26.179
(It's become a mess again.)

1021
00:34:26.508 --> 00:34:29.348
- What are you doing?
- Is this an auction?

1022
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:30.817
Is this an auction?

1023
00:34:30.818 --> 00:34:32.788
- Is this an auction?
- Are you at an auction?

1024
00:34:32.789 --> 00:34:33.849
It looks like an auction.

1025
00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:36.119
This is not an auction.

1026
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:37.958
I asked if this was an auction.

1027
00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:40.258
- We already told you.
- What?

1028
00:34:41.088 --> 00:34:44.358
(If one of them says the
wrong answer, they fail.)

1029
00:34:45.398 --> 00:34:47.869
Excuse me. You'd better
know the exact rules.

1030
00:34:48.329 --> 00:34:49.868
- Keep the rule in mind.
- Let's start over.

1031
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:51.567
- Think before you say.
- Let's start over.

1032
00:34:51.568 --> 00:34:52.568
This is really hard.

1033
00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:53.739
My gosh.

1034
00:34:53.938 --> 00:34:55.207
It's hard to add numbers with three digits.

1035
00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:57.007
You need to have good hearing for this.

1036
00:34:57.008 --> 00:34:58.409
Jong Min is so smart.

1037
00:34:58.539 --> 00:35:01.309
Jong Min will be so sad if he loses.

1038
00:35:02.648 --> 00:35:06.888
(Jong Min has been saying
the correct answers.)

1039
00:35:06.889 --> 00:35:08.988
(But Ha Ra has been saying
the wrong answers.)

1040
00:35:08.989 --> 00:35:11.688
(Could he sleep indoors tonight?)

1041
00:35:12.688 --> 00:35:15.499
(From now on, whoever says
the answer first wins.)

1042
00:35:15.628 --> 00:35:17.499
189 plus 56 equals?

1043
00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:20.469
It equals 244.

1044
00:35:20.499 --> 00:35:22.398
Wrong.
- 245.

1045
00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:23.769
- Correct!
- Yes!

1046
00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:26.207
We did it!

1047
00:35:26.208 --> 00:35:28.048
(Defconn and Shin Young
win "The Gyeong Ree".)

1048
00:35:28.168 --> 00:35:29.309
Yes!

1049
00:35:29.809 --> 00:35:30.809
Awesome.

1050
00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:34.007
(The winner's ceremony)

1051
00:35:34.008 --> 00:35:35.048
Come on!

1052
00:35:35.179 --> 00:35:37.119
(Her feet are as nimble
as a soccer player.)

1053
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:38.719
(Laughing)

1054
00:35:39.489 --> 00:35:41.849
(They mess with Jong Min.)

1055
00:35:42.019 --> 00:35:43.159
You were good.

1056
00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:46.028
They have a good teamwork.

1057
00:35:46.628 --> 00:35:48.758
- Good job.
- It was close.

1058
00:35:50.758 --> 00:35:52.869
- That was really close.
- It was funny.

1059
00:35:52.929 --> 00:35:54.128
We beat them by one point.

1060
00:35:54.329 --> 00:35:56.437
You guys were so funny.

1061
00:35:56.438 --> 00:35:57.468
Ha Ra.

1062
00:35:57.469 --> 00:36:01.239
Ha Ra, why did you keep saying 476?
It's 477.

1063
00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:03.739
Second place is meaningless.

1064
00:36:04.378 --> 00:36:06.547
- Good job.
- All right.

1065
00:36:06.548 --> 00:36:09.748
The winners of "The Gyeong Ree" are...

1066
00:36:09.749 --> 00:36:13.989
Defconn and Shin Young.

1067
00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:16.289
Give them a big hand.

1068
00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:17.958
"Today Is Girls' Day..."

1069
00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:19.488
("Today is Girls' Day.")

1070
00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:21.488
- I'm sorry.
- What did you say?

1071
00:36:21.489 --> 00:36:23.127
Watch your pronunciation.

1072
00:36:23.128 --> 00:36:25.099
I'm really sorry.
- "Girls' Day"?

1073
00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:26.797
"Today Is Girl's Day,."

1074
00:36:26.798 --> 00:36:28.798
"Save Gyeong Ree and Narsha."

1075
00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:31.639
(And I)

1076
00:36:31.838 --> 00:36:34.638
The second game is "Fly Narsha".

1077
00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:36.239
Yes!

1078
00:36:37.108 --> 00:36:39.179
(Each team member plays one after another.)

1079
00:36:40.749 --> 00:36:43.178
(They should run toward and
blow out the candles.)

1080
00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:45.349
(The number of blown out
candles will be counted.)

1081
00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:49.758
(The team that blows the
most candles out wins.)

1082
00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:53.758
You can do whatever you want in this area.

1083
00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:55.288
Can one jump and flip?

1084
00:36:55.289 --> 00:36:56.957
- What do you mean by...
- A triple axel.

1085
00:36:56.958 --> 00:36:59.228
- Can I do a triple axel?
- Jump and...

1086
00:36:59.398 --> 00:37:01.098
Let's go. Who's first?

1087
00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:02.099
Let's give Jong Min a chance.

1088
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.297
Let me tell you who starts...

1089
00:37:04.298 --> 00:37:07.008
the game, "Fly Narsha".
It's Joon Ho's team.

1090
00:37:07.668 --> 00:37:08.707
Don't you have to respect elderly?

1091
00:37:08.708 --> 00:37:10.578
- There's no such a rule.
- You start.

1092
00:37:10.579 --> 00:37:11.878
Sir, you start.

1093
00:37:12.008 --> 00:37:13.878
- I start?
- Yes, you can start.

1094
00:37:13.949 --> 00:37:15.208
Come and help me.

1095
00:37:16.278 --> 00:37:18.849
- I don't feel well.
- Where's his top?

1096
00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:21.119
(Come on.)

1097
00:37:21.188 --> 00:37:23.488
You said you don't feel any pain.

1098
00:37:23.489 --> 00:37:24.489
(You don't feel pain?)

1099
00:37:24.588 --> 00:37:27.457
- Good. Joon Ho and...
- Joon Ho. Don't mess up.

1100
00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:29.458
- You shouldn't mess up.
- Narsha will start.

1101
00:37:29.929 --> 00:37:32.498
Don't try to be funny. We must not mess up.

1102
00:37:32.499 --> 00:37:34.528
Don't try to be funny. Be serious.

1103
00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:38.168
He's not trying anything. That's how he is.

1104
00:37:38.269 --> 00:37:39.768
- I'm nervous.
- I think he'll blow five.

1105
00:37:39.769 --> 00:37:41.268
Joon Ho. Watch out for your lung.

1106
00:37:41.269 --> 00:37:43.107
- Take off your hat.
- Watch your tailbone.

1107
00:37:43.108 --> 00:37:44.437
Take off your glasses.

1108
00:37:44.438 --> 00:37:46.278
Joon Ho, tailbone.

1109
00:37:46.478 --> 00:37:47.707
Here we go.

1110
00:37:47.708 --> 00:37:49.548
- Go for it.
- I think he'll do good.

1111
00:37:49.978 --> 00:37:50.978
Watch your tailbone.

1112
00:37:52.449 --> 00:37:53.548
Be careful.

1113
00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:02.027
(Fly like a butterfly.)

1114
00:38:02.028 --> 00:38:03.559
(Sting like a bee.)

1115
00:38:04.258 --> 00:38:06.369
(The result is?)

1116
00:38:07.499 --> 00:38:09.639
14.

1117
00:38:09.668 --> 00:38:11.797
You blew out a lot.
- 14.

1118
00:38:11.798 --> 00:38:14.208
I knew you'd do better
once the game starts.

1119
00:38:14.269 --> 00:38:15.678
- We should use our body.
- It should be quick.

1120
00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:16.938
Yes, it should be quick.

1121
00:38:17.438 --> 00:38:19.948
Narsha used to be good at games.

1122
00:38:19.949 --> 00:38:22.178
She looks good in hanbok.

1123
00:38:22.179 --> 00:38:23.179
She's good at this kind of game.

1124
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.219
(Focused)

1125
00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:26.449
- Let me start.
- Go for it.

1126
00:38:26.489 --> 00:38:29.118
Fly, Narsha!

1127
00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:30.559
Let's go!

1128
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:35.599
(The candles in the middle are all off.)

1129
00:38:38.798 --> 00:38:40.168
- They all revived.
- How many?

1130
00:38:40.969 --> 00:38:42.269
- They all revived.
- How many?

1131
00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:45.808
Why did they revive?

1132
00:38:45.809 --> 00:38:47.568
8.
- 8.

1133
00:38:48.068 --> 00:38:50.409
They blew 22 candles out.
They're currently leading.

1134
00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:52.208
22 is not bad.

1135
00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:54.219
I should have blown more than 10 candles.

1136
00:38:54.949 --> 00:38:59.489
Next up is Dong Gu. He's
very horrible with games.

1137
00:38:59.818 --> 00:39:01.349
Dong Gu is a clumsy man.

1138
00:39:02.489 --> 00:39:03.889
- Let me start.
- Let's go.

1139
00:39:04.758 --> 00:39:05.758
You can do it!

1140
00:39:07.028 --> 00:39:09.027
I wonder how many candles he will blow out?

1141
00:39:09.028 --> 00:39:10.727
He's so serious.

1142
00:39:10.728 --> 00:39:11.828
One should be quick.

1143
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:13.498
If he stumbles, he will mess up.

1144
00:39:13.499 --> 00:39:16.398
Let's go. Jump in!

1145
00:39:16.999 --> 00:39:18.738
That's not how you do it.

1146
00:39:18.739 --> 00:39:21.139
That's not the way you jump.

1147
00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:26.909
- Jump in!
- It's not how you do it.

1148
00:39:27.449 --> 00:39:28.569
(The candles are lit again.)

1149
00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:30.719
Oh no.

1150
00:39:30.918 --> 00:39:32.388
1, 2, - 1, 2,

1151
00:39:32.389 --> 00:39:35.018
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1152
00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:36.418
- It's 7.
- He put out 7 candles.

1153
00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:38.119
Now you see why he's Dumb Gu, right?

1154
00:39:39.528 --> 00:39:41.527
He shouldn't have been so serious.

1155
00:39:41.528 --> 00:39:43.198
- Why is he so serious?
- He's always serious.

1156
00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:45.398
He even put out less candles than me.

1157
00:39:46.269 --> 00:39:48.398
See? He's Dumb Gu.

1158
00:39:49.769 --> 00:39:52.638
- All right.
- Yu Ra of Girl's Day.

1159
00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:53.937
Next up is Yu Ra of Girl's Day.

1160
00:39:53.938 --> 00:39:56.238
Yu Ra is the tallest member of Girl's Day.

1161
00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:57.638
She even has her legs insured.

1162
00:39:57.639 --> 00:39:58.808
Insurance on her legs?

1163
00:39:58.809 --> 00:40:00.147
- Am I right?
- Yes.

1164
00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:01.377
I pay 30 dollars per
month for the insurance.

1165
00:40:01.378 --> 00:40:03.178
- Insurance on her legs?
- 30 dollars a month.

1166
00:40:03.179 --> 00:40:05.488
If she scratches her leg,
she'll get 30,000 dollars.

1167
00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:06.547
Yu Ra!

1168
00:40:06.548 --> 00:40:08.288
After Kim Tae Hee...

1169
00:40:08.289 --> 00:40:09.558
(She's wasting her precious legs.)

1170
00:40:09.559 --> 00:40:11.757
- She looks motivated.
- Look. She's tough.

1171
00:40:11.758 --> 00:40:13.488
- Go easy on it.
- She's ready.

1172
00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:15.188
Look at her face.

1173
00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:16.457
She's scary.

1174
00:40:16.458 --> 00:40:18.727
- It's terrifying.
- She's so serious.

1175
00:40:18.728 --> 00:40:19.829
She looks like a bull.

1176
00:40:20.128 --> 00:40:21.328
She looks like a bull.

1177
00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:22.738
There comes a bull.

1178
00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:24.238
(What's so important
about sleeping indoors?)

1179
00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:25.708
- Here I come!
- All right.

1180
00:40:25.869 --> 00:40:26.909
Action!

1181
00:40:27.168 --> 00:40:29.108
- She's running.
- Go!

1182
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:30.338
Oh no!

1183
00:40:31.978 --> 00:40:34.208
(Yu Ra almost flew.)

1184
00:40:35.008 --> 00:40:36.948
Yu Ra is supporting Dong Gu.

1185
00:40:36.949 --> 00:40:38.988
All right.
- 1, 2, 3, 4,

1186
00:40:38.989 --> 00:40:41.249
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, - 9, 10, 11,

1187
00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:42.957
11, - 11.

1188
00:40:42.958 --> 00:40:44.688
- And 12!
- It's 12.

1189
00:40:44.789 --> 00:40:47.187
They put out 19 candles in total.

1190
00:40:47.188 --> 00:40:48.628
Their record is 19.

1191
00:40:49.358 --> 00:40:51.297
We're still in first place.

1192
00:40:51.298 --> 00:40:53.498
- You almost flew.
- I know.

1193
00:40:53.499 --> 00:40:55.127
Did I look like a flying squirrel, Defconn?

1194
00:40:55.128 --> 00:40:57.567
No, you are too big.

1195
00:40:57.568 --> 00:40:58.639
(Laughing)

1196
00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:00.667
- A big squirrel.
- It's Tae Hyun.

1197
00:41:00.668 --> 00:41:02.277
- It's Tae Hyun's turn.
- Tae Hyun.

1198
00:41:02.278 --> 00:41:03.738
Tae Hyun is a little slow.

1199
00:41:03.739 --> 00:41:04.877
- Really?
- Yes.

1200
00:41:04.878 --> 00:41:06.547
And he slept outdoors most of the time.

1201
00:41:06.548 --> 00:41:09.018
- That's Tae Hyun.
- He mostly sleeps out.

1202
00:41:09.019 --> 00:41:10.419
He's most likely to sleep outdoors.

1203
00:41:10.818 --> 00:41:12.988
(He rehearses it.)

1204
00:41:12.989 --> 00:41:14.019
That wasn't so bad.

1205
00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:17.088
(Shouting)

1206
00:41:17.458 --> 00:41:20.389
Look. Gyeong Ree is so competitive now.

1207
00:41:20.929 --> 00:41:23.297
- She let herself down.
- She's carried away.

1208
00:41:23.298 --> 00:41:24.298
Here I go.

1209
00:41:24.299 --> 00:41:26.829
(Would the practice pay off?)

1210
00:41:29.798 --> 00:41:31.268
- What was that?
- Goodbye.

1211
00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:33.238
- Oh no.
- Look at that.

1212
00:41:33.239 --> 00:41:35.138
- It turns out I was good.
- Let me count.

1213
00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:36.437
1, 2, 3, 4...

1214
00:41:36.438 --> 00:41:37.507
(Excited)

1215
00:41:37.508 --> 00:41:38.508
5, 6...
- 5, 6...

1216
00:41:38.509 --> 00:41:39.548
5, 6...
- 5, 6...

1217
00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:41.178
7, 8, and 9.
- 7, 8, and 9.

1218
00:41:41.179 --> 00:41:42.518
It's 9.
- 9 candles.

1219
00:41:42.519 --> 00:41:43.849
- Is it 7?
- It's 9.

1220
00:41:44.478 --> 00:41:45.748
That's not that bad.

1221
00:41:45.749 --> 00:41:47.417
- I thought it'd be more.
- Not bad.

1222
00:41:47.418 --> 00:41:48.989
I'll put out all the candles.

1223
00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:51.758
The members of "Invincible
Youth" are so competitive.

1224
00:41:53.628 --> 00:41:55.758
- I'm ready.
- Will she save Tae Hyun?

1225
00:41:56.458 --> 00:41:57.728
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

1226
00:41:58.099 --> 00:41:59.099
- Was it good?
- Excellent.

1227
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.667
- That looks good.
- That was nice.

1228
00:42:00.668 --> 00:42:02.238
- She's good.
- We'll see.

1229
00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:03.837
- I'm coming.
- Start.

1230
00:42:03.838 --> 00:42:06.269
Isn't it too far? We should make it closer.

1231
00:42:09.978 --> 00:42:10.978
(Laughing)

1232
00:42:12.208 --> 00:42:13.309
She did it with her voice.

1233
00:42:13.749 --> 00:42:14.777
She did it with her voice.

1234
00:42:14.778 --> 00:42:17.348
The candles went out as the floor vibrated.

1235
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:18.888
(Giggling)

1236
00:42:18.889 --> 00:42:19.949
How many candles?

1237
00:42:23.088 --> 00:42:25.559
(It's like the roaring of a lion.)

1238
00:42:25.929 --> 00:42:28.488
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1239
00:42:28.489 --> 00:42:30.027
- It's only 5.
- She put out 5 candles.

1240
00:42:30.028 --> 00:42:32.928
- Their record is 14.
- What was that?

1241
00:42:32.929 --> 00:42:34.067
(They're still in first place.)

1242
00:42:34.068 --> 00:42:36.297
- It's almost over.
- It's almost guaranteed.

1243
00:42:36.298 --> 00:42:38.638
- But they are strong.
- Look at them.

1244
00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:40.969
Ha Ra is tying her hair back.

1245
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:43.437
Jong Min used to be a gymnast.

1246
00:42:43.438 --> 00:42:45.179
But he doesn't know much about it.

1247
00:42:47.409 --> 00:42:48.877
- Just do it.
- Are you ready?

1248
00:42:48.878 --> 00:42:50.147
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1249
00:42:50.148 --> 00:42:51.148
He's ready.

1250
00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:53.719
It's not as easy as you think.

1251
00:42:53.789 --> 00:42:56.688
(What?)

1252
00:42:57.958 --> 00:42:59.329
(The end)

1253
00:42:59.789 --> 00:43:00.988
What was that?

1254
00:43:00.989 --> 00:43:02.727
- He's so...
- That was lame.

1255
00:43:02.728 --> 00:43:05.227
- That was ridiculous.
- I knew it.

1256
00:43:05.228 --> 00:43:06.228
- I know you're good.
- What was that?

1257
00:43:06.229 --> 00:43:08.027
Did he do that on purpose?

1258
00:43:08.028 --> 00:43:09.538
Please give him one more chance.

1259
00:43:09.539 --> 00:43:11.567
- One more chance.
- No way.

1260
00:43:11.568 --> 00:43:12.607
That's impossible.

1261
00:43:12.608 --> 00:43:13.808
- Please.
- Just one more chance.

1262
00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:16.408
All right. Let me be clear about this.

1263
00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:19.277
I saw him hesitate when he did a run-up.

1264
00:43:19.278 --> 00:43:21.708
"Should I win or make people laugh?"

1265
00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:24.948
He looked very weird when he jumped.

1266
00:43:24.949 --> 00:43:27.348
All right. Save Kim Jong Min.

1267
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:28.349
He's strict.

1268
00:43:28.758 --> 00:43:30.558
She has heavy pressure on her shoulders.

1269
00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:32.018
She has to put out 23 candles.

1270
00:43:32.019 --> 00:43:33.659
23 candles? That's easy.

1271
00:43:33.889 --> 00:43:35.558
(Frustrated)

1272
00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:36.599
Ha Ra.

1273
00:43:37.429 --> 00:43:38.458
Ha Ra.

1274
00:43:39.228 --> 00:43:41.468
- She kicked him.
- Gosh.

1275
00:43:41.469 --> 00:43:43.268
I understand how she feels.

1276
00:43:43.269 --> 00:43:44.837
- I'm ready.
- Good luck.

1277
00:43:44.838 --> 00:43:47.508
- You'll see.
- She'll fly.

1278
00:43:48.838 --> 00:43:50.538
(Surprised)

1279
00:43:50.539 --> 00:43:51.608
Look at that.

1280
00:43:51.708 --> 00:43:52.949
(Running fast)

1281
00:43:56.878 --> 00:43:57.978
What just happened?

1282
00:43:59.849 --> 00:44:00.949
What just happened?

1283
00:44:02.958 --> 00:44:04.158
What just happened?

1284
00:44:04.159 --> 00:44:06.429
If I could rate her jump, I'd give her 10.

1285
00:44:07.758 --> 00:44:13.028
(A long run-up and strong landing)

1286
00:44:13.568 --> 00:44:15.999
(Jump score 10)

1287
00:44:16.838 --> 00:44:18.837
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

1288
00:44:18.838 --> 00:44:21.308
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, - 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

1289
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:22.709
- And 13.
- She put out 13 candles.

1290
00:44:23.739 --> 00:44:25.749
(It means Jong Min put out zero candles.)

1291
00:44:26.508 --> 00:44:27.988
- She's amazing.
- Their score is 13.

1292
00:44:28.108 --> 00:44:30.148
She's in first place in the women's league.

1293
00:44:30.978 --> 00:44:33.318
Respect. I respect her.

1294
00:44:34.418 --> 00:44:37.158
If we beat Joon Young's team,

1295
00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:38.789
we'll sleep indoors.

1296
00:44:39.659 --> 00:44:43.297
If Joon Young fails to put
out 10 candles, we'll win.

1297
00:44:43.298 --> 00:44:44.458
I'll never give up.

1298
00:44:45.028 --> 00:44:47.768
(He looks like an anchovy
flapping in the wind.)

1299
00:44:47.769 --> 00:44:48.769
Good luck.

1300
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.499
You should do that. That's right.

1301
00:44:51.838 --> 00:44:54.409
All right. They're the last team.

1302
00:44:54.639 --> 00:44:55.679
Okay.

1303
00:44:56.179 --> 00:44:57.239
He's ready.

1304
00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:00.507
- He's ready.
- He's good at this.

1305
00:45:00.508 --> 00:45:02.877
- How did you jump here?
- If you put out...

1306
00:45:02.878 --> 00:45:05.348
That's right. Actually he's quite timid.

1307
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:06.618
- He's right.
- He's a coward.

1308
00:45:06.619 --> 00:45:08.857
He wasn't good at the baseball game.

1309
00:45:08.858 --> 00:45:09.978
- Really?
- I remember that.

1310
00:45:10.719 --> 00:45:13.128
(Meet the Baseball Fans Special)

1311
00:45:14.958 --> 00:45:19.599
(He was afraid to jump, so he just slid.)

1312
00:45:19.999 --> 00:45:21.027
I'm sorry.

1313
00:45:21.028 --> 00:45:23.938
(It's proven that he's a coward.)

1314
00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:25.468
- I'm ready.
- He's ready.

1315
00:45:25.469 --> 00:45:27.007
(Would he be different today?)

1316
00:45:27.008 --> 00:45:29.208
- He looks good.
- He needs 15 candles.

1317
00:45:31.838 --> 00:45:33.608
(Shocked)

1318
00:45:35.548 --> 00:45:36.849
(Clapping like a seal)

1319
00:45:37.648 --> 00:45:40.587
(What just happened?)

1320
00:45:40.588 --> 00:45:42.818
- 1, 2, 3...
- He needs 15 candles.

1321
00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:46.489
(It's the best.)

1322
00:45:52.028 --> 00:45:55.469
(The coward anchovy has
become a flying fish.)

1323
00:45:56.199 --> 00:45:59.969
(Fly, Joon Young.)

1324
00:46:02.378 --> 00:46:04.938
(He brags about it without looking back.)

1325
00:46:05.878 --> 00:46:08.607
(I'm the genius.)

1326
00:46:08.608 --> 00:46:10.148
1, 2, 3, 4...

1327
00:46:11.179 --> 00:46:13.047
(This isn't good.)

1328
00:46:13.048 --> 00:46:14.988
17, 18, 19, 20,

1329
00:46:14.989 --> 00:46:16.417
21, 22, 23, and 24.

1330
00:46:16.418 --> 00:46:18.758
- He put out 24 candles.
- He's in 1st place.

1331
00:46:18.958 --> 00:46:21.828
They get to sleep indoors.

1332
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:24.458
Joon Young and Chae Yeon.

1333
00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:28.398
(They are in second place
which is useless.)

1334
00:46:29.499 --> 00:46:31.039
(Devastated)

1335
00:46:31.469 --> 00:46:32.568
Hey, Joon Young.

1336
00:46:32.938 --> 00:46:34.808
You should've gone first.

1337
00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:36.477
Joon Young gave me hope.

1338
00:46:36.478 --> 00:46:38.778
Joon Young flapped the skirt like this.

1339
00:46:38.978 --> 00:46:41.507
Chae Yeon's giving a celebration ritual.

1340
00:46:41.508 --> 00:46:43.108
- A celebration ritual.
- Let's do that.

1341
00:46:43.449 --> 00:46:46.188
- Joon Young, help her.
- Go easy on it.

1342
00:46:47.088 --> 00:46:48.618
- All right.
- This is fun.

1343
00:46:48.619 --> 00:46:50.719
It's a celebration ritual
for their victory.

1344
00:46:50.958 --> 00:46:51.989
Chae Yeon.

1345
00:46:52.858 --> 00:46:54.388
- Let's do this.
- I'm ready.

1346
00:46:54.389 --> 00:46:56.828
- Okay. She's ready.
- What?

1347
00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:58.828
She already started running.

1348
00:46:58.829 --> 00:47:00.268
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

1349
00:47:00.269 --> 00:47:02.598
(Running lightly)

1350
00:47:02.599 --> 00:47:03.739
(Flopping)

1351
00:47:08.778 --> 00:47:10.978
(What did I just do?)

1352
00:47:11.079 --> 00:47:12.147
What just happened?

1353
00:47:12.148 --> 00:47:13.777
How many is that?
- 1, 2, 3, 4,

1354
00:47:13.778 --> 00:47:15.877
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

1355
00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:18.147
- 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
- 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

1356
00:47:18.148 --> 00:47:19.248
She's in first place in the women's league.

1357
00:47:19.249 --> 00:47:20.288
(Chae Yeon is number one female player.)

1358
00:47:20.289 --> 00:47:22.757
- She's in first place.
- They're the winner.

1359
00:47:22.758 --> 00:47:23.989
- Hey.
- They win anyway.

1360
00:47:24.159 --> 00:47:26.889
They put out 38 candles in total.

1361
00:47:27.559 --> 00:47:29.058
All right. The winners...

1362
00:47:29.059 --> 00:47:31.599
of the second game, "Fly Narsha"...

1363
00:47:31.728 --> 00:47:33.198
are Joon Young and Chae Yeon.

1364
00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:35.119
(Joon Young and Chae Yeon
get to sleep indoors.)

1365
00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:38.768
- Congratulations.
- This is the last game.

1366
00:47:38.769 --> 00:47:41.567
All right. We have only one game left.

1367
00:47:41.568 --> 00:47:43.107
- Only one team left.
- Really?

1368
00:47:43.108 --> 00:47:46.278
Joon Young and I won.
What if Tae Hyun wins?

1369
00:47:46.608 --> 00:47:48.817
Each game...

1370
00:47:48.818 --> 00:47:51.418
Gosh, it's happening again? It's Neubdari.

1371
00:47:51.778 --> 00:47:54.318
Gosh, I'm sick of it now.

1372
00:47:54.489 --> 00:47:57.159
The third game is...

1373
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.757
"Save My Partner".

1374
00:47:59.758 --> 00:48:02.159
- Save my partner.
- Save Ha Ra.

1375
00:48:02.728 --> 00:48:05.158
(Sit face to face on a spinning pole.)

1376
00:48:05.159 --> 00:48:08.297
(Hit the opponent with
a pillow to fall off.)

1377
00:48:08.298 --> 00:48:11.469
(If all four fall off,
get back on quickly.)

1378
00:48:11.798 --> 00:48:14.039
Tae Hyun is good at this.
He's good at holding out.

1379
00:48:14.739 --> 00:48:17.878
We did it on a pole. Where is the pole?

1380
00:48:18.508 --> 00:48:20.478
I want you to stand up.

1381
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:23.018
That's... Are you storing energy?

1382
00:48:23.019 --> 00:48:24.777
- It's a performance.
- A performance?

1383
00:48:24.778 --> 00:48:26.118
All right. That's good.

1384
00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:27.159
Isn't it against the rule?

1385
00:48:27.749 --> 00:48:30.889
("Save My Partner")

1386
00:48:31.188 --> 00:48:33.658
Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree
versus Joon Ho and Narsha.

1387
00:48:33.659 --> 00:48:35.127
Who sits in the front?

1388
00:48:35.128 --> 00:48:36.957
- Girls sit in the front.
- Let's go one by one.

1389
00:48:36.958 --> 00:48:38.869
- Hold this.
- Excuse me. Lady first.

1390
00:48:40.028 --> 00:48:41.067
Hold the pole.

1391
00:48:41.068 --> 00:48:42.099
- I'm tired.
- Hold it.

1392
00:48:42.739 --> 00:48:44.539
- Well...
- Lady first. Narsha.

1393
00:48:44.938 --> 00:48:46.138
- All right.
- Good.

1394
00:48:46.139 --> 00:48:47.809
(Groaning)

1395
00:48:48.168 --> 00:48:49.808
Narsha, you can't do that.

1396
00:48:49.809 --> 00:48:52.107
- I'm sorry.
- We had an accident.

1397
00:48:52.108 --> 00:48:54.578
- It hurts.
- You can't go like that.

1398
00:48:54.579 --> 00:48:56.317
What should I do then?

1399
00:48:56.318 --> 00:48:58.078
You should put your leg up on it first.

1400
00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:00.118
- I see. Legs first.
- I'll hold you.

1401
00:49:00.119 --> 00:49:01.719
Joon Ho, hold her legs.

1402
00:49:02.418 --> 00:49:03.988
- That's good.
- All right.

1403
00:49:03.989 --> 00:49:05.658
You should hold her.

1404
00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:07.288
- She has long legs.
- Gosh.

1405
00:49:07.289 --> 00:49:09.328
It's not easy for her.

1406
00:49:09.329 --> 00:49:11.298
- It's not easy to get on.
- My legs hurt.

1407
00:49:11.628 --> 00:49:13.828
- Dong Gu, hold this.
- You're funny.

1408
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:15.028
Get on it now.

1409
00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:16.239
How can I get on it?

1410
00:49:16.438 --> 00:49:17.837
(Everyone is seated.)

1411
00:49:17.838 --> 00:49:19.607
- Where's the pillow?
- Careful.

1412
00:49:19.608 --> 00:49:20.868
Wait a minute.

1413
00:49:20.869 --> 00:49:21.908
Wait.

1414
00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:23.277
- No.
- Joon Ho.

1415
00:49:23.278 --> 00:49:24.937
There's a toilet in front of me.

1416
00:49:24.938 --> 00:49:26.348
- Joon Ho.
- He's a spy.

1417
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:27.507
When will we start?

1418
00:49:27.508 --> 00:49:30.148
Come on, Joon Ho. I'm getting tired.

1419
00:49:30.249 --> 00:49:31.618
Please end the game quickly.

1420
00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:33.749
I don't want to look at
his buttocks anymore.

1421
00:49:34.249 --> 00:49:35.618
My gosh.

1422
00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:37.357
I thought it was a pillow.

1423
00:49:37.358 --> 00:49:38.388
- It startled me.
- A pillow.

1424
00:49:38.389 --> 00:49:39.587
It's as plump as a pillow.

1425
00:49:39.588 --> 00:49:41.127
What is he doing?

1426
00:49:41.128 --> 00:49:42.158
Excuse me.

1427
00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:43.159
(Passing gas)

1428
00:49:45.028 --> 00:49:47.068
- No!
- Did he just fart?

1429
00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:48.598
What's the matter with you?

1430
00:49:48.599 --> 00:49:49.769
Why would you do that?

1431
00:49:50.068 --> 00:49:51.268
(He needs a good spanking.)

1432
00:49:51.269 --> 00:49:53.238
- My gosh.
- Seriously.

1433
00:49:53.239 --> 00:49:55.507
This game isn't good for my bowels.

1434
00:49:55.508 --> 00:49:57.139
Do a better job, please.

1435
00:49:57.338 --> 00:49:58.539
(That's enough.)

1436
00:49:58.878 --> 00:49:59.977
Ready.

1437
00:49:59.978 --> 00:50:01.849
- You need to move fast.
- We're doomed.

1438
00:50:02.048 --> 00:50:03.048
(Start)

1439
00:50:03.619 --> 00:50:04.917
- Is this good?
- Yes.

1440
00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:06.188
(Tae Hyun attacks first.)

1441
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:09.318
(Narsha counterattacks.)

1442
00:50:11.088 --> 00:50:12.658
(After exchanging a swing)

1443
00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:15.059
- There you go.
- Joon Ho, look.

1444
00:50:15.758 --> 00:50:16.998
(Meanwhile, Joon Ho...)

1445
00:50:16.999 --> 00:50:18.698
Move. Don't just watch them.

1446
00:50:18.699 --> 00:50:19.868
(just looks on as they fight.)

1447
00:50:19.869 --> 00:50:21.127
You're going to lose.

1448
00:50:21.128 --> 00:50:23.269
(It looked like he's finally active.)

1449
00:50:24.639 --> 00:50:25.668
He's hitting Narsha.

1450
00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:27.809
Why are you hitting Narsha?

1451
00:50:27.938 --> 00:50:29.039
Joon Ho!

1452
00:50:29.478 --> 00:50:30.707
It's 3 against 1.

1453
00:50:30.708 --> 00:50:32.007
(It's somehow 3 against 1.)

1454
00:50:32.008 --> 00:50:33.208
It's 3 against 1.

1455
00:50:33.778 --> 00:50:35.108
You can do it!

1456
00:50:35.878 --> 00:50:36.917
(Shaking)

1457
00:50:36.918 --> 00:50:37.918
He's shaking it.

1458
00:50:37.919 --> 00:50:40.519
(Falling together)

1459
00:50:41.489 --> 00:50:43.258
(He looks like a cicada.)

1460
00:50:45.628 --> 00:50:47.829
(The team who gets back on first wins.)

1461
00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:52.168
(Gyeong Ree gets on first.)

1462
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:55.098
(Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree win.)

1463
00:50:55.099 --> 00:50:57.139
- Tae Hyun!
- Tae Hyun's team wins!

1464
00:50:57.999 --> 00:50:59.409
It worked!

1465
00:51:01.108 --> 00:51:02.838
(I told you it's not my game.)

1466
00:51:04.008 --> 00:51:06.348
Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree
move on to the finals.

1467
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:07.509
(They move on to the finals.)

1468
00:51:08.949 --> 00:51:09.949
Next.

1469
00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:11.777
Gosh, this match will be fierce.

1470
00:51:11.778 --> 00:51:13.019
Ha Ra and Jong Min...

1471
00:51:13.519 --> 00:51:15.418
versus Dong Gu and Yu Ra.

1472
00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:17.389
- It's too high...
- Dong Gu and Yu Ra.

1473
00:51:17.489 --> 00:51:18.789
- To get on.
- Jong Min.

1474
00:51:18.858 --> 00:51:20.828
Gyeong Ree just has long legs.

1475
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:22.757
(Ha Ra gets on it at once.)

1476
00:51:22.758 --> 00:51:24.198
It's easier to get on the right side.

1477
00:51:24.199 --> 00:51:25.228
(Proud)

1478
00:51:26.168 --> 00:51:27.829
It's easier to get on the right side.

1479
00:51:30.898 --> 00:51:32.168
- Let's see.
- Oh, boy.

1480
00:51:32.909 --> 00:51:33.909
Get up there.

1481
00:51:35.208 --> 00:51:36.539
Get up there.

1482
00:51:36.878 --> 00:51:37.908
Get up there.

1483
00:51:37.909 --> 00:51:39.108
I'll help you.

1484
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:40.648
- Yu Ra.
- I'll help you.

1485
00:51:40.909 --> 00:51:42.377
- Get up there.
- Yu Ra.

1486
00:51:42.378 --> 00:51:43.448
It's okay.

1487
00:51:43.449 --> 00:51:44.917
- I'll try it from here.
- It's okay.

1488
00:51:44.918 --> 00:51:46.249
I'll try again from this side.

1489
00:51:47.949 --> 00:51:49.488
See? It's easier from this side.

1490
00:51:49.489 --> 00:51:51.587
(She finally gets on it.)

1491
00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:53.289
It's easier to get on it from this side.

1492
00:51:53.989 --> 00:51:55.288
Gosh, Dong Gu.

1493
00:51:55.289 --> 00:51:57.257
- That was quick.
- Mr. Gymnast.

1494
00:51:57.258 --> 00:52:01.269
(Will Jong Min succeed as well?)

1495
00:52:02.539 --> 00:52:04.369
(He wouldn't be Cheerful Fool if he did.)

1496
00:52:05.469 --> 00:52:06.469
(He's hilarious.)

1497
00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:09.337
It's because there is no take-off board.

1498
00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:10.778
I can do Thomas flairs.

1499
00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:12.449
Thomas what?

1500
00:52:12.909 --> 00:52:14.589
- Thomas flairs?
- It's a gymnastics term.

1501
00:52:15.208 --> 00:52:18.548
(This is what Thomas flairs looks like.)

1502
00:52:20.289 --> 00:52:23.357
(This is an original Cheerful Fool flair.)

1503
00:52:23.358 --> 00:52:24.489
That's enough.

1504
00:52:26.389 --> 00:52:27.457
This is the Thomas flair.

1505
00:52:27.458 --> 00:52:30.128
(It makes everyone laugh.)

1506
00:52:30.728 --> 00:52:32.268
That's an old move.

1507
00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:34.199
- This is Thomas flair.
- All right.

1508
00:52:34.769 --> 00:52:37.139
- Stop it.
- It's been so long.

1509
00:52:37.838 --> 00:52:39.369
They look nice.

1510
00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:41.469
It's like a group blind date.

1511
00:52:42.179 --> 00:52:44.508
Look at Dong Gu's rolled up sleeves.

1512
00:52:45.079 --> 00:52:46.179
Look at his muscles.

1513
00:52:46.278 --> 00:52:47.648
- His muscles.
- Look at Jong Min.

1514
00:52:47.909 --> 00:52:48.977
Ready.

1515
00:52:48.978 --> 00:52:50.349
This is going to be fun.

1516
00:52:51.048 --> 00:52:53.349
(They hold the bar so the
game won't end quickly.)

1517
00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:55.857
What are you doing?

1518
00:52:55.858 --> 00:52:58.058
- Ha Ra is doing good.
- She's steady.

1519
00:52:58.059 --> 00:52:59.429
Ha Ra and Dong Gu are good.

1520
00:52:59.688 --> 00:53:02.059
(He protects Yu Ra with his arm.)

1521
00:53:02.599 --> 00:53:03.999
He's a gentleman.

1522
00:53:04.398 --> 00:53:05.678
- All right.
- We'll let go now.

1523
00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:07.439
- We're letting it go.
- Here we go.

1524
00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:11.838
(They all fall down together.)

1525
00:53:12.969 --> 00:53:14.908
Hurry up.

1526
00:53:14.909 --> 00:53:15.978
It's rolling.

1527
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:19.008
What a mess.

1528
00:53:20.179 --> 00:53:21.978
- Hurry up.
- It's rolling.

1529
00:53:22.318 --> 00:53:24.278
(Rolling)

1530
00:53:25.278 --> 00:53:28.758
(They have no sense of balance.)

1531
00:53:30.059 --> 00:53:33.429
No one is up on the bar yet.

1532
00:53:33.559 --> 00:53:34.829
The game hasn't ended yet.

1533
00:53:34.858 --> 00:53:36.498
No pushing.

1534
00:53:36.499 --> 00:53:37.499
Oh, boy.

1535
00:53:38.728 --> 00:53:39.728
(Stumbling)

1536
00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:42.969
(They fall again.)

1537
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:43.999
The bar spins again.

1538
00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:48.068
(Chaotic)

1539
00:53:49.679 --> 00:53:50.938
(He claps with his feet.)

1540
00:53:51.938 --> 00:53:54.048
(While Ha Ra and Yu Ra are struggling, )

1541
00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:57.378
(Jong Min is doing the Thomas flair.)

1542
00:53:58.478 --> 00:54:02.159
(Yu Ra gets on the bar panting heavily.)

1543
00:54:03.258 --> 00:54:06.088
The winners are Yu Ra and Si Yoon!

1544
00:54:08.688 --> 00:54:10.628
- Hey.
- Jong Min did nothing.

1545
00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:14.868
It looks like Yu Ra had a UFC match.

1546
00:54:14.869 --> 00:54:16.937
Seriously. She was even...

1547
00:54:16.938 --> 00:54:17.938
(She was on fire.)

1548
00:54:18.298 --> 00:54:19.337
That was amazing.

1549
00:54:19.338 --> 00:54:20.837
(It was a good game.)

1550
00:54:20.838 --> 00:54:22.239
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1551
00:54:22.338 --> 00:54:26.309
(Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree
versus Dong Gu and Yu Ra)

1552
00:54:26.548 --> 00:54:27.579
Listen up, everyone.

1553
00:54:27.949 --> 00:54:29.817
- I think I can do this.
- I have an announcement.

1554
00:54:29.818 --> 00:54:32.118
- Go ahead.
- It's past 2am now.

1555
00:54:32.119 --> 00:54:33.348
- Oh, my.
- Really?

1556
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:38.188
Yes, it's too late to go
to Driver Lee's house.

1557
00:54:38.519 --> 00:54:39.929
(They have to sleep here.)

1558
00:54:41.188 --> 00:54:42.757
(Final match)

1559
00:54:42.758 --> 00:54:43.758
Ready.

1560
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:46.598
Tae Hyun. If you win,

1561
00:54:46.599 --> 00:54:48.269
our team wins again.

1562
00:54:48.628 --> 00:54:49.739
You have to beat them.

1563
00:54:50.168 --> 00:54:51.398
- You have to.
- I will.

1564
00:54:51.869 --> 00:54:53.337
- Let's get it.
- I'll beat them.

1565
00:54:53.338 --> 00:54:54.507
- Please do.
- I don't think he can.

1566
00:54:54.508 --> 00:54:56.107
- Let's go!
- Beat Tae Hyun.

1567
00:54:56.108 --> 00:54:57.239
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1568
00:54:58.409 --> 00:55:01.008
Beat them, Dong Gu. Work out your muscles.

1569
00:55:03.478 --> 00:55:05.348
She made two straight hits!

1570
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:06.719
- That's right.
- Goodness.

1571
00:55:08.548 --> 00:55:12.019
(Aren't you being too violent?)

1572
00:55:13.358 --> 00:55:15.929
Joon Young, let go. We're letting it go.

1573
00:55:16.898 --> 00:55:17.928
Joon Young, let go.

1574
00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:21.127
(Dong Gu hangs on to it.)

1575
00:55:21.128 --> 00:55:22.999
(Tae Hyun hangs on to it too.)

1576
00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:27.239
(Whoever gets back on it first will win.)

1577
00:55:28.139 --> 00:55:29.208
Gyeong Ree won.

1578
00:55:30.978 --> 00:55:32.079
Gyeong Ree won.

1579
00:55:34.278 --> 00:55:38.749
(Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree win by a hair.)

1580
00:55:40.449 --> 00:55:42.088
(Dong Gu and Yu Ra lose.)

1581
00:55:44.458 --> 00:55:45.627
That was close.

1582
00:55:45.628 --> 00:55:47.058
- We won!
- I'm sorry.

1583
00:55:47.059 --> 00:55:48.627
Tae Hyun!

1584
00:55:48.628 --> 00:55:50.028
You're the hope of middle-aged men.

1585
00:55:50.128 --> 00:55:51.128
I can't believe you won.

1586
00:55:51.728 --> 00:55:55.199
Now, we've decided who
will get to sleep indoors.

1587
00:55:55.798 --> 00:55:57.397
Today is Girl's Day.

1588
00:55:57.398 --> 00:55:58.768
Save Gyeong Ree and Narsha.

1589
00:55:58.769 --> 00:56:01.568
And I - It's painful.

1590
00:56:02.239 --> 00:56:03.639
Those who will sleep indoors are...

1591
00:56:03.838 --> 00:56:06.949
me, Defconn,

1592
00:56:07.378 --> 00:56:09.219
Tae Hyun, Gyeong Ree,

1593
00:56:09.579 --> 00:56:12.489
Joon Young, and Chae Yeon.

1594
00:56:13.719 --> 00:56:14.788
We're lucky.

1595
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:16.159
We're sleeping outdoors again.

1596
00:56:17.219 --> 00:56:20.058
Let me tell you what the
morning mission is.

1597
00:56:20.059 --> 00:56:21.459
Here is tomorrow's morning mission.

1598
00:56:21.559 --> 00:56:23.928
When you hear the morning song,

1599
00:56:23.929 --> 00:56:27.769
pick up a megaphone and
get on the bus together.

1600
00:56:27.929 --> 00:56:31.738
If you don't get on the
bus within five minutes,

1601
00:56:31.739 --> 00:56:32.739
you'll get a penalty.

1602
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:34.738
Great work, everyone.

1603
00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:35.938
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1604
00:56:36.478 --> 00:56:37.639
Good night.

1605
00:56:37.938 --> 00:56:39.749
- Good night.
- Good night.

1606
00:56:40.008 --> 00:56:41.949
And I - I'm sleeping outdoors.

1607
00:56:42.548 --> 00:56:46.489
Will always love you.

1608
00:56:48.019 --> 00:56:49.288
I should wash my face.

1609
00:56:49.289 --> 00:56:50.559
(Let's get washed up.)

1610
00:56:52.989 --> 00:56:54.328
My face is so red.

1611
00:56:54.329 --> 00:56:55.369
(At the end of a long day)

1612
00:56:57.429 --> 00:56:59.269
Are you taking the before and after shot?

1613
00:57:01.769 --> 00:57:03.009
This is my face without makeup.

1614
00:57:03.438 --> 00:57:04.739
I've removed the makeup.

1615
00:57:12.208 --> 00:57:15.148
(Shin Young is cleansing her face too.)

1616
00:57:18.449 --> 00:57:19.749
(Thorough)

1617
00:57:23.258 --> 00:57:26.627
(For their tired skin after a long day, )

1618
00:57:26.628 --> 00:57:28.999
(they remove all the makeup.)

1619
00:57:37.199 --> 00:57:38.909
(Get some rest now.)

1620
00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:43.478
(This feels good.)

1621
00:57:44.508 --> 00:57:46.778
(Feeling refreshed)

1622
00:57:47.249 --> 00:57:48.378
I look pure, right?

1623
00:57:56.818 --> 00:57:57.918
Will you brighten my face?

1624
00:57:58.989 --> 00:58:01.128
(If you want.)

1625
00:58:01.159 --> 00:58:02.228
Will you?

1626
00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:06.027
Gosh, I look so innocent.

1627
00:58:06.028 --> 00:58:07.028
(Absolutely innocent)

1628
00:58:07.028 --> 00:58:08.028
I look so innocent.

1629
00:58:10.469 --> 00:58:12.107
Thank you, everyone.

1630
00:58:12.108 --> 00:58:13.507
Thanks to you, I'm sleeping indoors.

1631
00:58:13.508 --> 00:58:15.508
- I owe it to you.
- Thank you.

1632
00:58:16.278 --> 00:58:17.578
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1633
00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:19.249
I'm sorry, but who are you?

1634
00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:22.178
- Good night.
- What? I still look good.

1635
00:58:22.179 --> 00:58:23.477
Good night, Shin Young.

1636
00:58:23.478 --> 00:58:26.187
- Good night.
- That's Jeong Ree.

1637
00:58:26.188 --> 00:58:28.018
Jeong Ree.
- "Jeong Ree"?

1638
00:58:28.019 --> 00:58:29.219
Or is it Chun Li?

1639
00:58:29.619 --> 00:58:30.917
(I will ignore him.)

1640
00:58:30.918 --> 00:58:32.658
Are those infrared cameras?

1641
00:58:32.659 --> 00:58:33.789
Yes, they are.

1642
00:58:34.059 --> 00:58:36.428
Is the screen fluorescent then?

1643
00:58:36.429 --> 00:58:38.498
- That's right.
- They're infrared.

1644
00:58:38.499 --> 00:58:39.528
(Amazed)

1645
00:58:41.199 --> 00:58:43.999
(For the fans of DIA)

1646
00:58:45.438 --> 00:58:47.508
(Good night, guys.)

1647
00:58:49.079 --> 00:58:52.108
- Look at that.
- It looks so cozy.

1648
00:58:53.679 --> 00:58:55.179
It looks so cozy.

1649
00:58:56.719 --> 00:58:58.179
It looks cozy.

1650
00:58:58.989 --> 00:59:00.417
- It's cold.
- Seriously.

1651
00:59:00.418 --> 00:59:01.647
Is this okay, Ha Ra?

1652
00:59:01.648 --> 00:59:03.318
- It's a bit cold.
- Is it cold?

1653
00:59:04.088 --> 00:59:05.758
Yu Ra, sleep here. You're tall.

1654
00:59:06.059 --> 00:59:07.358
Okay.

1655
00:59:07.728 --> 00:59:09.397
- It kind of feels good.
- I know, right?

1656
00:59:09.398 --> 00:59:10.498
It's like we're camping.

1657
00:59:10.499 --> 00:59:12.268
We won't get another chance to sleep...

1658
00:59:12.269 --> 00:59:14.068
- together like this.
- Right?

1659
00:59:14.929 --> 00:59:17.038
I actually lost the game on purpose.

1660
00:59:17.039 --> 00:59:18.068
Me too.

1661
00:59:19.369 --> 00:59:21.469
- Guys, is it okay?
- Yes.

1662
00:59:22.208 --> 00:59:23.208
It's good.

1663
00:59:23.679 --> 00:59:25.138
I told you it's nice.

1664
00:59:25.139 --> 00:59:27.179
- Hey, Ha Ra.
- Yes?

1665
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:29.619
- It's okay, right?
- I think it's good.

1666
00:59:30.249 --> 00:59:32.489
(If you're happy, then I'm happy.)

1667
00:59:32.989 --> 00:59:34.519
I'll wake you up tomorrow.

1668
00:59:35.289 --> 00:59:36.559
No, I'll wake you up.

1669
00:59:38.119 --> 00:59:39.258
(This is nice.)

1670
00:59:39.958 --> 00:59:42.028
Is this a midsummer night's dream?

1671
00:59:42.858 --> 00:59:44.599
(It's autumn, mister!)

1672
00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:48.599
Please play "A Midsummer Night's Dream".

1673
00:59:48.969 --> 00:59:50.568
(Crowing)

1674
00:59:52.239 --> 00:59:55.108
What was that? A rooster just crowed.

1675
00:59:55.878 --> 00:59:57.438
Excuse me. A rooster just crowed.

1676
00:59:57.508 --> 00:59:58.948
- What was that?
- A rooster?

1677
00:59:58.949 --> 00:59:59.978
A rooster cried.

1678
01:00:01.249 --> 01:00:02.377
Good night.

1679
01:00:02.378 --> 01:00:03.458
(Just go to sleep already.)

1680
01:00:04.679 --> 01:00:07.949
Remember the members. Walk flowery roads.

1681
01:00:08.148 --> 01:00:10.587
Remember, remember. Walk flowery roads.

1682
01:00:10.588 --> 01:00:12.587
It's "remember the members".

1683
01:00:12.588 --> 01:00:14.227
Members remember.

1684
01:00:14.228 --> 01:00:15.228
- Excuse me.
- What?

1685
01:00:15.229 --> 01:00:16.698
It's "remember the members".

1686
01:00:16.699 --> 01:00:18.058
Remember the members?

1687
01:00:18.059 --> 01:00:20.168
It's "remember the members".

1688
01:00:20.298 --> 01:00:21.969
Remember the members.

1689
01:00:22.269 --> 01:00:24.668
- Walk flowery roads.
- Walk flowery roads.

1690
01:00:25.068 --> 01:00:26.068
Good night.

1691
01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:31.639
(A tiring day goes by...)

1692
01:00:33.478 --> 01:00:36.147
(and fresh morning arrives...)

1693
01:00:36.148 --> 01:00:38.478
(in Hongcheon.)

1694
01:00:44.389 --> 01:00:46.159
(They're still sleeping.)

1695
01:00:47.588 --> 01:00:49.499
(Defconn)

1696
01:00:50.429 --> 01:00:51.599
(Gyeong Ree)

1697
01:00:52.269 --> 01:00:55.099
(Everyone is fast asleep.)

1698
01:00:59.269 --> 01:01:01.369
(People in the tents are
still sleeping too.)

1699
01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:04.578
(Guys, )

1700
01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:06.378
(it's time to get up.)

1701
01:01:14.389 --> 01:01:16.289
(Crowing)

1702
01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:20.989
(It's the morning song.)

1703
01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:25.059
(They get up right away.)

1704
01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:32.039
(Narsha wakes up instantly.)

1705
01:01:34.469 --> 01:01:36.838
(The morning song plays indoors too.)

1706
01:01:42.849 --> 01:01:44.079
(Wriggling)

1707
01:01:51.688 --> 01:01:54.159
(Dong Gu gets up first.)

1708
01:01:57.298 --> 01:01:58.398
(Yu Ra, are you up?)

1709
01:01:59.699 --> 01:02:01.128
(Yes, I'm up.)

1710
01:02:03.539 --> 01:02:04.568
Ha Ra!

1711
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.168
Koo Ha Ra!

1712
01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:10.477
(Ha Ra...)

1713
01:02:10.478 --> 01:02:13.377
(wants to...)

1714
01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:16.079
(sleep a little more.)

1715
01:02:18.648 --> 01:02:21.888
(Yes, Ha Ra. I understand.)

1716
01:02:21.889 --> 01:02:24.258
(I'll sleep a bit more too.)

1717
01:02:25.019 --> 01:02:26.058
Hey, Ha Ra.

1718
01:02:26.059 --> 01:02:27.128
(Is Joon Ho awake?)

1719
01:02:27.688 --> 01:02:29.128
Will you sleep more?

1720
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.658
- Joon Ho, wake up.
- Ha Ra.

1721
01:02:31.659 --> 01:02:32.668
Wake up.

1722
01:02:34.929 --> 01:02:36.169
- You're the only one.
- Ha Ra.

1723
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:37.269
Koo Ha Ra.

1724
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:38.310
(Ha Ra, let's get up now.)

1725
01:02:41.168 --> 01:02:42.679
(Gosh)

1726
01:02:43.508 --> 01:02:44.508
What's this?

1727
01:02:45.878 --> 01:02:46.878
Let's dance.

1728
01:02:46.879 --> 01:02:48.648
(Everyone who slept outdoors is up.)

1729
01:02:51.749 --> 01:02:53.849
(Shin Young wakes up.)

1730
01:02:57.019 --> 01:02:58.258
(All right.)

1731
01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:00.128
(Running)

1732
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:03.499
(Defconn, let's go.)

1733
01:03:15.068 --> 01:03:17.978
(A couple that's never pretentious)

1734
01:03:22.949 --> 01:03:24.029
Why aren't they getting up?

1735
01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:26.679
(Defconn and Shin Young are on the bus.)

1736
01:03:27.088 --> 01:03:28.208
Why are they taking so long?

1737
01:03:28.249 --> 01:03:30.187
(Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree are up.)

1738
01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:32.389
- Wait.
- What?

1739
01:03:40.329 --> 01:03:41.369
Where were you?

1740
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:42.869
Bathroom.

1741
01:03:43.239 --> 01:03:44.937
I couldn't find you.

1742
01:03:44.938 --> 01:03:47.068
- They're here.
- You're up.

1743
01:03:47.208 --> 01:03:49.438
Tae Hyun is quick.

1744
01:03:50.278 --> 01:03:51.977
Goodness.

1745
01:03:51.978 --> 01:03:55.007
The one who's sleeping is Chae Yeon, right?

1746
01:03:55.008 --> 01:03:56.048
Yes.

1747
01:03:57.048 --> 01:03:58.048
Well...

1748
01:03:58.278 --> 01:03:59.588
(Joon Young wakes up.)

1749
01:03:59.949 --> 01:04:01.048
Chae Yeon.

1750
01:04:01.318 --> 01:04:02.789
(Chae Yeon passed out.)

1751
01:04:03.758 --> 01:04:07.088
(Did they say a beauty was a sleepyhead?)

1752
01:04:08.858 --> 01:04:10.258
(Get up, Chae Yeon.)

1753
01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:14.898
(Power off)

1754
01:04:15.898 --> 01:04:17.368
The wake-up mission.

1755
01:04:17.369 --> 01:04:18.498
(What will be the hardest mission?)

1756
01:04:18.499 --> 01:04:20.969
I really can't get up in the morning.

1757
01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:22.409
My ears are shut.

1758
01:04:24.179 --> 01:04:26.208
(Her ears are shut.)

1759
01:04:26.849 --> 01:04:28.309
(She finally opens her eyes.)

1760
01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:31.478
(We aren't late yet.)

1761
01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:33.289
Go, go, go.

1762
01:04:36.418 --> 01:04:38.659
(Everyone passes the wake-up mission.)

1763
01:04:39.929 --> 01:04:40.989
Where are we going?

1764
01:04:44.099 --> 01:04:48.068
(A fresh autumn morning)

1765
01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:52.168
(It feels like your mind
is being cleansed.)

1766
01:04:56.139 --> 01:04:57.777
(This is...)

1767
01:04:57.778 --> 01:04:59.749
(Hoengseong Changbongcheon valley.)

1768
01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.148
(Everyone is gathered together again.)

1769
01:05:05.278 --> 01:05:06.648
(Spaced out)

1770
01:05:09.619 --> 01:05:11.388
Excuse me, MC.

1771
01:05:11.389 --> 01:05:13.388
She's not an MC. She's my sponsor.

1772
01:05:13.389 --> 01:05:14.429
She's Mother Kim.

1773
01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:16.159
Well,

1774
01:05:16.258 --> 01:05:20.028
we are at a valley near
Yuchi-ri, Hongcheon.

1775
01:05:20.699 --> 01:05:21.998
The villagers...

1776
01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:24.198
Is this a special episode
on four stages of life?

1777
01:05:24.199 --> 01:05:25.199
She's my sponsor.

1778
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.567
One Night Two Days is known for diving.

1779
01:05:27.568 --> 01:05:29.478
- That's right.
- Yes.

1780
01:05:29.878 --> 01:05:33.107
(Did you just say...)

1781
01:05:33.108 --> 01:05:36.019
(diving?)

1782
01:05:39.648 --> 01:05:40.888
(Here?)

1783
01:05:40.889 --> 01:05:44.358
Since the members of
"Invincible Youth" are...

1784
01:05:44.389 --> 01:05:46.857
- in One Night Two Days...
- Please shout it out.

1785
01:05:46.858 --> 01:05:50.127
They'll do the morning diving.

1786
01:05:50.128 --> 01:05:52.869
(Welcome to the morning diving!)

1787
01:05:55.469 --> 01:05:57.998
- We'll do this.
- We have to do this.

1788
01:05:57.999 --> 01:05:59.738
- Let's do this.
- It's...

1789
01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:00.739
I'm cold.

1790
01:06:01.969 --> 01:06:05.338
It's "2017 Open Your Heart".

1791
01:06:05.409 --> 01:06:07.977
("2017 Open Your Heart")

1792
01:06:07.978 --> 01:06:10.018
- They should try it.
- Open your heart.

1793
01:06:10.019 --> 01:06:11.218
Open it.

1794
01:06:11.219 --> 01:06:13.818
It's a nice day for a morning dive.

1795
01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:16.958
Only "Invincible Youth" members will do it.

1796
01:06:17.688 --> 01:06:19.489
(As long as it's not me!)

1797
01:06:19.858 --> 01:06:22.328
- Why?
- Only "Invincible Youth".

1798
01:06:22.329 --> 01:06:23.358
Why?

1799
01:06:23.429 --> 01:06:25.869
("2017 Open Your Heart")

1800
01:06:26.228 --> 01:06:27.398
Start!

1801
01:06:27.798 --> 01:06:31.499
(Each member will talk
about what they want.)

1802
01:06:32.108 --> 01:06:34.368
You're safe If you finish
between 50 to 60 seconds.

1803
01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:35.369
(They need to finish...)

1804
01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:36.970
(their speech between 50 to 60 seconds.)

1805
01:06:37.438 --> 01:06:39.398
(If they fail, they'll
dive with their partners.)

1806
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:42.578
Do we just dive?

1807
01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:45.048
- Yes, you dive in.
- Without talking?

1808
01:06:45.179 --> 01:06:46.219
Just dive in.

1809
01:06:46.389 --> 01:06:47.418
(Let's see.)

1810
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:49.889
This is it.

1811
01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:51.289
(If you fail, you dive.)

1812
01:06:52.889 --> 01:06:54.329
(Chae Yeon is up first.)

1813
01:06:55.159 --> 01:06:57.227
Chae Yeon, start.

1814
01:06:57.228 --> 01:06:59.599
Hello, I'm Chae Yeon of DIA.

1815
01:06:59.699 --> 01:07:03.968
Since yesterday, we all spent...

1816
01:07:03.969 --> 01:07:08.409
such a fun time together.

1817
01:07:08.778 --> 01:07:13.248
I was so happy that I got to travel...

1818
01:07:13.249 --> 01:07:15.108
and eat with people.

1819
01:07:15.148 --> 01:07:17.918
Thank you for allowing me
these wonderful memories.

1820
01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:21.388
I want to travel with my group members too.

1821
01:07:21.389 --> 01:07:23.989
Thank you so much for everything.

1822
01:07:24.219 --> 01:07:26.428
Thank you. The end!

1823
01:07:26.429 --> 01:07:27.857
You should thank more.

1824
01:07:27.858 --> 01:07:29.499
- What?
- You should thank more.

1825
01:07:29.528 --> 01:07:30.698
I think she got it.

1826
01:07:30.699 --> 01:07:31.897
What?

1827
01:07:31.898 --> 01:07:33.099
What's wrong? Let me see.

1828
01:07:33.128 --> 01:07:35.568
- She did really well.
- Last digits are 22.

1829
01:07:35.838 --> 01:07:37.739
Incredible.
- 22.

1830
01:07:37.769 --> 01:07:39.268
It's something seconds 22.

1831
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:42.038
She should've talked
more about the members.

1832
01:07:42.039 --> 01:07:44.178
- It's 39.22 seconds.
- That's short.

1833
01:07:44.179 --> 01:07:46.477
(39.22 seconds)

1834
01:07:46.478 --> 01:07:48.507
- Gosh.
- She talked too little.

1835
01:07:48.508 --> 01:07:50.277
Couldn't you thank the members more?

1836
01:07:50.278 --> 01:07:51.678
- Nothing?
- I feel sorry.

1837
01:07:51.679 --> 01:07:53.518
If you were going to dive in anyway...

1838
01:07:53.519 --> 01:07:55.388
- Seriously.
- It was too short.

1839
01:07:55.389 --> 01:07:57.587
You should've made a long speech.

1840
01:07:57.588 --> 01:07:59.628
Chae Yeon never failed before.

1841
01:08:00.228 --> 01:08:03.059
Chae Yeon, say something to your members.

1842
01:08:03.128 --> 01:08:04.698
Say anything you were upset about.

1843
01:08:04.699 --> 01:08:06.498
I love you all.

1844
01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:07.499
(I love DIA.)

1845
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.868
That's not enough.

1846
01:08:08.869 --> 01:08:11.798
"I love you all". That's 40.02 seconds.

1847
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:13.269
That's too bad.

1848
01:08:14.008 --> 01:08:15.909
- Next up is Yu Ra.
- Yu Ra.

1849
01:08:16.579 --> 01:08:18.848
You can't go over a minute.

1850
01:08:18.879 --> 01:08:20.108
Please.

1851
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:24.118
(Yu Ra suddenly starts...)

1852
01:08:24.119 --> 01:08:25.888
(grooving.)

1853
01:08:27.188 --> 01:08:29.419
- Excuse me. No grooving.
- Wait.

1854
01:08:29.518 --> 01:08:30.788
- You can't do that.
- That's not allowed.

1855
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:32.488
- You can't do that.
- It's not allowed.

1856
01:08:32.489 --> 01:08:33.789
(Can I do this?)

1857
01:08:33.989 --> 01:08:36.498
- No.
- Grooving is okay.

1858
01:08:36.499 --> 01:08:38.159
What do you mean it's okay?

1859
01:08:38.499 --> 01:08:40.028
It's okay, right?

1860
01:08:40.169 --> 01:08:41.169
(Well, grooving is fine.)

1861
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:42.539
- Get ready.
- Hey.

1862
01:08:42.869 --> 01:08:44.938
- Ready, set, go.
- Start.

1863
01:08:46.308 --> 01:08:49.808
Hello, I'm Yu Ra of Girl's Day.

1864
01:08:50.778 --> 01:08:54.879
I'm so happy that I'm with you all.

1865
01:08:55.079 --> 01:08:58.619
I made such great memories yesterday.

1866
01:08:58.848 --> 01:09:01.248
You'll keep in contact afterward, right?

1867
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:03.018
- Yes.
- Of course.

1868
01:09:03.688 --> 01:09:05.928
- Yes.
- I'm happy.

1869
01:09:06.388 --> 01:09:07.527
You have to say "the end".

1870
01:09:07.528 --> 01:09:08.588
I'm happy. The end.

1871
01:09:08.589 --> 01:09:10.258
(She said "the end" too late.)

1872
01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:11.527
- She failed.
- Let's see.

1873
01:09:11.528 --> 01:09:12.767
- I told you.
- All right.

1874
01:09:12.768 --> 01:09:14.498
You said "the end" a little too late.

1875
01:09:14.499 --> 01:09:16.168
I was done when I said "I'm happy."

1876
01:09:16.169 --> 01:09:17.637
No, "the end" is the end.

1877
01:09:17.638 --> 01:09:19.909
No, "I'm happy" was the end.

1878
01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:22.508
Yu Ra, even with "the end" at the end,

1879
01:09:22.509 --> 01:09:24.677
you still pass with 59.15 seconds.

1880
01:09:24.678 --> 01:09:26.749
(She passed with 59.15 seconds.)

1881
01:09:27.079 --> 01:09:28.847
(She finished within the time limit.)

1882
01:09:28.848 --> 01:09:30.048
- I did it.
- You made it.

1883
01:09:30.049 --> 01:09:31.549
- Now...
- It was 59.15.

1884
01:09:31.919 --> 01:09:34.347
Are you serious, Joon Ho?

1885
01:09:34.348 --> 01:09:35.618
- It was 59 seconds.
- You made it.

1886
01:09:35.619 --> 01:09:36.958
Get started, okay?

1887
01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:38.017
I'll go.

1888
01:09:38.018 --> 01:09:40.258
Pay attention, everyone.

1889
01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:41.959
Why are you moving?

1890
01:09:42.398 --> 01:09:44.499
- Joon Ho.
- What are you doing?

1891
01:09:45.629 --> 01:09:48.168
- Are you a metronome?
- No, that's cheating.

1892
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:49.238
What's wrong?

1893
01:09:49.239 --> 01:09:50.239
(You proved yourself guilty.)

1894
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.739
Get ready, set, go.

1895
01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:57.477
It's an honor to be here
on One Night Two Days.

1896
01:09:57.478 --> 01:10:00.648
All the games were fun.

1897
01:10:01.249 --> 01:10:03.277
During my career in entertainment...

1898
01:10:03.278 --> 01:10:05.717
I don't think I'll ever play these games...

1899
01:10:05.718 --> 01:10:07.717
- with so much fun.
- She speaks well.

1900
01:10:07.718 --> 01:10:08.758
It's an award ceremony speech.

1901
01:10:08.759 --> 01:10:11.789
- Without any sleep...
- Best Actress Award.

1902
01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:14.328
Without any sleep,

1903
01:10:14.329 --> 01:10:16.828
our crew members work very hard.

1904
01:10:16.829 --> 01:10:19.927
I hope the show continues to be a success.

1905
01:10:19.928 --> 01:10:22.538
I'll watch it more to raise...

1906
01:10:22.539 --> 01:10:24.898
the viewer ratings.

1907
01:10:25.299 --> 01:10:28.068
(Jong Min starts to act strange.)

1908
01:10:28.239 --> 01:10:29.579
What is Cheerful Fool doing?

1909
01:10:29.938 --> 01:10:31.777
- What about your mom?
- And...

1910
01:10:31.778 --> 01:10:34.977
I love you, Mom and Dad.

1911
01:10:34.978 --> 01:10:36.278
- Okay.
- The end.

1912
01:10:37.018 --> 01:10:39.288
- She finished.
- That's too late.

1913
01:10:39.289 --> 01:10:40.887
I tried to tell you.

1914
01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:42.158
- We don't know yet.
- What's the time?

1915
01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:43.857
- Let's see.
- Wasn't it five minutes?

1916
01:10:43.858 --> 01:10:46.528
She could have passed.

1917
01:10:46.858 --> 01:10:49.397
However, - Oh, no.

1918
01:10:49.398 --> 01:10:51.427
Due to her love for her parents,

1919
01:10:51.428 --> 01:10:54.499
she exceeded two seconds.

1920
01:10:55.129 --> 01:10:56.398
It's 1 minute 2 seconds.

1921
01:10:56.598 --> 01:10:58.968
- My goodness.
- That was close.

1922
01:10:59.138 --> 01:11:00.909
She has to talk about her parents.

1923
01:11:01.009 --> 01:11:03.177
Talking about her parents
was worth being penalized.

1924
01:11:03.178 --> 01:11:04.408
Going in the water isn't important.

1925
01:11:04.409 --> 01:11:07.078
Narsha and Ha Ra.

1926
01:11:07.079 --> 01:11:09.048
Thank you for coming.

1927
01:11:09.049 --> 01:11:10.647
It was 1 minute 5 seconds.

1928
01:11:10.648 --> 01:11:13.017
- Gosh.
- That was unfortunate.

1929
01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:14.289
- Thank you.
- You failed.

1930
01:11:14.388 --> 01:11:15.419
Get ready.

1931
01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:16.959
Start.

1932
01:11:17.318 --> 01:11:22.259
It was nice to meet you
on One Night Two Days.

1933
01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:23.659
It was great.

1934
01:11:25.329 --> 01:11:27.329
I think I have to go in the water.

1935
01:11:27.598 --> 01:11:30.999
It was 1 minute 0.13 seconds.

1936
01:11:31.369 --> 01:11:32.738
- She goes in the water.
- It's confirmed.

1937
01:11:32.739 --> 01:11:34.419
(Tae Hyun and Gyeong Ree go in the water.)

1938
01:11:34.539 --> 01:11:37.138
It's unfortunate because
she was being sincere.

1939
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:39.408
Do you have something?

1940
01:11:39.409 --> 01:11:41.378
- There's not much time.
- Narsha.

1941
01:11:41.379 --> 01:11:44.348
- This is hard.
- Everyone, be quiet.

1942
01:11:45.949 --> 01:11:49.018
Should I go in the water or be sincere?

1943
01:11:49.089 --> 01:11:50.089
Be sincere.

1944
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:51.588
- Be sincere?
- The best is...

1945
01:11:51.589 --> 01:11:54.088
not being penalized while being sincere.

1946
01:11:54.089 --> 01:11:56.598
She got married not so long ago.

1947
01:11:56.898 --> 01:11:58.868
She has many people to thank.

1948
01:11:58.869 --> 01:11:59.999
Her in-laws.

1949
01:12:00.329 --> 01:12:02.198
You're a member of "Invincible Youth".

1950
01:12:02.199 --> 01:12:04.397
- Right.
- To reminisce about it...

1951
01:12:04.398 --> 01:12:06.107
- Tell us how you feel.
- Takes 30 minutes.

1952
01:12:06.108 --> 01:12:07.138
Right.

1953
01:12:07.339 --> 01:12:09.578
30 minutes for "Invincible Youth"...

1954
01:12:09.579 --> 01:12:11.338
- and 30 for my husband.
- It's 30 seconds.

1955
01:12:11.339 --> 01:12:13.009
30 minutes for my mother-in-law.

1956
01:12:13.278 --> 01:12:14.379
It's 30 seconds.

1957
01:12:14.678 --> 01:12:17.817
- Let's go.
- Get ready, set, go.

1958
01:12:17.818 --> 01:12:18.887
"Invincible Youth".

1959
01:12:18.888 --> 01:12:20.648
Dear "Invincible Youth".

1960
01:12:21.888 --> 01:12:25.489
I'm happy to be back
here after seven years.

1961
01:12:25.989 --> 01:12:29.829
Nothing has changed including all of you.

1962
01:12:30.129 --> 01:12:32.298
Thanks to those who still welcome us,

1963
01:12:32.299 --> 01:12:34.199
the experience will remain in my heart.

1964
01:12:35.799 --> 01:12:36.799
Dear...

1965
01:12:37.339 --> 01:12:38.838
- Dear?
- Dear?

1966
01:12:38.839 --> 01:12:39.937
- My husband.
- What does it mean?

1967
01:12:39.938 --> 01:12:41.038
(Dear Husband)

1968
01:12:41.039 --> 01:12:42.538
- My husband.
- Be more emotional.

1969
01:12:42.539 --> 01:12:45.848
It's my 1st night away
in 8 months of marriage.

1970
01:12:46.249 --> 01:12:48.677
(It's her first night away from home.)

1971
01:12:48.678 --> 01:12:51.118
Unfortunately, - Goodness.

1972
01:12:51.119 --> 01:12:53.518
My partner is Joon Ho.

1973
01:12:54.518 --> 01:12:56.558
It was very difficult.

1974
01:12:56.858 --> 01:12:58.289
Her husband must be relieved.

1975
01:12:59.228 --> 01:13:02.299
Give me a massage when I get home.
I love you.

1976
01:13:02.659 --> 01:13:04.658
- Talk about me now.
- Dear Joon Ho.

1977
01:13:04.659 --> 01:13:05.828
(Dear Joon Ho)

1978
01:13:05.829 --> 01:13:07.467
It was great to see you.

1979
01:13:07.468 --> 01:13:10.097
I have a lot to learn from you,

1980
01:13:10.098 --> 01:13:12.267
- but you're a handful.
- Finish it.

1981
01:13:12.268 --> 01:13:14.268
It was a fun experience. The end.

1982
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:16.138
The end.

1983
01:13:19.079 --> 01:13:22.277
That was amazing. - 1 minute 12 seconds.

1984
01:13:22.278 --> 01:13:23.418
We went over by 12 seconds?

1985
01:13:23.419 --> 01:13:24.624
(Joon Ho and Narsha go in the water.)

1986
01:13:24.648 --> 01:13:26.488
Isn't it cruel?

1987
01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:29.687
Team Dong Gu is the only one that passed.

1988
01:13:29.688 --> 01:13:31.317
The rest goes in the water.

1989
01:13:31.318 --> 01:13:33.528
- That's right.
- Congratulations.

1990
01:13:35.558 --> 01:13:39.027
(They enjoy the fresh
morning air in autumn.)

1991
01:13:39.028 --> 01:13:41.629
(Shall we go in the water?)

1992
01:13:43.869 --> 01:13:45.968
(It's cold.)

1993
01:13:48.209 --> 01:13:51.308
(Warming up is necessary.)

1994
01:13:51.608 --> 01:13:52.847
- Ha Ra.
- Yes?

1995
01:13:52.848 --> 01:13:54.579
- You should stretch.
- I can't think.

1996
01:13:55.718 --> 01:13:58.278
Gosh.
- 1, 2, 1, 2.

1997
01:13:58.789 --> 01:14:01.249
Let's go.
- 2, 2.

1998
01:14:01.619 --> 01:14:04.488
This is what's fun about
One Night Two Days.

1999
01:14:04.489 --> 01:14:07.187
If you don't get penalized, it's very fun.

2000
01:14:07.188 --> 01:14:09.158
Right. Mine was 59.15 seconds.

2001
01:14:09.159 --> 01:14:11.528
Gosh, I can't believe it.

2002
01:14:12.028 --> 01:14:13.168
Let's go.

2003
01:14:13.169 --> 01:14:14.798
Let's go in.

2004
01:14:14.799 --> 01:14:16.298
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

2005
01:14:16.299 --> 01:14:17.869
- Let's go.
- Go in the water.

2006
01:14:18.638 --> 01:14:19.767
(Groaning)

2007
01:14:19.768 --> 01:14:22.009
How will we do it?

2008
01:14:22.379 --> 01:14:25.449
- We must go in together.
- Goodness.

2009
01:14:25.848 --> 01:14:27.048
(It's very cold.)

2010
01:14:27.049 --> 01:14:29.777
Gosh, it's very slippery.

2011
01:14:29.778 --> 01:14:31.977
- Everyone, is it cold?
- It's slippery.

2012
01:14:31.978 --> 01:14:34.347
- It's slippery.
- Yu Ra.

2013
01:14:34.348 --> 01:14:35.348
- It's slippery.
- Go together.

2014
01:14:35.349 --> 01:14:36.789
- Go now.
- It's slippery.

2015
01:14:37.459 --> 01:14:39.187
(Screaming is automatic.)

2016
01:14:39.188 --> 01:14:40.588
Be careful. It's slippery.

2017
01:14:40.589 --> 01:14:42.727
- Come.
- Come in.

2018
01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.527
- Hurry up.
- Where should I go?

2019
01:14:45.528 --> 01:14:47.767
- My goodness.
- It's slippery.

2020
01:14:47.768 --> 01:14:48.799
Can you hold her?

2021
01:14:50.098 --> 01:14:51.138
What are you doing?

2022
01:14:51.598 --> 01:14:54.169
- Here is for the heart.
- Stop it.

2023
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:56.709
Stop it.

2024
01:14:58.138 --> 01:14:59.677
(Joon Ho's whole body goes in the water.)

2025
01:14:59.678 --> 01:15:01.778
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2026
01:15:02.278 --> 01:15:03.817
What's going on?

2027
01:15:03.818 --> 01:15:04.977
It's so funny.

2028
01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:06.848
(Going in the water is the best.)

2029
01:15:07.119 --> 01:15:09.717
- Wait for me.
- Hurry up.

2030
01:15:09.718 --> 01:15:11.388
We can't lose.

2031
01:15:11.789 --> 01:15:14.159
Hurry up, Jong Min.

2032
01:15:14.459 --> 01:15:16.057
Come here.

2033
01:15:16.058 --> 01:15:18.258
- Hurry up.
- Come here.

2034
01:15:18.259 --> 01:15:19.268
Come here now.

2035
01:15:20.329 --> 01:15:21.728
It's getting windy. Hurry up.

2036
01:15:22.968 --> 01:15:25.039
(Screaming)

2037
01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:27.567
(It's a big mess.)

2038
01:15:27.568 --> 01:15:28.568
Gosh.

2039
01:15:31.608 --> 01:15:33.148
Hurry up.

2040
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:34.749
Come on.

2041
01:15:35.348 --> 01:15:36.978
(I'm in the water.)

2042
01:15:37.119 --> 01:15:38.178
All right.

2043
01:15:38.718 --> 01:15:40.647
Let's go in the water like this.

2044
01:15:40.648 --> 01:15:42.658
After screaming One Night Two Days,

2045
01:15:42.659 --> 01:15:43.817
- let's go in the water.
- Okay.

2046
01:15:43.818 --> 01:15:47.228
- One Night...
- Two Days.

2047
01:15:47.558 --> 01:15:48.589
Here we go.

2048
01:15:52.129 --> 01:15:53.829
(Chae Yeon dives in.)

2049
01:15:55.329 --> 01:15:56.799
(Ha Ra goes in as well.)

2050
01:15:58.369 --> 01:16:01.808
(Laughing)

2051
01:16:02.608 --> 01:16:06.148
(They fully experience going in the water.)

2052
01:16:06.409 --> 01:16:07.478
Goodness.

2053
01:16:07.648 --> 01:16:10.348
- Hey, stop it.
- Wait.

2054
01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:21.328
(It's time to say goodbye to the locals.)

2055
01:16:21.329 --> 01:16:23.258
- Goodbye.
- It's so sad.

2056
01:16:23.259 --> 01:16:24.874
(It's time to say goodbye to the locals.)

2057
01:16:24.898 --> 01:16:26.628
It was too much.

2058
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:29.897
- We made you work hard.
- It's a present for you.

2059
01:16:29.898 --> 01:16:30.938
It's a present.

2060
01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.039
Thank you.

2061
01:16:33.468 --> 01:16:35.339
My goodness. Thank you.

2062
01:16:35.579 --> 01:16:38.239
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

2063
01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:46.119

they enjoyed it together.)
