1
00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:29.005
It's going to burn. Flip it.

2
00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.046
What time is her bus?

3
00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:39.675
7pm.

4
00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:42.315
She must be on it now.

5
00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:47.186
Is Ji Ho immigrating to Europe?

6
00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:49.126
What's the fuss about her going back home?

7
00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:52.796
It takes 4 hours to Namhae and 3 hours if we drive fast.

8
00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:54.796
It's not that.

9
00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:58.135
It was really hard for Ji Ho to move to Seoul.

10
00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:01.936
She got into university in one go and moved then.

11
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.876
Even if she gets into Harvard, it's no use...

12
00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:07.276
if her parents won't let her go.

13
00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:09.576
Why wouldn't they?

14
00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:13.546
Ji Ho wasn't allowed to go anywhere else...

15
00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:15.615
other than Namhae National University.

16
00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.356
Her dad said it costs too much for Seoul.

17
00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:20.115
Really? Then how did she come to Seoul?

18
00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:23.996
The thing is, Ji Ho...

19
00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.595
- is a little crazy. - Crazy.

20
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:29.766
Ji Ho? She's the nicest person I know.

21
00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:32.095
You must not know her yet.

22
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.666
(10 years ago)

23
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.005
This isn't too bad.

24
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:37.975
Her dad had a philosophy.

25
00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:40.076
If she can't become a judge or a prosecutor,

26
00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:42.005
the only other option was becoming a teacher.

27
00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:46.115
But her marks weren't good enough for Seoul National University law.

28
00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:55.055
(Seoul National University, College of Law)

29
00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:01.095
Her dream was to become a writer since she was young.

30
00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:03.496
That's why she decided to try for Korean literature.

31
00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:10.305
That's why she brought it up while having dinner.

32
00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:11.976
Dad.

33
00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:14.546
I want to study Korean...

34
00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:16.576
What?

35
00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:20.745
Her dad flipped over the table.

36
00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.546
No way. How did she persuade him?

37
00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:24.786
Persuade him?

38
00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.925
I told you, she's crazy.

39
00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:32.655
She registered herself without anyone knowing.

40
00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:34.266
The day before the first day,

41
00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:37.935
(Namhae to Seoul)

42
00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.036
she ran away from home at night.

43
00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:44.976
(Namhae National University of Education)

44
00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:52.976
Okay, bye.

45
00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:57.916
(Where are you? I'm in front of your school. Come out.)

46
00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:11.236
Until she finished her first semester,

47
00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:13.196
her dad thought Ji Ho was attending Namhae University.

48
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.435
She really is crazy.

49
00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:19.736
I thought Soo Ji was the crazy one.

50
00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:22.606
No, Soo Ji just has a bad personality.

51
00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:24.816
Ji Ho...

52
00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:28.386
always surprises you at the most unexpected times.

53
00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:35.625
The driver won't wait long because he's upset.

54
00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:37.395
So give me a quick answer.

55
00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:39.196
Okay.

56
00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:40.666
Will you...

57
00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:42.525
marry me?

58
00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:48.106
Hurry. He's waiting.

59
00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:51.205
Okay.

60
00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:53.705
Then I'll go unload my luggage.

61
00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:56.006
He's very upset.

62
00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:58.346
Look.

63
00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:02.085
I have something to ask before then.

64
00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:03.786
Go ahead.

65
00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:05.386
By any chance,

66
00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:10.726
do you like me?

67
00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:15.266
No.

68
00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.296
Bring out your stuff. I'll wait inside.

69
00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:41.956
I noticed that you washed the instant noodle bowl.

70
00:04:43.656 --> 00:04:45.596
Yes, it's a habit.

71
00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:49.695
You have a really good habit.

72
00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:52.096
Thank you.

73
00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:55.765
- There's a seat. Sit down. - No, you sit.

74
00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:57.005
It's okay, you sit.

75
00:04:57.836 --> 00:04:58.875
Give me your bag.

76
00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.805
- Your hair looks good. - Doesn't it?

77
00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:03.875
- I'm hot. - Are you?

78
00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:10.555
You should sit.

79
00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:12.755
You can sit first.

80
00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:13.986
That's okay.

81
00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:44.015
I'm on my way...

82
00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:48.425
to get married to my landlord.

83
00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:01.606
My conditions haven't changed.

84
00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:04.276
Do you have any objections?

85
00:06:07.646 --> 00:06:11.015
No, not to your conditions.

86
00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:16.146
Is there something you want to add?

87
00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:21.986
As you know, I had to quit work.

88
00:06:23.356 --> 00:06:25.596
Until I find a new job,

89
00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:30.026
I need some adjustment to the rent.

90
00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:35.736
Would you be able to lower the rent?

91
00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:38.675
How much were you thinking?

92
00:06:40.846 --> 00:06:42.075
About 50 dollars.

93
00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:44.646
If you could give me the discount,

94
00:06:45.346 --> 00:06:47.815
it wouldn't be too much for me.

95
00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:56.185
Okay. Let's do that.

96
00:06:57.026 --> 00:07:00.325
We'll make our contract 250 dollars a month.

97
00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:03.226
Okay. Thank you.

98
00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:07.406
Are you sure you can handle it?

99
00:07:10.606 --> 00:07:11.706
I'm talking about the marriage.

100
00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:16.305
It might be more economical at this state...

101
00:07:16.445 --> 00:07:18.315
to go back home.

102
00:07:20.716 --> 00:07:21.885
No.

103
00:07:23.346 --> 00:07:26.925
Even if I go back, I still have to find a job.

104
00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:32.656
On top of that, I'll have conflicts with Dad.

105
00:07:34.226 --> 00:07:36.296
The only difference would be the rent.

106
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:39.995
There wouldn't be anything better than Seoul.

107
00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:42.305
There are no jobs either.

108
00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.945
It looks like the stress level is beyond the rental fee.

109
00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:50.916
However, I was surprised.

110
00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:55.615
I thought you considered marriages to be based on love.

111
00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:58.755
It was very unexpected...

112
00:07:59.055 --> 00:08:02.086
when you chose this marriage based on tenancy.

113
00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:04.695
Well...

114
00:08:05.796 --> 00:08:07.565
Just like you said,

115
00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:12.666
love and affection...

116
00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:18.375
aren't something I need for at least two years.

117
00:08:19.805 --> 00:08:23.505
What I need right now is that room.

118
00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:27.815
I decided to marry my tenant today.

119
00:08:29.515 --> 00:08:30.656
I know.

120
00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:34.726
It's not a choice an ordinary person would make.

121
00:08:37.295 --> 00:08:38.655
To be honest,

122
00:08:41.566 --> 00:08:43.295
I really wanted...

123
00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:46.836
to try it once.

124
00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:50.005
Marriage.

125
00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:52.905
I found...

126
00:08:55.676 --> 00:08:57.375
Did you sort the recycling this week?

127
00:08:59.275 --> 00:09:01.216
a very unusual woman as my wife.

128
00:09:04.915 --> 00:09:08.486
(Episode 4: Because This Is My First Marriage)

129
00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:32.446
I...

130
00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:35.645
slept so well.

131
00:10:09.446 --> 00:10:10.915
Good morning.

132
00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:12.486
Hello.

133
00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:18.155
Do you want some?

134
00:10:18.395 --> 00:10:21.265
I made a little too much for breakfast.

135
00:10:21.265 --> 00:10:25.295
I'm okay. A cup of americano is good enough for breakfast.

136
00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:27.466
Okay.

137
00:10:54.295 --> 00:10:55.525
It's so delicious.

138
00:10:55.966 --> 00:10:57.995
The food and the night too.

139
00:10:58.395 --> 00:11:01.736
I haven't had such a sweet morning in a long time.

140
00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:03.976
It's just as the saying goes.

141
00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:06.736
I can hardly support myself.

142
00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:09.775
How can I date and love in this state?

143
00:11:10.245 --> 00:11:12.346
I don't even have 5,000 dollars for a deposit.

144
00:11:12.446 --> 00:11:15.415
Thanks to this marriage, I got a 50-dollar discount.

145
00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:17.785
How much would that amount to in two years?

146
00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:23.226
What a great choice, Ji Ho.

147
00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:29.596
I feel so comfortable. Both Kitty and I.

148
00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:33.135
It's been so long since I had such a peaceful weekend.

149
00:11:35.336 --> 00:11:37.635
I don't have to suffer through blind dates...

150
00:11:38.436 --> 00:11:40.905
and get stressed about recycling.

151
00:11:41.806 --> 00:11:45.076
By giving a 50-dollar discount, I gained such a valuable serenity.

152
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.946
I used an egg.

153
00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:51.456
I'll refill it later.

154
00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:53.316
Okay.

155
00:12:06.535 --> 00:12:10.535
Yes. Marrying my tenant was the answer.

156
00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:15.476
Yes, it's me.

157
00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:18.816
What? Was that today?

158
00:12:19.576 --> 00:12:21.946
Oh. Okay.

159
00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:24.155
I'll come this evening.

160
00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:26.885
Okay. Have a safe trip.

161
00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:28.385
Okay.

162
00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:30.795
Is it your parents?

163
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:35.696
Yes. There is a wedding, so they're coming to Seoul.

164
00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:40.135
I think I'll have to go to my brother's tonight.

165
00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:43.165
Then should I come with you?

166
00:12:43.836 --> 00:12:45.976
Pardon? Why?

167
00:12:46.206 --> 00:12:48.976
If we're getting married, I should say hello.

168
00:12:50.816 --> 00:12:51.946
That's true.

169
00:12:52.216 --> 00:12:54.885
We should do those things if we're getting married.

170
00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:59.086
Yes. I arranged the process last night.

171
00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:00.856
Okay.

172
00:13:01.186 --> 00:13:02.356
(Process for two-year tenancy marriage)

173
00:13:02.356 --> 00:13:03.525
(Wedding process)

174
00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:06.426
(Meet the parents, wedding hall, dress, photoshoot, honeymoon...)

175
00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:12.736
Are we doing all of that?

176
00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:14.905
What you see now is an ordinary wedding.

177
00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:17.505
If it's a wedding based on love,

178
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.436
these are the procedures one must go through.

179
00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:22.375
As for us, we can skip it all.

180
00:13:23.915 --> 00:13:27.186
We just need to focus on this. That's all we need to do.

181
00:13:27.186 --> 00:13:32.115
Okay. Will you come today then?

182
00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:34.726
I think that would be efficient.

183
00:13:35.326 --> 00:13:37.096
If it's too sudden...

184
00:13:37.826 --> 00:13:40.326
No, let's go today.

185
00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:42.596
Okay.

186
00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:48.005
- Goodbye. - Bye.

187
00:13:52.576 --> 00:13:54.806
- Seul Gi. - Yes?

188
00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:57.476
You took the wrong order down for table 13, didn't you?

189
00:13:57.476 --> 00:13:59.216
Yes, I did.

190
00:13:59.716 --> 00:14:02.285
I'm sorry. I won't make the same mistake.

191
00:14:02.785 --> 00:14:04.356
That's impossible.

192
00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:05.885
Pardon?

193
00:14:05.885 --> 00:14:07.726
Of course you'll make mistakes when you're training.

194
00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:10.956
Just tell me when you do, so I can take care of it.

195
00:14:11.826 --> 00:14:13.056
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:14:13.795 --> 00:14:15.826
There's a reservation on table three, so go set it up.

197
00:14:15.826 --> 00:14:16.936
Okay.

198
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.775
What's this? You didn't tell me.

199
00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:32.245
I'm going to get mad at you.

200
00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:34.915
We had five bottles of makgeolli last night because of you.

201
00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:37.015
That's why I came right away.

202
00:14:38.655 --> 00:14:41.326
So? Are you moving back in as housemates?

203
00:14:41.785 --> 00:14:44.525
Yes, we're like housemates, but...

204
00:14:45.696 --> 00:14:47.125
It's a long story.

205
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:49.125
The three of us should meet.

206
00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:51.096
Did you tell Soo Ji? What did she say?

207
00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:55.306
I called her. She told me we should just drink.

208
00:14:55.765 --> 00:14:57.905
She can drink more after that?

209
00:14:58.505 --> 00:15:01.245
Is she a rabbit? She must have spare lungs.

210
00:15:03.446 --> 00:15:05.846
What is that? Meat? Beef?

211
00:15:05.846 --> 00:15:08.316
This? I have to go somewhere after.

212
00:15:08.816 --> 00:15:11.885
Now that I look at it, you look different today.

213
00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:15.456
You even have a bag.

214
00:15:17.596 --> 00:15:18.795
What is this?

215
00:15:19.056 --> 00:15:23.966
You look like you're going to meet someone important.

216
00:15:27.035 --> 00:15:28.165
Ji Ho.

217
00:15:28.865 --> 00:15:29.966
What?

218
00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:32.236
Are you meeting a new writer?

219
00:15:32.976 --> 00:15:34.076
Yes.

220
00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:36.275
Great idea.

221
00:15:36.275 --> 00:15:38.115
There are many writers in the world.

222
00:15:38.115 --> 00:15:40.285
It'd be a waste for you to quit because of them.

223
00:15:45.285 --> 00:15:47.885
Ho Rang. I have a question to ask you.

224
00:15:47.885 --> 00:15:48.986
What?

225
00:15:50.895 --> 00:15:54.895
When a guy is meeting a girl's parents,

226
00:15:56.865 --> 00:16:00.306
what should the guy say to impress the parents?

227
00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:05.106
Like... If he was trying to get their permission for marriage.

228
00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:07.645
Why do you want to know that?

229
00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:10.946
Well...

230
00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:14.115
Is it for a line in the drama?

231
00:16:15.186 --> 00:16:16.586
Is the new writer testing you?

232
00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:19.015
I'm the expert in stuff like this.

233
00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:20.155
I know, right?

234
00:17:04.466 --> 00:17:05.595
You arrived early.

235
00:17:05.995 --> 00:17:07.065
Yes.

236
00:17:11.775 --> 00:17:13.646
The bus is coming. Shall we go?

237
00:17:13.646 --> 00:17:14.676
Okay.

238
00:17:30.696 --> 00:17:32.855
Will there be any other issues that I should be aware of...

239
00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:35.196
other than those three?

240
00:17:36.626 --> 00:17:38.535
There's one variable.

241
00:17:38.835 --> 00:17:41.666
My younger brother can get a bit out of control.

242
00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:44.236
What do you mean, out of control?

243
00:17:46.206 --> 00:17:48.805
Never mind. I'll take care of him, so don't worry.

244
00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:52.916
You just need to be careful in talking to my dad.

245
00:17:53.376 --> 00:17:56.785
Okay. I'll keep those three ways in mind.

246
00:17:57.686 --> 00:17:58.916
If...

247
00:17:59.156 --> 00:18:01.456
all the three ways don't work out,

248
00:18:01.825 --> 00:18:05.456
you'll have to use another means.

249
00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:07.666
And what is that?

250
00:18:07.726 --> 00:18:11.535
You might not like this idea.

251
00:18:14.236 --> 00:18:17.075
You know, I got some advice from my friend...

252
00:18:17.406 --> 00:18:19.406
because she's the expert in marriage.

253
00:18:22.105 --> 00:18:24.646
These are the crucial comments to win your father-in-law's favor.

254
00:18:24.946 --> 00:18:28.886
The first one is, "I won't let her do any harsh work in her life."

255
00:18:29.085 --> 00:18:32.886
The second one is, "I'll make sure she becomes a madam."

256
00:18:33.186 --> 00:18:37.055
The third one is, "I'll serve her like a princess all my life."

257
00:18:37.295 --> 00:18:41.196
The fourth one is, "I'll love her until the day I die."

258
00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:44.936
This... This actually works?

259
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.305
Yes, maybe.

260
00:18:47.535 --> 00:18:51.406
No, I'll stop this from happening no matter what.

261
00:19:04.386 --> 00:19:05.456
Ji Ho.

262
00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:07.825
You got so fine after moving out.

263
00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:10.696
- These clothes seem new. - No, they're not.

264
00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:13.866
- I haven't seen this bag either. - Stop it.

265
00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:15.396
I don't think so.

266
00:19:16.265 --> 00:19:18.835
- And a new guy. - Gosh, I've had...

267
00:19:21.406 --> 00:19:25.105
Well, he's my boyfriend. Say hi.

268
00:19:26.035 --> 00:19:28.505
It's nice to meet you. I'm Nam Se Hee.

269
00:19:28.845 --> 00:19:31.176
Hello, I'm Yoon Ji Seok.

270
00:19:35.745 --> 00:19:38.015
- Mom and Dad are home, right? - Right.

271
00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:39.686
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

272
00:19:40.255 --> 00:19:41.255
Come in.

273
00:19:41.956 --> 00:19:43.386
Hurry in.

274
00:19:49.525 --> 00:19:50.795
It's not bad.

275
00:19:51.095 --> 00:19:53.736
- He doesn't seem that out of... - Mom! Dad!

276
00:19:54.035 --> 00:19:56.505
Ji Ho brought a man, and he has both arms and legs.

277
00:19:56.565 --> 00:19:58.436
- Go out and check. - What?

278
00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:00.476
- Mom, hurry! - What?

279
00:20:00.476 --> 00:20:02.906
I'm telling you the truth. It's for real.

280
00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:04.245
Hurry.

281
00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:29.206
You don't like crab doenjang soup?

282
00:20:29.805 --> 00:20:32.775
It was boiled down with huge crabs.

283
00:20:32.976 --> 00:20:35.505
It's not something that you can have in Seoul.

284
00:20:37.176 --> 00:20:38.245
Pardon?

285
00:20:42.515 --> 00:20:44.456
He wants you to eat a lot.

286
00:20:45.055 --> 00:20:46.855
I see. Thank you for the food.

287
00:20:50.156 --> 00:20:51.255
Let me pour you a glass.

288
00:20:51.426 --> 00:20:52.495
Sure.

289
00:21:03.035 --> 00:21:05.906
My family is very patriarchal.

290
00:21:05.906 --> 00:21:08.005
All you need to do is win my dad's favor.

291
00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:09.706
Remember just three things.

292
00:21:09.706 --> 00:21:12.545
First, drink the first shot at once.

293
00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:21.025
- Pour me a drink too. - Yes, sir.

294
00:21:23.126 --> 00:21:24.555
So what do you do for a living?

295
00:21:25.595 --> 00:21:28.295
I'm working as a top designer and CTO...

296
00:21:28.295 --> 00:21:30.765
at a start-up company which develops a social networking service.

297
00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:38.376
Secondly, you must always keep your answer short.

298
00:21:38.535 --> 00:21:41.446
If it gets longer than two sentences, he doesn't listen.

299
00:21:42.446 --> 00:21:44.345
I'm working at an IT company.

300
00:21:46.216 --> 00:21:47.545
IT?

301
00:21:48.616 --> 00:21:50.486
What kind of IT?

302
00:21:50.486 --> 00:21:52.785
It's about developing a mobile application.

303
00:21:53.015 --> 00:21:54.426
I see.

304
00:21:55.255 --> 00:21:58.426
Is it an outsourcing company?

305
00:21:58.995 --> 00:22:01.325
Lastly, if he demands some kind of explanation,

306
00:22:01.325 --> 00:22:04.335
give an example of something very famous.

307
00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:06.636
So we develop something like...

308
00:22:06.896 --> 00:22:10.436
a messenger which a lot of people use to chat.

309
00:22:12.305 --> 00:22:13.305
Is that so?

310
00:22:13.376 --> 00:22:14.946
Where is your company?

311
00:22:14.946 --> 00:22:18.116
It's located in a place called, Co-working Space.

312
00:22:21.245 --> 00:22:23.545
It's between the office buildings of Samsung and LG.

313
00:22:24.716 --> 00:22:27.085
It's located in a hot area.

314
00:22:27.085 --> 00:22:29.656
So he works at a nice company.

315
00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:32.926
All those conglomerates have gone less influential.

316
00:22:32.926 --> 00:22:34.995
Developing mobile messengers and social media...

317
00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:38.136
is called the real business these days.

318
00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:41.035
If he gets excited and continues talking,

319
00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:43.265
you can say you've almost cleared the mission.

320
00:22:43.265 --> 00:22:46.136
Those cars drive on their own even if you do nothing.

321
00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:47.345
They drive themselves.

322
00:22:47.876 --> 00:22:50.315
It's what we call the fourth industrial revolution.

323
00:22:51.416 --> 00:22:53.446
They really drive themselves.

324
00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:54.785
Really.

325
00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:57.855
Stop it and have your meal.

326
00:23:00.486 --> 00:23:02.656
You put too many amberjacks in the soup.

327
00:23:07.565 --> 00:23:09.025
Well, Dad.

328
00:23:09.696 --> 00:23:10.896
So...

329
00:23:11.696 --> 00:23:12.765
We...

330
00:23:13.866 --> 00:23:15.605
want to get married.

331
00:23:17.075 --> 00:23:18.636
- Goodness. - My gosh.

332
00:23:19.505 --> 00:23:20.505
Get married?

333
00:23:21.946 --> 00:23:22.976
Well...

334
00:23:23.845 --> 00:23:25.815
I know it's so sudden,

335
00:23:26.815 --> 00:23:29.515
but both of us are of age to marry someone.

336
00:23:29.815 --> 00:23:32.456
We think it's best to get married sooner than later.

337
00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:33.656
Are you pregnant?

338
00:23:34.386 --> 00:23:35.426
Abe?

339
00:23:37.196 --> 00:23:40.025
No, that's not it.

340
00:23:43.396 --> 00:23:46.236
Why is he bringing up Shinzo Abe?

341
00:23:48.565 --> 00:23:51.105
So he's wondering...

342
00:23:52.136 --> 00:23:54.005
- if I'm pregnant with your baby. - What?

343
00:23:57.116 --> 00:23:58.976
No, that's never the case.

344
00:23:59.416 --> 00:24:01.785
Of course, we're sharing our living space,

345
00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:04.886
but we protect each other's privacy.

346
00:24:05.055 --> 00:24:06.285
Do you live together?

347
00:24:07.525 --> 00:24:10.795
Does it mean your housemate is your boyfriend?

348
00:24:10.956 --> 00:24:11.995
What?

349
00:24:13.126 --> 00:24:15.126
You live with him?

350
00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:19.795
- Dad. - Are you saying...

351
00:24:20.035 --> 00:24:22.305
- you two are living together now? - Dad, hear me out.

352
00:24:22.305 --> 00:24:24.236
I didn't raise you to behave this way.

353
00:24:24.376 --> 00:24:27.745
I let you move out to Seoul, and how could you do such a thing?

354
00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:31.216
- You live together? - Stop it and sit down.

355
00:24:31.216 --> 00:24:34.045
Are you out of your mind?

356
00:24:34.315 --> 00:24:37.285
Should I lock you up in that room?

357
00:24:37.555 --> 00:24:40.156
I think you're mistaken.

358
00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:43.426
We're living together not in that sense.

359
00:24:43.926 --> 00:24:46.055
What? You live together?

360
00:24:46.255 --> 00:24:47.866
Did you just say that?

361
00:24:47.866 --> 00:24:51.335
I'm trying to correct your misunderstanding.

362
00:24:51.636 --> 00:24:52.866
Please hear me out.

363
00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:55.706
How dare you run that mouth of yours?

364
00:24:56.565 --> 00:24:58.505
Shall I make a scene here?

365
00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:20.126
I will...

366
00:25:22.226 --> 00:25:26.095
I will never let your daughter's hands get wet.

367
00:25:37.716 --> 00:25:38.716
It's so nice and cozy.

368
00:25:39.216 --> 00:25:42.486
You might get sick of this sofa even before you buy it.

369
00:25:42.515 --> 00:25:46.416
Of course not. I already thought of how to decorate my house with it.

370
00:25:47.926 --> 00:25:49.585
I wondered why you weren't coming today.

371
00:25:51.426 --> 00:25:53.396
The sofa will arrive in next week.

372
00:25:54.966 --> 00:25:56.095
I see.

373
00:25:56.295 --> 00:25:57.866
Seul Gi, you bought this?

374
00:25:58.466 --> 00:25:59.466
Yes.

375
00:25:59.565 --> 00:26:01.406
Didn't you say your house was small?

376
00:26:01.505 --> 00:26:03.466
Does it have enough space for this?

377
00:26:03.535 --> 00:26:05.736
I'm moving to another house.

378
00:26:06.206 --> 00:26:09.376
I'm actually getting married next month.

379
00:26:09.406 --> 00:26:10.716
- What? - Really?

380
00:26:10.745 --> 00:26:13.416
- Congratulations. - It's great to hear.

381
00:26:14.015 --> 00:26:16.015
I'm sorry, Ms. Yang.

382
00:26:16.815 --> 00:26:19.116
About what?

383
00:26:21.355 --> 00:26:22.486
Why are you sorry to me?

384
00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:25.095
I know you want to buy this.

385
00:26:25.426 --> 00:26:27.196
They said they had only one left.

386
00:26:27.995 --> 00:26:30.226
I was going to go for another one,

387
00:26:30.295 --> 00:26:32.666
but my boyfriend wanted it so much.

388
00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:39.936
Why are you making a big deal out of it?

389
00:26:39.936 --> 00:26:42.775
It's okay. I can always buy something else.

390
00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:45.446
I should go now.

391
00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:46.815
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

392
00:26:46.815 --> 00:26:48.085
- Bye. - Bye.

393
00:26:48.085 --> 00:26:49.245
Take care.

394
00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:52.315
- That's great news. - Where did you meet him?

395
00:26:52.315 --> 00:26:56.386
(Gongwon Supermarket)

396
00:26:56.386 --> 00:26:58.255
- Hello? - Won Seok.

397
00:26:58.995 --> 00:27:00.696
Can you come pick me up?

398
00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:05.265
Why is it so noisy there? Where are you?

399
00:27:05.265 --> 00:27:07.005
I'm outside. I met Sang Goo.

400
00:27:07.005 --> 00:27:09.535
Why are you telling me that now?

401
00:27:09.605 --> 00:27:11.605
I thought you were going to the company's dinner.

402
00:27:12.535 --> 00:27:15.305
I didn't go. I wanted to have dinner with you.

403
00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:16.476
Really?

404
00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:20.486
Could you wait for me a little bit then?

405
00:27:20.745 --> 00:27:22.146
I'll leave here in 30 minutes.

406
00:27:22.146 --> 00:27:24.255
I'm starving to death. How can I wait for 30 minutes?

407
00:27:24.716 --> 00:27:26.315
Never mind. I'll just eat alone.

408
00:27:31.095 --> 00:27:33.426
Ho Rang. Ho Rang!

409
00:27:36.065 --> 00:27:37.595
Did you guys argue again?

410
00:27:39.495 --> 00:27:41.206
What's with her these days?

411
00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:44.075
You can talk to me about it.

412
00:27:44.075 --> 00:27:46.406
I don't know what to talk about. That's why I'm so annoyed.

413
00:27:46.406 --> 00:27:48.206
- Give it to me. - What?

414
00:27:48.976 --> 00:27:52.245
Your phone. Let this expert analyze the data for you. It's free.

415
00:27:52.245 --> 00:27:54.686
Don't worry about it. I'm the one who knows her the most.

416
00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:56.015
It's up to you.

417
00:28:02.986 --> 00:28:04.995
Right. Let me see...

418
00:28:04.995 --> 00:28:06.825
"I love you." "What are you doing?"

419
00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:08.166
"I have a day off tomorrow."

420
00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:10.166
"Let's eat baby octopus tomorrow."

421
00:28:10.166 --> 00:28:11.565
"You shouldn't eat it when your stomach is empty."

422
00:28:11.565 --> 00:28:13.535
- Some of them are a bit weird. - I see.

423
00:28:15.265 --> 00:28:17.505
This is the picture.

424
00:28:18.075 --> 00:28:19.406
"My coworker..."

425
00:28:19.476 --> 00:28:21.406
"bought that couch..."

426
00:28:21.406 --> 00:28:22.946
"for her new house."

427
00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:24.976
"Good for Seul Gi."

428
00:28:24.976 --> 00:28:26.146
"Congratulations!"

429
00:28:26.446 --> 00:28:28.216
"Good for Seul Gi. Congratulations!"

430
00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:29.686
Are you crazy?

431
00:28:30.216 --> 00:28:31.355
What about it?

432
00:28:31.355 --> 00:28:35.886
Are you not getting any metaphors of her messages?

433
00:28:35.886 --> 00:28:38.095
She sent me a picture of herself. So I told her she was pretty.

434
00:28:38.095 --> 00:28:40.466
And her coworker's getting married. So I said, "Congratulations!"

435
00:28:40.466 --> 00:28:42.466
Should I have said something more?

436
00:28:42.525 --> 00:28:45.495
Oh, my goodness. Take a look at this.

437
00:28:45.736 --> 00:28:49.466
Do you think she just wanted to send the picture of herself?

438
00:28:49.466 --> 00:28:53.275
How can you think it's about celebrating her coworker?

439
00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:57.015
Can you not see what she tried to say,

440
00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.716
stupid?

441
00:28:59.876 --> 00:29:01.015
The couch?

442
00:29:04.285 --> 00:29:07.325
Why did she have to talk about it like that though?

443
00:29:07.486 --> 00:29:09.055
She could have just said she wanted to buy it.

444
00:29:09.055 --> 00:29:11.325
Is there any space for it at your place?

445
00:29:11.325 --> 00:29:13.156
You live in a small rooftop house.

446
00:29:13.295 --> 00:29:16.196
Of course, she couldn't say anything about it to you.

447
00:29:19.095 --> 00:29:20.765
How stupid you are!

448
00:29:20.906 --> 00:29:22.565
Just open your mouth and have it.

449
00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:29.105
That's why she's been talking about a house and a couch.

450
00:29:29.876 --> 00:29:32.976
Well, let me tell you something really important.

451
00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:33.986
Listen.

452
00:29:33.986 --> 00:29:36.416
Girls never say what they want directly.

453
00:29:36.416 --> 00:29:39.785
They never do that to guys. Literally, never.

454
00:29:40.186 --> 00:29:44.626
They want to hear it from guys.

455
00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:47.166
To hear what they want to hear,

456
00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:49.795
they keep talking to their guys.

457
00:29:50.226 --> 00:29:51.565
But they always beat around the bush.

458
00:29:51.565 --> 00:29:54.535
It can be strong sometimes.

459
00:29:54.535 --> 00:29:57.976
It can be cute sometimes.

460
00:29:57.976 --> 00:30:01.045
But at the end, it will make you go crazy.

461
00:30:01.976 --> 00:30:03.075
Are you getting it?

462
00:30:04.216 --> 00:30:07.515
That's why someone like you always fails.

463
00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:10.085
You are amazing.

464
00:30:10.085 --> 00:30:14.025
You don't date someone with your looks. You need some skills.

465
00:30:15.186 --> 00:30:17.795
You can also date someone with your looks.

466
00:30:18.325 --> 00:30:21.396
You know me. I'm Ma Sang Goo.

467
00:30:22.065 --> 00:30:24.065
I'm the Magical Sang Goo.

468
00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:26.966
I'm that amazing.

469
00:30:27.706 --> 00:30:29.706
The Magical Sang Goo!

470
00:30:49.525 --> 00:30:51.055
Here you are. It's water.

471
00:30:51.055 --> 00:30:52.426
Okay.

472
00:31:00.436 --> 00:31:03.605
I will never...

473
00:31:05.636 --> 00:31:09.575
I will never let your daughter's hands get wet.

474
00:31:12.476 --> 00:31:14.745
It's water.

475
00:31:16.386 --> 00:31:18.755
Are your knees okay?

476
00:31:22.226 --> 00:31:26.295
I never wanted that to happen at all.

477
00:31:26.855 --> 00:31:29.396
But if my dad flips the table over, that's the end of the conversation.

478
00:31:29.565 --> 00:31:31.236
So I couldn't stop it.

479
00:31:31.495 --> 00:31:35.265
But that made him trust you. At the end, it wasn't...

480
00:31:35.265 --> 00:31:39.005
I wonder who made that expression.

481
00:31:39.535 --> 00:31:42.075
"I will never let your daughter's hands get wet."

482
00:31:42.075 --> 00:31:45.045
Do you think that's even possible?

483
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:48.946
There were many other options though.

484
00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:51.515
That was the least strange one.

485
00:31:55.156 --> 00:31:56.355
Good night.

486
00:31:57.795 --> 00:32:00.825
(I hope this helps! Good luck, Ji Ho!)

487
00:32:02.866 --> 00:32:04.666
Well, he is right.

488
00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:13.335
How was the meeting?

489
00:32:13.845 --> 00:32:16.305
Thanks to you, it went well. I appreciate your help.

490
00:32:16.605 --> 00:32:21.416
Ji Ho, I'm really sad. I argued with Won Seok again.

491
00:32:21.486 --> 00:32:23.285
Why?

492
00:32:23.386 --> 00:32:25.355
I don't know. I'm exhausted.

493
00:32:25.456 --> 00:32:27.156
I just want to end everything.

494
00:32:31.855 --> 00:32:34.095
I'll go see you tomorrow. Let's eat together.

495
00:32:40.966 --> 00:32:43.335
(My darling)

496
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.366
Are you sleeping, Ho Rang?

497
00:33:19.676 --> 00:33:21.005
I'm sorry.

498
00:33:24.446 --> 00:33:26.876
I know I haven't been a good boyfriend.

499
00:33:28.986 --> 00:33:31.255
I should have understood you more.

500
00:33:37.396 --> 00:33:38.525
What do you mean?

501
00:33:39.196 --> 00:33:41.196
I'm sorry to make you wait so long.

502
00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:46.866
I know what you want. I'll make it happen.

503
00:33:47.505 --> 00:33:49.565
You must have been frustrated.

504
00:33:52.176 --> 00:33:53.535
Don't cry.

505
00:33:54.406 --> 00:33:55.505
Come here.

506
00:33:55.946 --> 00:33:58.545
Go away, you stupid.

507
00:33:58.545 --> 00:34:01.216
She bought the last couch.

508
00:34:01.716 --> 00:34:02.986
Please forgive me.

509
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:05.456
Please forgive me.

510
00:34:09.156 --> 00:34:10.855
- Will you? - Okay.

511
00:34:22.565 --> 00:34:24.676
- Are you going to work now? - Yes.

512
00:34:28.205 --> 00:34:30.946
This is how much I spent for your parents' gift yesterday.

513
00:34:31.616 --> 00:34:33.415
I think we should split the payment.

514
00:34:33.415 --> 00:34:35.545
Don't worry about it. I'll pay for it.

515
00:34:36.746 --> 00:34:38.516
You had a rough time yesterday too.

516
00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:44.496
How are your knees now?

517
00:34:45.926 --> 00:34:47.766
I think...

518
00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:53.605
you were pretty wise yesterday.

519
00:34:55.406 --> 00:34:59.005
For our marriage, meeting parents is actually the most important part.

520
00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:01.645
Because you made the right decision, it all went really well.

521
00:35:01.645 --> 00:35:04.116
It was worth it despite what I had to do.

522
00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:08.016
I'm glad you think that way.

523
00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:09.145
I know.

524
00:35:09.685 --> 00:35:12.386
I think I will tell my family about it today.

525
00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:15.225
- Today? - Yes.

526
00:35:15.955 --> 00:35:18.725
My family is strongly patriarchal too.

527
00:35:18.725 --> 00:35:21.966
But it's like having two bosses with one of them assisting the other one.

528
00:35:22.826 --> 00:35:24.835
Is your mom the assisting one?

529
00:35:24.835 --> 00:35:28.335
Yes. That's why I'm trying to pass the ball to my mom first.

530
00:35:28.935 --> 00:35:30.775
I see.

531
00:35:33.475 --> 00:35:35.906
Could you please take a selfie with me?

532
00:35:36.746 --> 00:35:38.216
Why do you need it?

533
00:35:38.216 --> 00:35:42.315
It's more convincing than just sending them a text message.

534
00:35:42.415 --> 00:35:44.216
I get it.

535
00:35:52.556 --> 00:35:54.625
- We should take it again. - Okay.

536
00:35:59.966 --> 00:36:02.205
Why don't you turn your phone around?

537
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.545
I can't press the button like this.

538
00:36:09.105 --> 00:36:10.645
You can use the other hand.

539
00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:16.915
I'm marrying this woman.

540
00:36:31.366 --> 00:36:32.496
Aren't you having lunch?

541
00:36:32.636 --> 00:36:33.766
After I answer the call.

542
00:36:35.565 --> 00:36:36.665
No one's calling you.

543
00:36:36.665 --> 00:36:38.236
She will soon.

544
00:36:39.005 --> 00:36:40.676
(Mother)

545
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.232

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

546
00:36:46.508 --> 00:36:47.849
Gosh, I ate too much.

547
00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:50.449
I can't believe you treated me to a meal.

548
00:36:51.648 --> 00:36:53.278
Of course I should.

549
00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:55.088
You even introduced me to investors.

550
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:57.918
Goodness, you dressed up so nicely.

551
00:36:58.389 --> 00:37:00.258
You made up with your girlfriend, didn't you?

552
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:02.628
Well, I'm going to go buy it today.

553
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:06.258
Good thinking. How would you live your life like that?

554
00:37:06.798 --> 00:37:10.168
You should work with whatever you have in your hands.

555
00:37:10.168 --> 00:37:11.298
That's life.

556
00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:14.208
Your tips helped me a lot.

557
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:16.769
Otherwise, I would have known nothing like an idiot.

558
00:37:17.179 --> 00:37:19.378
You are the best advisor when it comes to women issues.

559
00:37:19.878 --> 00:37:20.878
Hold on.

560
00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:26.918
This is unit 303. When are you coming?

561
00:37:27.219 --> 00:37:29.619
Do you have a girlfriend? Cigarette Light?

562
00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:31.858
- What kind of name is this? - It's not my girlfriend.

563
00:37:32.358 --> 00:37:34.929
That's the girl I met when she borrowed my light.

564
00:37:35.059 --> 00:37:38.099
We went into room 303 that night right away.

565
00:37:38.099 --> 00:37:40.499
Of a motel? What else?

566
00:37:40.728 --> 00:37:42.969
I met her a few days ago, but she just ignored me.

567
00:37:43.168 --> 00:37:44.699
She said she doesn't remember me.

568
00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:48.338
- So? - So I threw a bait professionally.

569
00:37:48.769 --> 00:37:50.278
She'll reply right away.

570
00:37:50.978 --> 00:37:53.409
Unit 303? What are you talking about?

571
00:37:55.008 --> 00:37:56.449
Then what will you say?

572
00:37:57.548 --> 00:37:59.079
Isn't this Ji Eun's number?

573
00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:00.519
I'm so sorry.

574
00:38:00.688 --> 00:38:03.789
I thought it was Ji Eun because I saved it as unit 303.

575
00:38:04.519 --> 00:38:07.128
- That's screwing her! - It is!

576
00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:08.758
She's not the only one from unit 303.

577
00:38:08.758 --> 00:38:12.159
Sun Young, Mi Ja, Sook Hee, and everyone's from unit 303. Darn her.

578
00:38:12.758 --> 00:38:16.028
I think she's going to be really upset.

579
00:38:16.228 --> 00:38:17.298
Learn from this.

580
00:38:17.798 --> 00:38:19.969
Her anger will reach this high,

581
00:38:20.139 --> 00:38:23.139
and she'll reply me after she completely loses herself.

582
00:38:23.438 --> 00:38:24.708
I'm learning another tip.

583
00:38:25.378 --> 00:38:26.978
- Let's go. - Yes, Master.

584
00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:31.079
I had a message?

585
00:38:32.949 --> 00:38:35.048
This is unit 303. When are you coming?

586
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:37.059
What is this idiot?

587
00:38:37.989 --> 00:38:39.858
I told you not to drink too much.

588
00:38:42.389 --> 00:38:44.298
Ms. Woo! Are you going home?

589
00:38:44.659 --> 00:38:46.358
We're having a drink with Mr. Lee.

590
00:38:46.798 --> 00:38:49.329
Oh, really? I didn't get a message.

591
00:38:49.728 --> 00:38:51.099
I just got it too.

592
00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:55.039
Then why don't you stay for a bit?

593
00:38:55.668 --> 00:38:58.878
I have a really important meeting. I don't think I can go. I'm sorry.

594
00:38:59.139 --> 00:39:01.579
What meeting? Who are you meeting?

595
00:39:04.579 --> 00:39:05.648
Are you going on a date?

596
00:39:06.249 --> 00:39:07.349
No, I'm not.

597
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:10.318
Yes, you are. Seeing how...

598
00:39:10.318 --> 00:39:12.818
you put on a makeup and a nice dress says it all.

599
00:39:12.889 --> 00:39:15.128
She has a boyfriend. A boyfriend.

600
00:39:16.858 --> 00:39:19.298
I'll attend the next get-together.

601
00:39:19.728 --> 00:39:20.829
See you tomorrow.

602
00:39:21.068 --> 00:39:22.228
Okay then.

603
00:39:22.898 --> 00:39:25.369
Don't go home too late. Don't drink!

604
00:39:25.568 --> 00:39:27.008
Your mom will get worried.

605
00:39:46.289 --> 00:39:47.389
Hey.

606
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:50.329
Do people at your company know you dress like this?

607
00:39:50.528 --> 00:39:53.869
Why did you have to call me here? There was so much traffic.

608
00:39:53.869 --> 00:39:55.528
You have to come along.

609
00:39:55.528 --> 00:39:58.398
Your girlfriend works here. Why don't you just go with her?

610
00:39:58.398 --> 00:40:00.869
No, I can't. I'm buying it secretly.

611
00:40:00.869 --> 00:40:03.239
- What is it? - You'll see.

612
00:40:15.818 --> 00:40:17.059
What's he doing here at this hour?

613
00:40:17.619 --> 00:40:18.918
Is he here to take me home?

614
00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:25.298
What's going on?

615
00:40:25.758 --> 00:40:27.699
He didn't call me. Why are the two of them here?

616
00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:40.708
- Hey. - Hey, where are you?

617
00:40:40.809 --> 00:40:42.878
What? I'm in the office.

618
00:40:42.978 --> 00:40:45.749
- You are? - Yes, is something wrong?

619
00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:48.048
No, I just called to tell you I'm going home right away.

620
00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:50.119
- Okay. See you. - Okay.

621
00:40:54.688 --> 00:40:55.758
What's going on?

622
00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:58.099
Are they...

623
00:41:01.199 --> 00:41:02.269
No way.

624
00:41:06.298 --> 00:41:08.938
I saw you two. Tell me honestly.

625
00:41:08.938 --> 00:41:10.168
Won Seok got me something, didn't he?

626
00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:20.019
Hey, pretend like you don't know.

627
00:41:20.148 --> 00:41:23.019
Won Seok is preparing so much to surprise you.

628
00:41:23.088 --> 00:41:24.418
You'll see when you go home later.

629
00:41:25.258 --> 00:41:26.929
Okay, I'll get off work early today.

630
00:41:35.699 --> 00:41:37.539
That's why you called me over.

631
00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:40.099
Of course, I can't do this alone. It's too tiring.

632
00:41:40.438 --> 00:41:44.139
Hey, Ho Rang will be really surprised when she sees this, right?

633
00:41:44.208 --> 00:41:45.508
Her eyes will get so big from the surprise.

634
00:41:46.008 --> 00:41:47.878
Put them back in if her eyes fall out.

635
00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:51.619
What's the installment plan?

636
00:41:52.378 --> 00:41:54.889
It's for 12 months. It's a really big deal for me.

637
00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:57.559
Hey, I guess it really is.

638
00:41:59.258 --> 00:42:01.258
She must have waited for a long time. It's the least I could do.

639
00:42:05.798 --> 00:42:07.298
(Idiot)

640
00:42:10.269 --> 00:42:11.269
What is it?

641
00:42:12.139 --> 00:42:14.708
"Idiot"? Whose name is saved like that?

642
00:42:14.708 --> 00:42:15.708
Some guy.

643
00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:19.008
(Are you sure you want to block this friend?)

644
00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:20.978
- Are you blocking him? - I already did.

645
00:42:28.119 --> 00:42:30.318
Ji Eun, pick up my shirt on the way.

646
00:42:30.318 --> 00:42:33.059
Young In, this is unit 303.

647
00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:34.389
What's happening?

648
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:36.789
Why isn't she checking the message?

649
00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:40.969
An e-mail came from HK. She sent the final report on the demo day.

650
00:42:43.798 --> 00:42:46.568
- Who? - I can't remember the name.

651
00:42:47.239 --> 00:42:48.239
Is it from Ms. Woo?

652
00:42:50.938 --> 00:42:53.008
No, it was from Mr. Park Jin Ho.

653
00:42:53.708 --> 00:42:55.878
Park... Park Jin Ho?

654
00:43:02.688 --> 00:43:05.289
- Hello. - Hi.

655
00:43:06.789 --> 00:43:08.429
That sofa must have been sold.

656
00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:12.898
Oh, someone bought it even though it was a display.

657
00:43:13.458 --> 00:43:14.528
What should you do?

658
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:16.599
You wouldn't be able to buy it elsewhere.

659
00:43:17.068 --> 00:43:20.199
It's okay. When I move, I'll need something bigger anyway.

660
00:43:20.338 --> 00:43:23.139
- Really? - Ms. Yang, are you moving?

661
00:43:23.338 --> 00:43:25.309
I thought your contract isn't over yet.

662
00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:29.378
I mean, I feel like I need to move before the contract is over.

663
00:43:29.608 --> 00:43:32.079
Are you perhaps getting married?

664
00:43:32.418 --> 00:43:34.318
Nothing's been decided yet.

665
00:43:34.519 --> 00:43:36.789
But I think it's going to be soon.

666
00:43:37.059 --> 00:43:38.688
- Really? - No way.

667
00:43:39.258 --> 00:43:42.659
That's great then. You should catch my bouquet at my wedding.

668
00:43:43.458 --> 00:43:44.499
Sure.

669
00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:52.039
Ji Ho!

670
00:43:54.438 --> 00:43:56.539
I was about to call you.

671
00:43:58.179 --> 00:43:59.579
What's this? You bought a cake?

672
00:43:59.809 --> 00:44:01.208
Won Seok told me to get one.

673
00:44:01.548 --> 00:44:03.108
He said there's something to celebrate.

674
00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:04.778
Is today a special day?

675
00:44:05.318 --> 00:44:06.378
Won Seok did?

676
00:44:08.249 --> 00:44:10.048
Won Seok, that dummy.

677
00:44:10.048 --> 00:44:11.858
He's so bad at surprises.

678
00:44:12.918 --> 00:44:15.659
Ji Ho, today...

679
00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:21.528
Does that mean you two are...

680
00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:24.668
It's a secret that I knew, okay?

681
00:44:25.798 --> 00:44:27.409
I should act naturally surprised.

682
00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:32.108
- How was it? Was it awkward? - It wasn't awkward.

683
00:44:32.478 --> 00:44:33.878
Your eyes were about to fall out.

684
00:44:34.708 --> 00:44:35.778
Hold on.

685
00:44:37.278 --> 00:44:38.778
(Landlord)

686
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:41.188
I'll have to get this first. You go in.

687
00:44:41.449 --> 00:44:42.918
Okay, hurry up.

688
00:44:48.989 --> 00:44:50.028
Hello?

689
00:44:53.668 --> 00:44:55.068
Ho Rang is coming up.

690
00:44:55.369 --> 00:44:58.739
- Turn off the lights. - Turn off the lights? Okay.

691
00:45:06.478 --> 00:45:10.208
Won Seok, why did you turn off all the lights?

692
00:45:11.048 --> 00:45:13.278
Won Seok, are you not home?

693
00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:17.858
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

694
00:45:22.148 --> 00:45:23.858
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

695
00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:29.748
Her eyes are about to pop out.

696
00:45:31.418 --> 00:45:33.018
What's this?

697
00:45:33.078 --> 00:45:36.087
You're lost for words because you're too surprised, right?

698
00:45:37.857 --> 00:45:39.918
I told you, her eyes are going to pop out.

699
00:45:40.228 --> 00:45:42.058
Oh, that's great.

700
00:45:42.127 --> 00:45:44.897
I was worried that your mother might not believe it.

701
00:45:44.897 --> 00:45:48.368
Yes, it paid off to take a lot of selfies.

702
00:45:49.067 --> 00:45:52.467
I'm going to tell my friends tonight too.

703
00:45:52.768 --> 00:45:56.268
Oh, you mean your friends from high school?

704
00:45:56.368 --> 00:45:59.578
Yes, I hesitated to tell because of this friend,

705
00:45:59.737 --> 00:46:02.708
but I think she's going to get married before me.

706
00:46:02.808 --> 00:46:04.018
That's great.

707
00:46:04.018 --> 00:46:07.248
But this is too sudden.

708
00:46:07.487 --> 00:46:09.518
So I don't know if they will believe me.

709
00:46:10.418 --> 00:46:13.728
I'll send you our couple selfie that we took in the morning.

710
00:46:14.087 --> 00:46:15.927
Why don't you try using that?

711
00:46:16.158 --> 00:46:18.197
Oh, okay then.

712
00:46:18.527 --> 00:46:20.027
Good night.

713
00:46:28.507 --> 00:46:32.237
How am I supposed to use it?

714
00:46:36.918 --> 00:46:39.047
Hey, Shim Won Seok!

715
00:46:41.248 --> 00:46:43.388
Are you out of your mind? Are you crazy?

716
00:46:43.388 --> 00:46:45.688
How can we put a sofa here?

717
00:46:46.717 --> 00:46:49.328
But you wanted this sofa.

718
00:46:49.427 --> 00:46:51.297
I made some space...

719
00:46:51.297 --> 00:46:53.427
and took the last sofa from that store.

720
00:46:53.697 --> 00:46:55.328
What's wrong this time?

721
00:46:55.527 --> 00:46:57.138
What's the problem?

722
00:46:57.138 --> 00:46:58.697
Are you playing Tetris or something?

723
00:46:58.938 --> 00:47:01.567
Look at our room. Do you think we even have any space to eat?

724
00:47:01.737 --> 00:47:03.607
Are we going to eat on our sofa?

725
00:47:03.607 --> 00:47:05.507
Why can't we do that?

726
00:47:06.638 --> 00:47:08.348
I can't talk with you at all.

727
00:47:09.607 --> 00:47:11.018
This is embarrassing.

728
00:47:11.848 --> 00:47:13.018
What? You're embarrassed?

729
00:47:13.647 --> 00:47:14.888
You're embarrassed of me?

730
00:47:15.388 --> 00:47:18.317
Ho Rang, is that all you can say to me?

731
00:47:19.018 --> 00:47:20.228
Hey, stop.

732
00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:22.188
Then what am I supposed to say? You can't understand me at all.

733
00:47:22.188 --> 00:47:24.728
What's the use of going to a good college when you can't understand?

734
00:47:24.728 --> 00:47:26.127
- Stop it. - What?

735
00:47:26.127 --> 00:47:27.728
Is that really all you can say?

736
00:47:27.897 --> 00:47:30.067
Then why don't you make it easy for me to understand?

737
00:47:30.067 --> 00:47:32.598
Help me understand rather than acting crazy for not understanding.

738
00:47:34.808 --> 00:47:35.938
Did you...

739
00:47:37.638 --> 00:47:39.138
just call me...

740
00:47:40.947 --> 00:47:42.578
crazy?

741
00:47:44.277 --> 00:47:45.877
- Hey. - What?

742
00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:47.688
Are you going to cry again?

743
00:47:47.817 --> 00:47:49.317
Should I ask for forgiveness again?

744
00:47:50.188 --> 00:47:51.817
- What? - I mean...

745
00:47:52.688 --> 00:47:55.357
Why should I be the only one who's always sorry?

746
00:47:56.388 --> 00:47:58.697
Why should I always care for your feelings only?

747
00:48:03.328 --> 00:48:04.868
I'm so sick of it.

748
00:48:06.197 --> 00:48:07.567
Darn it.

749
00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:11.677
Don't go.

750
00:48:12.938 --> 00:48:14.848
If you leave, we're over.

751
00:48:40.038 --> 00:48:41.268
Stop drinking.

752
00:48:51.848 --> 00:48:54.348
You told him that you wanted the sofa.

753
00:48:54.618 --> 00:48:56.987
Won Seok bought it on the installment plan.

754
00:48:57.717 --> 00:48:59.158
Why did you two...

755
00:49:00.527 --> 00:49:02.627
go to a jewelry shop earlier?

756
00:49:02.757 --> 00:49:03.857
What?

757
00:49:04.697 --> 00:49:06.328
I went there to change my watch strap.

758
00:49:06.728 --> 00:49:09.927
Won Seok paid for it too, you know.

759
00:49:09.927 --> 00:49:11.868
He wanted to thank me for moving the sofa with him.

760
00:49:12.438 --> 00:49:14.138
There's no one like Won Seok.

761
00:49:14.138 --> 00:49:15.808
He's really good to you.

762
00:49:17.438 --> 00:49:18.837
Proposal.

763
00:49:18.837 --> 00:49:20.507
You went too far today.

764
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:23.208
You shouldn't have done that in front of us.

765
00:49:23.748 --> 00:49:26.848
Do you know how many stores he went to?

766
00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:28.447
Proposal...

767
00:49:30.688 --> 00:49:33.788
I thought he was going to propose to me.

768
00:49:35.058 --> 00:49:39.328
It's not like I literally wanted that sofa.

769
00:49:39.328 --> 00:49:42.768
I wanted a big house where that sofa can fit in.

770
00:49:44.038 --> 00:49:47.337
He said he's sorry for making me wait for so long.

771
00:49:48.607 --> 00:49:50.067
That's why I thought...

772
00:49:51.237 --> 00:49:56.047
he was going to propose to me.

773
00:50:04.317 --> 00:50:08.587
Ho Rang's dream has been the same since she was 17 years old.

774
00:50:09.828 --> 00:50:12.158
It's been over seven years already.

775
00:50:12.658 --> 00:50:15.868
The youngest of my restaurant is getting married too.

776
00:50:16.427 --> 00:50:22.438
And I can't get married when I'm already 30.

777
00:50:26.677 --> 00:50:28.578
Being a good mother.

778
00:50:30.777 --> 00:50:34.147
My fallopian tubes are getting old too.

779
00:50:35.147 --> 00:50:38.658
My womb is aging.

780
00:50:42.188 --> 00:50:44.098
I can't stand this.

781
00:50:45.357 --> 00:50:47.697
Hey! Stop crying. That's enough.

782
00:50:47.697 --> 00:50:49.627
Marriage is nothing.

783
00:50:51.138 --> 00:50:54.038
What? Nothing?

784
00:50:55.438 --> 00:50:56.668
You mean it?

785
00:50:56.668 --> 00:51:01.047
Of course, someone who's so successful like you...

786
00:51:01.047 --> 00:51:03.107
must think marriage is nothing.

787
00:51:03.107 --> 00:51:06.518
But for a penniless girl like me,

788
00:51:06.518 --> 00:51:08.447
marriage is everything.

789
00:51:08.918 --> 00:51:10.857
That's the goal of my life!

790
00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:17.598
That's not what I meant.

791
00:51:18.197 --> 00:51:19.857
Is your fallopian tube your everything?

792
00:51:19.857 --> 00:51:21.797
Is your womb your identity?

793
00:51:21.797 --> 00:51:24.038
Why are you trying to sell yourself with marriage?

794
00:51:24.038 --> 00:51:28.208
That's because all I have is this womb. Is that wrong?

795
00:51:28.208 --> 00:51:31.277
Hey, Ho Rang. Don't be sarcastic.

796
00:51:31.277 --> 00:51:32.808
Why do you hear it wrong?

797
00:51:32.808 --> 00:51:35.578
Stop showing off! You're such a major turn off!

798
00:51:36.208 --> 00:51:38.748
Crazy witch. Your insanity is getting you again.

799
00:51:39.877 --> 00:51:41.348
Gosh, seriously.

800
00:51:42.317 --> 00:51:43.558
Where are you going?

801
00:51:44.888 --> 00:51:46.618
I can't stand to be here anymore.

802
00:51:47.228 --> 00:51:49.587
- I'll get going first. - Soo Ji! Soo Ji!

803
00:51:49.788 --> 00:51:51.527
Hey, Soo Ji!

804
00:51:52.828 --> 00:51:54.927
Gosh. Wait a minute.

805
00:52:10.848 --> 00:52:12.118
Soo Ji.

806
00:52:13.047 --> 00:52:15.918
Ji Ho, do you know what kind of a day I had?

807
00:52:15.918 --> 00:52:18.518
I got off work early today unlike other days,

808
00:52:18.658 --> 00:52:21.558
but I had to be dragged around by Won Seok to buy the sofa.

809
00:52:21.558 --> 00:52:23.058
And I even cleaned the room for her.

810
00:52:23.058 --> 00:52:25.527
Should I also stand her being crazy on me?

811
00:52:25.527 --> 00:52:29.228
I know. Ho Rang did wrong today.

812
00:52:29.998 --> 00:52:32.868
So stop being mad,

813
00:52:32.967 --> 00:52:36.168
and talk to her face-to-face.

814
00:52:37.038 --> 00:52:38.908
If you leave like this,

815
00:52:39.777 --> 00:52:43.408
Ho Rang will be so lonely today.

816
00:52:44.848 --> 00:52:47.118
Loneliness only comes if you have time.

817
00:52:47.288 --> 00:52:49.817
I'm disappointed in her because she's being hysterical...

818
00:52:49.817 --> 00:52:52.757
to a friend who doesn't even have time to sleep.

819
00:52:59.598 --> 00:53:01.927
- Excuse me, Ji Ho. - Oh, just get it.

820
00:53:04.697 --> 00:53:06.138
Yes, Mr. Lee.

821
00:53:09.308 --> 00:53:11.877
Really? Were you looking for me?

822
00:53:12.938 --> 00:53:16.308
In high school, Soo Ji's dream was to become a CEO.

823
00:53:17.447 --> 00:53:21.788
She wanted to be a CEO in whatever field she chooses.

824
00:53:22.317 --> 00:53:25.558
No, of course not. There's nothing more important than you, Mr. Lee.

825
00:53:26.958 --> 00:53:30.598
She's always been the center of her life. She was always awesome.

826
00:53:32.058 --> 00:53:33.458
That's how she was like.

827
00:53:33.868 --> 00:53:36.967
Okay, okay. I'll see you soon.

828
00:53:43.777 --> 00:53:45.777
I think I need to return to the office.

829
00:53:45.777 --> 00:53:47.647
Right now? At this hour?

830
00:53:47.848 --> 00:53:49.978
I'm just an employee. I can't choose not to.

831
00:53:50.217 --> 00:53:51.978
He's an important client,

832
00:53:52.078 --> 00:53:54.217
and he holds so much grudge if I miss a get-together.

833
00:54:04.027 --> 00:54:06.527
Soo Ji wanted to become a CEO,

834
00:54:12.598 --> 00:54:15.067
but now, she's just an employee...

835
00:54:16.007 --> 00:54:17.677
who answers to her boss.

836
00:54:28.618 --> 00:54:31.317
Ho Rang's only dream was to be married.

837
00:54:35.857 --> 00:54:37.257
But she's been dating the same guy for 5 years...

838
00:54:38.857 --> 00:54:40.668
and living with him for 2 years.

839
00:54:49.507 --> 00:54:52.607
And I decided to...

840
00:54:58.848 --> 00:55:00.248
marry my landlord...

841
00:55:02.047 --> 00:55:03.618
to live in Seoul.

842
00:55:12.197 --> 00:55:14.427
Did you talk about it well?

843
00:55:15.027 --> 00:55:17.268
Did your friends take the news well?

844
00:55:18.268 --> 00:55:19.397
No.

845
00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:22.737
I couldn't talk to them yet. Things got in the way.

846
00:55:28.777 --> 00:55:30.078
By the way,

847
00:55:31.047 --> 00:55:32.918
what do your friends do?

848
00:55:35.018 --> 00:55:36.518
I mean,

849
00:55:38.217 --> 00:55:40.427
what are their jobs and...

850
00:55:40.828 --> 00:55:42.788
what are they like?

851
00:55:44.728 --> 00:55:47.998
They just work in the office or they are married.

852
00:55:48.567 --> 00:55:49.797
Some of them run their own business.

853
00:55:50.897 --> 00:55:53.067
They are just normal like others.

854
00:55:55.808 --> 00:55:58.308
"Like others". I see.

855
00:56:03.377 --> 00:56:04.647
I was just wondering...

856
00:56:05.918 --> 00:56:09.018
where we were.

857
00:56:11.257 --> 00:56:12.717
I'm just thinking.

858
00:56:14.328 --> 00:56:16.388
It looks like everyone's trying really hard.

859
00:56:17.098 --> 00:56:19.458
But no one knows if they are...

860
00:56:20.397 --> 00:56:22.268
getting closer to achieve what they want or not.

861
00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:25.768
It's just hard to know.

862
00:56:27.007 --> 00:56:30.237
So I was just wondering what it's like to get what you want...

863
00:56:30.808 --> 00:56:32.138
and how they got it.

864
00:56:32.908 --> 00:56:34.447
That's why I asked you about them.

865
00:56:35.007 --> 00:56:38.578
You shouldn't ask something like that to others.

866
00:56:39.478 --> 00:56:41.388
Things are different these days.

867
00:56:42.918 --> 00:56:44.188
As you know,

868
00:56:44.688 --> 00:56:47.328
the market is saturated or depleted these days.

869
00:56:47.558 --> 00:56:49.728
The world is not going to get better in that way.

870
00:56:50.228 --> 00:56:52.328
So there should be a new standard...

871
00:56:52.828 --> 00:56:54.498
for the new generation.

872
00:56:55.397 --> 00:56:57.668
- For example... - Marriage?

873
00:56:59.768 --> 00:57:00.967
Is that you want to talk about?

874
00:57:02.938 --> 00:57:04.007
Yes.

875
00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:13.587
The world is not going to be a better place.

876
00:57:18.487 --> 00:57:22.188
That also means my life is not going to get better.

877
00:57:25.197 --> 00:57:26.828
I shouldn't be looking forward to the better future.

878
00:57:27.868 --> 00:57:29.868
I might be living to avoid the worst thing...

879
00:57:30.938 --> 00:57:32.638
that could happen tomorrow.

880
00:57:39.438 --> 00:57:40.447
Bye.

881
00:57:41.408 --> 00:57:42.947
Wait.

882
00:57:45.018 --> 00:57:47.817
I was thinking about the regulations...

883
00:57:47.817 --> 00:57:50.047
to manage our marriage.

884
00:57:51.857 --> 00:57:54.058
I do think the most important things about our marriage are...

885
00:57:54.058 --> 00:57:56.458
efficiency and the financial situation.

886
00:57:56.458 --> 00:57:58.558
That's right. I totally agree with you.

887
00:57:59.498 --> 00:58:00.897
So I want to suggest...

888
00:58:01.067 --> 00:58:05.098
to skip things that can incur expenses.

889
00:58:05.467 --> 00:58:08.567
So the wedding ceremony is...

890
00:58:08.668 --> 00:58:10.408
Of course, we will skip that part.

891
00:58:11.107 --> 00:58:13.507
The expenses and the procedures for our marriage will...

892
00:58:13.607 --> 00:58:15.348
be limited to our first family meeting.

893
00:58:16.947 --> 00:58:18.547
I think so too.

894
00:58:18.817 --> 00:58:20.647
Yes, definitely.

895
00:58:23.618 --> 00:58:24.888
You don't...

896
00:58:25.587 --> 00:58:27.987
(Stop dreaming)

897
00:58:28.987 --> 00:58:30.757
marry someone for love anymore.

898
00:58:36.668 --> 00:58:38.897
That's for the rich people these days.

899
00:58:53.348 --> 00:58:54.618
Now we are...

900
00:59:15.138 --> 00:59:16.337
Didn't we say...

901
00:59:17.177 --> 00:59:19.708
we weren't doing anything?

902
00:59:22.248 --> 00:59:25.717
I think we did.

903
00:59:27.518 --> 00:59:28.587
We just want to...

904
00:59:29.618 --> 00:59:31.717
live normally.

905
00:59:32.888 --> 00:59:34.058
To do that,

906
00:59:35.158 --> 00:59:36.328
we have to do something.

907
00:59:57.018 --> 01:00:00.817
(Because This is My First Life)

908
01:00:00.817 --> 01:00:03.658
Who made a bet on I'm gay?

909
01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:04.958
Who thought I was straight?

910
01:00:05.618 --> 01:00:06.958
How about asexual?

911
01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:08.888
I'm getting married.

912
01:00:09.688 --> 01:00:11.558
- When did you start dating him? - What?

913
01:00:11.728 --> 01:00:13.797
Since we are having a relationship of the landlord and a tenant,

914
01:00:13.868 --> 01:00:16.598
I feel very uncomfortable for you to ask me to do things.

915
01:00:16.967 --> 01:00:19.368
Why do I have to talk about it when I'm done with him anyway?

916
01:00:19.438 --> 01:00:20.768
You can tell that to him.

917
01:00:20.808 --> 01:00:22.467
She was deeply hurt.

918
01:00:22.607 --> 01:00:23.777
Why is it not enough?

919
01:00:24.277 --> 01:00:26.737
You don't have to worry about my dad.

920
01:00:27.248 --> 01:00:29.208
Isn't that too much?

921
01:00:29.277 --> 01:00:31.947
It's my wedding. So I have to be there.

922
01:00:32.317 --> 01:00:34.487
I want the wedding to be short and plain.
