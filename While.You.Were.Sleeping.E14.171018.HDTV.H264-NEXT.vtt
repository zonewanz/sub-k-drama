(Episode 14)

2
00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:10.730
What are you doing there, Jae Chan?

3
00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.008
Why are the lights off?

4
00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:13.684
Don't turn it on.

5
00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:15.215
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

6
00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.455
They're having a barbecue party.

7
00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:20.455
That's Woo Tak.

8
00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:26.664
Let's drink soju next time.

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.065
(Prosecutor, Police)

10
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:31.965
Hong Joo told me everything.

11
00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:33.603
I heard that you saved her life.

12
00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:35.504
Please don't mention it. I did what any police officer...

13
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.174
would have done.

14
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:39.514
You should eat too. I'll do it. Give me the scissors.

15
00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:40.874
It's okay. I'm done.

16
00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.444
I'll take complete care of you...

17
00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:45.384
until you're fully recovered.

18
00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:47.884
What kind of food do you like?

19
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:49.955
I like many things.

20
00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:52.225
I'll think about it and submit a report to you.

21
00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:53.495
Yes, sir!

22
00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:58.494
- Are you looking for something? - I don't see any perilla leaves.

23
00:00:58.495 --> 00:00:59.633
Meat must be eaten with them.

24
00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:01.495
Just eat lettuce. There's scallion salad too.

25
00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.404
No, no barbecue is complete without perilla leaves.

26
00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:05.705
Hold on a second.

27
00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:12.544
Hey, Woo Tak.

28
00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.144
Hey, Jae Chan. Do you happen to have perilla leaves at home?

29
00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:17.045
No, I don't have any.

30
00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:18.815
Then can you pick some up for us?

31
00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:21.384
I can't really eat meat without perilla leaves.

32
00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:25.684
Oh, of course. I can definitely pick some up for you.

33
00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:29.194
Then please also get some pickled radish.

34
00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.725
Sure, perilla leaves and pickled radish.

35
00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:33.065
Got it.

36
00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:38.904
Seung Won, I suddenly thought of an excerpt from a poem.

37
00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:41.274
- A poem? - "You need to look from afar..."

38
00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:42.604
"to see its beauty."

39
00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:46.344
"You need to see it briefly to find it lovable."

40
00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:49.815
"That man is like that."

41
00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:51.485
There's a poem like that?

42
00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.614
Of course not! You idiot.

43
00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:56.924
Clean up. I'll be back in a bit.

44
00:01:59.354 --> 00:02:00.495
That little...

45
00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:08.664
Let's go together.

46
00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:10.334
There's no need for two people to go buy perilla leaves.

47
00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.805
He wants a number of things.

48
00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.545
He asked me to pick up socks and pajamas too.

49
00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:18.344
Then you have to go to that big store.

50
00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:19.844
It's pretty far, isn't it?

51
00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:21.343
Use my car.

52
00:02:21.344 --> 00:02:23.015
I'll give you my car keys. Catch them.

53
00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:28.955
All right. Thanks.

54
00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:32.455
- Get in. - Okay.

55
00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:42.904
Oh, it's Woo Tak.

56
00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:45.265
(Han Woo Tak)

57
00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:47.634
Why are you video-calling me?

58
00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:49.275
I wanted to see what you bought.

59
00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:53.144
Oh, that penguin is cute. Get that too.

60
00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:54.575
This one?

61
00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.153
You're so quirky. Do you like plush toys like this?

62
00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:02.514
No, I just think it looks like you.

63
00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.525
Me?

64
00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:05.484
It does look like you.

65
00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:08.154
Short arms and legs, wide-set eyes, and protruding lips.

66
00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.505
Wait, Jae Chan. What's that beside you?

67
00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:18.735
Can you put it on?

68
00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:20.574
You mean, right here?

69
00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.634
Yes. I need to see what it looks like to decide to buy it or not.

70
00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:24.114
Ta-da.

71
00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:28.535
Ta-da.

72
00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:32.954
It's cute. What do you think?

73
00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:33.955
This one?

74
00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:34.955
You like this better?

75
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:36.825
For goodness' sake.

76
00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:39.164
Hong Joo, what's that on your left? The long thing.

77
00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:42.164
This? I think it's a massage stick.

78
00:03:42.404 --> 00:03:44.234
Oh, Kyung Han would love that.

79
00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:45.903
His shoulders get tense when he's working.

80
00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:47.134
Really? Then shall I buy one of this?

81
00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:49.745
No, not the chick. I want the bear.

82
00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:52.375
Hang on, would the dinosaur be better?

83
00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:53.745
This one?

84
00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:55.544
The dinosaur would be better. I've decided.

85
00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:57.015
Get the chick.

86
00:03:57.814 --> 00:03:58.915
Gosh.

88
00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:37.064
Just leave them. They're heavy. I'll carry them for you.

89
00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:39.234
It's okay. I live right here.

90
00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:41.004
I don't want to keep inconveniencing you.

91
00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:43.305
What?

92
00:04:43.504 --> 00:04:45.403
Do you think you're inconveniencing me?

93
00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:49.244
Yes, I keep getting help from you without being able to repay you.

94
00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:50.844
Do you hate it that much?

95
00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:52.645
Yes, I do.

96
00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:58.584
Oh, boy. I want to repay you for everything at once, but I can't.

97
00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:01.355
What can I do? I should repay you little by little.

98
00:05:03.524 --> 00:05:05.154
Can I be an exception?

99
00:05:06.594 --> 00:05:07.863
- Sorry? - Don't feel...

100
00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:10.194
that you have to repay me. You can be shameless with me.

101
00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:12.035
Can't you do that?

102
00:05:12.265 --> 00:05:13.805
Why do you want to be an exception?

103
00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:15.664
Do you want to help me whenever you see me?

104
00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:19.375
Do you want to protect me? Are you worried about me?

105
00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:21.904
Yes.

106
00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:28.883
What's with you these days?

107
00:05:28.884 --> 00:05:32.685
I'm cracking jokes. Why do you keep putting a romantic spin on them?

108
00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:35.984
You got me all flustered.

109
00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:41.165
Just be yourself, your normal self.

110
00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:50.904
After this, we'll call it even.

111
00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:53.375
Sorry?

112
00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:27.805
What... What are you doing now?

113
00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:57.274
Did she step out?

114
00:06:59.944 --> 00:07:01.705
Is she already asleep?

115
00:07:02.915 --> 00:07:05.044
Hold these for me for a second.

116

I need to find my key.

117
00:07:08.214 --> 00:07:09.984
Hurry up already.

118
00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:11.884
I'm trying to find my key.

119
00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:19.664
By the way, what were you trying to do in the car earlier?

120
00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:21.424
Gosh. Just let it slide, will you?

121
00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:24.264
I mean, something similar happened to you a while ago...

122
00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:26.863
when you offered to untie my apron for me. What did I do back then?

123
00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:29.003
I didn't say a word because I wanted to be considerate of your feelings.

124
00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:30.535
So, you should also just...

125
00:07:46.055 --> 00:07:48.654
Wasn't this what you were trying to do?

126
00:07:49.955 --> 00:07:51.694
I thought this was it.

127
00:07:53.364 --> 00:07:54.924
I guess I was wrong.

128
00:08:01.504 --> 00:08:03.475
Well, this never happened, okay?

129
00:08:39.174 --> 00:08:40.344
I must be going insane.

130
00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:42.404
I keep making moves on him.

131
00:08:44.114 --> 00:08:46.314
How am I going to see him tomorrow?

132
00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:52.955
- You're back. - Oh, you're home.

133
00:08:53.154 --> 00:08:54.754
Yes, it took you a long time.

134
00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:56.895
Sorry, the traffic was bad.

135
00:08:57.325 --> 00:08:59.495
Take a look at what I bought. I can get them exchanged for you.

136
00:09:01.864 --> 00:09:04.134
There's no need. I like everything you bought.

137
00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:19.714
What was that about? He didn't even see them.

138
00:09:37.435 --> 00:09:38.535
My gosh.

139
00:09:43.805 --> 00:09:44.915
Jae Chan, we have a big problem.

140
00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:46.813
He took a huge dump again in the kitchen.

141
00:09:46.814 --> 00:09:47.814
Really?

142
00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:51.253
Gosh, Woo Bin. Did you poop?

143
00:09:51.254 --> 00:09:53.684
Do you feel better now? Gosh, my baby.

144
00:09:53.685 --> 00:09:55.384
- Did you drink? - No.

145
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:58.193
Did you eat? Was it good?

146
00:09:58.194 --> 00:09:59.225
Was it delicious?

147
00:10:00.254 --> 00:10:01.325
Gosh, you're heavy.

148
00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:09.404
Jae Chan, we got it again.

149
00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:10.634
What? What did we get?

150
00:10:11.075 --> 00:10:13.774
That man sent us money again.

151
00:10:14.044 --> 00:10:16.245
He somehow managed to find our new address.

152
00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:20.415
He's been sending it to us for almost a decade now.

153
00:10:20.685 --> 00:10:22.284
Can't we just spend that money now?

154
00:10:22.285 --> 00:10:24.515
I'll return it to him when we find him. Where did you put the money?

155
00:10:25.314 --> 00:10:28.685
I just put it on your desk. I didn't touch it.

156
00:10:29.185 --> 00:10:30.225
Good.

(South Seoul Funeral Home)

159
00:11:02.384 --> 00:11:04.523
I totally saw them going this way.

160
00:11:04.524 --> 00:11:05.894
- Are you sure? - Yes.

161
00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:07.824
The kid in the mourning clothes is the cop's son,

162
00:11:07.825 --> 00:11:09.794
and the one wearing a baseball jacket is the bus driver's son.

163
00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:12.064
- Hey. - Yes.

164
00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:13.594
We don't have time to find his son.

00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:15.934
I heard that the runaway soldier's brother is here now.

166
00:11:15.935 --> 00:11:16.935
- Brother? - Brother?

167
00:11:16.936 --> 00:11:20.105
That jerk got himself in trouble on his way to meet his brother.

168
00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:21.645
And his brother is a cop.

169
00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:23.144
- He's a cop? - Yes.

170
00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:24.145
- Hey, let's go. - Okay.

171
00:11:24.146 --> 00:11:26.575
It'll be better to talk to him than those boys.

172
00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:28.344
Wait up!

173
00:11:31.114 --> 00:11:34.855
Are you the deceased bus driver's son?

174
00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:36.085
What?

175
00:11:37.725 --> 00:11:38.754
Yes.

176
00:11:40.455 --> 00:11:41.464
What's wrong?

177
00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:43.464
Over there.

178
00:11:44.935 --> 00:11:46.035
Someone is there.

179
00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:48.364
Who?

180
00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:57.544
Officer.

181
00:12:03.344 --> 00:12:05.685
Are you the cop the reporters were...

182
00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:08.325
talking about earlier?

183
00:12:13.794 --> 00:12:14.864
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:17.564 --> 00:12:19.364
The man who killed my dad...

185
00:12:20.395 --> 00:12:22.165
is your brother?

186
00:12:24.674 --> 00:12:26.004
I didn't know either.

187
00:12:26.774 --> 00:12:28.745
I had no idea that my little brother would do such a thing.

188
00:12:36.814 --> 00:12:37.955
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:38.515 --> 00:12:41.325
I'm really sorry.

190
00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:43.725
You said I have a lot of time.

191
00:12:44.225 --> 00:12:47.794
You told me that I can impress my dad from now on.

192
00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:49.964
You're the one who told me that.

193
00:12:52.035 --> 00:12:54.035
A lot of time, my foot!

194
00:12:54.765 --> 00:12:56.435
There's no future with him.

195
00:12:57.205 --> 00:12:58.674
My dad is gone.

196
00:12:59.234 --> 00:13:02.705
How can I impress him? How?

197
00:14:17.114 --> 00:14:18.384
What are you doing there?

198
00:14:25.694 --> 00:14:29.524
Mom, Jae Chan is waiting for me outside right now.

199
00:14:31.734 --> 00:14:32.734
So?

200
00:14:34.265 --> 00:14:36.265
Tell him that I already left for work.

201
00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:38.705
All right.

202
00:14:48.344 --> 00:14:51.285
Hong Joo wants me to tell you that she left for work already.

203
00:14:51.314 --> 00:14:53.085
Did something happen? Did you guys fight?

204
00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:54.625
No, not at all.

205
00:14:55.225 --> 00:14:57.725
Hong Joo, come on out! You'll be late for work.

206
00:14:59.154 --> 00:15:00.294
Mom...

207
00:15:00.964 --> 00:15:02.024
Hong Joo!

208
00:15:03.395 --> 00:15:04.665
Okay.

209
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.435
I'm sorry. I'm a bit late.

210
00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:15.105
Let's go.

211
00:15:15.805 --> 00:15:17.575
See you later, Mom.

212
00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:19.844
All right, bye.

213
00:15:21.614 --> 00:15:23.515
- Have a great day. - See you.

214
00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:47.344
Are you avoiding me because of what happened yesterday?

215
00:15:48.674 --> 00:15:49.705
Yesterday?

216
00:15:50.774 --> 00:15:51.814
What happened yesterday?

217
00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:54.145
Did I see you yesterday?

218
00:15:55.185 --> 00:15:56.285
I can't remember.

219
00:15:58.384 --> 00:16:00.384
Then let's just say that it never happened.

220
00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:01.524
Is that what you want?

221
00:16:03.685 --> 00:16:04.825
What happened?

222
00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:07.694
I don't know what you're talking about.

223
00:16:11.064 --> 00:16:13.634
Nothing happened yesterday. Are we good now?

224
00:16:15.504 --> 00:16:16.535
Yes.

225
00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:19.004
So, let's not avoid each other.

226
00:16:19.575 --> 00:16:21.645
Stop disappearing whenever I'm looking for you.

227
00:16:28.645 --> 00:16:29.645
Let's go.

228
00:16:43.225 --> 00:16:46.634
Well, please fix it properly this time.

229
00:16:47.364 --> 00:16:49.034
This is the third time this month alone.

230
00:16:49.035 --> 00:16:50.575
It's moving season now, you know.

231
00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.535
This is happening because other companies keep touching the cables.

232
00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:57.074
Moving season is almost over, so it won't happen again.

233
00:16:57.075 --> 00:16:58.245
You say that every time,

234
00:16:58.415 --> 00:16:59.975
but it always breaks again.

235
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.055
Then you can just call me again.

236
00:17:07.984 --> 00:17:09.884
Well... Miss.

237
00:17:11.294 --> 00:17:14.064
When you receive the survey call this time,

238
00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:15.394
please put in a good word for me.

239
00:17:15.395 --> 00:17:17.294
I can only do that if it doesn't break again.

240
00:17:26.105 --> 00:17:28.444
Shall I take that out on my way out?

241
00:17:32.044 --> 00:17:33.575
Take care.

242
00:17:46.355 --> 00:17:48.793
Kyung Han, when will Lieutenant Han return to work?

243
00:17:48.794 --> 00:17:50.394
He said he'd be back next week.

244
00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:51.564
- Really? - Yes.

245
00:17:51.935 --> 00:17:55.133
Then shall we ask him if he wants to have dinner with us?

246
00:17:55.134 --> 00:17:57.034
Just let him get as much rest as possible.

247
00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.674
And you're on patrol with me.

248
00:17:59.835 --> 00:18:01.774
Why do you want to have dinner with him?

249
00:18:02.805 --> 00:18:04.075
That's exactly the reason.

250
00:18:04.575 --> 00:18:06.673
Because I'm on patrol with you,

251
00:18:06.674 --> 00:18:08.844
I at least wanted to see him for dinner.

252
00:18:10.444 --> 00:18:12.054
Patrol car 592 in Sangku Division.

253
00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:13.484
Report to the scene of an unnatural death.

254
00:18:14.524 --> 00:18:15.884
Patrol car 592, roger that.

255
00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:25.093
- What happened? - Are you okay, ma'am?

256
00:18:25.094 --> 00:18:27.605
I'm... I'm a housekeeper.

257
00:18:28.364 --> 00:18:29.734
When I opened the door, I saw...

258
00:18:32.004 --> 00:18:33.134
What on earth happened?

259
00:18:34.105 --> 00:18:35.205
My goodness.

260
00:18:35.774 --> 00:18:38.044
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

261
00:18:47.884 --> 00:18:49.284
The gold medalist archer, Yoo Su Kyung,

262
00:18:49.285 --> 00:18:52.423
was found dead on the 21st, and newly found evidence...

263
00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.024
revealed that she might have been murdered.

264
00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:59.463
The police are openly searching for the prime suspect, Do Hak Young.

265
00:18:59.464 --> 00:19:01.064
Reporter Nam Hong Joo will tell us more.

266
00:19:01.864 --> 00:19:04.233
The queen of archery, Yoo Su Kyung,

267
00:19:04.234 --> 00:19:07.305
was found dead at her home on the 21st.

268
00:19:07.475 --> 00:19:09.943
The police stated that she died of excessive bleeding...

269
00:19:09.944 --> 00:19:12.145
caused by the wound on the back of her head.

270
00:19:12.515 --> 00:19:14.883
The police are speculating her death to be homicide...

271
00:19:14.884 --> 00:19:17.144
because of the geometrical drawing...

272
00:19:17.145 --> 00:19:20.384
found at the scene which was made with her blood.

273
00:19:21.024 --> 00:19:23.423
Based on the autopsy results, the police are estimating...

274
00:19:23.424 --> 00:19:26.654
the time of her death to be sometime in the morning of the 21st.

275
00:19:26.855 --> 00:19:30.093
The only person who visited her home during that time frame...

276
00:19:30.094 --> 00:19:33.494
was a 29-year-old internet technician, Do Hak Young.

277
00:19:33.495 --> 00:19:36.003
Hence, the police has put out an APB for the suspect.

278
00:19:36.004 --> 00:19:38.074
Why are you so focused? Do you know that person?

279
00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:40.173
What? No, I've never seen him before.

280
00:19:40.174 --> 00:19:42.003
Because of her complaints...

281
00:19:42.004 --> 00:19:45.144
Ms. Yoon, I made a list of side dishes that I'm craving.

282
00:19:45.145 --> 00:19:46.474
Would I be able to take some home?

283
00:19:46.475 --> 00:19:48.043
I'd love to eat them at home.

284
00:19:48.044 --> 00:19:51.015
My gosh, of course. I've been waiting for this list.

285
00:19:51.154 --> 00:19:52.954
- Request accepted. - You're going home?

286
00:19:52.955 --> 00:19:54.524
Yes, I'll be going back to work soon.

287
00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:55.685
I should move back now.

288
00:19:55.785 --> 00:19:57.424
- Seriously? - Seriously?

289
00:20:01.395 --> 00:20:03.964
Gosh, I'm so sad. It's too bad.

290
00:20:04.895 --> 00:20:08.204
Here, you should eat these too. Stir-fried pork and rolled omelet.

291
00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:09.334
You're running late, Jae Chan.

292
00:20:09.335 --> 00:20:10.535
Right, I'm running late.

293
00:20:17.145 --> 00:20:20.745
How odd. It looks like the amount of my stuff has tripled.

294
00:20:20.944 --> 00:20:24.054
I'm sure it has. Think about all the things you've asked us to buy.

295
00:20:24.055 --> 00:20:26.015
And you asked for so much food too.

296
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:30.355
You said we should repay him.

297
00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:32.825
For a long time. Don't forget about what happened.

298
00:20:33.325 --> 00:20:35.964
I am repaying him. What more can I do?

299
00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:42.404
Get in. I'll drive you.

300
00:20:42.605 --> 00:20:44.475
- Thank you. - No problem at all.

301
00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:52.843
Shall I open the sunroof for you?

302
00:20:52.844 --> 00:20:55.515
Are you comfortable? I'm trying to drive very carefully.

303
00:20:55.884 --> 00:20:56.915
It's great.

304
00:20:57.884 --> 00:20:59.014
Oh, I see Cho Hee.

305
00:20:59.015 --> 00:21:00.015
- Really? - Really?

306
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:07.094
Thank goodness. I was worried about her.

307
00:21:07.154 --> 00:21:08.794
I know, right? I'm relieved too.

308
00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:21.404
What is it?

309
00:21:22.944 --> 00:21:23.975
It's nothing.

310
00:21:33.314 --> 00:21:36.555
This is radish kimchi, and this one is scallion kimchi.

311
00:21:38.024 --> 00:21:40.724
This is seaweed soup. I'll put it in your freezer,

312
00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:42.765
- so heat it up before you eat it. - Okay.

313
00:21:48.435 --> 00:21:49.904
Do you have to go to the hospital again?

314
00:21:50.134 --> 00:21:52.205
No, I got the stitches removed yesterday.

315
00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:54.105
Do you want to see?

316
00:21:54.174 --> 00:21:57.814
Gosh, seriously. See what? Why would I want to see that?

317
00:21:58.375 --> 00:21:59.914
Why do you keep doing this?

318
00:21:59.915 --> 00:22:01.114
All right, I heard you.

319
00:22:01.344 --> 00:22:03.213
- Shall I take a look? - No, it's okay.

320
00:22:03.214 --> 00:22:04.314
- It doesn't hurt, right? - Right.

321
00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:07.325
I must say, you're such a handful.

322
00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:11.724
My mom wants you to come by for breakfast every day.

323
00:22:11.725 --> 00:22:13.293
She just needs to put out an extra set of cutlery.

324
00:22:13.294 --> 00:22:15.024
And tell me when you run out of the foods.

325
00:22:15.064 --> 00:22:16.064
Okay.

326
00:22:16.065 --> 00:22:18.334
Call me if you need anything. I'll come right away.

327
00:22:18.335 --> 00:22:20.835
Don't worry. You've done enough for me.

328
00:22:21.205 --> 00:22:23.133
- Sorry? - Thanks to you guys,

329
00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:24.835
I had such a great time for the last few days.

330
00:22:24.935 --> 00:22:28.403
So, let's call it even now. You guys don't owe me anything.

331
00:22:28.404 --> 00:22:29.504
What are you talking about?

332
00:22:29.605 --> 00:22:31.015
You're right, Jae Chan.

333
00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:34.884
I neither want to boast about my injury nor resent you guys.

334
00:22:35.884 --> 00:22:39.085
I'm just so glad that you're okay.

335
00:22:41.984 --> 00:22:44.995
So, I don't want you to cry even for a brief moment.

336
00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:47.825
Don't beat yourself up either, okay?

337
00:22:51.665 --> 00:22:53.534
Wait, does that mean...

338
00:22:53.535 --> 00:22:55.535
Were you at the park?

339
00:22:55.564 --> 00:22:57.774
No, I saw it in my dream.

340
00:22:58.575 --> 00:23:00.305
You two were agonizing yourselves at the park.

341
00:23:06.774 --> 00:23:09.113
Is that why you made us do all the work for you?

342
00:23:09.114 --> 00:23:10.285
Are you realizing that just now?

343
00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:12.084
Gosh, that hurts my feelings.

344
00:23:12.085 --> 00:23:14.424
I'd never inconvenience others for no reason.

345
00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:15.725
Get in.

346
00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:29.605
He bossed us around like that so that we could feel unburdened.

347
00:23:30.105 --> 00:23:31.234
I had no idea.

348
00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:36.745
What's that look on your face? Are you mad?

349
00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:39.113
After putting us through all of that,

350
00:23:39.114 --> 00:23:42.444
he made himself look cool with just one remark. Frankly, it's not fair.

351
00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:44.254
He made me look like the pettiest person.

352
00:23:44.355 --> 00:23:45.384
What?

353
00:23:45.455 --> 00:23:47.825
Gosh, I didn't think Woo Tak could do something like this.

354
00:23:48.024 --> 00:23:49.855
He has a mysterious side to him.

355
00:23:53.555 --> 00:23:55.265
I'm a third-generation only son.

356
00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:59.234
When I was a kid, a persimmon fell on my head.

357
00:23:59.435 --> 00:24:02.864
My parents cut down all persimmon trees in the area right away.

358
00:24:05.535 --> 00:24:06.634
You're right.

359
00:24:07.805 --> 00:24:09.774
There's something mysterious about him.

360
00:24:33.234 --> 00:24:34.734
What's your relationship with Do Hak Young?

361
00:24:34.805 --> 00:24:36.265
We went to high school together,

362
00:24:36.634 --> 00:24:38.475
and he was my roommate until a year and a half ago.

363
00:24:38.535 --> 00:24:41.043
Did you also think that he could be the killer...

364
00:24:41.044 --> 00:24:43.105
when you first heard about the incident?

365
00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:45.015
Yes.

366
00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:51.254
(Hong Joo)

367
00:25:05.864 --> 00:25:07.094
(Hong Joo)

368
00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:09.734
Hello?

369
00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:11.534
Are you okay? Did anything happen?

370
00:25:11.535 --> 00:25:13.403
No, nothing happened. Why do you ask?

371
00:25:13.404 --> 00:25:15.104
I just had a dream about you.

372
00:25:15.105 --> 00:25:17.214
You remember the wanted suspect, Do Hak Young, right?

373
00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:19.344
That guy barged into your place in my dream.

374
00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:20.984
Why would he come to my place?

375
00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:23.384
You know him, don't you?

376
00:25:23.645 --> 00:25:25.213
You were pretending like you didn't know him, right?

377
00:25:25.214 --> 00:25:27.484
Not at all. I really don't know him.

378
00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:29.725
I don't think that dream means anything.

379
00:25:31.524 --> 00:25:32.654
Did you lock your door?

380
00:25:33.154 --> 00:25:36.294
You know what? You should call the police immediately, Woo Tak.

381
00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:40.265
Why should I call the police when I'm a police officer?

382
00:25:40.364 --> 00:25:43.264
I saw that guy grabbing and threatening you in my dream.

383
00:25:43.265 --> 00:25:45.475
Okay, all right. Don't worry.

384
00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:48.575
I'll make sure to lock the door, so don't worry and sleep well.

385
00:25:48.674 --> 00:25:49.805
Good night.

386
00:26:02.524 --> 00:26:03.625
Why are you here?

387
00:26:04.794 --> 00:26:05.794
Do Hak Young.

388
00:26:16.535 --> 00:26:17.835
You haven't changed the passcode.

389
00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:22.274
Did I move out...

390
00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:24.875
over a year ago?

391
00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.344
This guy...

392
00:26:29.814 --> 00:26:31.154
still remembers me too.

393
00:26:55.944 --> 00:26:57.214
You haven't answered my question.

394
00:26:58.515 --> 00:26:59.674
What brings you here?

395
00:27:03.785 --> 00:27:04.814
Woo Tak.

396
00:27:09.254 --> 00:27:10.484
I've become a murderer.

397
00:27:14.924 --> 00:27:16.825
I saw it on the news. The police are looking for you.

398
00:27:19.564 --> 00:27:23.004
Hey, I really didn't do it.

399
00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:24.704
I did go into her place,

400
00:27:24.705 --> 00:27:27.305
but I left as soon as I fixed her internet.

401
00:27:27.944 --> 00:27:31.044
They're saying that I killed her. I really didn't do it,

402
00:27:31.214 --> 00:27:32.915
but everyone is saying that I'm the killer.

403
00:27:36.185 --> 00:27:38.685
Gosh, I can't believe that this is happening.

404
00:27:41.754 --> 00:27:43.825
All right, you should turn yourself in first.

405
00:27:44.355 --> 00:27:46.094
I'll go with you, okay?

406
00:27:47.024 --> 00:27:49.964
I will turn myself in. I will, but...

407
00:27:54.634 --> 00:27:55.665
Woo Tak.

408
00:27:57.575 --> 00:27:59.975
You'll help me, right?

409
00:28:00.274 --> 00:28:03.173
You're the most competent guy I know.

410
00:28:03.174 --> 00:28:05.645
You have connections because you're a cop, and you're smart too.

411
00:28:05.915 --> 00:28:08.245
That's why I'm here.

412
00:28:09.015 --> 00:28:10.814
You believe me, right?

413
00:28:11.254 --> 00:28:12.714
You'll be on my side, right?

414
00:28:16.754 --> 00:28:17.995
If I tell you that I believe you,

415
00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:21.064
will you turn yourself in?

416
00:28:25.594 --> 00:28:26.694
Hak Young.

417
00:28:30.464 --> 00:28:31.734
Hey, if...

418
00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:35.575
If I end up becoming a murderer like this,

419
00:28:38.245 --> 00:28:40.314
I'll disclose your secret to the police.

420
00:28:57.234 --> 00:28:58.265
Hak Young.

421
00:28:58.364 --> 00:28:59.535
You don't want that, do you?

422
00:29:00.134 --> 00:29:01.234
So,

423
00:29:01.935 --> 00:29:03.805
you must...

424
00:29:06.134 --> 00:29:07.504
prove my innocence at all costs.

425
00:29:35.634 --> 00:29:39.544
