00:00:19.943 --> 00:00:22.143
- Hello? - Is this Ms. Yoon Ji Ho?

2
00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:24.184
Yes, who is it?

3
00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:25.943
It's me, the alley guy.

4
00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:27.413
The alley guy?

5
00:00:28.513 --> 00:00:31.353
Oh, you're the guy I met when I was looking for Bok Nam.

6
00:00:31.423 --> 00:00:32.654
Yes, that's right.

7
00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:34.993
What's happening?

8
00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:36.693
I had something to ask you.

9
00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:38.824
- Do you have a note beside you? - A note?

10
00:00:40.294 --> 00:00:41.434
Yes, I do.

11
00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:43.663
What about a pen?

12
00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:45.864
I have a pen too.

13
00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:47.873
- What about a boyfriend? - A boy...

14
00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:52.974
- Pardon? - Do you have a boyfriend?

15
00:01:01.913 --> 00:01:03.313
I don't have...

16
00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:10.624
a boyfriend.

17
00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:20.004
I'll be going.

18
00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:35.053
Why would you ask me that?

19
00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:37.553
I saw Bok Nam in the alley.

20
00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:38.924
He was walking around alone again.

21
00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:42.353
Really? Did Bok Nam run away from home again?

22
00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:47.394
But...

23
00:01:48.493 --> 00:01:50.364
it has nothing to do with me now.

24
00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:53.874
I'm sure they found a new staff already.

25
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.704
Should I tell you the name of the restaurant?

26
00:01:57.704 --> 00:01:59.543
You can call them directly.

27
00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:00.913
The same alley I saw you last time.

28
00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:03.213
- Pardon? - Come there by 11:30am.

29
00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:05.344
Find Bok Nam by then.

30
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.914
Hello? But why should I...

31
00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:10.324
Hello?

32
00:02:19.364 --> 00:02:20.533
What was the time again?

33
00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:22.433
Was it 11am?

34
00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:24.864
It's 11:30am.

35
00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:34.444
The dog is all by himself.

36
00:02:36.884 --> 00:02:39.414
Yes, it's because I don't have a job.

37
00:02:39.984 --> 00:02:41.553
I have time on my hands.

38
00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:47.394
What? You're always napping too.

39
00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:49.954
What?

40
00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:10.544
- Is he a celebrity? - Seriously.

41
00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:13.144
- He's so handsome. - No kidding.

42
00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:15.514
What is going on?

43
00:03:15.514 --> 00:03:17.384
We're screening profiles,

44
00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:20.084
and we found the hottest member that signed up to date.

45
00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:23.924
No way. That's the highest score.

46
00:03:24.123 --> 00:03:25.963
- I'm so jealous. - He made it.

47
00:03:26.563 --> 00:03:29.134
Isn't that the highest score we've had so far?

48
00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:30.903
We never had any male members get above nine.

49
00:03:30.903 --> 00:03:32.403
- Yes. - He's the first.

50
00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:36.433
This means he's the type young people like these days.

51
00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:39.044
- He's a pappy-like guy. - A puppy-like guy.

52
00:03:40.813 --> 00:03:42.574
- How old is he? - He's 24.

53
00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:45.813
That means I'm two years older.

54
00:03:45.843 --> 00:03:48.384
(Diamond score: 9.18)

55
00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:56.454
- Mom! - Dad.

56
00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:00.063
Why did you make such an ugly face? You surprised me.

57
00:04:00.664 --> 00:04:01.734
Look who's talking.

58
00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:04.764
What about Bok Nam?

59
00:04:05.764 --> 00:04:06.834
Follow me.

60
00:04:13.204 --> 00:04:14.213
Wait...

61
00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:18.043
Why are we going in there? What about Bok Nam?

62
00:04:18.314 --> 00:04:19.983
Come in so we can find him.

63
00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:21.454
No.

64
00:04:22.913 --> 00:04:24.824
I can't go in here.

65
00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:27.454
I didn't make the cut.

66
00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:28.554
What?

67
00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:32.124
Didn't the owner ask you to find Bok Nam?

68
00:04:32.723 --> 00:04:33.793
Exactly.

69
00:04:34.434 --> 00:04:36.804
He asked me to find his dog when we first met,

70
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:40.064
but he never called me after.

71
00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:42.304
That must mean I didn't get the job.

72
00:04:42.374 --> 00:04:43.944
What? Why?

73
00:04:44.343 --> 00:04:46.704
How can you fail an interview after going to university?

74
00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:50.713
It's possible...

75
00:04:50.913 --> 00:04:53.954
It could be my age or my experience.

76
00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:57.554
The owner might find me uncomfortable.

77
00:04:57.554 --> 00:04:58.754
Uncomfortable? No way.

78
00:04:58.954 --> 00:05:00.994
How can he feel uncomfortable with you?

79
00:05:00.994 --> 00:05:02.954
You look like a complete pushover.

80
00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:05.064
How can he not recognize you?

81
00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:06.863
He really has no talent in recruiting.

82
00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:10.533
Is this a compliment?

83
00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:11.863
Of course.

84
00:05:11.863 --> 00:05:14.173
You're working hard today because of Bok Nam again.

85
00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:16.903
The owner is horrible.

86
00:05:17.403 --> 00:05:18.973
He was the one that asked you to find his dog first.

87
00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:21.314
How can he fail you for a part-time job?

88
00:05:23.884 --> 00:05:24.983
Let's go in.

89
00:05:25.084 --> 00:05:26.644
We should find out why he failed you at least.

90
00:05:27.184 --> 00:05:28.613
Why should I?

91
00:05:28.684 --> 00:05:29.853
Excuse me!

92
00:05:30.523 --> 00:05:32.624
Please wait one moment. Thank you.

93
00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:34.194
Gosh.

94
00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:37.293
Hey, Bok Nam. You jerk.

95
00:05:37.694 --> 00:05:39.793
It's been so busy. Where have you been?

96
00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:40.934
Bok Nam?

97
00:05:41.894 --> 00:05:44.603
That's why I brought a new part-time worker.

98
00:05:44.764 --> 00:05:47.273
Hey, Bok Nam. I didn't ask you to do this.

99
00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:49.834
Where is Bok Nam anyway?

100
00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:55.644
I'll use her as my assistant starting tomorrow.

101
00:05:55.644 --> 00:05:57.814
Hey, Yeon Bok Nam...

102
00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:00.853
"Bok Nam"...

103
00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:04.184
Fluffy brown hair.

104
00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:06.523
Pink.

105
00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:09.223
Bok Nam was a man?

106
00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:15.264
If you don't hire her, I'll quit.

107
00:06:15.264 --> 00:06:16.394
- What? - What?

108
00:06:25.444 --> 00:06:27.973
I was going to call you,

109
00:06:28.074 --> 00:06:30.413
but the store was busy.

110
00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:31.814
- I see. - Yes.

111
00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:37.554
By the way, I wonder if you think I'm unfit...

112
00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:40.824
but you're forced to hire me due to the pressure from Bok Nam.

113
00:06:40.824 --> 00:06:44.194
No, no. It's fine as long as Bok Nam likes you.

114
00:06:44.194 --> 00:06:45.923
One must like their colleagues.

115
00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:48.163
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

116
00:06:48.334 --> 00:06:50.533
Okay. Thank you.

117
00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:11.283
Excuse me.

118
00:07:12.324 --> 00:07:13.523
Did you get hired?

119
00:07:14.994 --> 00:07:16.624
- Yes. - I'm glad.

120
00:07:18.663 --> 00:07:21.334
Why are you doing this to me?

121
00:07:22.064 --> 00:07:24.463
- Which? - Pardon?

122
00:07:25.004 --> 00:07:26.163
Are you talking about calling you out?

123
00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:27.874
Or not telling you my name?

124
00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:30.473
Or is it about getting you a job? Which one?

125
00:07:35.113 --> 00:07:38.043
Well... All three.

126
00:07:38.514 --> 00:07:40.954
Bok Nam! You need to make a delivery...

127
00:07:40.954 --> 00:07:42.153
- right now. - Okay.

128
00:07:47.853 --> 00:07:48.954
Come here.

129
00:07:49.994 --> 00:07:51.093
Why?

130
00:07:51.163 --> 00:07:52.894
Didn't you just ask me a question?

131
00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:01.033
What's wrong with you?

132
00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:02.903
I was told to make a delivery.

133
00:08:02.903 --> 00:08:04.874
Get on. I'll tell you when we get there.

134
00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:08.444
- Really? - I said, get on.

135
00:08:08.444 --> 00:08:09.874
I'm busy.

136
00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:15.153
The kimchi was good.

137
00:08:15.153 --> 00:08:17.353
Let's try and eat lunch outside of the office.

138
00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:18.523
Let's be humane.

139
00:08:30.064 --> 00:08:31.533
It's Se Hee's wife.

140
00:08:39.944 --> 00:08:41.044
Here.

141
00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:55.794
You should take it easy.

142
00:08:56.154 --> 00:08:59.164
Tell me. Why did you do that?

143
00:08:59.824 --> 00:09:02.893
Why do you think? It's because I like you.

144
00:09:04.003 --> 00:09:05.133
Me?

145
00:09:05.564 --> 00:09:06.733
Who else?

146
00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:11.373
Yes, sir. Yes.

147
00:09:11.373 --> 00:09:13.174
I'm nearby. Can I come now?

148
00:09:13.643 --> 00:09:15.613
Yes. Yes.

149
00:09:16.544 --> 00:09:18.544
- See you tomorrow. - Wait.

150
00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:22.914
I think I made you misunderstand.

151
00:09:23.113 --> 00:09:25.954
I don't have a boyfriend,

152
00:09:27.623 --> 00:09:28.893
but I have a husband.

153
00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:41.404
It must be her little brother.

154
00:09:41.404 --> 00:09:42.503
They look exactly the same.

155
00:09:43.074 --> 00:09:45.774
What are you talking about? We saw her brother at the wedding.

156
00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:55.054
- So what? - Pardon?

157
00:09:55.054 --> 00:09:57.684
So what if you have a husband? What should I do?

158
00:09:59.623 --> 00:10:02.324
If you have a husband, can't you have a boyfriend?

159
00:10:11.934 --> 00:10:15.434
(Episode 6: Because This Is My First YOLO)

160
00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:20.473
He said what?

161
00:10:20.513 --> 00:10:22.373
"If you have a husband, can't you have a boyfriend?"

162
00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:25.643
Then what did you say?

163
00:10:25.843 --> 00:10:28.954
Nothing. I was too stunned to say anything.

164
00:10:29.314 --> 00:10:31.324
Kids these days are so bold.

165
00:10:33.554 --> 00:10:34.694
How old is he again? 24?

166
00:10:34.694 --> 00:10:36.654
Yes. He's 24.

167
00:10:37.064 --> 00:10:39.593
How can he play such a joke?

168
00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:44.564
Soo Ji, work hard at your job.

169
00:10:44.564 --> 00:10:46.834
Even if it's hard, hang in there until the end. Okay?

170
00:10:49.904 --> 00:10:52.843
There's nothing I can do after I quit being a writer.

171
00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:56.414
I'm halfway to being 60, but I'm working with a guy...

172
00:10:56.414 --> 00:10:58.284
that's younger than my brother while being made fun of.

173
00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:01.684
I don't think that's something you should say to someone...

174
00:11:01.684 --> 00:11:04.584
who gets made fun of by old men every day.

175
00:11:05.424 --> 00:11:06.584
Sorry.

176
00:11:08.554 --> 00:11:11.593
What about Ho Rang? Isn't the restaurant closed today?

177
00:11:12.794 --> 00:11:14.934
She's in complete shock right now.

178
00:11:15.194 --> 00:11:16.294
Why?

179
00:11:22.204 --> 00:11:23.973
But you love me.

180
00:11:24.103 --> 00:11:27.074
Of course. You know I can't live without you.

181
00:11:27.314 --> 00:11:30.914
But I don't know if getting married is the same as loving someone.

182
00:11:31.513 --> 00:11:33.613
- What? - Marriage is about having kids...

183
00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.784
and being responsible.

184
00:11:36.013 --> 00:11:37.623
So how I can do such things?

185
00:11:38.753 --> 00:11:41.253
Love and marriage...

186
00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.564
are separate things.

187
00:11:48.564 --> 00:11:49.963
Wake up, Ho Rang.

188
00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:51.834
It's no time for you to be like this.

189
00:11:59.743 --> 00:12:02.213
Who could it be? Did they forget our radish?

190
00:12:02.574 --> 00:12:03.784
I have it right here.

191
00:12:06.444 --> 00:12:07.584
Who is it?

192
00:12:07.954 --> 00:12:09.914
Me! Me!

193
00:12:15.753 --> 00:12:17.524
What happened? I thought you couldn't come.

194
00:12:19.623 --> 00:12:22.133
Recommend some books for me.

195
00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:24.603
Books? To read?

196
00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:26.404
Why do you need books?

197
00:12:29.074 --> 00:12:30.574
What kind of books?

198
00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:34.473
About reproduction of mankind and the necessity of marriage.

199
00:12:34.973 --> 00:12:37.914
Why? Is this about Won Seok?

200
00:12:38.544 --> 00:12:39.743
Are you all right?

201
00:12:39.914 --> 00:12:42.154
Did you go insane from the shock?

202
00:12:43.314 --> 00:12:46.154
No. I have a clearer head now.

203
00:12:46.454 --> 00:12:50.223
What? He loves me, but he's unsure about marriage?

204
00:12:50.763 --> 00:12:52.294
If he says that, did he think I'd go...

205
00:12:52.824 --> 00:12:54.893
"If you love me,"

206
00:12:54.963 --> 00:12:57.404
"why am I not in your future?"

207
00:13:01.534 --> 00:13:03.603
Should I be crying to myself in my room?

208
00:13:05.204 --> 00:13:08.013
Who does he take me for?

209
00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:09.343
I'm getting goosebumps.

210
00:13:09.513 --> 00:13:10.914
At this rate, she'll go to Cannes.

211
00:13:11.643 --> 00:13:12.643
You know, don't you?

212
00:13:12.643 --> 00:13:14.883
It took me seven years to fix Won Seok from an AlphaGo...

213
00:13:14.883 --> 00:13:16.853
to the perfect boyfriend he is today.

214
00:13:17.483 --> 00:13:20.753
I've only trained him to be a boyfriend until now.

215
00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:23.024
I'll have to turn him into a husband material.

216
00:13:24.723 --> 00:13:27.334
I'm going to the bookstore, so chat me book titles.

217
00:13:27.334 --> 00:13:29.164
Hey, eat before you go.

218
00:13:29.363 --> 00:13:31.534
Forget it. I have no time to chat around with you.

219
00:13:31.534 --> 00:13:33.774
A guy born in 1994 asked for Ji Ho's number.

220
00:13:33.774 --> 00:13:34.873
Hey.

221
00:13:38.304 --> 00:13:40.274
1994? How old is that?

222
00:13:40.274 --> 00:13:41.373
24.

223
00:13:45.643 --> 00:13:47.814
- Bring out the soju. - All right.

224
00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:56.024
- You're late. - Yes.

225
00:14:02.263 --> 00:14:04.263
Did the cat throw up?

226
00:14:04.263 --> 00:14:06.164
Yes, I guess so.

227
00:14:06.164 --> 00:14:07.473
I saw it after I came home.

228
00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:10.204
Will she be okay? Is she sick?

229
00:14:10.204 --> 00:14:12.873
Sometimes, cats throw up for no reason,

230
00:14:13.074 --> 00:14:16.113
but I should take her to the vet just in case.

231
00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:20.454
If you're getting off work late, in the afternoon...

232
00:14:20.454 --> 00:14:22.814
I just feel a bit uncomfortable.

233
00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:24.554
She is my cat,

234
00:14:25.383 --> 00:14:27.924
and someone else is calling her by a different name.

235
00:14:28.593 --> 00:14:29.723
It's uncomfortable.

236
00:14:30.524 --> 00:14:32.623
Pardon? In the afternoon?

237
00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:38.904
Oh, I'm going to work in the afternoon.

238
00:14:39.034 --> 00:14:40.603
I found a job.

239
00:14:41.674 --> 00:14:44.444
Yes. YOLO cafe near my office.

240
00:14:46.174 --> 00:14:48.713
I saw you near the company this afternoon.

241
00:14:49.774 --> 00:14:51.143
You were riding on the back seat of the motorbike.

242
00:14:54.113 --> 00:14:57.723
Right, I went nearby the company a while ago. Did you see?

243
00:14:57.824 --> 00:15:01.393
The part-timer there told me to hop on because we were busy.

244
00:15:02.223 --> 00:15:04.723
That punk is too playful.

245
00:15:05.223 --> 00:15:06.463
Since the first day...

246
00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:09.434
You seem to have gotten close with him since the first day.

247
00:15:09.834 --> 00:15:10.934
With that part-timer.

248
00:15:11.263 --> 00:15:14.574
Well... It's just because we work together there.

249
00:15:14.704 --> 00:15:18.343
You just work together there, but you seem to be very close...

250
00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:19.873
with that part-timer.

251
00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.743
I'll let you rest then.

252
00:15:26.814 --> 00:15:27.914
Well...

253
00:15:30.654 --> 00:15:34.093
Are you mad at me by any chance?

254
00:15:34.454 --> 00:15:36.554
No. Why would I be?

255
00:15:47.204 --> 00:15:50.103
He's right. Why would he be?

256
00:15:50.973 --> 00:15:52.444
There's no way.

257
00:15:54.274 --> 00:15:56.243
Maybe he's down because of the cat.

258
00:16:14.893 --> 00:16:16.934
- Goodness. - It's good.

259
00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:19.133
(Come to YOLO Cafe, Age 24, Living in Seoul, College Student)

260
00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:24.373
It's that man from earlier.

261
00:16:25.003 --> 00:16:26.973
- Right? - You're right.

262
00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:29.473
Maybe he works part-time at YOLO Cafe.

263
00:16:29.873 --> 00:16:31.343
They recently opened.

264
00:16:32.143 --> 00:16:35.013
I heard Ji Ho was looking for a part-time work.

265
00:16:35.013 --> 00:16:38.054
They must be colleagues.

266
00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:42.493
But it's strange for a part-timer to drive such a bike.

267
00:16:42.924 --> 00:16:45.564
- Isn't it around 40,000 dollars? - Some cost double the amount.

268
00:16:46.893 --> 00:16:48.194
You have a point.

269
00:16:48.934 --> 00:16:51.334
Why does he work part-time when he owns this expensive bike?

270
00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:53.503
It doesn't make sense.

271
00:17:05.113 --> 00:17:09.514
(Come to YOLO Cafe, Age 24, Living in Seoul, College Student)

00:17:28.433 --> 00:17:31.474
(Occupancy Application)

273
00:17:35.843 --> 00:17:37.143
Shall I turn off the lights?

274
00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:39.014
Later after I'm done watching this.

275
00:17:39.484 --> 00:17:40.613
What are you watching?

276
00:17:44.054 --> 00:17:45.153
Ho Rang.

277
00:17:46.224 --> 00:17:48.193
Why are you watching that? It's not like you.

278
00:17:50.093 --> 00:17:53.764
Sorry, please understand. I'm on my ovulation day.

279
00:17:54.534 --> 00:17:56.163
What does it have to do with that video?

280
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.834
Women experience a sharp rise in Luteinizing hormone in this period.

281
00:18:01.334 --> 00:18:02.574
What?

282
00:18:04.173 --> 00:18:07.413
It causes the increase in estrogen levels.

283
00:18:07.913 --> 00:18:10.784
Maybe it's because I have more desire in breeding...

284
00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:13.853
that I instinctively look for these muscular men.

285
00:18:18.953 --> 00:18:20.084
What are you doing?

286
00:18:20.453 --> 00:18:23.393
So you're saying that you have a high level of...

287
00:18:23.524 --> 00:18:24.964
estrogen, right?

288
00:18:25.123 --> 00:18:28.193
A strong boyfriend like myself is here...

289
00:18:28.193 --> 00:18:29.693
to release your hormones.

290
00:18:30.504 --> 00:18:32.564
I need to find my reason of existence tonight.

291
00:18:36.974 --> 00:18:40.044
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do it tonight.

292
00:18:40.843 --> 00:18:42.413
What are you talking about?

293
00:18:43.343 --> 00:18:46.683
It's true that women's sexual desire is the highest during this period.

294
00:18:46.883 --> 00:18:50.054
Still, they don't allow any man as their partners.

295
00:18:50.123 --> 00:18:52.653
Psychologically speaking, females instinctively look for...

296
00:18:52.653 --> 00:18:56.294
a safe and stable man who can protect them.

297
00:18:58.064 --> 00:19:00.633
We have no intention in marriage,

298
00:19:01.093 --> 00:19:04.834
so I think my body instinctively takes you as a dangerous factor.

299
00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:07.603
It's the same for certain type of birds too. The female birds...

300
00:19:07.603 --> 00:19:11.274
leave their partners if the male birds don't build a stable nest.

301
00:19:12.343 --> 00:19:13.843
What, birds?

302
00:19:14.314 --> 00:19:16.544
I didn't know there were such birds.

303
00:19:17.014 --> 00:19:18.744
Anyway, it's about animals.

304
00:19:18.744 --> 00:19:21.653
You and I are not birds.

305
00:19:22.353 --> 00:19:25.754
Humans are animals too. Haven't you read "The Selfish Gene"?

306
00:19:25.784 --> 00:19:29.024
“Humans are survival machines blindly programmed to preserve..."

307
00:19:29.024 --> 00:19:30.964
"the selfish molecules known as genes."

308
00:19:33.494 --> 00:19:35.334
You sure you read that book?

309
00:19:35.564 --> 00:19:38.534
So please understand during my ovulation period.

310
00:19:38.863 --> 00:19:40.903
I need a means to release my desire.

311
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.514
- Ho Rang. - Yes?

312
00:19:48.443 --> 00:19:49.613
Do you love me?

313
00:19:50.183 --> 00:19:53.383
Of course. You know that I can't live without you.

314
00:19:53.613 --> 00:19:56.554
Then stop watching that stuff and sleep with me.

315
00:20:00.054 --> 00:20:02.324
I've given it some thought after listening to your opinion.

316
00:20:02.754 --> 00:20:05.024
There's a chance of pregnancy if I sleep with you.

317
00:20:05.024 --> 00:20:08.764
We have to think about possible risks no matter how careful we are.

318
00:20:09.393 --> 00:20:12.903
I can't do such a thing with someone unsure.

319
00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:14.834
So...

320
00:20:15.603 --> 00:20:18.343
I won't sleep with you just because I love you.

321
00:20:20.744 --> 00:20:21.774
What?

322
00:20:25.214 --> 00:20:26.613
It's hard.

323
00:20:27.183 --> 00:20:30.284
This thought comes to my mind from time to time.

324
00:20:31.153 --> 00:20:34.653
"Are love and sexual desire the same thing?"

325
00:20:38.224 --> 00:20:39.363
Ho Rang.

326
00:20:39.593 --> 00:20:42.193
Where did you get those glasses?

327
00:20:43.064 --> 00:20:44.264
I bought them today.

328
00:20:44.403 --> 00:20:46.363
They've got a new part-timer in the optician's near home.

329
00:20:46.603 --> 00:20:49.004
He looks like this guy.

330
00:21:12.824 --> 00:21:14.564
You're up early.

331
00:21:15.534 --> 00:21:18.564
Yes, I have to work starting today.

332
00:21:37.724 --> 00:21:39.584
I didn't get to have breakfast yet.

333
00:21:40.024 --> 00:21:41.054
I see.

334
00:21:45.163 --> 00:21:46.423
You want one?

335
00:21:48.064 --> 00:21:50.433
It's nice to have it as a breakfast substitute.

336
00:21:51.004 --> 00:21:53.034
Thank you.

337
00:22:02.574 --> 00:22:03.744
Thank you.

338
00:22:05.214 --> 00:22:07.953
- You get off at the next station? - Yes.

339
00:22:08.853 --> 00:22:10.953
The cafe is located near the company.

340
00:22:11.284 --> 00:22:12.623
I know.

341
00:22:13.153 --> 00:22:15.153
Come if you have time.

342
00:22:17.464 --> 00:22:20.834
I'd like to avoid situations...

343
00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:25.064
in which we have to act like a married couple.

344
00:22:29.004 --> 00:22:30.143
Never mind.

345
00:22:33.403 --> 00:22:35.173
I'll see you at home later.

346
00:22:42.683 --> 00:22:43.724
Ji Ho.

347
00:22:57.663 --> 00:22:59.964
- Ji Ho? - Then how should I call you?

348
00:23:00.703 --> 00:23:02.534
You're older than me, but you're still cute.

349
00:23:02.974 --> 00:23:05.343
- I'll call you by your name. - What?

350
00:23:09.474 --> 00:23:11.183
Still, don't be too casual to me.

351
00:23:11.613 --> 00:23:13.413
I'm more conservative than I look.

352
00:23:13.883 --> 00:23:15.853
I don't want my date to treat me too casually.

353
00:23:25.123 --> 00:23:27.294
Are there private lessons that teach people those flirting skills?

354
00:23:29.764 --> 00:23:30.903
He's unbelievable.

355
00:23:35.933 --> 00:23:37.843
- Wash these too, please. - Okay.

356
00:23:51.423 --> 00:23:52.724
No, let me do it.

357
00:23:52.883 --> 00:23:54.294
I'm almost done already.

358
00:23:55.093 --> 00:23:57.593
Where did you get the hair tie?

359
00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:02.633
I bought it on my way to work.

360
00:24:03.163 --> 00:24:05.203
You look much prettier with your hair tied like this.

361
00:24:05.433 --> 00:24:07.774
What? Well, you've never...

362
00:24:07.804 --> 00:24:10.504
seen me tie my hair.

363
00:24:11.544 --> 00:24:12.943
I've never tied my hair in here before.

364
00:24:14.274 --> 00:24:16.613
That's... I'm just saying you might look much prettier.

365
00:24:18.214 --> 00:24:21.484
Tie your hair. You have such a pretty neckline.

366
00:24:35.334 --> 00:24:38.133
Are you at work? What about the young part-timer?

367
00:24:38.163 --> 00:24:40.103
Was he surprised when you said you're married?

368
00:24:40.974 --> 00:24:44.074
No, he didn't seem surprised at all.

369
00:24:44.474 --> 00:24:45.974
What? Does he still try to flirt with you?

370
00:24:46.173 --> 00:24:47.373
I don't know.

371
00:24:47.474 --> 00:24:50.044
I don't know if he just wants to fool around or really likes me.

372
00:24:50.343 --> 00:24:53.453
Earlier, he even bought me a hair tie and said he would tie my hair.

373
00:24:53.514 --> 00:24:56.613
What? Isn't that sexual harassment?

374
00:24:56.853 --> 00:24:58.683
How dare he?

375
00:24:58.754 --> 00:25:00.024
What a pervert.

376
00:25:00.024 --> 00:25:02.224
We should show him a lesson.

377
00:25:02.524 --> 00:25:04.593
- Ji Ho, just wait for a bit. - We'll be there soon.

378
00:25:12.064 --> 00:25:14.203
I'm sorry. You said you wanted no whipped cream.

379
00:25:14.703 --> 00:25:16.334
I totally forgot. I will make it again.

380
00:25:16.334 --> 00:25:17.843
Please don't do that. It's totally fine.

381
00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:20.274
I lose my weight easily. I'm fine with the cream now.

382
00:25:20.544 --> 00:25:22.974
Thank you so much. I will drink every drop of it.

383
00:25:24.943 --> 00:25:27.484
Here's your lavender tea.

384
00:25:27.653 --> 00:25:29.183
Please be careful. It's really hot.

385
00:25:30.554 --> 00:25:31.784
Enjoy.

386
00:25:39.264 --> 00:25:41.933
Guys. You said it was sexual harassment.

387
00:25:42.234 --> 00:25:44.163
You said you were going to show him a lesson.

388
00:25:44.504 --> 00:25:48.903
My friend, this is a chance to make your lifetime memory.

389
00:25:48.903 --> 00:25:50.673
You are insane. Be quiet.

390
00:25:51.044 --> 00:25:52.744
Should I not get married?

391
00:25:53.143 --> 00:25:55.873
I don't think I've experienced the world enough.

392
00:25:57.044 --> 00:25:59.183
What's wrong with you?

393
00:26:14.334 --> 00:26:16.804
- Thank you, sir. - We enjoyed the meal.

394
00:26:16.804 --> 00:26:19.334
Don't worry about it. I'm your boss. I can do this.

395
00:26:19.334 --> 00:26:20.633
It didn't even cost me 1,000 dollars.

396
00:26:20.633 --> 00:26:23.943
Se Hee will pay for your desert!

397
00:26:23.943 --> 00:26:25.903
- Awesome! - That's amazing!

398
00:26:25.903 --> 00:26:28.014
Let's go where Ji Ho works.

399
00:26:28.014 --> 00:26:30.014
It's really good.

400
00:26:30.014 --> 00:26:31.814
- It's also famous around here. - Okay.

401
00:26:31.814 --> 00:26:33.484
Let's go!

402
00:26:33.484 --> 00:26:35.814
- Okay! - I love cake!

403
00:26:35.814 --> 00:26:37.953
- Are you buying us cake? - I love it!

404
00:26:43.764 --> 00:26:45.294
- Hello. - Ji Ho!

405
00:26:45.494 --> 00:26:48.093
- Hi! - Hello.

406
00:26:48.464 --> 00:26:49.794
We came here for some cake.

407
00:26:49.994 --> 00:26:51.163
I see the cake!

408
00:26:51.163 --> 00:26:53.574
- Look at the color. - It looks delicious.

409
00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:56.133
- The chocolate one looks good. - This one looks good too.

410
00:26:56.133 --> 00:26:58.903
- I like this one. - If you want a chocolate cake...

411
00:26:59.343 --> 00:27:00.443
Take your pick.

412
00:27:03.014 --> 00:27:04.343
Could you please recommend anything?

413
00:27:04.413 --> 00:27:06.744
- Se Hee is buying today. - Really?

414
00:27:07.754 --> 00:27:10.054
The cheesecake and the chocolate cake are popular.

415
00:27:10.054 --> 00:27:12.453
- I want blueberry cheesecake. - I want chocolate mousse cake.

416
00:27:12.453 --> 00:27:13.653
- I want cheesecake. - I want Tiramisu.

417
00:27:13.653 --> 00:27:15.794
- Should I have the chocolate one? - How about Tiramisu?

418
00:27:15.794 --> 00:27:17.564
- Are you ready to order? - Yes.

419
00:27:17.994 --> 00:27:19.494
Seven cups of Americano, please.

420
00:27:24.064 --> 00:27:25.603
No cakes?

421
00:27:25.603 --> 00:27:26.703
No cakes.

422
00:27:27.603 --> 00:27:28.974
Who wants the iced coffee?

423
00:27:30.373 --> 00:27:31.474
No one?

424
00:27:41.853 --> 00:27:43.623
Are you not embarrassed?

425
00:27:45.524 --> 00:27:49.494
Cakes weren't that expensive. How can you not pay for that?

426
00:27:49.824 --> 00:27:51.994
Your salary is the highest here.

427
00:27:51.994 --> 00:27:53.764
It's very embarrassing.

428
00:27:53.764 --> 00:27:56.804
Sadly, my expenses for this month are the highest too.

429
00:27:56.903 --> 00:28:00.234
When I fully pay back for my loan, I will pay for the company dinner.

430
00:28:00.474 --> 00:28:01.574
I will buy you guys beef.

431
00:28:03.133 --> 00:28:04.373
When will that be?

432
00:28:04.943 --> 00:28:06.504
The year 2048.

433
00:28:08.943 --> 00:28:11.014
Will I be able to chew properly?

434
00:28:11.214 --> 00:28:12.984
Do you think you'll be alive?

435
00:28:19.683 --> 00:28:22.494
You have 31 years left until 2048.

436
00:28:22.794 --> 00:28:24.593
Don't you need to be alive to pay for the company dinner?

437
00:28:25.123 --> 00:28:26.224
What is this?

438
00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:28.564
It's on me.

439
00:28:28.564 --> 00:28:31.464
- Awesome! - Thank you!

440
00:28:31.633 --> 00:28:34.574
You are such a nice person.

441
00:28:34.673 --> 00:28:37.074
Personally, I want to ask you something.

442
00:28:37.244 --> 00:28:40.004
Are you from a loving, happy, and rich family...

443
00:28:40.004 --> 00:28:41.574
for generations?

444
00:28:41.574 --> 00:28:45.284
I saw your bike outside. It's not something you can buy...

445
00:28:45.284 --> 00:28:46.544
by yourself because it's expensive.

446
00:28:46.544 --> 00:28:48.913
Are you like a son of a famous and rich family?

447
00:28:48.913 --> 00:28:50.484
Maybe you are training yourself here as the successor.

448
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:51.824
No, it's not something like that.

449
00:28:51.984 --> 00:28:54.193
I just moved to a semi-basement room...

450
00:28:54.423 --> 00:28:55.524
to buy that.

451
00:28:55.524 --> 00:28:56.863
Really?

452
00:28:56.863 --> 00:28:59.923
You sacrificed your house for your motorcycle.

453
00:28:59.923 --> 00:29:01.863
You only live once, YOLO.

454
00:29:01.863 --> 00:29:03.234
You are living your life.

455
00:29:03.363 --> 00:29:06.774
I only live once. I don't want to waste my life paying back loans.

456
00:29:07.103 --> 00:29:08.774
I think the people who are called, "House Poor",

457
00:29:08.774 --> 00:29:10.804
are a bit pathetic.

458
00:29:17.044 --> 00:29:19.943
You don't have to think they are pathetic.

459
00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:22.653
Everyone has a different goal.

460
00:29:22.913 --> 00:29:24.284
That can't be a goal.

461
00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:26.353
You are just not taking care of your life.

462
00:29:26.353 --> 00:29:28.024
How can you sacrifice your life for getting a house?

463
00:29:28.024 --> 00:29:29.623
You should enjoy every moment of your life.

464
00:29:29.623 --> 00:29:32.193
You want to believe you are enjoying every moment of your life.

465
00:29:32.494 --> 00:29:35.933
YOLO is a nihilistic spending pattern.

466
00:29:36.464 --> 00:29:38.334
You know you can't earn much and you can't save at all.

467
00:29:38.534 --> 00:29:41.974
So you just want to spend it all...

468
00:29:42.234 --> 00:29:43.504
to forget your miserable situation.

469
00:29:45.103 --> 00:29:46.244
To forget?

470
00:29:55.484 --> 00:29:58.923
Your view is very different from me. Is it because you learned a lot?

471
00:30:00.254 --> 00:30:03.294
Well, please enjoy the sweet cakes and forget about your stress today.

472
00:30:03.794 --> 00:30:05.923
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

473
00:30:06.224 --> 00:30:07.494
He's such a sweet guy.

474
00:30:09.163 --> 00:30:11.334
What a sweet man. He's lovely.

475
00:30:14.203 --> 00:30:16.103
- Let's eat! - Thanks.

476
00:30:16.534 --> 00:30:17.744
We enjoyed the dessert.

477
00:30:19.044 --> 00:30:20.314
I will see you at home.

478
00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:23.044
I see. Are you coming home late?

479
00:30:23.343 --> 00:30:26.214
If nothing happens, I will be able to come home soon.

480
00:30:26.584 --> 00:30:29.413
I see. I'll see you at home.

481
00:30:29.554 --> 00:30:30.653
Okay.

482
00:30:34.494 --> 00:30:37.324
Are you coming home late, Ji Ho?

483
00:30:39.494 --> 00:30:43.133
If nothing happens, I will be able to come home soon like you.

484
00:30:46.603 --> 00:30:47.734
Why?

485
00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:49.633
Just asking.

486
00:30:51.304 --> 00:30:52.403
Take care.

487
00:31:00.284 --> 00:31:02.054
Ji Ho, take care.

488
00:31:02.054 --> 00:31:03.214
Bye.

489
00:31:04.984 --> 00:31:06.284
Do you know...

490
00:31:07.423 --> 00:31:09.693
if the YOLO guy has a girlfriend?

491
00:31:10.724 --> 00:31:13.693
I'm not sure, but I don't think so.

492
00:31:15.633 --> 00:31:17.403
- I'm leaving. - Bye.

493
00:31:26.913 --> 00:31:28.244
What are you going to do?

494
00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:31.284
What? What are you talking about?

495
00:31:32.443 --> 00:31:35.453
That YOLO boy. He's into Ji Ho.

496
00:31:37.923 --> 00:31:41.453
Don't you need to be concerned about it?

497
00:31:43.224 --> 00:31:44.363
Why would I do that?

498
00:31:45.163 --> 00:31:46.423
You are her husband.

499
00:31:46.724 --> 00:31:49.893
Even though I'm her husband, that doesn't mean I have a right...

500
00:31:49.893 --> 00:31:51.334
to tell my wife what to do with her own social life.

501
00:31:51.703 --> 00:31:54.933
That's Ji Ho's workplace that Ji Ho chose.

502
00:31:54.933 --> 00:31:58.244
Whatever happens there, it's about Ji Ho's office life.

503
00:31:58.774 --> 00:32:01.744
I can't tell her what to do because I'm her husband.

504
00:32:02.474 --> 00:32:05.784
I expected it, but your marriage sounds very much like you, Se Hee.

505
00:32:06.744 --> 00:32:09.814
But you should show her your jealousy a bit.

506
00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:13.084
Girls sometimes like their men getting jealous.

507
00:32:14.923 --> 00:32:16.224
Jealousy?

508
00:32:16.824 --> 00:32:19.524
Are you sure you are talking to me now?

509
00:32:19.923 --> 00:32:23.133
Yes, you were jealous for the whole time while you were there.

510
00:32:25.264 --> 00:32:26.403
I wasn't.

511
00:32:26.703 --> 00:32:29.673
Then why are you looking at the same thing again and again?

512
00:32:33.004 --> 00:32:34.974
You are reading the weather report for an hour.

513
00:32:37.913 --> 00:32:40.784
There are lots of things to read when it comes to the weather report.

514
00:32:41.284 --> 00:32:42.883
I see.

515
00:32:43.953 --> 00:32:45.853
What is that inappropriate attitude?

516
00:32:46.353 --> 00:32:48.853
Bo Mi, I want you to apologize.

517
00:32:49.224 --> 00:32:50.724
Here's the weather report.

518
00:32:50.724 --> 00:32:52.464
I'm not just looking at the Korean weather.

519
00:32:52.693 --> 00:32:54.964
Look. Here, you can see...

520
00:33:00.703 --> 00:33:03.744
Did you see his cute dimples?

521
00:33:04.343 --> 00:33:06.044
He's amazing.

522
00:33:06.544 --> 00:33:09.214
Isn't he so different from Ji Ho's husband?

523
00:33:09.673 --> 00:33:12.913
They are extremely opposite in terms of looks and lifestyle.

524
00:33:13.183 --> 00:33:15.453
Who would you choose?

525
00:33:15.613 --> 00:33:18.084
House Poor with house or YOLO with no house?

526
00:33:19.153 --> 00:33:20.254
Can I choose no one?

527
00:33:20.254 --> 00:33:23.153
What if they are the only men left on earth?

528
00:33:23.294 --> 00:33:24.593
Who would you go for?

529
00:33:24.693 --> 00:33:27.593
Why do I have to choose 1 when there are only 2?

530
00:33:27.593 --> 00:33:29.334
I will sleep with them both.

531
00:33:30.663 --> 00:33:31.804
Pervert.

532
00:33:33.034 --> 00:33:35.873
So, what's going on with you and Mr. Ma?

533
00:33:37.603 --> 00:33:39.074
What do you mean?

534
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:42.574
Did you sleep with him or will you? Or are you sleeping with him?

535
00:33:42.574 --> 00:33:43.744
What is going on?

536
00:33:44.284 --> 00:33:45.744
What are you talking about?

537
00:33:45.943 --> 00:33:47.683
We work together.

538
00:33:49.953 --> 00:33:51.554
I see.

539
00:33:51.653 --> 00:33:54.224
I guess you exchange stuffed toys...

540
00:33:54.623 --> 00:33:56.724
instead of the document.

541
00:33:56.863 --> 00:33:58.264
That's adorable.

542
00:33:58.324 --> 00:34:01.933
He said he had some coins, and he did the claw machine game.

543
00:34:02.393 --> 00:34:03.964
He got the prize and just gave it to me.

544
00:34:04.163 --> 00:34:06.534
I was going to throw it away anyway. It's annoying.

545
00:34:07.304 --> 00:34:09.334
I see.

546
00:34:10.544 --> 00:34:13.944
Why is it wearing a belt if you are going to throw it away?

547
00:34:18.643 --> 00:34:21.553
He just gave it to you, right?

548
00:34:21.654 --> 00:34:23.314
It looks exactly like you, you know.

549
00:34:23.314 --> 00:34:25.223
What do you mean?

550
00:34:25.353 --> 00:34:26.823
Am I that ugly?

551
00:34:28.254 --> 00:34:31.594
Is everything okay with you and Won Seok?

552
00:34:32.524 --> 00:34:36.964
Yes, I'm paying him everything back.

553
00:34:37.203 --> 00:34:39.203
It will be slow but painful.

554
00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:40.834
What?

555
00:34:42.834 --> 00:34:44.944
Goodness. I think there was an accident because of an application.

556
00:34:45.103 --> 00:34:46.703
The man met this woman through it...

557
00:34:46.703 --> 00:34:48.314
- and stalked her. - Which application?

558
00:34:48.674 --> 00:34:49.774
Which company's?

559
00:34:50.444 --> 00:34:53.243
Don't worry. It's not your dear Mr. Ma's company.

560
00:34:58.267 --> 00:35:01.499
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E07 Because This is My First Life
"Because This is Our YOLO"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

561
00:35:06.763 --> 00:35:07.933
Unbelievable.

562
00:35:08.734 --> 00:35:09.834
What is it?

563
00:35:10.103 --> 00:35:12.203
Remember the incident where a man locked up a woman...

564
00:35:12.263 --> 00:35:14.334
for 13 hours in a studio apartment?

565
00:35:14.774 --> 00:35:16.944
It says that they met through a game application.

566
00:35:17.143 --> 00:35:18.243
The article just got released.

567
00:35:18.243 --> 00:35:21.814
Won't people think ill of all dating apps including ours?

568
00:35:22.044 --> 00:35:24.044
I think so. People normally just remember...

569
00:35:24.044 --> 00:35:26.413
the fact that they met through an application.

570
00:35:26.584 --> 00:35:29.283
Shouldn't we be ready and take care of stalkers beforehand?

571
00:35:30.953 --> 00:35:32.953
I guess we need to come up with a list of potential criminals...

572
00:35:33.084 --> 00:35:34.953
and make them do decent deeds.

573
00:35:35.453 --> 00:35:36.524
Bo Mi.

574
00:35:37.123 --> 00:35:39.694
Are you taking care of customer satisfaction matters?

575
00:35:40.294 --> 00:35:42.163
Was there anything special?

576
00:35:43.263 --> 00:35:45.303
There were 32 complaints this week,

577
00:35:45.404 --> 00:35:49.004
but they were all about how women don't participate actively.

578
00:35:49.134 --> 00:35:52.703
Please monitor them real time just in case.

579
00:35:53.303 --> 00:35:56.214
If there are any complaints that need followups,

580
00:35:56.214 --> 00:35:57.413
share them right away.

581
00:35:57.844 --> 00:35:59.413
Even if it seems unnecessary.

582
00:36:00.013 --> 00:36:02.413
Okay. I'll share it with you right away.

583
00:36:03.524 --> 00:36:06.524
No, don't share it with me. Share it with Mr. Ma.

584
00:36:06.853 --> 00:36:08.694
Customer satisfaction is not part of my job.

585
00:36:10.694 --> 00:36:12.094
- Okay. - Yes!

586
00:36:12.123 --> 00:36:15.334
Yes, yes, yes.

587
00:36:15.594 --> 00:36:16.803
Yes!

588
00:36:22.334 --> 00:36:23.404
Attention, please.

589
00:36:23.643 --> 00:36:27.373
We can finally launch a global office now.

590
00:36:28.013 --> 00:36:30.114
- Really? - Awesome!

591
00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:33.553
Did you get the investment?

592
00:36:33.783 --> 00:36:35.283
I just talked with Mr. Park.

593
00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:39.024
They're going to confirm it in the Golden Venture meeting.

594
00:36:39.353 --> 00:36:40.453
Mr. Park?

595
00:36:40.654 --> 00:36:43.123
You mean the man whom you wanted to send back to the military?

596
00:36:43.663 --> 00:36:46.464
The guy whom you wanted to meet in India in your next life?

597
00:36:46.493 --> 00:36:47.594
That's right.

598
00:36:47.594 --> 00:36:49.893
If I were to be born as a rich man in India in my next life,

599
00:36:49.893 --> 00:36:52.263
I want to use Mr. Park as my Sudra.

600
00:36:52.404 --> 00:36:55.004
And amazingly, that Mr. Park...

601
00:36:55.734 --> 00:36:58.203
is friends with a guy...

602
00:36:58.444 --> 00:37:00.473
who works as a loan officer at Golden Venture.

603
00:37:00.714 --> 00:37:02.114
Then what will happen...

604
00:37:02.444 --> 00:37:05.084
to Mr. Park whom you'll meet as a Sudra in your next life?

605
00:37:05.143 --> 00:37:08.814
What do you mean? Mr. Park will be...

606
00:37:09.214 --> 00:37:10.584
a Brahman.

607
00:37:10.884 --> 00:37:12.123
A Brahman!

608
00:37:12.884 --> 00:37:15.953
Let's chant our slogan that we haven't chanted for a while.

609
00:37:17.123 --> 00:37:19.524
- We are... - Slaves!

610
00:37:20.064 --> 00:37:22.194
- If they pay us... - We'll do everything!

611
00:37:23.904 --> 00:37:26.703
Everyone should go home early today. I'll go get the investment.

612
00:37:26.774 --> 00:37:30.404
I'm the man you should pick

613
00:37:31.873 --> 00:37:33.174
That's awesome.

614
00:37:34.013 --> 00:37:36.573
- This is great. - It's amazing.

615
00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:42.913
Thank you.

616
00:37:48.493 --> 00:37:49.553
Come on in.

617
00:37:51.763 --> 00:37:53.024
You're here early again.

618
00:38:12.013 --> 00:38:14.714
Congratulations. I heard you might get the investment.

619
00:38:15.053 --> 00:38:16.283
Oh, thanks.

620
00:38:17.024 --> 00:38:19.353
Mr. Park tried really hard for you.

621
00:38:20.154 --> 00:38:22.694
He's not the type that works hard, you know.

622
00:38:23.663 --> 00:38:25.524
It's more important to be good at your work...

623
00:38:25.623 --> 00:38:28.163
than just working hard.

624
00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:32.763
I actually used to work as a manager in Samsun Electronics.

625
00:38:33.234 --> 00:38:35.703
No one's born as a CEO.

626
00:38:37.703 --> 00:38:40.913
I think I went too far last time, thinking I was giving you advice.

627
00:38:41.413 --> 00:38:43.614
You already apologized.

628
00:38:44.344 --> 00:38:47.053
Oh, does that mean you accepted the apology then?

629
00:38:50.584 --> 00:38:53.053
I misunderstood you because you didn't reply.

630
00:38:53.223 --> 00:38:55.254
I wondered why you never answer my text...

631
00:38:55.254 --> 00:38:57.393
and if it's evaporated while being sent to you.

632
00:38:57.723 --> 00:39:00.294
I almost called up the messenger company to complain.

633
00:39:06.064 --> 00:39:08.033
But please accept my apology officially.

634
00:39:09.073 --> 00:39:10.203
I'm sorry.

635
00:39:10.904 --> 00:39:13.044
I'll never act like an old man who likes giving advice.

636
00:39:13.373 --> 00:39:14.373
Okay.

637
00:39:14.614 --> 00:39:17.183
Since today's meeting is really important to you,

638
00:39:17.344 --> 00:39:19.643
don't respond to anything unprofessionally and personally.

639
00:39:19.913 --> 00:39:21.853
Personally?

640
00:39:22.314 --> 00:39:24.024
You mean how I like you?

641
00:39:26.484 --> 00:39:27.794
I'm just kidding.

642
00:39:28.424 --> 00:39:30.424
I've been a CEO for three years even if I don't look it.

643
00:39:30.464 --> 00:39:33.763
I'm not a person that ruins business by being unprofessional.

644
00:39:38.964 --> 00:39:40.004
Hello.

645
00:40:01.723 --> 00:40:04.123
I'm on my way to confirm the investment by Golden Venture.

646
00:40:04.294 --> 00:40:07.533
I'll make sure to get it and help you get your investment too.

647
00:40:09.594 --> 00:40:10.703
Congratulations.

648
00:40:11.163 --> 00:40:13.134
I know you'll get it.

649
00:40:14.274 --> 00:40:16.274
Gosh, I envy him so much.

650
00:40:19.703 --> 00:40:21.643
(End of Ho Rang's ovulation)

651
00:40:43.263 --> 00:40:44.364
Hey.

652
00:40:44.634 --> 00:40:46.873
Sang Goo told me he's going to confirm the investment.

653
00:40:46.904 --> 00:40:48.573
He said he's going to help me if it goes well.

654
00:40:49.174 --> 00:40:51.444
Really? That's great.

655
00:40:51.803 --> 00:40:53.944
Then I guess Se Hee will get a raise too?

656
00:40:54.174 --> 00:40:56.373
I guess. He's one of foundation members.

657
00:40:57.243 --> 00:40:59.044
I think he also has many shares too.

658
00:40:59.844 --> 00:41:02.114
Goodness, that's great for Ji Ho.

659
00:41:02.114 --> 00:41:03.984
She's going to become a wife of an executive before me.

660
00:41:04.924 --> 00:41:06.424
Don't worry.

661
00:41:06.723 --> 00:41:10.194
I'll make sure you live in a luxury when I succeed. Give me a kiss.

662
00:41:12.064 --> 00:41:14.334
Don't. I have to apply toner.

663
00:41:14.634 --> 00:41:15.893
You don't have to.

664
00:41:16.864 --> 00:41:20.404
Don't. It's important to keep my skin moisturized in autumn.

665
00:41:22.103 --> 00:41:25.004
You know what's best for the skin.

666
00:41:26.703 --> 00:41:27.844
I know everything.

667
00:41:28.274 --> 00:41:30.243
Your ovulation ended today, right?

668
00:41:30.844 --> 00:41:32.584
How did you know?

669
00:41:33.214 --> 00:41:35.953
It ended yesterday.

670
00:41:40.853 --> 00:41:42.623
Go and get protection.

671
00:41:43.154 --> 00:41:44.594
I'm all ready.

672
00:41:45.864 --> 00:41:49.094
Ho Rang, my friend made these, and they're very popular.

673
00:41:49.163 --> 00:41:50.163
Let's try them.

674
00:41:51.163 --> 00:41:52.933
You have two of them, right?

675
00:41:53.803 --> 00:41:55.103
We're doing it twice?

676
00:41:55.873 --> 00:41:57.344
You pervert.

677
00:41:57.973 --> 00:42:00.344
Two times? Okay, I'm in.

678
00:42:01.413 --> 00:42:04.614
No, I mean you should wear two of them.

679
00:42:09.913 --> 00:42:11.783
Why should I wear two?

680
00:42:12.453 --> 00:42:15.654
I read in a book that the possibility of failing...

681
00:42:15.654 --> 00:42:17.024
in contraception is 15 percent.

682
00:42:20.933 --> 00:42:23.364
Let's see. Since there's 10 percent chance of getting pregnant...

683
00:42:23.364 --> 00:42:24.364
after my ovulation is over,

684
00:42:24.364 --> 00:42:26.103
Multiplying 15 by 10 equals to 150.

685
00:42:26.134 --> 00:42:27.373
If we divide it...

686
00:42:28.203 --> 00:42:30.303
The possibility of getting pregnant is 1.5 percent.

687
00:42:30.544 --> 00:42:32.873
Can you guarantee that I won't get pregnant?

688
00:42:34.013 --> 00:42:37.013
Ho Rang, when did you do all that math?

689
00:42:39.243 --> 00:42:41.913
Why did you put on the glasses?

690
00:42:44.223 --> 00:42:47.723
Since you won't raise a child and live alone,

691
00:42:47.924 --> 00:42:49.594
you have to be extra careful.

692
00:42:50.024 --> 00:42:53.323
So wear both of them.

693
00:42:53.594 --> 00:42:55.393
Let's be thorough.

694
00:43:07.143 --> 00:43:09.743
- I'll pour you a glass. - Oh, thanks.

695
00:43:12.344 --> 00:43:14.783
I read your investment proposal.

696
00:43:15.254 --> 00:43:17.783
Mr. Yoon said many good things about you...

697
00:43:17.924 --> 00:43:19.884
that I wanted to check it.

698
00:43:20.323 --> 00:43:23.564
You made your company grow big in such a short time.

699
00:43:24.323 --> 00:43:25.594
The prospect of profit seems bright.

700
00:43:25.594 --> 00:43:27.993
Thank you so much for being so kind.

701
00:43:28.294 --> 00:43:30.564
Thank you, Mr. Yoon. Here, let me pour you one.

702
00:43:30.564 --> 00:43:31.564
Oh, sure.

703
00:43:32.564 --> 00:43:36.073
Jin Woo pushed it very hard at the end.

704
00:43:36.073 --> 00:43:39.044
I listen to every word Jin Woo says.

705
00:43:39.844 --> 00:43:40.873
Mr. Yoon.

706
00:43:41.114 --> 00:43:44.214
It sounds like we invest through connections.

707
00:43:44.844 --> 00:43:47.513
This is all thanks to Mr. Jang...

708
00:43:47.513 --> 00:43:49.413
who has such a great eye for investment.

709
00:43:49.853 --> 00:43:52.353
I do admit that,

710
00:43:53.024 --> 00:43:55.893
but I hope I'm right this time.

711
00:43:56.553 --> 00:43:59.364
Of course. It's guaranteed.

712
00:44:00.024 --> 00:44:01.134
I'm flattering you.

713
00:44:03.334 --> 00:44:04.864
Let's drink.

714
00:44:04.964 --> 00:44:06.564
Okay.

715
00:44:08.174 --> 00:44:10.073
Here you go.

716
00:44:13.303 --> 00:44:15.614
- That's good to hear. - Thank you.

717
00:44:27.553 --> 00:44:30.663
Are you going to establish a global office when you get invested?

718
00:44:30.823 --> 00:44:32.163
Where was it? Vietnam?

719
00:44:32.163 --> 00:44:34.094
Yes, everything's ready.

720
00:44:34.794 --> 00:44:36.564
We only need the investment.

721
00:44:37.964 --> 00:44:41.373
That was my initial goal when I started my company.

722
00:44:41.504 --> 00:44:44.743
You know I went to Thailand with Mr. Jang, right?

723
00:44:44.944 --> 00:44:46.913
- And it was the weekends. - I heard.

724
00:44:46.913 --> 00:44:49.844
I heard you played golf for four days.

725
00:44:49.973 --> 00:44:51.714
And you got burned from it.

726
00:44:52.614 --> 00:44:55.714
That's right. I didn't go there on my behalf.

727
00:44:55.714 --> 00:44:58.323
I went there to push your company.

728
00:44:58.323 --> 00:45:00.223
You know how important it is to pitch stories...

729
00:45:00.223 --> 00:45:02.453
while playing golf.

730
00:45:02.453 --> 00:45:05.393
Of course. Those are the important points.

731
00:45:05.393 --> 00:45:08.864
Oh, right. Can I speak casually?

732
00:45:08.964 --> 00:45:10.103
We're of similar age.

733
00:45:10.564 --> 00:45:11.663
Would you feel uncomfortable?

734
00:45:13.774 --> 00:45:15.774
Why would I be?

735
00:45:15.774 --> 00:45:18.174
Age doesn't really matter these days.

736
00:45:19.743 --> 00:45:22.143
Right, Sang Goo? Sang Goo.

737
00:45:22.214 --> 00:45:23.373
Sang Goo.

738
00:45:24.884 --> 00:45:27.314
You better be spanked by Sang Goo.

739
00:45:36.424 --> 00:45:39.623
Oh, what a great night. What were you talking about?

740
00:45:39.964 --> 00:45:42.864
We were talking about your golf trip.

741
00:45:42.864 --> 00:45:44.163
Oh, the trip.

742
00:45:44.163 --> 00:45:46.303
Ms. Woo, what did you do during the holidays?

743
00:45:47.973 --> 00:45:49.973
I just rested at a hotel.

744
00:45:50.033 --> 00:45:52.044
A hotel? Which one?

745
00:45:52.243 --> 00:45:53.303
The one in Nam Mountain.

746
00:45:54.473 --> 00:45:56.544
Oh, you mean Gaya Hotel.

747
00:45:56.714 --> 00:45:59.814
That's a great hotel. It has a nice view.

748
00:46:00.183 --> 00:46:02.884
It's a great for lovers too.

749
00:46:03.584 --> 00:46:04.953
Who did you go with?

750
00:46:05.654 --> 00:46:06.924
I went alone.

751
00:46:07.053 --> 00:46:08.893
I just wanted to take a full rest this year.

752
00:46:08.893 --> 00:46:11.993
You're kidding. You wouldn't do that.

753
00:46:12.064 --> 00:46:13.594
I really went alone.

754
00:46:21.073 --> 00:46:23.844
Be honest. Tell us the truth.

755
00:46:23.844 --> 00:46:25.004
Didn't you go there with your boyfriend?

756
00:46:28.573 --> 00:46:30.444
You're being naughty.

757
00:46:33.384 --> 00:46:36.654
Is this crazy jerk kidding me?

758
00:46:37.053 --> 00:46:40.493
What on earth is he doing? Does he want to get beaten up?

759
00:46:40.953 --> 00:46:43.223
Mr. Ma. What's going on?

760
00:46:44.424 --> 00:46:46.364
Oh, I'm sorry.

761
00:46:46.464 --> 00:46:48.234
I was speaking to myself too loudly.

762
00:46:48.234 --> 00:46:51.103
My friend said something ridiculous through text.

763
00:46:51.364 --> 00:46:53.234
I suddenly got upset.

764
00:46:53.234 --> 00:46:55.274
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

765
00:46:59.803 --> 00:47:03.614
Ms. Woo! Just tell us the truth.

766
00:47:03.614 --> 00:47:05.814
You're just acting like you don't have a boyfriend, right?

767
00:47:06.214 --> 00:47:08.654
Why would you keep that as a secret between us?

768
00:47:09.214 --> 00:47:10.754
Why would I keep it a secret?

769
00:47:12.123 --> 00:47:13.694
That's right. Go on.

770
00:47:13.694 --> 00:47:17.893
I also want to hear how young people have dates these days.

771
00:47:18.823 --> 00:47:21.533
Is this jerk serious?

772
00:47:22.533 --> 00:47:26.004
You should act like your age, you jerk.

773
00:47:26.603 --> 00:47:28.573
Should I hurt you?

774
00:47:28.573 --> 00:47:31.044
Do you want me to cut your hands off?

775
00:47:31.103 --> 00:47:32.904
What's wrong with this scum?

776
00:47:37.384 --> 00:47:38.484
I'm sorry.

777
00:47:38.484 --> 00:47:40.953
I know I look pretty,

778
00:47:40.953 --> 00:47:42.353
but I'm very hot-tempered.

779
00:47:42.513 --> 00:47:46.623
If I don't make my friend a decent human,

780
00:47:46.623 --> 00:47:49.453
I think I'm going to regret it all my life. That's why I was upset.

781
00:47:49.794 --> 00:47:51.893
I'm sorry!

782
00:47:53.024 --> 00:47:54.433
I'm so sorry!

783
00:48:08.674 --> 00:48:10.214
Se Hee, get in.

784
00:48:10.214 --> 00:48:11.544
He brought his car today.

785
00:48:11.544 --> 00:48:13.654
No, thanks. I'll just take the bus.

786
00:48:13.654 --> 00:48:15.114
Get in, Se Hee.

787
00:48:15.254 --> 00:48:18.123
Your house is on the way anyway. I'll drop you off.

788
00:48:27.834 --> 00:48:28.964
Good work.

789
00:48:29.033 --> 00:48:31.103
You too. Thank you.

790
00:48:42.513 --> 00:48:44.714
The bus will arrive soon.

791
00:49:14.614 --> 00:49:16.143
Did you finish work?

792
00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:22.654
Ji Ho.

793
00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:27.794
How could you go home alone when I was delivering the food?

794
00:49:31.364 --> 00:49:32.464
Get on.

795
00:49:34.634 --> 00:49:37.064
It's okay. I'll take the bus.

796
00:49:38.263 --> 00:49:40.873
I know. You're sitting at a bus stop.

797
00:49:42.603 --> 00:49:43.743
You're right.

798
00:49:44.143 --> 00:49:46.444
Is your husband picking you up?

799
00:49:48.413 --> 00:49:51.183
- No, it's not that. - If not, just get on.

800
00:49:51.183 --> 00:49:52.544
I'm faster than the bus.

801
00:50:02.123 --> 00:50:06.493
Why did he insist on taking the bus? What's the mindset behind that?

802
00:50:07.064 --> 00:50:08.294
What mindset?

803
00:50:08.634 --> 00:50:10.334
His personality is just weird.

804
00:50:11.864 --> 00:50:14.504
- Please let me off over there. - Okay.

805
00:50:15.103 --> 00:50:17.603
Why are you going to Itaewon all of a sudden?

806
00:50:18.473 --> 00:50:19.603
Are you meeting your friends?

807
00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:23.984
No, I'm just spending time with myself.

808
00:50:24.844 --> 00:50:25.913
I see.

809
00:50:29.683 --> 00:50:30.783
See you tomorrow.

810
00:50:31.154 --> 00:50:32.424
Bye, Bo Mi.

811
00:51:14.634 --> 00:51:16.763
Mr. Jang, I'm so sorry for today.

812
00:51:19.163 --> 00:51:21.234
It's okay. Keep up the good work.

813
00:51:33.614 --> 00:51:34.754
Safe trip home.

814
00:51:42.893 --> 00:51:46.763
Mr. Ma, I didn't know you would ruin what's already a done deal.

815
00:51:47.834 --> 00:51:49.433
What are you talking about?

816
00:51:51.763 --> 00:51:52.964
I'm sorry anyway.

817
00:51:53.603 --> 00:51:55.373
I won't be seeing you for a while.

818
00:51:56.844 --> 00:51:58.674
Global office, my foot.

819
00:51:59.573 --> 00:52:00.873
Bye.

820
00:52:06.544 --> 00:52:08.913
- Did you call for a driver service? - Yes.

821
00:52:10.683 --> 00:52:11.823
Let's go.

822
00:52:21.594 --> 00:52:22.864
Why did you do that?

823
00:52:26.433 --> 00:52:30.544
I told you to not take anything personally and be professional.

824
00:52:31.504 --> 00:52:32.774
You said you'd do that.

825
00:52:33.444 --> 00:52:35.614
I didn't do that for my personal gain.

826
00:52:36.373 --> 00:52:37.984
That was me being professional.

827
00:52:38.944 --> 00:52:40.754
I always care about you,

828
00:52:41.884 --> 00:52:43.353
wonder what you're doing,

829
00:52:44.484 --> 00:52:45.953
and I always miss you.

830
00:52:47.723 --> 00:52:49.353
This is me being professional.

831
00:52:52.024 --> 00:52:54.163
- Mr. Ma. - I just don't like it!

832
00:52:54.594 --> 00:52:56.933
I hate it when they play dirty with you.

833
00:52:58.864 --> 00:53:01.573
I almost blew their heads off.

834
00:53:03.334 --> 00:53:04.674
So...

835
00:53:07.013 --> 00:53:09.013
can you not scold me today?

836
00:53:09.743 --> 00:53:12.013
They are the ones that did wrong.

837
00:53:13.183 --> 00:53:15.214
Why would you scold me?

838
00:53:22.723 --> 00:53:24.194
You're being cute.

839
00:53:29.433 --> 00:53:31.033
You look like a baby when you smile.

840
00:53:32.703 --> 00:53:35.533
But you look scary in general.

841
00:54:06.103 --> 00:54:07.203
This is...

842
00:54:09.504 --> 00:54:12.174
This is where I've been to. Unit 303.

843
00:54:16.844 --> 00:54:18.214
You said you don't remember it, right?

844
00:54:20.683 --> 00:54:23.384
Sir, please stop here.

845
00:54:36.855 --> 00:54:39.426
I'm sorry, but you should go by yourself from here.

846
00:54:40.056 --> 00:54:42.696
What? Why are you like this again?

847
00:54:42.995 --> 00:54:44.395
Did I do something wrong?

848
00:54:44.696 --> 00:54:47.665
No, but I don't want to do something wrong now.

849
00:54:48.495 --> 00:54:49.565
What?

850
00:54:50.136 --> 00:54:53.806
If we spend more time together, I might sleep with you.

851
00:54:55.835 --> 00:54:56.846
What?

852
00:54:58.406 --> 00:55:02.015
Oh, and the room number wasn't 303. It was 304.

853
00:55:02.315 --> 00:55:03.375
Our room, I mean.

854
00:55:15.225 --> 00:55:17.065
What is she doing?

855
00:55:17.725 --> 00:55:19.466
She remembers.

856
00:55:20.736 --> 00:55:22.466
She is such a fox.

857
00:55:26.006 --> 00:55:27.535
The sky looks beautiful.

858
00:55:28.535 --> 00:55:30.245
Look at the fine dust!

859
00:55:51.866 --> 00:55:52.995
What is this?

860
00:55:54.035 --> 00:55:56.466
What is this? It's a date.

861
00:55:57.265 --> 00:55:58.265
What?

862
00:55:58.506 --> 00:56:01.035
Stop frowning. I'm just joking.

863
00:56:02.205 --> 00:56:03.276
Come with me.

864
00:56:15.855 --> 00:56:17.585
I told you. It's great.

865
00:56:18.526 --> 00:56:19.756
You haven't done anything like this for a while, right?

866
00:56:21.026 --> 00:56:22.096
You are right.

867
00:56:25.096 --> 00:56:27.435
I haven't looked at the sky like this for years.

868
00:56:28.796 --> 00:56:30.065
The night view of Seoul...

869
00:56:30.736 --> 00:56:32.466
You just got married.

870
00:56:32.506 --> 00:56:34.906
Isn't it weird that you haven't seen something like this for a while?

871
00:56:35.406 --> 00:56:37.046
Do you not go on a date with your husband?

872
00:56:38.176 --> 00:56:41.716
Well, we do.

873
00:56:42.546 --> 00:56:44.616
Like what? Drinking beer at home?

874
00:56:44.886 --> 00:56:46.145
Watching TV?

875
00:56:46.616 --> 00:56:49.315
Or drinking beer while watching TV at home?

876
00:56:56.596 --> 00:56:57.926
Bok Nam.

877
00:56:58.165 --> 00:56:59.265
Yes?

878
00:57:02.366 --> 00:57:05.065
I thought you were just joking at first.

879
00:57:06.006 --> 00:57:08.035
You are even younger than my brother.

880
00:57:08.506 --> 00:57:10.776
So I just thought you were cute and didn't even think much about it.

881
00:57:12.145 --> 00:57:15.346
But I don't think I can think you are joking anymore.

882
00:57:17.716 --> 00:57:20.915
The view is beautiful,

883
00:57:22.216 --> 00:57:24.355
and I think you are beautiful to bring me here.

884
00:57:25.085 --> 00:57:26.855
I want to feel...

885
00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:29.696
how beautiful everything is at this moment.

886
00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:33.565
But I can't.

887
00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:38.236
I started to think...

888
00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:42.636
this is uncomfortable, Bok Nam.

889
00:57:45.105 --> 00:57:46.776
Is it because of your husband?

890
00:57:49.975 --> 00:57:51.116
No, it's not.

891
00:57:52.415 --> 00:57:53.815
It's because of me.

892
00:57:55.455 --> 00:57:59.026
I don't know if you are being nice to me...

893
00:57:59.556 --> 00:58:01.096
or fooling around now.

894
00:58:02.656 --> 00:58:05.565
But it doesn't matter. I'm married anyway.

895
00:58:06.866 --> 00:58:10.105
That makes me feel uncomfortable.

896
00:58:12.366 --> 00:58:14.676
I'm looking at such a great view now.

897
00:58:17.046 --> 00:58:18.245
But I just...

898
00:58:19.406 --> 00:58:20.915
can't stop feeling uncomfortable.

899
00:58:25.015 --> 00:58:27.855
What if you were not married?

900
00:58:29.015 --> 00:58:30.486
Would you have felt everything beautifully?

901
00:58:31.625 --> 00:58:32.785
Would you have enjoyed this view?

902
00:58:33.895 --> 00:58:37.796
Would you have been enjoyed what I do for you?

903
00:58:39.725 --> 00:58:40.736
Yes.

904
00:58:42.395 --> 00:58:44.866
I would have felt very happy...

905
00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:47.475
if I were not married.

906
00:58:48.736 --> 00:58:50.605
You are a young, good-looking man.

907
00:58:51.506 --> 00:58:53.475
And you are showing me a beautiful view.

908
00:58:54.245 --> 00:58:55.915
It would have been weird not to be happy about it.

909
00:58:57.645 --> 00:58:59.185
Am I young and good-looking?

910
00:59:02.015 --> 00:59:03.725
You know it too.

911
00:59:04.256 --> 00:59:05.785
You are young and good-looking.

912
00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:09.696
I can read it from your face.

913
00:59:10.326 --> 00:59:12.165
"I know I'm pretty amazing."

914
00:59:12.926 --> 00:59:14.995
"Don't you think I look good?"

915
00:59:15.796 --> 00:59:17.705
Can you see that?

916
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:20.335
Yes.

917
00:59:21.406 --> 00:59:24.276
It must be annoying at times.

918
00:59:25.245 --> 00:59:26.245
A little bit.

919
00:59:29.815 --> 00:59:31.446
I didn't know you would know that.

920
01:00:13.787 --> 01:00:14.887
Take this.

921
01:00:18.798 --> 01:00:21.128
I bought it when I dropped by the bookstore.

922
01:00:21.398 --> 01:00:23.568
I've heard that writers read a lot. Am I wrong?

923
01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:28.338
I heard it from the boss. You used to be a writer.

924
01:00:31.278 --> 01:00:34.477
Do you like this writer? I like him a lot.

925
01:00:34.707 --> 01:00:36.818
I don't know. I don't read much.

926
01:00:37.247 --> 01:00:39.178
I just liked the cover.

927
01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:43.988
I haven't read much, and I haven't learned much.

928
01:00:44.318 --> 01:00:45.657
So I'm very simple.

929
01:00:46.657 --> 01:00:48.387
So don't feel uncomfortable.

930
01:00:50.657 --> 01:00:53.097
I understood what you said today.

931
01:00:55.168 --> 01:00:57.097
I wasn't actually being serious.

932
01:00:57.497 --> 01:00:59.798
I just thought you were cute and easy.

933
01:01:00.207 --> 01:01:02.937
I thought I could get close to you by drinking beer and looking at...

934
01:01:03.068 --> 01:01:04.738
the nice view after work.

935
01:01:06.807 --> 01:01:07.977
Easy?

936
01:01:08.178 --> 01:01:10.048
You know that too.

937
01:01:10.048 --> 01:01:11.477
You know you are cute because of that.

938
01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:16.617
Are you getting back at me?

939
01:01:18.418 --> 01:01:19.787
I am.

940
01:01:22.227 --> 01:01:23.327
Okay.

941
01:01:24.157 --> 01:01:26.557
We can drink beer after work from now on.

942
01:01:28.497 --> 01:01:31.468
I'll talk more freely to you then.

943
01:01:33.738 --> 01:01:34.838
I'm your easygoing coworker.

944
01:01:37.707 --> 01:01:39.878
You can't treat me like that all of a sudden though.

945
01:01:49.148 --> 01:01:50.557
- You are home. - Yes.

946
01:01:50.718 --> 01:01:53.258
- Kitty... - She puked again.

947
01:01:53.557 --> 01:01:54.827
Did you go to the vet?

948
01:01:54.887 --> 01:01:56.557
Not yet. I couldn't because of my work.

949
01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:00.128
I should definitely go tomorrow.

950
01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:03.838
I can go if you are busy.

951
01:02:04.767 --> 01:02:07.608
I can change my schedule. I just need to talk to Bok Nam.

952
01:02:08.108 --> 01:02:09.207
I will go.

953
01:02:11.278 --> 01:02:12.407
It's okay.

954
01:02:13.678 --> 01:02:16.648
It's not in our contract either. You don't have to do that.

955
01:02:17.548 --> 01:02:20.387
I can use my lunch time.

956
01:02:24.457 --> 01:02:25.488
Okay.

957
01:02:28.827 --> 01:02:29.997
Did you...

958
01:02:33.267 --> 01:02:34.997
take the bus home?

959
01:02:36.267 --> 01:02:37.267
What?

960
01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:41.407
Did you take the bus home?

961
01:02:47.707 --> 01:02:48.847
But...

962
01:02:50.318 --> 01:02:51.948
do I have to answer to that?

963
01:02:56.187 --> 01:02:59.957
You don't have to do that.

964
01:03:01.428 --> 01:03:02.687
That's what I thought.

965
01:03:28.588 --> 01:03:30.918
- Did you just get off work? - Yes.

966
01:03:30.918 --> 01:03:32.758
Oh, I dropped Ji Ho off today...

967
01:03:32.758 --> 01:03:34.327
because it's dangerous at night.

968
01:03:38.097 --> 01:03:39.327
Since it's dangerous,

969
01:03:40.698 --> 01:03:43.997
- don't take her home anymore. - Pardon?

970
01:03:43.997 --> 01:03:46.738
It's more dangerous when you take her home,

971
01:03:47.008 --> 01:03:48.608
so don't take her home.

972
01:03:48.968 --> 01:03:51.878
Why not? Do I seem like a dangerous person?

973
01:03:55.077 --> 01:03:56.778
Someone who has nothing to lose...

974
01:03:58.077 --> 01:03:59.218
running away from the reality?

975
01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:03.247
It seems like those words bothered you much.

976
01:04:03.718 --> 01:04:05.457
I didn't mean it that way.

977
01:04:05.718 --> 01:04:08.287
I meant that the motorcycle could be more dangerous.

978
01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:12.327
I decide if I take her home by my motorcycle, not you.

979
01:04:12.327 --> 01:04:13.428
You're wrong.

980
01:04:14.198 --> 01:04:17.798
It's not up to us. It's up to Ji Ho.

981
01:04:18.597 --> 01:04:22.207
What rights do we have to decide how she goes home?

982
01:04:24.178 --> 01:04:27.008
I only gave you my opinion.

983
01:04:28.148 --> 01:04:30.418
Since Ji Ho is not good at rejecting,

984
01:04:31.178 --> 01:04:32.818
I hope you don't suggest her...

985
01:04:33.847 --> 01:04:35.617
to take your motorcycle first.

986
01:04:45.528 --> 01:04:47.367
Is it because you went to college?

987
01:04:47.698 --> 01:04:49.068
You're so logical.

988
01:04:56.568 --> 01:05:00.548
Unlike you, I'm uneducated and irrational.

989
01:05:01.878 --> 01:05:04.247
I have to get what I want.

990
01:05:15.358 --> 01:05:18.398
Se Hee, I'm sending this because I can't reach Mr. Ma.

991
01:05:18.698 --> 01:05:21.428
I'm sending you the complaints I received today.

992
01:05:25.267 --> 01:05:26.738
(Come to YOLO Cafe.)

993
01:05:29.668 --> 01:05:34.477
(Complaint: Stalking)

994
01:05:36.477 --> 01:05:39.778
(We often misunderstand others. We can't say we get how others feel.)

995
01:05:39.778 --> 01:05:42.648
(We often misunderstand others.)

996
01:05:45.657 --> 01:05:46.827
This is nice.

997
01:06:08.948 --> 01:06:12.548
We often misunderstand others.

998
01:06:13.948 --> 01:06:16.447
We can't say we get...

999
01:06:17.388 --> 01:06:19.388
how others feel.

1000
01:06:20.827 --> 01:06:22.027
Instead,

1001
01:06:22.027 --> 01:06:23.058
(You only love one. Bok Nam.)

1002
01:06:23.058 --> 01:06:25.728
you have to say, "I can't understand what I say either."

1003
01:06:26.428 --> 01:06:27.997
You have to say that.

1004
01:06:30.138 --> 01:06:31.997
If we don't try hard,

1005
01:06:33.808 --> 01:06:34.938
we won't...

1006
01:06:37.508 --> 01:06:39.178
understand each other.

1007
01:07:02.168 --> 01:07:05.668
(Because This Is My First Life)

1008
01:07:06.037 --> 01:07:07.607
That's really expensive.

1009
01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.268
- Do you want to know the price? - Not really.

1010
01:07:09.438 --> 01:07:10.537
How much is it?

1011
01:07:11.138 --> 01:07:12.207
Isn't it unbelievable?

1012
01:07:12.207 --> 01:07:14.508
No, it's not as expensive as I thought.

1013
01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:16.577
I bet that costs around the same as a medium-sized car.

1014
01:07:16.747 --> 01:07:18.647
I'm also a CEO of a start-up company.

1015
01:07:18.647 --> 01:07:20.487
- It's a "Get Up" app. - "Get Up".

1016
01:07:20.487 --> 01:07:22.487
Why did you make it?

1017
01:07:22.487 --> 01:07:23.657
Does that make money?

1018
01:07:25.218 --> 01:07:28.088
Since today is our first day, I'll give you just one flower.

1019
01:07:28.258 --> 01:07:29.357
What's with you?

1020
01:07:29.888 --> 01:07:31.397
The complaint was about a stalking.

1021
01:07:31.397 --> 01:07:33.298
How and who reported the complaint?

1022
01:07:33.298 --> 01:07:36.027
I'm also avoiding situations...

1023
01:07:36.027 --> 01:07:37.867
where we have to act like a married couple.

1024
01:07:37.867 --> 01:07:40.707
I can fix the motorcycle and a woman's heart.

1025
01:07:41.067 --> 01:07:43.107
Do you think your husband will come for you...

1026
01:07:43.478 --> 01:07:45.438
if something happens here?
