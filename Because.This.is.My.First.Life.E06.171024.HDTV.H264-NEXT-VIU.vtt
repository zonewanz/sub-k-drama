1
00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.583
Stop crying, Ji Ho.

2
00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.178
Is it hard to stop crying?

3
00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:04.488
If that's the case, we should go together.

4
00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.798
It's okay to cry. Let's go together.

5
00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:15.639
I'll be right next to you.

6
00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:18.908
I'll be with you.

7
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.449
1988.

8
00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:28.419
The world is looking at Korea.

9
00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:34.158
The day the global festivities began in 1988,

10
00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:36.059
I was getting ready...

11
00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:38.759
to be born.

12
00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.399
- It's moving. - Just like that,

13
00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.929
I was born as a 1988 baby...

14
00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:45.998
while the world watched Korea.

15
00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.569
My gosh!

16
00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.938
I was born during Korea's heyday.

17
00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:54.078
Having a house and a car was natural.

18
00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:57.748
I spent my childhood during a time of rapid growth and abundance.

19
00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:01.518
There was a change in the midst of it.

20
00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:04.718
The grade school was now called an elementary school.

21
00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.988
Of course, crises came upon us too.

22
00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:11.389
However, there was hope.

23
00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.999
If one tried hard, they could get back on their feet.

24
00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:17.868
Shoot, shoot.

25
00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.368
I trusted that a desperate wish...

26
00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.639
will always come true.

27
00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.009
However, that trust was soon broken.

28
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.949
Even dreams started to have class.

29
00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.349
We weren't 1988 babies anymore.

30
00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:38.588
We became the 880-dollars-generation.

31
00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:44.328
The vote of a 20-year-old did not have any power.

32
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:49.428
The world no longer looked to Korea.

33
00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:52.828
In a world of competition,

34
00:02:53.368 --> 00:02:55.768
my friends threw themselves for a line on their resume.

35
00:02:57.268 --> 00:02:58.639
In between them,

36
00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.578
I was a snail still chasing for dreams.

37
00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.949
I may be a little slow, but I continued to believe...

38
00:03:06.108 --> 00:03:08.548
that if I worked hard,

39
00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:10.749
my dream will come true.

40
00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:14.558
If I could tell my 20-year-old self...

41
00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:17.189
about how I look like now,

42
00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.028
would she believe me?

43
00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.599
Bride and groom, please enter.

44
00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:27.539
Let's go.

45
00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.009
Okay.

46
00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.719
The 30-year-old Yoon Ji Ho who was born in 1988...

47
00:03:42.078 --> 00:03:43.749
didn't get to become a writer,

48
00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.238
but she took the hand of a man...

49
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:11.208
who gave her a discounted rent.

50
00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:14.419
I really...

51
00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.319
got married...

52
00:04:19.648 --> 00:04:20.889
because of housing.

53
00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.359
Here I go.

54
00:04:26.228 --> 00:04:27.458
1, 2...

55
00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:29.429
It's finished.

56
00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:32.468
It was a lot of work. Great work.

57
00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.739
Great job, everyone.

58
00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.338
Hey, stop crying.

59
00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:45.179
People will think you have something to do with the groom.

60
00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:47.619
What about you? Did you get paid to attend this?

61
00:04:47.918 --> 00:04:49.819
How can you not shed a single tear?

62
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:51.819
You're so heartless.

63
00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:55.989
We'll now take pictures with friends.

64
00:04:56.018 --> 00:04:58.359
- Please come forward. - Hey, let's go for the photos.

65
00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:05.869
- No way. - What?

66
00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.239
Hey, let's go up.

67
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:15.809
We'll come down right away after the pictures, okay?

68
00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:38.299
Is that all of your friends?

69
00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:39.499
Yes.

70
00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:41.739
- You too, Se Hee? - Yes.

71
00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:48.708
Mr. Ma and the one with extra insoles.

72
00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:49.879
Move to the bride's side.

73
00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.578
- Me? - Yes, two of you.

74
00:05:52.848 --> 00:05:54.478
- No. - No!

75
00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:58.088
We don't have enough room.

76
00:05:58.348 --> 00:06:00.288
I don't have extra insoles.

77
00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:03.929
I'd appreciate your cooperation for a smooth wedding.

78
00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:07.528
Mr. Ma, insoles, move to the right.

79
00:06:07.828 --> 00:06:09.898
Okay, let's balance it out.

80
00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:11.328
Okay.

81
00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.639
All right.

82
00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:19.538
Insoles and the tall woman should switch positions.

83
00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.788
Here I go. 1, 2...

84
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.989
- Hey, your girlfriend... - Sang Goo.

85
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:43.429
Don't act friendly with her since we're still fighting.

86
00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:46.499
Okay, okay. What about the tall girl standing next to your girlfriend?

87
00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.668
Do you know her?

88
00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:51.569
She's Ho Rang's best friend, so I'm close with her too.

89
00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.939
Then she was born in 1988?

90
00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:57.949
How dare she block me?

91
00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.879
Let's just eat and jet.

92
00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:03.218
Don't act like you know her. Okay?

93
00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:06.049
Why would I say hello? I'm a shy guy.

94
00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:14.199
Gosh. Are these seats empty?

95
00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.799
- They're taken. - No, they're not.

96
00:07:18.968 --> 00:07:21.239
No? Then please excuse us.

97
00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:22.799
Sang Goo, you go there.

98
00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:32.778
Is that good?

99
00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:34.578
Do you want to try?

100
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:38.189
It's good.

101
00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:40.458
Hello. I think...

102
00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:43.658
it's our first time meeting. I only heard about you.

103
00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:46.689
- Hello. I heard a lot about you. - Hello.

104
00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:49.699
- This is my friend Woo Soo Ji... - Soo Ji.

105
00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.999
- What is this? Do you know her? - No.

106
00:07:53.028 --> 00:07:55.069
Then how did you know her name?

107
00:07:55.398 --> 00:07:58.538
She just looks like a Soo Ji.

108
00:07:58.538 --> 00:08:00.168
She looks sharp and chic.

109
00:08:00.338 --> 00:08:03.809
She looks like someone that would block you on chats.

110
00:08:03.908 --> 00:08:06.009
It says she's the type right on her face.

111
00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:08.918
- What? - I met him through work before.

112
00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:11.348
Have you been well, Mr. Ma?

113
00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:15.119
Thanks to you, I've been doing well.

114
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:17.859
I got a cold since we're changing seasons.

115
00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:20.499
After getting blocked by you, I was also depressed.

116
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:23.559
I was really happy and full of emotions.

117
00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:25.499
Soo Ji the blocker.

118
00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:36.209
It's Ji Ho.

119
00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:41.619
Wow! They look good together!

120
00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:49.489
Who would have thought she'd get married first?

121
00:08:49.489 --> 00:08:50.729
I know.

122
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:53.459
It feels like yesterday she got drunk and threw up at our flat.

123
00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.398
A flight of pigeons gathered the next day...

124
00:08:56.398 --> 00:08:57.698
It was such a bother.

125
00:08:57.698 --> 00:09:00.268
- You chase them as an eagle. - Hey.

126
00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:01.999
It was a hawk, not an eagle.

127
00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:07.609
Did he get a snack?

128
00:09:07.778 --> 00:09:09.509
What is that on his mouth?

129
00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:12.808
- That looks like hot sauce. - It does.

130
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:15.249
Why would he go around like that?

131
00:09:16.148 --> 00:09:19.148
Why does the sauce keep on dripping from his nose?

132
00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:21.859
You're right, it keeps on dripping.

133
00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:24.688
Hot sauce?

134
00:09:33.428 --> 00:09:35.168
You must have been really tired.

135
00:09:35.938 --> 00:09:37.639
I think it's because...

136
00:09:37.938 --> 00:09:40.268
the amount of physical activity increased in the last few days.

137
00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:41.538
You're right.

138
00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:44.678
That's why your nose is bleeding.

139
00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:49.418
I thought you'd have to be punched to get both nostrils to bleed.

140
00:09:49.548 --> 00:09:52.249
I'm just as flustered as someone who got knocked down.

141
00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:56.259
This is just as hard as developing a project.

142
00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:57.688
I'm talking about weddings.

143
00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:59.788
It's almost over,

144
00:10:00.158 --> 00:10:02.798
so please hang in there.

145
00:10:03.028 --> 00:10:04.099
Okay.

146
00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:09.068
I want to go rest at our home.

147
00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:18.278
What? Did I say something wrong?

148
00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:21.518
No, you didn't.

149
00:10:21.678 --> 00:10:23.418
I should go and wash this.

150
00:10:40.438 --> 00:10:43.969
I want to go rest at our home.

151
00:10:45.469 --> 00:10:46.839
Our home.

152
00:11:07.058 --> 00:11:09.259
That's because you're tired.

153
00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:12.698
When you're tired, you should take anything you can find.

154
00:11:12.698 --> 00:11:14.798
- Here, take it. - Thanks.

155
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:17.438
You have to take this with that.

156
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:18.668
Okay.

157
00:11:19.469 --> 00:11:21.009
Why are you so thin?

158
00:11:21.938 --> 00:11:23.278
What food do you like?

159
00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:25.479
Can you eat snake soup?

160
00:11:26.408 --> 00:11:29.678
I've never tried that.

161
00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:31.219
Oh, right.

162
00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:33.859
People in Seoul don't really eat such things.

163
00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:37.959
Then what should I feed you?

164
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:40.089
Ma'am.

165
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:45.168
Ji Ho is a woman with determination.

166
00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:50.339
Pardon?

167
00:11:50.538 --> 00:11:52.969
I don't know Ji Ho that well yet,

168
00:11:53.568 --> 00:11:55.609
When she decided to write scenarios,

169
00:11:56.278 --> 00:11:58.308
when she decided to quit,

170
00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:01.879
and when she decided to get married,

171
00:12:04.948 --> 00:12:07.989
she made all those choices for herself.

172
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:13.329
She may seem weak and shy, but she's a very determined person.

173
00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:18.068
Her heart is really strong.

174
00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:22.668
She doesn't do anything that makes her unhappy.

175
00:12:24.538 --> 00:12:26.068
Therefore,

176
00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.438
Ji Ho will eventually choose...

177
00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:32.648
the path that makes her happy.

178
00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:37.589
And I'm not going to be in the way...

179
00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.389
while I'm married to her.

180
00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:48.829
That's all the promise I can make.

181
00:12:56.499 --> 00:12:57.668
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:58.709 --> 00:12:59.839
Why?

183
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.349
I can't make promises to make her happy...

184
00:13:05.448 --> 00:13:06.849
or protect her.

185
00:13:08.818 --> 00:13:12.418
That's the only thing I can promise you.

186
00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:18.089
What about it? It's the right thing to say.

187
00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:22.459
Just because you're married,

188
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:25.099
it doesn't mean you have to make her happy.

189
00:13:26.198 --> 00:13:28.999
Who can make anyone else happy?

190
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:33.609
It's hard to be happy these days.

191
00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:38.609
The best thing you can do is to not be in the way of others.

192
00:13:40.418 --> 00:13:43.918
It's so much better than saying all the empty words.

193
00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:51.788
I'll make you snake soup next time.

194
00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:54.499
Give it a try.

195
00:13:56.359 --> 00:13:57.599
Snake soup?

196
00:13:57.898 --> 00:13:59.028
It's good.

197
00:14:01.869 --> 00:14:04.239
We survived all those hard times,

198
00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:07.079
didn't we, sir?

199
00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.839
Yes, of course.

200
00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:12.349
They were all born in good times.

201
00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:15.678
They always complain how things are hard.

202
00:14:15.678 --> 00:14:18.318
Let's go already. They're all tired.

203
00:14:18.448 --> 00:14:19.948
We'll get going. Let's go.

204
00:14:19.948 --> 00:14:21.018
Okay.

205
00:14:21.688 --> 00:14:24.688
Anyway, please take good care of my daughter...

206
00:14:25.028 --> 00:14:28.698
- even if she's lacking. - Yes, of course.

207
00:14:28.698 --> 00:14:30.058
Don't worry.

208
00:14:30.058 --> 00:14:32.798
- Please take care of her. - See you later.

209
00:14:32.798 --> 00:14:34.568
- Safe trip home. - Bye.

210
00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:37.109
Ji Ho, I'll get going.

211
00:14:37.239 --> 00:14:39.869
I'm sorry you had to come when you're pregnant.

212
00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:41.178
Not at all.

213
00:14:42.438 --> 00:14:46.609
By the way, your husband is so good-looking.

214
00:14:47.349 --> 00:14:49.018
What? Is he?

215
00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:51.018
He's really handsome.

216
00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:02.428
Let's get going now.

217
00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:03.898
Okay.

218
00:15:22.018 --> 00:15:23.989
He's really handsome.

219
00:15:33.658 --> 00:15:34.759
What's wrong?

220
00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:38.369
I was just wondering if my nose is bleeding again.

221
00:15:39.428 --> 00:15:42.139
It's because you kept looking at my face.

222
00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:44.839
Is there something on my face?

223
00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.778
No, it's just that...

224
00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.749
There's a mosquito.

225
00:15:52.109 --> 00:15:53.448
In this weather?

226
00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:55.048
I know, right?

227
00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:58.418
They survive so well.

228
00:16:03.558 --> 00:16:04.658
Well...

229
00:16:06.028 --> 00:16:07.298
Thank you.

230
00:16:10.329 --> 00:16:12.499
I heard it earlier from outside.

231
00:16:13.499 --> 00:16:17.408
Thank you for saying such things...

232
00:16:18.808 --> 00:16:20.009
to my mom.

233
00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:26.278
I feel like I made you worry.

234
00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:29.778
I should have dealt with it before.

235
00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:34.959
That doesn't concern just you.

236
00:16:36.219 --> 00:16:38.889
If the parent is concerned about us living together,

237
00:16:39.089 --> 00:16:43.499
it's my job as the landlord to make her feel relieved.

238
00:16:44.499 --> 00:16:46.168
Precisely speaking,

239
00:16:46.568 --> 00:16:48.599
it's not just your concern.

240
00:16:48.768 --> 00:16:49.938
It's ours.

241
00:16:52.908 --> 00:16:55.639
Our concern?

242
00:16:56.678 --> 00:16:59.209
Yes, it's our concern.

243
00:16:59.678 --> 00:17:01.178
That's our issue.

244
00:17:28.438 --> 00:17:31.908
(Episode 6: Because This Is Our First Time)

245
00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:36.049
Is there a table?

246
00:17:36.218 --> 00:17:37.918
There's none.

247
00:17:38.188 --> 00:17:39.319
Oh, really?

248
00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:44.529
Hey, you knew this, didn't you?

249
00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.398
That this place sells great food? Of course.

250
00:17:47.698 --> 00:17:50.029
Ho Rang. My goodness.

251
00:17:50.698 --> 00:17:51.799
Hey.

252
00:17:53.329 --> 00:17:55.698
What a coincidence to run into you here.

253
00:17:55.898 --> 00:17:57.569
I know, right?

254
00:17:57.708 --> 00:18:00.069
- Seoul's so tiny. - I know.

255
00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:02.978
Since it's small, let's share a table together.

256
00:18:02.978 --> 00:18:04.309
It's okay.

257
00:18:04.908 --> 00:18:08.918
Goodness, how can you block me when I'm so busy?

258
00:18:08.918 --> 00:18:10.589
Go sit down quickly.

259
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.549
Sit with us and don't disturb her.

260
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:14.688
Sit down.

261
00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:16.218
Let's join them since they're busy.

262
00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:22.359
- Cheers. - Shall we?

263
00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:23.769
- Cheers. - Cheers.

264
00:18:32.869 --> 00:18:34.508
Gosh, she drank it at once.

265
00:18:34.938 --> 00:18:36.809
Ho Rang, you're good at drinking mixed drinks.

266
00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:39.609
I thought you'd only drink soju.

267
00:18:40.208 --> 00:18:42.748
I wasn't good before, but I got better recently.

268
00:18:42.748 --> 00:18:44.119
It's because I broke up with my boyfriend.

269
00:18:47.718 --> 00:18:50.218
Oh, I see. You broke up with your boyfriend.

270
00:18:50.218 --> 00:18:51.559
Goodness.

271
00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.698
Should I register my name on your application?

272
00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.029
I mean, if a beautiful woman like you...

273
00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:02.339
register on our app, it'd be an honor.

274
00:19:02.698 --> 00:19:04.708
What kind of man do you like?

275
00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:09.178
I don't care much about anything, only if he didn't study engineering.

276
00:19:09.178 --> 00:19:11.549
An engineering student. But he is...

277
00:19:13.008 --> 00:19:16.349
Did something bad happen in the past with an engineering student?

278
00:19:18.488 --> 00:19:22.158
What did the engineering student do so wrong?

279
00:19:22.488 --> 00:19:24.158
Could you ask her that for me? I want to hear about it.

280
00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:26.458
Did you hear him?

281
00:19:27.758 --> 00:19:30.428
I don't want to talk about it since we already broke up.

282
00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:32.398
Please pass this to him.

283
00:19:32.498 --> 00:19:34.698
Why are you two doing this to me?

284
00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:36.438
Hey, stop it.

285
00:19:36.998 --> 00:19:39.839
Also tell him that I wish he could understand things...

286
00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:40.879
better in his next life.

287
00:19:40.938 --> 00:19:43.208
Because I don't think he can in this life.

288
00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:46.248
- Are you serious? - What about it?

289
00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:50.418
I tried to understand you,

290
00:19:50.418 --> 00:19:51.988
but you went too far this time, do you know that?

291
00:19:52.519 --> 00:19:54.258
What did you try to understand?

292
00:19:54.258 --> 00:19:56.458
How on earth did you try to understand me?

293
00:19:56.458 --> 00:19:58.928
Don't give me that sarcastic smile, okay?

294
00:19:58.928 --> 00:19:59.928
I hate that the most.

295
00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:01.498
Do you know why I'm angry and what the real reason is?

296
00:20:01.498 --> 00:20:03.869
- Do you even know? - I do!

297
00:20:05.569 --> 00:20:08.869
I do know why you are upset.

298
00:20:12.639 --> 00:20:16.238
Please calm down.

299
00:20:17.379 --> 00:20:20.448
Won Seok didn't feel good...

300
00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:22.879
when he found out why you got upset.

301
00:20:29.158 --> 00:20:31.559
He knows you are upset because he got the sofa that was displayed.

302
00:20:35.629 --> 00:20:36.629
What?

303
00:20:38.198 --> 00:20:41.569
He was worried if the sofa had any stains because it was displayed.

304
00:20:42.069 --> 00:20:44.738
He tried to wash it as much as possible.

305
00:20:44.738 --> 00:20:47.579
At the end, he even had a stiff muscle in his arms.

306
00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:49.609
Mr. Ma, can you please stop talking?

307
00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:51.609
He wanted to save the delivery fee too.

308
00:20:51.609 --> 00:20:54.049
He carried the sofa all the way from the station.

309
00:20:54.448 --> 00:20:57.319
- He did his best. - Just stop talking.

310
00:20:57.849 --> 00:20:58.948
Ho Rang.

311
00:20:59.988 --> 00:21:01.819
Won Seok did all he could.

312
00:21:05.688 --> 00:21:07.299
Is that the reason...

313
00:21:09.258 --> 00:21:10.569
you could only think of?

314
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:15.069
Did you think I was upset because you bought me the displayed sofa?

315
00:21:17.438 --> 00:21:18.438
What?

316
00:21:20.478 --> 00:21:21.579
To you...

317
00:21:22.408 --> 00:21:25.279
You think I'm just someone who's upset with that kind of thing.

318
00:21:27.218 --> 00:21:28.918
Even after seven years.

319
00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:38.789
- Ho Rang. - Ho Rang.

320
00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:41.799
- What is going on? - You should go out and check.

321
00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:43.728
Ho Rang!

322
00:21:46.198 --> 00:21:48.168
Ho Rang.

323
00:21:49.339 --> 00:21:51.008
Yang Ho Rang! Are you serious?

324
00:21:55.408 --> 00:21:56.508
Was that not the reason?

325
00:21:56.908 --> 00:21:59.178
What is it then?

326
00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:02.148
Do you know...

327
00:22:03.678 --> 00:22:05.748
I caught the bouquet...

328
00:22:06.988 --> 00:22:08.488
- at Ji Ho's wedding? - Yes, I saw it.

329
00:22:08.488 --> 00:22:10.458
I even saw you almost fell over.

330
00:22:11.728 --> 00:22:13.829
Ho Rang, please stop beating around the bush.

331
00:22:13.898 --> 00:22:15.958
Just tell me why you are upset.

332
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:18.629
Do you also know that catching the bouquet means...

333
00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:24.468
you have to get married in six months?

334
00:22:24.508 --> 00:22:26.069
What are you talking about?

335
00:22:26.769 --> 00:22:28.208
You can be straight forward.

336
00:22:29.008 --> 00:22:30.708
Let's talk things out.

337
00:22:30.908 --> 00:22:32.579
If you don't get married in six months...

338
00:22:33.948 --> 00:22:36.248
after catching the bouquet,

339
00:22:37.819 --> 00:22:39.488
it means you can't get married for three years.

340
00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:42.559
Why are you talking about that stupid superstition?

341
00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:46.158
That's not important now.

342
00:22:48.428 --> 00:22:49.428
Goodness.

343
00:22:55.438 --> 00:22:57.869
Yang Ho Rang! Are you insane? What is this?

344
00:22:57.869 --> 00:22:59.168
Marriage!

345
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:04.779
I want to get married!

346
00:23:22.629 --> 00:23:23.658
Marriage.

347
00:23:23.728 --> 00:23:27.438
How could that turn into something romantic all of a sudden?

348
00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:30.099
"I want to get married!" "Ho Rang!"

349
00:23:30.438 --> 00:23:34.938
That was more surprising than any other plot twists.

350
00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.208
Mr. Ma, you haven't been in many relationships, have you?

351
00:23:39.508 --> 00:23:41.619
What? Are you talking about relationships?

352
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:44.488
I don't even know what to say.

353
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:46.418
Ms. Woo.

354
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:48.789
Do you know why my name is Ma Sang Goo?

355
00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:50.988
It's because my relationships has always gone well...

356
00:23:50.988 --> 00:23:53.359
since I was 18.

357
00:23:53.428 --> 00:23:55.158
I'm Magical Sang Goo.

358
00:23:56.758 --> 00:23:58.869
I'm not talking about texting back and forth.

359
00:23:59.468 --> 00:24:00.539
I'm talking about the real relationships.

360
00:24:01.668 --> 00:24:04.369
You get to the point where you don't know if you guys are in love...

361
00:24:04.408 --> 00:24:06.109
or too close to each other like a family. You may feel intimidating.

362
00:24:06.468 --> 00:24:08.408
Have you ever been in a long-term relationship like that?

363
00:24:08.978 --> 00:24:10.208
I mean, something like what they have now.

364
00:24:10.609 --> 00:24:14.349
I've been with someone for 4 or 5 months many times.

365
00:24:15.148 --> 00:24:17.089
What about you?

366
00:24:18.448 --> 00:24:19.519
Have you been in...

367
00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:22.488
the real relationship?

368
00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:24.829
I don't do it. It's frustrating.

369
00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:28.458
I don't do that with guys.

370
00:24:29.329 --> 00:24:30.629
I just make memories with them.

371
00:24:32.369 --> 00:24:35.299
I can take a taxi from right there. How about you, Mr. Ma?

372
00:24:46.908 --> 00:24:48.349
What's with him now?

373
00:25:00.728 --> 00:25:01.898
Hi.

374
00:25:07.069 --> 00:25:08.069
What is it?

375
00:25:08.498 --> 00:25:11.738
Your daughter was crying there. So I helped her.

376
00:25:13.468 --> 00:25:15.178
- What are you talking about? - What am I talking about?

377
00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:17.008
You guys look so much alike.

378
00:25:20.948 --> 00:25:23.319
- I don't need it. - Just keep it.

379
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.349
You said you make memories with guys.

380
00:25:26.488 --> 00:25:29.458
This can be a memory you made today.

381
00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:34.359
By the way,

382
00:25:34.728 --> 00:25:37.468
can you please unblock me?

383
00:25:38.428 --> 00:25:41.438
I promise I won't send you any stupid messages anymore.

384
00:25:42.869 --> 00:25:45.039
I'm asking you. You can go now.

385
00:26:02.418 --> 00:26:03.988
I don't look like her at her.

386
00:26:11.898 --> 00:26:14.238
Ji Ho got married.

387
00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:17.769
Seul Bi is getting married too.

388
00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:22.339
Ji Ho got married and Seul Bi is getting married too.

389
00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:23.908
I get it.

390
00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:27.478
Ho Rang, please stop crying. You should sleep now.

391
00:26:28.178 --> 00:26:30.519
If you keep crying, you'll have a headache.

392
00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:33.488
It's okay. Let's sleep.

393
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:37.458
All right.

394
00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:40.089
Why are you crying so much?

395
00:26:42.629 --> 00:26:43.898
Don't cry.

396
00:27:21.069 --> 00:27:22.698
- Did you wake up? - Yes.

397
00:27:24.938 --> 00:27:27.809
You made a nice breakfast.

398
00:27:28.139 --> 00:27:29.139
I did.

399
00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:31.478
I always eat breakfast.

400
00:27:32.448 --> 00:27:35.678
And it's our first day after our wedding.

401
00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:37.148
I see.

402
00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:46.059
I hope you enjoy.

403
00:27:46.988 --> 00:27:48.329
You can have some too.

404
00:27:49.498 --> 00:27:50.898
I'm okay.

405
00:27:51.829 --> 00:27:52.968
But...

406
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:56.539
it's officially my first day of moving in.

407
00:27:56.769 --> 00:27:59.668
I made a lot because I thought we were going to eat together.

408
00:28:12.089 --> 00:28:14.418
I will have some then.

409
00:28:15.718 --> 00:28:16.819
Okay.

410
00:28:26.198 --> 00:28:27.398
Thank you.

411
00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:55.698
This is delicious.

412
00:28:58.529 --> 00:28:59.569
That's good.

413
00:29:01.468 --> 00:29:04.008
I know I'm good at cooking.

414
00:29:04.508 --> 00:29:06.438
Yes, I agree with you.

415
00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:08.779
You have a talent for cooking.

416
00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:13.379
It's actually the first time...

417
00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:17.289
for us to eat a proper meal together...

418
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:19.389
instead of ramyeon.

419
00:29:20.688 --> 00:29:21.758
You are right.

420
00:29:29.728 --> 00:29:31.029
What did you do yesterday?

421
00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:32.799
Yesterday?

422
00:29:33.898 --> 00:29:37.269
We just showered, watched a soccer game, and went to bed.

423
00:29:37.468 --> 00:29:39.269
Did you watch a soccer game with him?

424
00:29:39.408 --> 00:29:43.109
We were too tired. So we watched it separately in each other's rooms.

425
00:29:43.238 --> 00:29:46.049
You guys use different rooms?

426
00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:51.519
I mean, we watched it with each other's phones.

427
00:29:52.748 --> 00:29:54.688
Try this out. It's really good.

428
00:29:54.688 --> 00:29:57.019
I don't need it. You need it, Bride.

429
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:58.859
You need some energy as a newlywed.

430
00:29:59.889 --> 00:30:01.428
When do you think he's the sexiest?

431
00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:03.559
- What? - You guys are newlyweds.

432
00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:05.968
Do you not want him all the time?

433
00:30:06.898 --> 00:30:09.269
We're not like that.

434
00:30:09.468 --> 00:30:12.408
Ji Ho, don't tell me you guys are a sexless couple.

435
00:30:14.408 --> 00:30:15.738
That's not true.

436
00:30:15.738 --> 00:30:18.549
Then why aren't you telling me anything?

437
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:22.279
I shared every single detail about what happened with my dates.

438
00:30:22.849 --> 00:30:25.418
And you're not telling me anything about your husband.

439
00:30:27.688 --> 00:30:31.329
When he includes me in his life.

440
00:30:32.589 --> 00:30:34.559
I like to hear him mention things about us.

441
00:30:35.829 --> 00:30:39.468
When he says something like...

442
00:30:40.369 --> 00:30:41.769
our house or our business,

443
00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:45.269
I feel so good.

444
00:30:45.738 --> 00:30:50.478
So you get excited whenever he says "we"?

445
00:30:51.178 --> 00:30:52.809
Is that your fetish?

446
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:54.319
That's not it.

447
00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.549
- What's her fetish? - It's not my fetish.

448
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:58.349
She gets excited whenever he says "we".

449
00:30:59.948 --> 00:31:02.458
What a literary fetish for a writer.

450
00:31:03.158 --> 00:31:05.129
- We... - We...

451
00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:10.569
It's your first day of marriage. For what did you come outside?

452
00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.428
To get a part-time work.

453
00:31:13.198 --> 00:31:14.839
A part-time work? Why?

454
00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:16.898
What?

455
00:31:17.668 --> 00:31:19.569
I need to work in order to pay for my...

456
00:31:20.809 --> 00:31:24.079
I mean, our living expenses and wireless bills.

457
00:31:24.648 --> 00:31:27.379
Hey, your husband is so mean.

458
00:31:27.718 --> 00:31:28.849
Why?

459
00:31:30.418 --> 00:31:33.319
How could he make her work part-time when they're married?

460
00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:36.158
Having a double-income is a must in this society.

461
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:38.228
Will you not work when you get married?

462
00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:40.799
Of course, I will. I'll do housework.

463
00:31:41.398 --> 00:31:44.129
I'll give birth to children and spend time with my in-laws.

464
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:47.398
You need professionalism for that too.

465
00:31:48.099 --> 00:31:49.299
What did Won Seok say about it?

466
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:52.369
Did he answer to your weird proposal?

467
00:31:52.769 --> 00:31:54.109
Answer, my foot.

468
00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:55.478
He's not in the place to answer.

469
00:31:55.809 --> 00:31:58.079
He made a girl propose first.

470
00:31:59.049 --> 00:32:01.178
I woke up and he was gone already.

471
00:32:01.178 --> 00:32:02.849
He knows what he did is wrong.

472
00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:08.289
Ho Rang. Are you sure he wants to marry you?

473
00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:12.428
- What? - Have you had...

474
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:14.029
a serious conversation with him about marriage?

475
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:17.198
What's there to talk about?

476
00:32:17.529 --> 00:32:20.299
Soo Ji, we've dated for seven years.

477
00:32:20.398 --> 00:32:22.698
He better have our marriage in mind.

478
00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:24.639
If not, he's a scumbag.

479
00:32:28.609 --> 00:32:29.978
Just marry her.

480
00:32:30.309 --> 00:32:32.879
Even someone like him got married, so why can't you?

481
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.978
He has a job and a house.

482
00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:40.119
Where will I live if I get married?

483
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.859
It's not like I can show her parents my loft.

484
00:32:42.859 --> 00:32:44.289
You still haven't gotten the investment?

485
00:32:45.158 --> 00:32:48.559
I'm meeting them later today, but I'm not sure.

486
00:32:48.958 --> 00:32:51.029
They might decide not to invest in me after giving me false hope.

487
00:32:52.468 --> 00:32:54.938
Don't be mistaken about what I say.

488
00:32:55.938 --> 00:32:57.938
Will you just join my company?

489
00:32:59.369 --> 00:33:03.079
I mean, I know that you're the CEO of your company.

490
00:33:03.849 --> 00:33:07.049
But you should be part of somewhere to get married at ease.

491
00:33:07.478 --> 00:33:11.148
Thank you for the offer, but I want to see the end of it.

492
00:33:11.688 --> 00:33:13.289
I've invested a lot of time in this too.

493
00:33:14.188 --> 00:33:18.089
Above all, I don't know what marriage is.

494
00:33:20.329 --> 00:33:21.658
Do you know what marriage is?

495
00:33:22.099 --> 00:33:23.198
What?

496
00:33:24.829 --> 00:33:25.928
Well...

497
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:29.738
It must be something nice. Being together is better than being alone.

498
00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:33.069
Having someone who understands me unconditionally.

499
00:33:33.309 --> 00:33:35.438
Having her by my side all the time.

500
00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:37.648
Isn't that nice?

501
00:33:37.948 --> 00:33:39.208
What's wrong with you?

502
00:33:39.478 --> 00:33:40.819
Why have you gotten so buttery?

503
00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:43.789
Do you have someone like that lately?

504
00:33:45.619 --> 00:33:47.688
It's more than what you can imagine.

505
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:50.829
Se Hee, what's marriage?

506
00:33:50.829 --> 00:33:52.728
What do you think marriage is, married man?

507
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:55.258
Are you happy now that you're married?

508
00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:09.008
I told you not to talk to me while I'm working.

509
00:34:09.278 --> 00:34:11.209
You completely disturbed my logic.

510
00:34:12.378 --> 00:34:13.378
I see.

511
00:34:13.378 --> 00:34:16.548
And don't bring out personal issues at work.

512
00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:18.718
Okay.

513
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:30.628
I just realized people can spit through their eyes.

514
00:34:32.298 --> 00:34:34.298
He has no sense of companionship.

515
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:36.568
But he got married, so why can't we?

516
00:34:39.269 --> 00:34:41.278
You look so young.

517
00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:44.048
You look younger than your age.

518
00:34:44.378 --> 00:34:45.878
Are you preparing for an exam?

519
00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:49.678
No, I'm just taking a break for a while.

520
00:34:50.649 --> 00:34:51.789
At your age?

521
00:34:53.189 --> 00:34:54.658
You were a writer.

522
00:34:55.258 --> 00:34:57.088
I was an assistant writer for dramas.

523
00:34:57.229 --> 00:34:58.528
Assistant writer?

524
00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:01.499
I didn't know there was such a job.

525
00:35:03.928 --> 00:35:06.128
I'm afraid I can't hire you.

526
00:35:06.128 --> 00:35:09.669
We're looking for people in their 20s.

527
00:35:09.738 --> 00:35:11.039
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:12.369 --> 00:35:13.468
I see.

529
00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:22.218
(Hiring part-time workers)

530
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:25.619
Goodness.

531
00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:28.119
- Excuse me. Are you hiring... - Bok Nam.

532
00:35:28.289 --> 00:35:31.189
Bok Nam! Where on earth did this punk go?

533
00:35:33.158 --> 00:35:35.559
- Are you here to apply? - Yes.

534
00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:38.298
- Excuse me. - Yes, please hold.

535
00:35:39.169 --> 00:35:41.698
We're busy like crazy, but where is he?

536
00:35:43.298 --> 00:35:46.468
I'm sorry, but can you go find Bok Nam?

537
00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:48.838
Who's Bok Nam?

538
00:35:48.838 --> 00:35:51.778
He's my baby. He left while I was in the kitchen.

539
00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:55.079
- I should tie him or something. - Did he go out alone?

540
00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:57.548
He looks like... Oh, his hair is brown.

541
00:35:57.718 --> 00:35:59.889
He's fluffy and is wearing pink.

542
00:35:59.889 --> 00:36:01.218
He likes to be in a corner.

543
00:36:01.218 --> 00:36:02.588
You'll find him if you search those areas.

544
00:36:02.889 --> 00:36:04.729
He's brown, fluffy, and in pink.

545
00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:06.928
Excuse me, aren't you going to take my order?

546
00:36:06.928 --> 00:36:08.399
You can tell he's pretty just by looking at him.

547
00:36:08.698 --> 00:36:09.999
Thank you in advance.

548
00:36:09.999 --> 00:36:12.499
I'm coming. Please hold.

549
00:36:16.238 --> 00:36:17.369
Bok Nam.

550
00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:20.709
Bok Nam.

551
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.479
Bok Nam.

552
00:36:26.948 --> 00:36:28.878
I didn't ask him about its breed.

553
00:36:30.048 --> 00:36:31.349
Is he a brown poodle?

554
00:36:32.649 --> 00:36:33.889
Bok Nam.

555
00:36:42.358 --> 00:36:44.769
Bok Nam.

556
00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.829
Bok Nam.

557
00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:55.479
Bok Nam.

558
00:36:56.979 --> 00:36:58.149
Bok Nam.

559
00:37:01.718 --> 00:37:02.818
What are you looking for?

560
00:37:07.419 --> 00:37:10.059
I'm looking for a dog owned by a restaurant owner over there.

561
00:37:10.218 --> 00:37:12.459
I think he left outside alone.

562
00:37:12.729 --> 00:37:14.298
His name is Bok Nam.

563
00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:16.229
Bok Nam?

564
00:37:16.229 --> 00:37:17.628
Have you seen him?

565
00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.298
His hair is fluffy brown.

566
00:37:21.738 --> 00:37:23.139
He's in pink.

567
00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.738
You can tell he's pretty just by looking at him.

568
00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:29.039
He's pretty?

569
00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:31.778
Yes. Maybe.

570
00:37:35.778 --> 00:37:37.588
- Have you seen? - No.

571
00:37:40.488 --> 00:37:41.588
Bye, then.

572
00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:43.488
Excuse me.

573
00:37:46.528 --> 00:37:47.658
Give me your number.

574
00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:49.459
Why?

575
00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:52.068
I'll call you if I find the dog.

576
00:37:53.298 --> 00:37:54.399
Sure.

577
00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:57.508
Here.

578
00:37:58.939 --> 00:38:02.139
The name, Bok Nam, doesn't sound so pretty.

579
00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:10.178
Why did I give him my number?

580
00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.718
He's not even the owner.

581
00:38:20.189 --> 00:38:22.158
You're here.

582
00:38:23.158 --> 00:38:24.399
What should we do?

583
00:38:24.628 --> 00:38:26.298
I couldn't find Bok Nam.

584
00:38:26.399 --> 00:38:29.039
He came back just a minute ago. Thank you.

585
00:38:29.238 --> 00:38:30.369
Really?

586
00:38:30.869 --> 00:38:32.068
Thank goodness.

587
00:38:32.369 --> 00:38:33.908
Where is...

588
00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:37.649
Have a seat. You said you're looking for a part-time job, right?

589
00:38:37.649 --> 00:38:38.749
Yes.

590
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:42.519
Thank you for helping me find Bok Nam.

591
00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:45.619
He sneaks out whenever he gets a chance.

592
00:38:45.689 --> 00:38:48.619
By the way, I love how you named him.

593
00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:50.789
- Did you bring your resume? - Sure.

594
00:38:59.899 --> 00:39:02.298
Oh, right. Someone named Mr. Park called me...

595
00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:04.568
and said they're having a company dinner today.

596
00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:07.539
I can't believe them.

597
00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:08.709
It's obvious what they're after.

598
00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:11.249
They want me to come and pay for their dinner.

599
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:14.548
It's the Mr. Park who works at Phoenix, right?

600
00:39:14.548 --> 00:39:16.378
No, the Mr. Park who works at HK.

601
00:39:17.249 --> 00:39:18.389
HK?

602
00:39:18.749 --> 00:39:20.889
Oh, they're having a company dinner.

603
00:39:20.889 --> 00:39:22.419
Where at what time?

604
00:39:23.088 --> 00:39:24.588
I texted you the location and time.

605
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:25.928
Is that so?

606
00:39:28.928 --> 00:39:32.399
By the way, what is this strange feeling that I'm the only one...

607
00:39:32.499 --> 00:39:33.999
who volunteers to carry stuff?

608
00:39:34.238 --> 00:39:36.539
Considering the age and social status,

609
00:39:36.798 --> 00:39:39.209
shouldn't you carry these?

610
00:39:39.209 --> 00:39:40.369
Isn't she Se Hee's wife?

611
00:39:41.139 --> 00:39:42.709
Oh, Ji Ho.

612
00:39:44.408 --> 00:39:45.678
- Hello. - Hello.

613
00:39:45.678 --> 00:39:48.149
What brings you here? Oh, you're here to see Se Hee?

614
00:39:48.149 --> 00:39:51.718
No, I had business to take care of near here.

615
00:39:51.718 --> 00:39:54.959
That's good. We're going to have some snacks, so join us.

616
00:39:55.189 --> 00:39:56.889
No, thanks. I need to go home.

617
00:39:56.889 --> 00:39:59.358
It'll be nice if you join us.

618
00:40:03.298 --> 00:40:04.669
Make yourself comfortable.

619
00:40:04.999 --> 00:40:06.568
You've never been here before, right?

620
00:40:06.568 --> 00:40:08.139
- Yes. - How is it?

621
00:40:08.238 --> 00:40:10.968
- It's really nice. - Yes, I gave it some effort.

622
00:40:12.108 --> 00:40:14.738
Oh, Se Hee must be in a meeting, but I think it'll be over soon.

623
00:40:14.738 --> 00:40:17.008
This is his seat right here.

624
00:40:17.149 --> 00:40:19.408
Take a look around. I'll go get these served.

625
00:40:19.408 --> 00:40:21.649
- Okay. - Let's go, Ji Ho! I love it!

626

627
00:40:39.329 --> 00:40:41.439
(It's me.)

628
00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:51.608
(Ma Sang Goo: Nickname, Mavely, Likes women and working late)

629
00:40:53.209 --> 00:40:56.749
(Nam Se Hee: No nickname, Likes cats and hates things like this)

630
00:41:01.858 --> 00:41:04.428
Didn't you say there wasn't anything to fix last week?

631
00:41:04.959 --> 00:41:08.329
I clearly asked if there's anything to fix for the final version.

632
00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:09.428
I even asked twice.

633
00:41:10.798 --> 00:41:14.599
That happened because so many people voiced in for this matter.

634
00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:18.468
Do I have to know all of them?

635
00:41:18.669 --> 00:41:21.338
You should have dealt with it beforehand.

636
00:41:22.378 --> 00:41:23.778
I know that I should have...

637
00:41:23.778 --> 00:41:26.048
I hope you don't ever break my working rhythm...

638
00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:29.149
with a minor issue like this one.

639
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:30.488
Yes, sir.

640
00:41:43.869 --> 00:41:46.169
- Eat up, you guys. - Thank you for the food.

641
00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:49.238
I paid with the company card anyway.

642
00:41:51.669 --> 00:41:53.939
This is not a hologram, is it?

643
00:41:54.479 --> 00:41:58.309
I never thought it'd be possible to see Se Hee's wife with my own eyes.

644
00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:00.349
Don't overact.

645
00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:03.119
Can I take a photo for work?

646
00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:04.149
You mean me?

647
00:42:04.619 --> 00:42:05.749
She's pretty.

648
00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:09.459
Why would you take my photo?

649
00:42:09.459 --> 00:42:12.258
You're Se Hee's ideal type. I'll put you in our database.

650
00:42:12.258 --> 00:42:13.329
His ideal type?

651
00:42:13.588 --> 00:42:16.698
Se Hee told Mr. Ma that he married you because you're pretty.

652
00:42:16.798 --> 00:42:17.869
Isn't that right?

653
00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:20.369
I've never heard Se Hee using such a fancy adjective...

654
00:42:20.399 --> 00:42:22.369
when describing a woman.

655
00:42:22.369 --> 00:42:25.869
Very. Very pretty.

656
00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:27.209
That's what he said.

657
00:42:30.479 --> 00:42:31.479
That's unexpected.

658
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:33.579
I'm glad you're here, Ji Ho.

659
00:42:33.778 --> 00:42:35.919
When will we ever get to tease Se Hee like this again?

660
00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:37.649
I know.

661
00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:40.249
Please visit us more often, Mrs. Nam.

662
00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:42.959
- That's so cheesy. - Have one more, Ji Ho.

663
00:42:43.088 --> 00:42:44.829
- Okay. - I'll give her one.

664
00:42:45.028 --> 00:42:46.088
Here. Have this.

665
00:42:47.158 --> 00:42:48.559
- Eat up. - Eat up.

666
00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:49.698
Thank you.

667
00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.229
That's right.

668
00:42:52.869 --> 00:42:54.669
Let's do the wave again.

669
00:42:54.669 --> 00:42:56.568
I'll start us off.

670
00:43:07.548 --> 00:43:08.749
Shall we get going now?

671
00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:10.919
No, let's stay longer.

672
00:43:12.988 --> 00:43:14.189
Gosh.

673
00:43:18.298 --> 00:43:19.968
Hey, Mr. Ma.

674
00:43:21.798 --> 00:43:23.468
Hey, Mr. Ma.

675
00:43:24.638 --> 00:43:26.207
Mr. Ma, over here.

676
00:43:28.207 --> 00:43:30.607
- You've come a long way. - How have you been?

677
00:43:30.948 --> 00:43:33.408
What's this gathering about?

678
00:43:33.408 --> 00:43:35.377
It's a dinner...

679
00:43:35.377 --> 00:43:37.988
for the new recruits because it's their last day.

680
00:43:37.988 --> 00:43:40.247
- Nice to meet you. - This is...

681
00:43:40.247 --> 00:43:43.118
the CEO of Gyeol Mal Ae, Mr. Ma Sang Goo.

682
00:43:43.258 --> 00:43:44.388
Give a round of applause.

683
00:43:45.287 --> 00:43:49.028
I'm Ma Sang Goo, the CEO of Gyeol Mal Ae! Let's go, Gyeol Mal Ae!

684
00:43:49.198 --> 00:43:50.457
- Let's go! - Let's go!

685
00:43:50.698 --> 00:43:51.928
Gosh, let's drink.

686
00:43:53.997 --> 00:43:56.738
Since Mr. Ma joined us, let's go to another restaurant.

687
00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:59.068
Why don't we go and have raw beef sashimi?

688
00:43:59.138 --> 00:44:01.607
Okay. That sounds great.

689
00:44:09.848 --> 00:44:11.087
- I'll pay now. - Okay.

690
00:44:13.988 --> 00:44:15.017
Please use this.

691
00:44:16.758 --> 00:44:18.087
What are you doing?

692
00:44:18.328 --> 00:44:20.727
- I'll pay for this. - Why should you?

693
00:44:21.028 --> 00:44:22.328
We are the ones who drank them.

694
00:44:22.957 --> 00:44:24.328
- Please give me the bill. - Okay.

695
00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:27.127
It's 260 dollars. Please sign here.

696
00:44:27.368 --> 00:44:29.167
I get that you earn a lot,

697
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:31.008
but don't use money on the ones that take advantage of you.

698
00:44:31.537 --> 00:44:35.207
If you have money for this, go and play with the claw machine.

699
00:44:36.207 --> 00:44:37.247
Here you go.

700
00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.707
- Thank you. - Thank you. Goodbye.

701
00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.517
What's with that woman?

702
00:44:45.218 --> 00:44:46.247
Well...

703
00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:50.488
Is she showing off her charms? It makes my heart flutter.

704
00:44:52.457 --> 00:44:54.057
That's her card. Thank you.

705
00:44:54.328 --> 00:44:57.528
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

706
00:44:59.468 --> 00:45:02.368
- I pressed it. Let's take a look. - Okay.

707
00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:05.138
Mr. Park,

708
00:45:05.408 --> 00:45:07.738
we're friends now.

709
00:45:08.678 --> 00:45:11.977
- Mr. Park. - Do you think we're really friends?

710
00:45:12.408 --> 00:45:14.147
- Darn you. - Gosh, I'm jealous.

711
00:45:15.218 --> 00:45:17.147
- Ms. Woo. - Yes?

712
00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:21.388
Why didn't you accept my friend request? It's been two weeks.

713
00:45:21.457 --> 00:45:24.057
Oh, really? I didn't know that.

714
00:45:25.028 --> 00:45:26.528
Check it out now.

715
00:45:27.187 --> 00:45:29.298
- I'll do it later. - Why?

716
00:45:30.057 --> 00:45:31.598
Do you not want a friend who's already married?

717
00:45:33.267 --> 00:45:34.968
No, it's not that.

718
00:45:35.397 --> 00:45:37.098
- It's just... - Mr. Park.

719
00:45:37.408 --> 00:45:40.008
I also got rejected by my employee.

720
00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:43.307
She was so mad that her boss asked her to be her friend.

721
00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.877
- I would be mad too. - So...

722
00:45:46.207 --> 00:45:48.017
I guess the culture in offices is like that.

723
00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:51.287
Let's not be friends with colleagues. That's the culture.

724
00:45:51.647 --> 00:45:52.747
Isn't that employee a woman?

725
00:45:55.158 --> 00:45:56.417
Yes, that's right.

726
00:45:56.417 --> 00:46:00.028
I knew it. That's how girls are like.

727
00:46:00.698 --> 00:46:02.397
I know the reason.

728
00:46:02.528 --> 00:46:05.267
I bet she has tons of pictures she took with her boyfriend.

729
00:46:05.627 --> 00:46:09.537
If that's not the case, why wouldn't she accept the friend request?

730
00:46:09.537 --> 00:46:10.968
- I know. - That's exactly right.

731
00:46:12.037 --> 00:46:15.877
Goodness, okay, okay. I'll accept it. Are you happy now?

732
00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:19.247
Ms. Woo,

733
00:46:19.578 --> 00:46:21.718
you're the cool type.

734
00:46:22.318 --> 00:46:26.318
Then don't erase that bikini photo you took in a hotel.

735
00:46:32.587 --> 00:46:35.328
Don't like it then. It'll be creepy.

736
00:46:37.727 --> 00:46:40.368
- Let's drink. - I'm gonig to like it.

737
00:46:44.008 --> 00:46:46.807
Pour me some more.

738
00:46:58.787 --> 00:46:59.818
Are you going to smoke?

739
00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:01.787
What's wrong with you?

740
00:47:04.158 --> 00:47:06.627
Why do you not get mad at such trashy talks?

741
00:47:09.328 --> 00:47:12.698
Mr. Ma, please control yourself.

742
00:47:12.698 --> 00:47:14.897
You're so straightforward with me.

743
00:47:15.238 --> 00:47:17.638
How come you only smile in front of them?

744
00:47:17.837 --> 00:47:20.138
Are you playing dumb in front of them?

745
00:47:20.908 --> 00:47:22.977
Hey, you might not get it because you're the CEO,

746
00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:26.348
but dinners like this is also a part of work for people like me.

747
00:47:26.548 --> 00:47:29.477
If the seniors fight in front of the newbies, what'd they think of us?

748
00:47:29.477 --> 00:47:32.888
That's why you need to be more straightforward in front of them.

749
00:47:32.888 --> 00:47:34.457
You should let them know that such behavior is not tolerable.

750
00:47:34.457 --> 00:47:36.057
Why should I do that?

751
00:47:36.718 --> 00:47:38.888
Can you imagine a life of a female worker in such a big company?

752
00:47:39.428 --> 00:47:41.298
If things get noisy,

753
00:47:41.798 --> 00:47:43.828
I'll end up being gossiped about.

754
00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:49.937
So stop minding my business, Mr. Ma.

755
00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:03.078
Mr. Ma is...

756
00:48:03.417 --> 00:48:06.348
so much more fun than I thought.

757
00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:08.017
Is that so?

758
00:48:08.857 --> 00:48:11.928
Did you see Bo Mi's face earlier?

759
00:48:12.457 --> 00:48:14.658
When Mr. Ma hid the sandwich...

760
00:48:15.957 --> 00:48:19.198
I think Bo Mi is quite adorable.

761
00:48:19.798 --> 00:48:20.897
I see.

762
00:48:23.138 --> 00:48:24.238
Do you know this?

763
00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:28.008
It's the first time...

764
00:48:29.207 --> 00:48:31.147
we are going home together.

765
00:48:33.448 --> 00:48:34.517
Really?

766
00:48:36.218 --> 00:48:37.917
Most of the time,

767
00:48:38.888 --> 00:48:40.888
living alone in Seoul is okay...

768
00:48:41.457 --> 00:48:45.187
except for when I have to go home alone.

769
00:48:46.928 --> 00:48:50.028
So I imagined this when I was back in school.

770
00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:54.897
I thought I'd be going home with someone if I'm married.

771
00:48:56.167 --> 00:48:57.767
That it'd be great.

772
00:48:59.837 --> 00:49:01.037
I see.

773
00:49:08.678 --> 00:49:09.948
Woori!

774
00:49:12.187 --> 00:49:14.517
Were you not bored by yourself?

775
00:49:24.968 --> 00:49:27.267
I named her.

776
00:49:27.638 --> 00:49:29.337
Her name is Woori.

777
00:49:32.968 --> 00:49:36.508
I think it's good for her to have a name.

778
00:49:38.707 --> 00:49:42.818
Calling her Kitty is a bit strange.

779
00:49:43.348 --> 00:49:46.488
It's like my mom calling me Kid.

780
00:49:46.948 --> 00:49:48.888
"Kid, have your meal."

781
00:50:03.198 --> 00:50:06.107
Do you not like...

782
00:50:07.377 --> 00:50:08.437
the name?

783
00:50:08.437 --> 00:50:10.107
It's not that I don't like it.

784
00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.548
I just feel a bit uncomfortable.

785
00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:20.919
It's not that I don't like it.

786
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.360
I just feel a bit uncomfortable.

787
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.951
Do you feel uncomfortable?

788
00:50:34.111 --> 00:50:36.810
Yes, I do. She is my cat,

789
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.281
and someone else is calling her by a different name.

790
00:50:40.921 --> 00:50:42.051
It's uncomfortable.

791
00:50:48.631 --> 00:50:49.830
I see.

792
00:50:51.361 --> 00:50:52.801
I understand you.

793
00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.600
Does that mean...

794
00:50:59.741 --> 00:51:01.440
you felt uncomfortable...

795
00:51:03.011 --> 00:51:04.940
because I visited your office today?

796
00:51:08.651 --> 00:51:12.151
Yes, to be honest, I did.

797
00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:15.451
Okay.

798
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:17.861
I see.

799
00:51:19.321 --> 00:51:21.890
We were obliged to get married.

800
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:25.960
So if you want more than the landlord-tenant relationship,

801
00:51:26.431 --> 00:51:28.201
it's very uncomfortable for me.

802
00:51:29.201 --> 00:51:32.640
I would love to avoid the situation like today...

803
00:51:33.401 --> 00:51:37.241
as much as possible.

804
00:51:39.611 --> 00:51:40.750
Okay.

805
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.051
I agree with you.

806
00:51:44.821 --> 00:51:46.350
I think you are right about it.

807
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:49.890
You are right.

808
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.591
I will try to do that.

809
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.301
Can I take her?

810
00:52:01.171 --> 00:52:03.000
I have to cut her toenails.

811
00:52:05.201 --> 00:52:06.500
I see.

812
00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:28.861
Ho Rang, does Won Seok want to marry you?

813
00:52:29.131 --> 00:52:31.701
Have you guys had a serious conversation about...

814
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.431
getting married?

815
00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:46.281
- You are here. - I'm so tired.

816
00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:51.120
You told me you had a meeting with the investors.

817
00:52:51.921 --> 00:52:53.281
I bet you did a great job.

818
00:52:53.551 --> 00:52:55.951
I really did.

819
00:52:56.321 --> 00:52:58.790
Everyone acted like Steve Jobs.

820
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.931
They want us to start from a garage.

821
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.890
Are we in America?

822
00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.931
I don't even have a car. How can I have a garage?

823
00:53:06.301 --> 00:53:07.631
This is comfortable.

824
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.310
- Won Seok. - Yes?

825
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:18.511
I want to talk about us getting married.

826
00:53:21.511 --> 00:53:22.611
Okay.

827
00:53:28.221 --> 00:53:30.020
What do you think?

828
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.120
- What do I think? - Yes.

829
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:37.660
I've never heard how you actually feel about it.

830
00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.471
Do you want to get married too?

831
00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:45.571
I mean,

832
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:51.410
to be honest, I don't know yet.

833
00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:55.881
You don't know yet?

834
00:53:56.051 --> 00:53:59.750
I love you so much.

835
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.991
I always want to be with you.

836
00:54:03.551 --> 00:54:05.491
That's why I'm living with you now.

837
00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.591
But...

838
00:54:11.201 --> 00:54:14.000
I don't know what it is like to get married yet.

839
00:54:17.071 --> 00:54:18.770
But you love me.

840
00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.940
Of course. You know I can't live without you.

841
00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:27.281
But I don't know if getting married is the same as loving someone.

842
00:54:29.181 --> 00:54:31.421
- What? - Marriage is about having kids...

843
00:54:31.551 --> 00:54:33.580
and being responsible.

844
00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:37.921
I can't even successfully arrange an investment at the moment.

845
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.091
So how I can do such things?

846
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.730
That's what you think.

847
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.701
Yes.

848
00:54:51.701 --> 00:54:53.370
It makes me think a lot these days.

849
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.341
I'm concerned about many things.

850
00:54:56.671 --> 00:54:59.710
Ho Rang, are you disappointed by any chance?

851
00:55:01.651 --> 00:55:04.951
No, you can be concerned.

852
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:08.451
Being in a relationship and getting married are different.

853
00:55:08.451 --> 00:55:09.620
I think so too.

854
00:55:10.151 --> 00:55:12.721
It's very difficult.

855
00:55:14.261 --> 00:55:17.830
Ho Rang, I sometimes think...

856
00:55:19.131 --> 00:55:23.770
love and marriage are separate things.

857
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:31.140
We are the unlucky kids born in 1988.

858
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:41.991
We were born in the heyday of our country.

859
00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:44.620
But we are also going through the worst recession too.

860
00:55:47.131 --> 00:55:50.330
We experienced both prosperity and poverty.

861
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:53.301
That's why we are called...

862
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:56.270
(I love you, Ho Rang.)

863
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:58.640
the unlucky kids born in 1988.

864
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.841
Nothing is easy for us. Getting married, dating someone,

865
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:05.910
and being ourselves...

866
00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.651
are all difficult to have.

867
00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.221
I'm sorry. I sometimes act like an cocky old man.

868
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:25.801
Don't worry about it.

869
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.701
Being romantic and having a relationship are...

870
00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.611
something you can't dream of without spending money and energy.

871
00:56:40.611 --> 00:56:41.710
That's why...

872
00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.821
I misunderstood this time.

873
00:56:44.881 --> 00:56:46.250
I will be with you.

874
00:56:46.551 --> 00:56:48.591
It's not just your burden anymore.

875
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:49.951
It's our burden.

876
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.960
Is it ours?

877
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.690
Yes, it is ours.

878
00:56:58.401 --> 00:56:59.901
Because of those words you said,

879
00:57:01.201 --> 00:57:03.500
I thought I finally got something easily this time.

880
00:57:04.341 --> 00:57:05.540
I thought I finally found...

881
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:11.410
someone I can be called "us" with.

882
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:28.660
For the time being,

883
00:57:29.931 --> 00:57:31.201
I was happy.

884
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:47.310
You made a nice breakfast again.

885
00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.761
Yesterday,

886
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:08.870
I definitely overacted.

887
00:58:09.471 --> 00:58:10.571
Pardon?

888
00:58:12.201 --> 00:58:14.640
- That's okay. - After I quit my work,

889
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.140
my self-esteem has gone down.

890
00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:19.910
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

891
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.120
Actually,

892
00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:28.690
it's been so long since I heard...

893
00:58:30.821 --> 00:58:32.721
words like "we" or "us".

894
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.160
Our house. Our neighborhood.

895
00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.931
It's hard to hear such things anymore these days.

896
00:58:43.301 --> 00:58:46.040
It's been a while since I felt like I belonged somewhere.

897
00:58:47.511 --> 00:58:48.870
That's why I overacted.

898
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.341
I mistakenly thought you and I...

899
00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.111
belong together.

900
00:58:57.421 --> 00:58:58.750
That was a mistake.

901
00:59:03.151 --> 00:59:04.790
So from now on,

902
00:59:06.421 --> 00:59:07.830
don't easily say...

903
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.631
"we" or "us" anymore.

904
00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.971
I might misunderstand it.

905
00:59:16.701 --> 00:59:17.741
Okay.

906
00:59:18.571 --> 00:59:19.701
I understand.

907
00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:29.210
I know why...

908
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:39.361
I'm feeling anger right now.

909
00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.031
Please give me my spoon.

910
00:59:44.701 --> 00:59:45.801
Okay.

911
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:05.120
It's because I got the wrong idea, hurt my pride,

912
01:00:05.821 --> 01:00:07.080
and was embarrassed.

913
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.721
There may be many reasons,

914
01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:37.451
- Hello? - Is this Ms. Yoon Ji Ho?

915
01:00:38.381 --> 01:00:39.551
Yes, who is it?

916
01:00:39.881 --> 01:00:42.421
- It's me, the alley guy. - The alley guy?

917
01:00:44.221 --> 01:00:46.261
Oh, you're the guy I met when I was looking for Bok Nam.

918
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.890
Yes, that's right.

919
01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.801
- What's happening? - I had something to ask you.

920
01:00:52.261 --> 01:00:54.000
- Do you have a note beside you? - A note?

921
01:00:55.471 --> 01:00:56.671
Yes, I do.

922
01:00:57.841 --> 01:00:58.971
What about a pen?

923
01:01:00.071 --> 01:01:01.140
I have a pen too.

924
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.071
- What about a boyfriend? - A boy...

925
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:08.181
- Pardon? - Do you have a boyfriend?

926
01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:12.250
There may be many reasons,

927
01:01:19.591 --> 01:01:21.131
but I'm sure of one thing.

928
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:23.761
I don't have...

929
01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.560
Now, I want to...

930
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.600
a boyfriend.

931
01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:35.471
hurt you.

932
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:39.710
Our gravity...

933
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:45.350
is gone.

934
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.881
(Because This Is My First Life)

935
01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.310
We met for the first time.

936
01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.350
I guess you two have gotten close already.

937
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:18.980
- You said you didn't want it. - That's not true.

938
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:21.491
What is this inappropriate behavior?

939
01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.520
Are you mad at me or something?

940
01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.560
Why would I be?

941
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.591
Isn't he the total opposite of your husband?

942
01:02:29.991 --> 01:02:31.100
What's wrong with you?

943
01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.600
I suddenly feel like I'm not experienced enough.

944
01:02:33.701 --> 01:02:36.500
If I stay with you any longer, I think I'll eat you up.

945
01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.140
Why do you want both?

946
01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.511
I want to be extra careful since I'm never going to get married.

947
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:44.810
I think it'd be a good experience to try and meet him.

948
01:02:45.181 --> 01:02:48.111
I don't have any right to interfere with my wife's private life.

949
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.881
What should we do about him?
