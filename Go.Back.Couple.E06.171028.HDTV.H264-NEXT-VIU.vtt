Seo Jin. Mommy's clothes are here.

4
00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.398
I haven't bought a dress in years.

5
00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:19.398

(To: Ma Jin Joo)

7
00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:33.617
Goodness, why is this so short?

8
00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:38.418
Gosh, if I carry you with this dress on,

9
00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:40.518
my underwear will show.

10
00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:41.787
Right, Seo Jin?

11
00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:47.497
I'll have to return this too.

12
00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:51.367
It's really pretty though.

13
00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:54.137
When I was young...

14
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.668
I thought age was just a number.

15
00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:58.867
I, Ma Jin Joo, was in this world,

16
00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:03.378
and age was just merely a number that soaked into me.

17
00:01:04.177 --> 00:01:06.007
I'm in my late 30s with a kid.

18
00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:09.218
Do you think I can wear an above-the-knee dress?

19
00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:13.287
Do you wear short skirts after having kids?

20
00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:17.527
"I stopped wearing them in my mid 30's."

21
00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:20.458
"I might look like an old woman trying to look younger."

22
00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:24.128
"Me too. After giving birth, I tend to wear long skirts or pants."

23
00:01:24.628 --> 00:01:26.567
"It doesn't matter if it looks good on you."

24
00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:33.977
Yes, I can wear it if it looks good on me.

25
00:01:41.277 --> 00:01:43.688
- Ta-da. - Gosh, you surprised me.

26
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.617
How do I look? Isn't it pretty?

27
00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:52.958
Are you still a child?

28
00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:55.727
You're too old to wear such short skirts. Act your age.

29
00:01:56.328 --> 00:01:58.098
Where are you, Seo Jin?

30
00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.197
Seo Jin, Dad's here.

31
00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:02.567
Where are you, Seo Jin? It's Dad.

32
00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:05.037
Where are you, Seo Jin?

33
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:06.977
- He's sleeping. - Really?

34
00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.647
As I grew older each year, I realized that...

35
00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:21.217
the age wasn't soaking into me.

36
00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:24.828
Rather, I was adjusting myself to my age.

37
00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:29.427
That's how I got used to my age.

(1999, Seoul)

40
00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:47.907
Why is this umbrella so weak?

41
00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:15.897
Fold it. It's done its job.

42
00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:24.178
Then just take me to the College of Liberal Arts building.

43
00:04:43.828 --> 00:04:45.128
Do you like anything in particular?

44
00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:46.737
You.

45
00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:51.237
I think it's true.

46
00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:54.808
I think I like you.

47
00:04:58.907 --> 00:05:02.477
He's so young, yet so sly.

48
00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:04.917
You're making an old woman's heart flutter.

49
00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:08.787
He might be a player.

50
00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:11.157
- Excuse me. - Yes?

51
00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:14.058
Can you come closer to me?

52
00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:16.597
Look. He is a player.

53
00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:18.828
If we walk like this, I'll get wet.

54
00:05:22.897 --> 00:05:24.268
It's my umbrella after all.

55
00:05:25.037 --> 00:05:27.808
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

56
00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:40.458
It'll stop raining soon, right?

57
00:05:40.987 --> 00:05:42.087
Yes.

58
00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:45.157
It's the festival today.

59
00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:34.708
Is he Park Tae Hwan or something?

60
00:06:35.237 --> 00:06:38.178
His shoulders aren't that broad, and yet they're all wet.

61
00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:43.347
It's about the same size.

62
00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:10.448
Why did you bring two?

63
00:07:10.508 --> 00:07:11.708
We can use one together.

64
00:07:11.808 --> 00:07:14.178
Are we shooting a teen drama or something? It will get us wet.

65
00:07:14.578 --> 00:07:15.678
Let's go.

66
00:07:31.328 --> 00:07:34.837
Are you shooting a drama with her and a reality show with me?

67
00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:38.107
That scumbag.

68
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.508
Who? Me?

69
00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:42.537
No, of course not.

70
00:07:46.518 --> 00:07:47.847
Be quiet. Quiet.

71
00:07:47.847 --> 00:07:52.118
Now that it's stopped raining, you must be excited about the festival.

72
00:07:52.217 --> 00:07:53.857
- Yes. - Yes.

73
00:07:53.987 --> 00:07:56.087
You guys won't study on a day like this.

74
00:07:56.428 --> 00:07:58.428
This is my special treat! There's no class today.

75
00:08:02.828 --> 00:08:04.268
Play all you want.

76
00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:05.998
- Thank you. - Thank you.

77
00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:14.638
What are you doing?

78
00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:20.717
His shoulders are similar to mine.

79
00:08:21.477 --> 00:08:23.147
Gosh, that guy.

80
00:08:27.818 --> 00:08:29.287
You can date your first love.

81
00:08:29.688 --> 00:08:31.558
You can fulfill the dream that never came true.

82
00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:33.558
But you shouldn't have come to my dad's theater.

83
00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:35.458
I didn't want to go there.

84
00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:36.898
It just happened.

85
00:08:37.867 --> 00:08:38.997
Well,

86
00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:41.668
he doesn't know who I am anyway.

87
00:08:41.668 --> 00:08:44.107
So you nearly told him who you are kindly.

88
00:08:44.308 --> 00:08:45.507
"Yes, Father-in-law!"

89
00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.337
Gosh.

90
00:08:47.337 --> 00:08:50.347
I've been living like that for 18 years. It comes naturally.

91
00:08:50.548 --> 00:08:54.847
We don't know when we'll go back, yet you got yourself a boyfriend.

92
00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:56.717
He's always following you around.

93
00:08:56.717 --> 00:08:58.087
I thought he was gum or something.

94
00:08:59.087 --> 00:09:00.418
Look who's talking.

95
00:09:01.318 --> 00:09:04.087
Don't cry after being hurt by a sly fox.

96
00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:07.828
I didn't want to tell you this as I don't want to come between you two,

97
00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:10.328
but Min Seo Young had an umbrella this morning.

98
00:09:10.698 --> 00:09:12.967
- She had an umbrella? - Yes.

99
00:09:13.737 --> 00:09:17.267
You don't know how sly people are these days.

100
00:09:19.007 --> 00:09:20.078
Is this true?

101
00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:24.278
What's wrong with you? Have you gone crazy?

102
00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:26.148
It's cute.

103
00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:28.247
She wanted to use the umbrella with me.

104
00:09:28.247 --> 00:09:32.087
She's not a sly fox. That's what teen dramas look like.

105
00:09:32.087 --> 00:09:36.087
You're so used to crazy dramas.

106
00:09:36.087 --> 00:09:37.288
Crazy dramas?

107
00:09:37.288 --> 00:09:38.958
That's not what teen dramas look like.

108
00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958
It's just an illicit love of an old man.

109
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.198
Love and war.

110
00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:43.528
- Illicit love? - Gosh, you surprised me.

111
00:09:44.698 --> 00:09:46.068
Love and war?

112
00:09:49.038 --> 00:09:51.467

Gosh, Ma Jin Joo.

116
00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:04.048
He has thousands of collections for each category.

117
00:10:04.117 --> 00:10:05.217
You should ask him.

118
00:10:06.048 --> 00:10:07.458
Gosh, she doesn't know when to stop.

119
00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:10.857
You must be keeping healthy.

120
00:10:12.288 --> 00:10:14.058
It's not like that. Get out of my way.

121

00:12:52.887 --> 00:12:54.658
end up an old maid,

168
00:12:54.658 --> 00:12:57.357
contemplating about the best way to murder...

169
00:12:57.357 --> 00:12:58.757
Ahn Jae Woo.

170
00:12:58.828 --> 00:12:59.898
I'm not responsible when that happens.

171
00:13:02.298 --> 00:13:04.528
- My goodness. - Forget about that.

172
00:13:05.097 --> 00:13:08.068
You never know if you'll die today or tomorrow in life.

173
00:13:08.068 --> 00:13:10.208
Why would I need to think about the future? My head hurts.

174
00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:12.038
What's important is the present.

175
00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.007
"I want to date you."

176
00:13:14.107 --> 00:13:16.448
"Forget about one-sided love. I want to go out with you."

177
00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:21.948
Isn't Jae Woo just adorable?

178
00:13:23.148 --> 00:13:25.648
You'll ruin your life yourself. Who else can do that?

179
00:13:26.717 --> 00:13:28.487
When's the day you started dating him?

180
00:13:28.617 --> 00:13:29.958
I'll give you 10 dimes for 100 days on your 100th day.

181
00:13:30.028 --> 00:13:32.158
I knew you were very considerate.

182
00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:33.558
But that's not important.

183
00:13:33.558 --> 00:13:34.958
Who cares about the date you started dating someone?

184
00:13:41.997 --> 00:13:44.168
You're really frustrating me.

185
00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:55.017
Today is the second day we started dating.

186
00:14:04.227 --> 00:14:06.158
Brothers, are you ready?

187
00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:08.597
Wait, are you...

188
00:14:11.127 --> 00:14:12.627
My gosh, you startled me.

189
00:14:17.007 --> 00:14:19.438
Why do sad premonitions always come true?

190
00:14:19.837 --> 00:14:21.007
Do you remember?

191
00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:22.938
We've been waiting for this moment since school began.

192
00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:28.318
"Campus Talent Show"!

193
00:14:29.318 --> 00:14:30.548
I remember this.

194
00:14:30.847 --> 00:14:34.458
The title page of my ugly history that'll go away only when I die.

195
00:14:35.717 --> 00:14:36.788
The root of all evil.

196
00:14:38.987 --> 00:14:40.997
(Nurse Mi Gyeong, "Campus Talent Show" video)

197
00:14:42.857 --> 00:14:44.267
Right? Don't you think it's him?

198
00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:45.467
I think so too.

199
00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:48.668
- Mr. Choi. - Hey.

200
00:14:48.867 --> 00:14:50.538
Isn't this you?

201
00:14:52.967 --> 00:14:55.007
I never knew you had this kind of side to you.

202
00:15:00.617 --> 00:15:01.778
Darn it.

203
00:15:04.717 --> 00:15:06.517
Hey, this is awesome.

204
00:15:06.717 --> 00:15:08.517
Where did you get these outfits?

205
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.028
You're awesome. So awesome.

206
00:15:10.658 --> 00:15:13.658
I was a bit crazy back then...

207
00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:21.038
I get it now.

208
00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:24.467
This is why the future sent me back here.

209
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.607
Okay, good.

210
00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:30.308
Hey, friends.

211
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.347
Get rid of...

212
00:15:32.347 --> 00:15:33.747
whatever's on your mind right now.

213
00:15:33.747 --> 00:15:34.847
And this thing?

214
00:15:35.877 --> 00:15:37.847
Don't do it. Don't.

215
00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:39.387
And of course, I won't do it.

216
00:15:39.387 --> 00:15:40.887
What are you talking about?

217
00:15:41.188 --> 00:15:42.257
You said...

218
00:15:42.517 --> 00:15:44.528
you wanted to be on TV at the beginning of the school year,

219
00:15:44.528 --> 00:15:46.257
and you planned the whole thing.

220
00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:48.898
Yes, and he brought everything you asked for.

221
00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:50.028
What's with you?

222
00:15:50.528 --> 00:15:53.438
We'll end up making a great memory with these.

223
00:15:53.737 --> 00:15:55.198
- Right? - Yes.

224
00:15:55.767 --> 00:15:57.168
And this memory...

225
00:15:57.438 --> 00:15:59.507
will haunt you for the rest of your life.

226
00:16:03.247 --> 00:16:04.278
Anyway.

227
00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:07.247
- Goodbye, guys. Good luck. - Where are you going, Ban Do?

228
00:16:09.247 --> 00:16:11.648
Are you really going to the library, instead of the festival?

229
00:16:12.318 --> 00:16:15.158
If old seniors like us sit around at the tent bar,

230
00:16:15.617 --> 00:16:17.757
- the juniors will feel uneasy. - I guess...

231
00:16:17.928 --> 00:16:19.798
you were never really interested in festivals.

232
00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:27.137
It's been forever since I've been at a festival.

233
00:16:27.837 --> 00:16:29.908
I thought you didn't care about festivals.

234
00:16:29.908 --> 00:16:31.007
I guess not.

235
00:16:31.538 --> 00:16:33.977
Festivals and parties are great things.

236
00:16:34.038 --> 00:16:35.237
Party while you can.

237
00:16:35.237 --> 00:16:36.578
Later on, you'll have to pay for this.

238
00:16:36.948 --> 00:16:38.078
Do you pay to go to festivals?

239
00:16:38.408 --> 00:16:39.977
Festivals, parties.

240
00:16:39.977 --> 00:16:42.977
Every single corner of this country is doing some kind of a festival.

241
00:16:43.448 --> 00:16:46.087
You'll be lucky to be able to go if you have the money and time.

242
00:16:47.658 --> 00:16:48.788
That's our major's tent pub.

243
00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:54.658
Hold this.

244
00:16:54.658 --> 00:16:55.757
Goodness, it's heavy.

245
00:16:55.757 --> 00:16:56.997
- I'll get it. - What?

246
00:16:56.997 --> 00:16:58.898
- Oh, okay. - Over there?

247
00:16:58.898 --> 00:16:59.898
- Yes. - Yes.

248
00:16:59.898 --> 00:17:02.337
You young ladies aren't strong enough for this.

249
00:17:02.398 --> 00:17:03.507
Thanks.

250
00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:05.807
- Where? - Over here.

251
00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:08.307
Thank you.

252
00:17:09.507 --> 00:17:11.408
Hey, watch out for the water.

253
00:17:12.148 --> 00:17:14.277
It'll be really bad if you get water in oil.

254
00:17:14.448 --> 00:17:15.878
That could've been bad.

255
00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:29.698
Are you sure the sun rose from the east today?

256
00:17:29.967 --> 00:17:31.967
Hello, Nam Gil.

257
00:17:41.178 --> 00:17:44.348
He never showed up in festivals for the last three years. What's wrong?

258
00:17:44.507 --> 00:17:46.747
It's his last festival. He's a senior.

259
00:17:46.747 --> 00:17:48.217
Exactly. He's a senior.

260
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:50.487
Why would he sit around while we're preparing for the festival?

261
00:17:58.757 --> 00:17:59.827
Goodness.

262
00:17:59.898 --> 00:18:01.628
You're cutting off the good parts.

263
00:18:01.628 --> 00:18:03.168
My goodness.

264
00:18:03.398 --> 00:18:05.527
You have to hold the back of the knife...

265
00:18:05.527 --> 00:18:07.698
and peel just the outside layer.

266
00:18:10.138 --> 00:18:11.307
Was that an order?

267
00:18:12.338 --> 00:18:13.408
Just a suggestion.

268
00:18:16.448 --> 00:18:18.708
Oh, okay. Mom, one minute.

269
00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.577
Okay, so...

270
00:18:20.577 --> 00:18:22.618
a bit of sugar and a lot of red pepper paste.

271
00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:23.987
Okay.

272
00:18:25.388 --> 00:18:27.817
A bit of sugar.

273
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.418
A bit?

274
00:18:29.928 --> 00:18:31.257
A bit?

275
00:18:33.497 --> 00:18:35.358
A bit. A bit.

276
00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:37.467
That's a bit.

277
00:18:39.838 --> 00:18:41.638
Goodness, hey!

278
00:18:42.737 --> 00:18:44.908
- Hey. - That's a bit.

279
00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:47.938
If you added that much, you won't be able to taste anything.

280
00:18:48.307 --> 00:18:50.378
Do you know how to do make this?

281
00:18:51.108 --> 00:18:53.178
I can make stir-fried spicy pork even with my eyes closed.

282
00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:35.817
Are you sure you didn't make this half-heartedly?

283
00:19:36.088 --> 00:19:38.827
Goodness, you're so suspicious.

284
00:19:40.098 --> 00:19:41.158
Try some.

285
00:19:48.338 --> 00:19:49.537
Wow, this is good.

286
00:19:49.807 --> 00:19:51.537
Hey, Jin Joo.

287
00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:53.507
Sul.

288
00:19:54.878 --> 00:19:55.977
Me too.

289
00:19:56.408 --> 00:19:57.477
- This is good. - Right?

290
00:19:57.477 --> 00:19:58.577
Here.

291
00:20:01.777 --> 00:20:02.817
Jin Joo.

292
00:20:03.247 --> 00:20:05.188
This will be our main menu.

293
00:20:05.487 --> 00:20:06.787
How does that sound?

294
00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.088
Hey, this is nothing.

295
00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:13.557
You'll be really shocked if you see my other menus.

296
00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:17.628
How many servings do I have to make?

297
00:20:18.227 --> 00:20:19.297
Oh, right.

298
00:20:19.527 --> 00:20:21.797
We won't have a lot of customers, so let's make just a little.

299
00:20:22.168 --> 00:20:23.737
About 100 servings?

300
00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:26.067
- 100 servings? - Yes.

301
00:20:26.507 --> 00:20:27.638
I have a delivery.

302
00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:34.678
What's that?

303
00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:40.118
Lighten up. We won't make you cook the whole thing.

304
00:20:41.317 --> 00:20:43.827
Anyway, it's about time he got here.

305
00:21:22.098 --> 00:21:23.898
The special forces guard the country,

306
00:21:23.898 --> 00:21:27.497
and the reserved forces guard our bar at the festival.

307
00:21:33.838 --> 00:21:34.938
Thanks.

308
00:21:36.448 --> 00:21:39.378
We accomplish that difficult duty done.

309
00:21:45.247 --> 00:21:46.557
- Hello. - Hello.

310
00:21:47.388 --> 00:21:48.658
Good work.

311
00:21:49.088 --> 00:21:50.757
Have fun at the festival.

312
00:21:50.757 --> 00:21:51.928
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

313
00:21:53.497 --> 00:21:55.628
- Seo Young. - Yes?

314
00:21:55.628 --> 00:21:57.227
You're in great condition these days.

315
00:21:57.297 --> 00:21:59.967
Keep it up and control your weight.

316
00:22:00.267 --> 00:22:01.368
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:22:06.878 --> 00:22:07.977
What's with you?

318
00:22:08.338 --> 00:22:11.547
You're always smiling.

319
00:22:12.378 --> 00:22:14.918
And in a great condition. Is it a guy?

320
00:22:15.247 --> 00:22:17.547
Don't focus only on practicing.

321
00:22:17.547 --> 00:22:19.317
Find a way to relieve your stress.

322
00:22:20.217 --> 00:22:21.958
A guy is a good solution too.

323
00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:39.608
Thank goodness it stopped raining.

324
00:22:39.908 --> 00:22:42.807
You didn't even have an umbrella. Thank goodness I met you there.

325
00:22:43.807 --> 00:22:47.247
What? Right. Thank goodness you came.

326
00:22:47.678 --> 00:22:49.517
It's a good thing I bumped into you.

327
00:22:53.317 --> 00:22:55.017
"Campus Talent Show"?

328
00:22:55.118 --> 00:22:57.757
- Will you be entering it? - What?

329
00:22:57.928 --> 00:22:59.388
No way.

330
00:22:59.388 --> 00:23:01.898
I'm not a kid, and I'm not crazy about being on TV.

331
00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:03.497
No, I won't enter.

332
00:23:03.497 --> 00:23:05.997
Why not? It looks like fun. You should try.

333
00:23:05.997 --> 00:23:08.338
I think it'll be cool to see you on TV.

334
00:23:10.408 --> 00:23:11.507
You think so?

335
00:23:12.408 --> 00:23:13.477
No.

336
00:23:13.678 --> 00:23:15.638
You shouldn't make a mistake that can't be fixed.

337
00:23:15.838 --> 00:23:18.148
Keeping low key is the best way to live.

338
00:23:18.247 --> 00:23:20.918
You always tell me to have fun...

339
00:23:20.918 --> 00:23:22.678
and do whatever I want.

340
00:23:22.848 --> 00:23:24.348
But you're too timid.

341
00:23:25.017 --> 00:23:26.148
Am I?

342
00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:31.928
Wait a minute.

343
00:23:35.527 --> 00:23:36.628
Hi, Mom.

344
00:23:39.297 --> 00:23:41.037
No, I don't want to.

345
00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:44.368
Why would I enter a competition that I can't win?

346
00:23:45.737 --> 00:23:46.838
No!

347
00:23:49.608 --> 00:23:50.708
I'm hanging up.

348
00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:55.678
Gosh, you're scary.

349
00:23:56.618 --> 00:23:57.918
You know how to get angry?

350
00:23:58.188 --> 00:24:01.517
Well... A person can't have only good traits.

351
00:24:01.888 --> 00:24:05.188
What? Who says you only have good traits?

352
00:24:07.128 --> 00:24:08.297
Hey.

353
00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:17.338
- Gosh. - No way.

354
00:24:24.477 --> 00:24:27.648
All you need is this to cook in the army.

355
00:24:27.747 --> 00:24:30.118
When you're cooking this much, you think of...

356
00:24:30.118 --> 00:24:32.747
a spoonful as one shovelful.

357
00:24:36.487 --> 00:24:37.727
Hey, Jin Joo.

358
00:24:38.757 --> 00:24:41.757
If you were going to help out, you should've applied for May Queen.

359
00:24:41.898 --> 00:24:43.428
May Queen?

360
00:24:45.428 --> 00:24:46.567
That's right.

361
00:24:46.797 --> 00:24:51.007
I was nominated early in the semester, wasn't I?

362
00:24:51.668 --> 00:24:52.767
Yes.

363
00:24:53.878 --> 00:24:56.708
I wanted a student from my department to be nominated...

364
00:24:56.708 --> 00:24:59.648
to be May Queen while I was in student council.

365
00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:03.148
But you refused and refused.

366
00:25:04.348 --> 00:25:06.217
That's right.

367
00:25:06.588 --> 00:25:09.088
I guess I was really pretty.

368
00:25:10.227 --> 00:25:11.487
Gosh.

369
00:25:13.898 --> 00:25:15.727
All right. It's done.

370
00:25:15.727 --> 00:25:17.227
- We mustn't waste anything. - Goodness.

371
00:25:21.898 --> 00:25:24.338
Hey. Look what you did!

372
00:25:24.338 --> 00:25:27.237
Gosh, I don't have a change of clothes.

373
00:25:27.477 --> 00:25:29.378
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

374
00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:30.848
It doesn't look that bad though.

375
00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:33.777
- What? - I knew this would happen.

376
00:25:33.878 --> 00:25:35.077
Goodness.

377
00:25:41.057 --> 00:25:43.658
Are you okay? You got the most sauce on your shirt.

378
00:25:43.787 --> 00:25:44.888
Sorry.

379
00:25:45.327 --> 00:25:47.398
I can wash it when I get home.

380
00:25:56.168 --> 00:25:57.307
(Invincible History)

381
00:25:57.307 --> 00:25:58.938
Gosh, that's cold.

382
00:25:59.668 --> 00:26:01.378
I'm sorry.

383
00:26:14.217 --> 00:26:15.388
Why...

384
00:26:25.727 --> 00:26:27.198
What are you doing?

385
00:26:28.898 --> 00:26:30.967
Hey, did someone put drugs in his food?

386
00:26:34.537 --> 00:26:35.737
Gosh.

387
00:26:36.708 --> 00:26:38.648
We have a performance soon.

388
00:26:40.017 --> 00:26:41.477
Hurry up and wipe it off.

389
00:26:43.217 --> 00:26:45.987
Wait. You shouldn't do that.

390
00:26:46.787 --> 00:26:47.888
What?

391
00:26:50.858 --> 00:26:54.227
Because it's oil, it'll spread if you add water.

392
00:26:54.797 --> 00:26:58.368
You put a drop on the spot...

393
00:26:58.698 --> 00:27:01.138
and wash it...

394
00:27:02.237 --> 00:27:03.537
like this.

395
00:27:07.277 --> 00:27:08.378
Ta-da.

396
00:27:09.477 --> 00:27:11.277
Gosh, you're right.

397
00:27:11.277 --> 00:27:14.777
Jae Woo. How do you know all this?

398
00:27:15.577 --> 00:27:17.448
You're so meticulous.

399
00:27:17.717 --> 00:27:20.717
That's why I like you.

400
00:27:25.588 --> 00:27:26.698
Gosh.

Hi, Dok Jae.

00:28:18.777 --> 00:28:20.247
Gosh.

406
00:28:21.547 --> 00:28:24.047
Hey, don't you think it's too much?

407
00:28:24.148 --> 00:28:25.287
What?

408
00:28:25.888 --> 00:28:27.188
"What"?

409
00:28:30.088 --> 00:28:31.458
Three beers, please.

410
00:28:46.708 --> 00:28:47.777
Hello.

411
00:28:52.848 --> 00:28:55.517
Morning kiss, afternoon kiss,

412
00:28:55.517 --> 00:28:56.948
good night kiss.

413
00:28:56.948 --> 00:28:59.547
Yesterday alone I saw you kiss...

414
00:28:59.547 --> 00:29:02.257
more than 10 times, you punk.

415
00:29:02.358 --> 00:29:04.888
What's wrong with her? Is she a pervert?

416
00:29:04.888 --> 00:29:06.188
Is she going out with you to kiss you?

417
00:29:07.198 --> 00:29:09.057
Who would do that?

418
00:29:09.057 --> 00:29:10.198
"Who would do that?"

419
00:29:10.198 --> 00:29:13.567
There are many reasons why people date.

420
00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:16.537
I want to date a girl who's sexy.

421
00:29:16.807 --> 00:29:19.777
I want to date a girl who's cute.

422
00:29:19.807 --> 00:29:22.378
I want to date someone older and someone younger.

423
00:29:23.247 --> 00:29:24.678
What are you saying, idiot?

424
00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:30.517
I mean there are many reasons why a person dates someone.

425
00:29:30.688 --> 00:29:32.618
You're going out with her because you like her.

426
00:29:32.618 --> 00:29:35.388
She also has a reason for going out with you.

427
00:29:35.987 --> 00:29:37.088
A reason.

428
00:29:41.797 --> 00:29:42.898
It's body.

429
00:29:43.898 --> 00:29:45.797
- Body? - It's body.

430
00:29:48.698 --> 00:29:50.708
Hey, I'm getting a signal.

431
00:29:51.108 --> 00:29:52.807
It's a big one.

432
00:29:52.807 --> 00:29:54.878
- I have to go. - Gosh, you're nasty.

433
00:29:55.277 --> 00:29:56.507
What about the body?

434
00:29:57.148 --> 00:29:58.208
(Coffee)

435
00:30:02.717 --> 00:30:03.848
Gosh.

436
00:30:04.088 --> 00:30:07.987
Of course. I see why you'd think that.

437
00:30:08.358 --> 00:30:10.727
There are guys who date girls for physical affection.

438
00:30:11.188 --> 00:30:13.098
I don't hate it.

439
00:30:14.598 --> 00:30:16.797
But sometimes I wonder...

440
00:30:16.967 --> 00:30:19.227
if he's dating me because of that.

441
00:30:19.797 --> 00:30:21.368
Am I easy?

442
00:30:21.368 --> 00:30:24.638
Is he dating me just to grope me?

443
00:30:24.638 --> 00:30:26.138
That jerk.

444
00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:27.977
Is he a pervert?

445
00:30:30.547 --> 00:30:32.878
Is she a pervert?

446
00:30:32.977 --> 00:30:34.717
Is she going out with you to kiss you?

447
00:30:42.888 --> 00:30:44.727
Gosh, it's a college festival.

448
00:30:45.128 --> 00:30:47.198
It's been so long since I came to one.

449
00:30:48.658 --> 00:30:49.997
Good work, Ban Do.

450
00:30:50.297 --> 00:30:51.827
You led a good life.

451
00:30:52.098 --> 00:30:54.668
You're really funny.

452
00:30:54.668 --> 00:30:56.138
Hey, let's go over here.

453
00:31:11.317 --> 00:31:12.517
Throw it straight.

454
00:31:13.987 --> 00:31:14.987
That's right.

455
00:31:23.027 --> 00:31:25.327
Gosh, why are they making such a fuss?

456
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.208
Gosh. That's right.

457
00:31:37.547 --> 00:31:39.918
There were always things like this in college.

458
00:31:40.747 --> 00:31:41.777
Do you want to try?

459
00:31:41.848 --> 00:31:43.688
Yes, you should try.

460
00:31:50.227 --> 00:31:51.227
You're on a date.

461
00:31:51.388 --> 00:31:52.787
I envy you.

462
00:31:53.698 --> 00:31:55.557
Your friends and fourth years...

463
00:31:55.557 --> 00:31:57.628
are working so hard so that...

464
00:31:57.628 --> 00:31:59.967
we can earn some money for our major.

465
00:32:00.398 --> 00:32:02.168
You were nowhere to be seen...

466
00:32:02.698 --> 00:32:03.767
because you were on a date?

467
00:32:04.237 --> 00:32:06.208
Gosh, you must be out of your mind.

468
00:32:06.777 --> 00:32:08.178
- Gosh. - Goodness.

469
00:32:08.307 --> 00:32:10.378
It's not like that.

470
00:32:10.378 --> 00:32:12.507
Who's that? Jin Joo.

471
00:32:13.077 --> 00:32:15.148
Do you want to play?

472
00:32:15.348 --> 00:32:16.348
Yes.

473
00:32:16.618 --> 00:32:18.948
It's 50 cents.

474
00:32:19.118 --> 00:32:20.188
I'll give you a dollar.

475
00:32:26.327 --> 00:32:27.458
But I want him.

476
00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:36.567
What are you doing?

477
00:32:38.007 --> 00:32:40.178
Gosh, wait.

478
00:32:40.378 --> 00:32:42.077
Wait. Wait.

479
00:32:42.077 --> 00:32:43.307
No, I mean...

480
00:32:54.017 --> 00:32:55.158
Okay.

481
00:33:00.628 --> 00:33:02.128
Gosh, hurry up!

482
00:33:10.767 --> 00:33:12.208
Bullseye!

483
00:33:13.307 --> 00:33:15.678
Jin Joo, you're so good at this.

484
00:33:15.807 --> 00:33:17.077
This is easy.

485
00:33:17.247 --> 00:33:18.608
Let me change your diapers.

486
00:33:18.608 --> 00:33:20.077
Gosh, you're so adorable.

487
00:33:20.077 --> 00:33:21.148
My handsome boy.

488
00:33:34.757 --> 00:33:35.827
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

489
00:33:45.408 --> 00:33:46.507
- Excuse me. - Yes?

490
00:33:46.638 --> 00:33:48.007
Can you change him to another person?

491
00:33:49.138 --> 00:33:51.277
Are you worried about him?

492
00:33:51.777 --> 00:33:53.517
Of course.

493
00:33:53.977 --> 00:33:56.388
Oh, my. Choi Ban Do.

494
00:33:56.448 --> 00:33:57.588
Wait.

495
00:33:58.487 --> 00:33:59.648
I think...

496
00:34:00.418 --> 00:34:02.088
we should change.

497
00:34:02.217 --> 00:34:03.958
I think he might die.

498
00:34:04.227 --> 00:34:05.358
No, you can't.

499
00:34:05.557 --> 00:34:07.128
He's my only target.

500
00:34:19.738 --> 00:34:22.108
How many balloons are you throwing?

501
00:34:29.947 --> 00:34:31.017
Ma Jin Joo.

502
00:34:32.287 --> 00:34:33.488
I'll kill you.

503
00:34:35.057 --> 00:34:37.358
That was harsh.

504
00:34:39.057 --> 00:34:41.458
She was really targeting one man.

505
00:34:42.157 --> 00:34:45.668
But I did find out one thing.

506
00:34:45.898 --> 00:34:47.767
You know, love...

507
00:34:47.767 --> 00:34:49.767
comes from worrying about someone.

508
00:34:51.537 --> 00:34:53.137
Min Seo Young...

509
00:34:53.807 --> 00:34:56.477
I think Min Seo Young...

510
00:34:56.907 --> 00:34:58.177
I think...

511
00:34:58.907 --> 00:35:00.117
I think Min Seo Young likes you.

512
00:35:00.847 --> 00:35:02.318
Gosh, Ban Do.

513
00:35:02.548 --> 00:35:04.188
I'm sure of this. Trust me.

514
00:35:05.148 --> 00:35:06.988
- Gosh, you took so long. - What?

515
00:35:06.988 --> 00:35:08.188
You took so long to find out.

516
00:35:08.218 --> 00:35:10.787
Gosh, well done.

517
00:35:10.787 --> 00:35:12.387
Well done.

518
00:35:12.657 --> 00:35:14.798
What's this? You knew this?

519
00:35:15.427 --> 00:35:16.468
How would you?

520
00:35:16.727 --> 00:35:20.438
You're too stupid and ignorant to realize such delicate feelings.

521
00:35:22.968 --> 00:35:24.238
Why are you sighing?

522
00:35:26.577 --> 00:35:27.677
Let's go.

523
00:35:27.738 --> 00:35:28.878
What's wrong with him?

524
00:35:29.307 --> 00:35:31.548
You were so happy just before.

525
00:35:32.008 --> 00:35:33.148
Did she dump you?

526
00:35:34.177 --> 00:35:35.477
She didn't kiss you, am I right?

527
00:35:35.818 --> 00:35:37.818
Don't pick on me. I don't feel like getting in a fight.

528
00:35:39.818 --> 00:35:41.188
Yes, sir.

529
00:35:42.887 --> 00:35:44.028
Ban Do,

530
00:35:44.028 --> 00:35:45.688
change into our uniform.

531
00:35:45.688 --> 00:35:47.697
You used to wear it every day.

532
00:35:47.697 --> 00:35:50.968
I told you not to do this.

533
00:35:51.298 --> 00:35:53.597
You might embarrass yourselves...

534
00:35:53.597 --> 00:35:55.767
and be treated as Bruce Lee all over the nation.

535
00:35:55.767 --> 00:35:57.108
I won't do it.

536
00:35:57.108 --> 00:35:58.367
I can't.

537
00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:00.508
Choi Ban Do.

538
00:36:00.708 --> 00:36:03.378
Are you sure you won't have regrets when we come out on TV without you?

539
00:36:03.447 --> 00:36:04.477
Yes.

540
00:36:04.508 --> 00:36:06.077
If you're certain you won't regret it,

541
00:36:07.577 --> 00:36:09.447
come and take some pictures.

542
00:36:10.017 --> 00:36:12.347
Let's go.

543
00:36:12.347 --> 00:36:14.318
Do you really need to take that road?

544
00:36:15.057 --> 00:36:16.188
Hey!

545
00:36:16.188 --> 00:36:19.588
At least, don't do anything with the water bottle.

546
00:36:19.588 --> 00:36:21.157
Hey! Kang Ho Dong is here!

547
00:36:21.227 --> 00:36:22.597
Kang Ho Dong? Kang Ho Dong?

548
00:36:30.537 --> 00:36:32.867
Hey! Kang Ho Dong is here!

549
00:36:33.008 --> 00:36:35.208
- What? - Gosh.

550
00:36:40.818 --> 00:36:41.918
Let's go.

551
00:36:41.918 --> 00:36:43.048
It's Kang Ho Dong.

552
00:36:43.048 --> 00:36:44.318
I'm not going.

553
00:36:44.318 --> 00:36:45.787
Why would I want to see Kang Ho Dong?

554
00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:48.517
It's not only him. Jae Woo and the others are coming.

555
00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:50.628
They're just going to make a fool of themselves.

556
00:36:50.758 --> 00:36:52.758
Are you really not going?

557
00:36:52.758 --> 00:36:54.427
Yes, go on.

558
00:36:54.628 --> 00:36:56.968
We'll come back after seeing Kang Ho Dong, all right?

559
00:36:57.028 --> 00:36:58.028
All right.

560
00:36:58.128 --> 00:36:59.327
Let's go!

561
00:38:12.068 --> 00:38:13.307
Is it for me?

562
00:38:14.238 --> 00:38:15.278
Why?

563
00:38:32.588 --> 00:38:35.927
It's new. Is it for me?

564
00:38:36.497 --> 00:38:37.528
Why?

565
00:38:59.758 --> 00:39:01.617
You should just laugh out loud.

566
00:39:01.758 --> 00:39:03.588
That makes me feel worse.

567
00:39:04.427 --> 00:39:07.697
I told you not to do anything with the water bottle.

568
00:39:07.997 --> 00:39:11.028
I wanted to change your destiny, but you won't listen to me.

569
00:39:11.367 --> 00:39:12.968
If this gets broadcast on TV,

570
00:39:13.097 --> 00:39:14.497
it'll become an ugly past...

571
00:39:14.968 --> 00:39:16.068
that will last until you die.

572
00:39:16.137 --> 00:39:18.068
So what? It was adorable.

573
00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:20.438
Well done.

574
00:39:21.137 --> 00:39:23.008
Gosh, you're so cute.

575
00:39:27.418 --> 00:39:28.747
Isn't that Min Seo Young?

576
00:39:29.787 --> 00:39:31.148
Why is she wandering around?

577
00:39:32.318 --> 00:39:33.517
Min Seo Young!

578
00:39:33.918 --> 00:39:34.918
Hey!

579
00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:37.358
Ban Do is here.

580
00:39:40.227 --> 00:39:41.697
Gosh, there's a mosquito.

581
00:39:43.497 --> 00:39:44.668
Good luck.

582
00:39:54.708 --> 00:39:55.907
Nam Gil.

583
00:39:56.108 --> 00:39:57.347
Where have you been?

584
00:40:05.387 --> 00:40:06.988
(May Queen Contest)

585
00:40:08.818 --> 00:40:10.188
Isn't the candidate from the college of liberal arts here?

586
00:40:10.988 --> 00:40:12.128
- No. - No.

587
00:40:12.358 --> 00:40:13.898
Darn it.

588
00:40:14.028 --> 00:40:15.758
What's wrong?

589
00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.568
A May Queen candidate isn't coming.

590
00:40:18.568 --> 00:40:21.238
The Zhang Ziyi lookalike from the Chinese major?

591
00:40:21.238 --> 00:40:22.298
Yes.

592
00:40:22.497 --> 00:40:24.108
Gosh, pretty girls are so full of themselves.

593
00:40:34.718 --> 00:40:36.148
You're drinking too much.

594
00:40:38.418 --> 00:40:39.858
It'll stop raining soon, right?

595
00:40:40.387 --> 00:40:41.488
Yes.

596
00:40:57.807 --> 00:40:58.867
Did you see me?

597
00:41:01.378 --> 00:41:02.838
Gosh, look at that.

598
00:41:02.838 --> 00:41:04.778
I'm too embarrassed to come to school, Jae Woo.

599
00:41:04.778 --> 00:41:06.208
No, it was fun.

600
00:41:06.977 --> 00:41:08.218
No, it wasn't.

601
00:41:12.347 --> 00:41:15.657
It's like you're dating a minor.

602
00:41:42.177 --> 00:41:45.517
How come that young kid has such emotional eyes?

603
00:41:47.358 --> 00:41:48.958
What a player.

604
00:41:53.227 --> 00:41:55.157
What? I mean, what is it?

605
00:41:55.427 --> 00:41:57.997
Give me some. I never got a taste.

606
00:42:00.168 --> 00:42:02.097
Are you hungry? Here you are.

607
00:42:12.148 --> 00:42:13.548
Hey, Jin Joo!

608
00:42:24.727 --> 00:42:29.028
Hey, why did you get stuff on your shirt like an old lady?

609
00:42:29.157 --> 00:42:30.327
An old lady?

610
00:42:30.528 --> 00:42:33.798
Stop being nosy, and mind your own business.

611
00:42:51.617 --> 00:42:54.318
I heard old men dating minors is a huge problem nowadays.

612
00:42:55.157 --> 00:42:58.958
There are many perverted old men, right?

613
00:42:59.028 --> 00:43:01.327
Perverted old men? Like who?

614
00:43:01.327 --> 00:43:04.468
There are these perverted guys that only love young women.

615
00:43:04.628 --> 00:43:09.468
Goodness, I heard old women are bigger problems nowadays.

616
00:43:09.968 --> 00:43:12.807
They go to these male escort bars,

617
00:43:12.807 --> 00:43:14.838
and they go crazy and think they're young...

618
00:43:15.108 --> 00:43:17.947
because these young men kiss up to them.

619
00:43:18.447 --> 00:43:19.847
Be careful.

620
00:43:20.847 --> 00:43:22.648
There is always more than meets the eye.

621
00:43:24.088 --> 00:43:25.188
You!

622
00:43:25.447 --> 00:43:26.557
What?

623
00:43:27.988 --> 00:43:30.057
What are you two talking about?

624
00:43:30.287 --> 00:43:32.657
What's this talk about dating minors and a male escort bar?

625
00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:34.827
Have they always been this close?

626
00:43:35.758 --> 00:43:38.597
You're right. You two seem very close.

627
00:43:39.597 --> 00:43:40.838
We aren't close.

628
00:43:43.307 --> 00:43:46.367
Forget about it. Give me that stir-fried spicy pork.

629
00:43:46.367 --> 00:43:47.977
I heard it's really good.

630
00:43:47.977 --> 00:43:50.608
Yes, we found the hidden genius chef.

631
00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:52.648
Jin Joo!

632
00:43:52.807 --> 00:43:56.588
We need one person from liberal arts to be in the May Queen Contest.

633
00:43:56.588 --> 00:44:00.287
They'll let you join because you were on the preliminaries.

634
00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:01.858
Just do it, will you?

635
00:44:02.557 --> 00:44:05.157
What? Was she on the preliminaries of the May Queen Contest?

636
00:44:05.157 --> 00:44:07.798
We voted for her because she was pretty, but she refused to go.

637
00:44:07.798 --> 00:44:09.227
Jin Joo, do it.

638
00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:11.668
You're the prettiest girl in the College of Liberal Arts.

639
00:44:11.767 --> 00:44:13.267
Just do it.

640
00:44:13.267 --> 00:44:15.637
How can I ever be the May Queen?

641
00:44:15.867 --> 00:44:18.968
I'm not the type that likes to be in front of people.

642
00:44:18.968 --> 00:44:21.608
They won't crown just anyone as the May Queen.

643
00:44:22.278 --> 00:44:25.608
Don't embarrass yourself by joining the contest.

644
00:44:26.177 --> 00:44:27.577
That idiot.

645
00:44:28.048 --> 00:44:29.218
What's with him?

646
00:44:29.477 --> 00:44:31.617
Embarrass myself?

647
00:44:31.947 --> 00:44:34.387
You're worried because I might be the first place.

648
00:44:34.387 --> 00:44:36.657
- Me? - That's it. The first place.

649
00:44:36.787 --> 00:44:38.488
Let's do it. You are doing it, okay?

650
00:44:38.657 --> 00:44:39.758
What?

651
00:44:40.927 --> 00:44:44.097
Oh, gosh. I'm not dressed properly.

652
00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:46.668
Next time.

653
00:44:52.668 --> 00:44:54.577
What's this?

654
00:44:54.838 --> 00:44:56.037
Why do you have new clothes?

655
00:44:57.077 --> 00:44:58.477
It was in my car.

656
00:44:59.307 --> 00:45:01.648
In your car? Women's clothes?

657
00:45:04.887 --> 00:45:07.688
My sister. It's my younger sister's.

658
00:45:08.787 --> 00:45:10.327
Right, sure.

659
00:45:13.298 --> 00:45:15.057
This isn't good.

660
00:45:15.858 --> 00:45:17.867
How can I ever be the May Queen Contest?

661
00:45:18.168 --> 00:45:20.367
You can't be the May Queen.

662
00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:22.137
You should be glad if you aren't the last place.

663
00:45:23.668 --> 00:45:25.608
What will you do if I win?

664
00:45:25.608 --> 00:45:27.577
What? You? Win?

665
00:45:31.108 --> 00:45:32.548
Goodness.

666
00:45:33.247 --> 00:45:34.347
Okay.

667
00:45:35.077 --> 00:45:36.988
- Let's do it. - Really?

668
00:45:37.588 --> 00:45:40.358
Then I'll ask someone to get some accessories too.

669
00:45:40.358 --> 00:45:42.617
Let's go. Come on, hurry.

670
00:45:42.617 --> 00:45:44.787
(May Queen Dressing and Waiting Room)

671
00:45:46.028 --> 00:45:48.157
She's the May Queen candidate from the College of Liberal Arts.

672
00:45:48.497 --> 00:45:49.597
- Okay. - Okay.

673
00:45:52.168 --> 00:45:54.767
I got myself into this because Ban Do got me angry.

674
00:45:55.168 --> 00:45:56.637
But how can I be the May Queen?

675
00:45:56.838 --> 00:45:58.137
I can't do this.

676
00:45:59.468 --> 00:46:00.537
Hey.

677
00:46:01.938 --> 00:46:04.648
Make it good. You're the Queen of the history major.

678
00:46:06.008 --> 00:46:09.017
- Hey... - If you win, it'll be even better.

679
00:46:09.218 --> 00:46:10.318
Good luck!

680
00:46:11.218 --> 00:46:13.588
Hey, wait. I...

681
00:46:14.588 --> 00:46:15.988
You're the substitute,

682
00:46:15.988 --> 00:46:17.787
Ma Jin Joo, a history major, right?

683
00:46:18.057 --> 00:46:19.157
Yes.

684
00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:21.858
- Get changed and ready. - Okay.

685
00:46:35.807 --> 00:46:37.708
Goodness, why is this so short?

686
00:46:38.577 --> 00:46:39.847
(May Queen Contest)

687
00:46:40.278 --> 00:46:41.418
It's starting.

688
00:46:43.347 --> 00:46:45.048
(Here comes the May Queen, Ko Eun Seon of chemistry major!)

689
00:46:45.048 --> 00:46:46.958
Hello, everyone.

690
00:46:48.617 --> 00:46:50.028
It's the moment you've been waiting for.

691
00:46:50.287 --> 00:46:52.157
It's the highlight of the festival.

692
00:46:52.157 --> 00:46:55.958
Let Hankook University's May Queen Contest begin.

693
00:46:55.958 --> 00:46:57.097
A round of applause, please.

694
00:46:57.697 --> 00:47:00.838
We don't have to worry. Jin Joo will definitely win.

695
00:47:01.037 --> 00:47:02.238
You're right. Don't worry.

696
00:47:02.238 --> 00:47:04.267
Jin Joo will definitely be the last place.

697
00:47:07.838 --> 00:47:08.977
Gosh, you scared me.

698
00:47:09.037 --> 00:47:10.608
Stop looking at me like that.

699
00:47:10.608 --> 00:47:12.577
You're really scary whenever you glare at me.

700
00:47:12.847 --> 00:47:14.048
I'm not scary.

701
00:47:14.378 --> 00:47:15.617
Am I scary?

702
00:47:16.688 --> 00:47:17.818
What?

703
00:47:17.818 --> 00:47:19.887
Now, before we bring out the beautiful...

704
00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:22.787
- May Queen candidates, - Did you just hesitate?

705
00:47:22.787 --> 00:47:25.227
let me tell you not to applaud only for people from your major.

706
00:47:25.628 --> 00:47:28.358
I'm just kidding. Don't be scared.

707
00:47:28.358 --> 00:47:30.497
Rather, clap for whoever is the prettiest to you, okay?

708
00:47:30.497 --> 00:47:32.197
- Okay. - Sounds great.

709
00:47:32.197 --> 00:47:34.537
And now, the first contestant.

710
00:47:34.938 --> 00:47:37.968
Kim Yeong Ju from the College of Education.

711
00:47:37.968 --> 00:47:40.177
Please come out. A round of applause, please.

712
00:47:42.137 --> 00:47:44.407
Goodness, you're such a beauty.

713
00:47:44.477 --> 00:47:46.847
Say hello to everyone. Great.

714
00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:50.847
Next up is Ko Eun Seon from the College of Engineering.

715
00:47:55.117 --> 00:47:57.628
Wow, she looks great too.

716
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.188
Say hello to everyone.

717
00:47:59.188 --> 00:48:01.197
All right, great.

718
00:48:02.057 --> 00:48:04.727
Should I stop now? Should I leave?

719
00:48:05.168 --> 00:48:06.298
Should I go?

720
00:48:06.468 --> 00:48:08.668
Gosh, but I said I'll do it.

721
00:48:09.338 --> 00:48:12.508
And finally, the last contestant.

722
00:48:12.907 --> 00:48:16.608
Ma Jin Joo from the College of Liberal Arts.

723
00:48:16.608 --> 00:48:18.008
- Give her a round of applause. - It's Jin Joo.

724
00:48:25.048 --> 00:48:27.358
Let's give them all a hand.

725
00:48:32.258 --> 00:48:34.827
Wow, aren't they all so beautiful?

726
00:48:36.927 --> 00:48:38.028
All right, then.

727
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.367
You're so pretty!

728
00:48:42.597 --> 00:48:44.738
Look at her. She's so pretty.

729
00:48:50.378 --> 00:48:53.878
Hey, do all women look like her...

730
00:48:53.878 --> 00:48:55.918
when they're dressed up?

731
00:48:56.688 --> 00:48:57.787
No.

732
00:48:59.017 --> 00:49:00.818
Please introduce yourself.

733
00:49:01.488 --> 00:49:02.617
Pardon?

734
00:49:03.727 --> 00:49:05.958
- Please introduce yourself. - Right.

735
00:49:08.827 --> 00:49:10.697
Hello, everyone.

736
00:49:11.528 --> 00:49:14.438
I'm Ma Jin Joo, a history major from the College of Liberal arts.

737
00:49:16.298 --> 00:49:18.068
She's really nervous.

738
00:49:18.738 --> 00:49:21.778
The beautiful ladies here...

739
00:49:21.778 --> 00:49:24.278
will put on a talent show.

740
00:49:24.278 --> 00:49:27.418
What have you prepared, Ms. Ma Jin Joo?

741
00:49:28.718 --> 00:49:30.148
I haven't heard anything about that.

742
00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:33.787
Hey, isn't that the same girl that you wanted to hit on?

743
00:49:33.958 --> 00:49:36.287
Yes, you're right.

744
00:49:36.628 --> 00:49:38.887
You should hurry. She'll be taken soon.

745
00:49:40.028 --> 00:49:42.427
But since you do have to show us what you can do,

746
00:49:42.427 --> 00:49:44.798
can you show us anything you're good at?

747
00:49:45.227 --> 00:49:48.938
Oh, I'm very talented at eating things and whatnot,

748
00:49:48.938 --> 00:49:53.477
but I really don't have anything I can show on stage.

749
00:49:54.338 --> 00:49:55.878
- I'm dropping out. - Wait.

750
00:49:55.878 --> 00:49:58.677
You can't drop out after I've introduced you.

751
00:49:58.677 --> 00:49:59.847
You can't do that.

752
00:49:59.847 --> 00:50:02.548
Just show us anything you're good at.

753
00:50:02.947 --> 00:50:05.847
For example, you can dance, sing,

754
00:50:05.847 --> 00:50:07.517
or impersonate someone.

755
00:50:08.958 --> 00:50:11.988
I don't think I'm good at anything in particular.

756
00:50:14.358 --> 00:50:15.727
Something I'm good at?

757
00:50:20.938 --> 00:50:25.767
The dusk begins to fall

758
00:50:25.867 --> 00:50:30.648
On this dark street

759
00:50:30.648 --> 00:50:35.117
And quietly I tell you

760
00:50:35.218 --> 00:50:40.188
About my dream

761
00:50:51.267 --> 00:50:54.867
Goodness, honey. You're such a great singer.

762
00:50:54.867 --> 00:50:58.568
Thanks to you, Jin Joo is a great singer too.

763
00:50:59.238 --> 00:51:02.637
Jin Joo is truly an exceptional singer.

764
00:51:02.938 --> 00:51:04.708
She was born with the talent.

765
00:51:05.847 --> 00:51:07.677
Maybe she should've been a singer.

766
00:51:07.677 --> 00:51:08.918
- A singer? - Yes.

767
00:51:38.577 --> 00:51:43.387
Leave my life alone

768
00:51:44.347 --> 00:51:47.688
Don't meddle with it anymore

769
00:51:48.918 --> 00:51:52.827
To the world that

770
00:51:53.227 --> 00:51:56.057
I can lead my own life

771
00:51:56.097 --> 00:51:59.738
- I will be born again - Jin Joo, don't be nervous!

772
00:52:01.968 --> 00:52:06.807
I don't need anything else

773
00:52:07.838 --> 00:52:11.878
I only need music and dance

774
00:52:12.077 --> 00:52:13.977
Just like this

775
00:52:13.977 --> 00:52:16.318
I will do what I want

776
00:52:16.387 --> 00:52:19.218
I will spread my wings

777
00:52:19.387 --> 00:52:23.227
I have to be the owner

778
00:52:23.758 --> 00:52:26.128
Of my life

779
00:52:26.758 --> 00:52:28.597
I know now

780
00:52:28.727 --> 00:52:31.597
What my real life is

781
00:52:31.597 --> 00:52:34.497
In the rhythms of music

782
00:52:34.497 --> 00:52:38.608
I'm always there

783
00:52:38.608 --> 00:52:40.378
Even if I have to

784
00:52:40.378 --> 00:52:42.977
Choose my life again

785
00:52:42.977 --> 00:52:45.177
There won't be any regrets

786
00:52:45.508 --> 00:52:48.677
I'd be happy to be anywhere

787
00:52:48.677 --> 00:52:51.287
Where there is music

788
00:52:51.747 --> 00:52:56.528
I want to walk a different path

789
00:52:57.557 --> 00:53:01.657
I will find a different me

790
00:53:01.758 --> 00:53:06.197
What's at the end of this world?

791
00:53:06.267 --> 00:53:09.097
I will fly higher

792
00:53:09.238 --> 00:53:15.807
Nobody can live my life for me

793
00:53:16.077 --> 00:53:18.048
I know now

794
00:53:18.048 --> 00:53:20.977
What my real life is

795
00:53:20.977 --> 00:53:23.688
In the rhythms of music

796
00:53:23.988 --> 00:53:27.988
I'm always there

797
00:53:27.988 --> 00:53:29.588
Even if I have to

798
00:53:29.787 --> 00:53:32.327
Choose my life again

799
00:53:32.427 --> 00:53:34.458
There won't be any regrets

800
00:53:34.827 --> 00:53:37.898
I'd be happy to be anywhere

801
00:53:37.898 --> 00:53:40.597
Where there is music

802
00:53:41.037 --> 00:53:45.907
I want to walk a different path

803
00:53:46.738 --> 00:53:50.907
I will find a different me

804
00:53:51.048 --> 00:53:55.577
What's at the end of this world?

805
00:53:55.577 --> 00:53:58.247
I will fly higher

806
00:53:58.447 --> 00:54:05.157
Nobody can live my life for me

807
00:54:07.057 --> 00:54:14.197
Nobody can live my life for me

808
00:54:51.968 --> 00:54:53.278
I have a question.

809
00:54:55.677 --> 00:54:57.807
- What is it? - What do you like?

810
00:54:58.307 --> 00:54:59.378
"What do I like?"

811
00:54:59.378 --> 00:55:02.447
I like ballet, hip-hop, and dance.

812
00:55:02.918 --> 00:55:05.017
You know what I like.

813
00:55:05.287 --> 00:55:08.588
But I don't know much about you.

814
00:55:09.488 --> 00:55:10.588
You're right.

815
00:55:11.287 --> 00:55:13.398
What do I like?

816
00:55:13.898 --> 00:55:15.628
What do I like?

817
00:55:17.327 --> 00:55:19.367
Maybe you don't know it because I don't like anything.

818
00:55:19.997 --> 00:55:22.867
How can you not like anything? Think more carefully.

819
00:55:24.267 --> 00:55:27.008
Something I like? Something I like...

820
00:55:27.608 --> 00:55:28.778
- Cheers. - Drink up.

821
00:55:30.177 --> 00:55:31.208
Alcohol!

822
00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:35.048
Alcohol is what you like?

823
00:55:36.318 --> 00:55:38.088
I really don't know.

824
00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:39.688
Goodness.

825
00:55:40.188 --> 00:55:41.418
That's like you though.

826
00:55:44.387 --> 00:55:46.758
- She was so close. - I know.

827
00:55:46.927 --> 00:55:48.528
Jin Joo was the prettiest.

828
00:55:49.128 --> 00:55:51.468
You're saying that because she's your friend.

829
00:55:51.528 --> 00:55:52.867
She wasn't the prettiest.

830
00:55:53.168 --> 00:55:54.468
She was the prettiest.

831
00:55:55.367 --> 00:55:56.367
Are you challenging me?

832
00:55:56.367 --> 00:55:58.508
No, I never challenged you.

833
00:55:58.838 --> 00:56:01.278
Let's say the judges were blind.

834
00:56:03.807 --> 00:56:06.378
By the way, why is Jae Woo going to the bathroom so often?

835
00:56:08.378 --> 00:56:10.418
Well... Mr. Bo Reum?

836
00:56:11.847 --> 00:56:13.958
There's something I really want to ask you.

837
00:56:14.017 --> 00:56:17.128
- May I ask you a question? - You're free to ask.

838
00:56:17.128 --> 00:56:18.588
I'm free to not give an answer.

839
00:56:18.588 --> 00:56:20.958
Why can't you just answer me? Never mind then.

840
00:56:21.858 --> 00:56:23.668
What is it?

841
00:56:24.197 --> 00:56:27.997
The reason why you're dating Jae Woo...

842
00:56:29.468 --> 00:56:31.108
She'll hit me if I put it like this.

843
00:56:33.238 --> 00:56:34.307
Why...

844
00:56:35.238 --> 00:56:36.977
are you going out with Jae Woo?

845
00:56:37.807 --> 00:56:39.378
- What? - Well...

846
00:56:39.378 --> 00:56:41.648
There must be a lot of reasons for dating him.

847
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:42.747
Why are you dating him?

848
00:56:43.188 --> 00:56:45.117
Why do you want to know?

849
00:56:45.148 --> 00:56:47.358
Come on. It's not like answering me costs money.

850
00:56:47.358 --> 00:56:48.418
Why are you dating him?

851
00:56:49.617 --> 00:56:50.727
Because he's easy.

852
00:56:52.358 --> 00:56:54.157
Jae Woo is easy.

853
00:56:56.427 --> 00:56:58.497
Easy... Easy?

854
00:56:58.767 --> 00:57:00.898
Easy...

855
00:57:05.938 --> 00:57:08.137
(Under construction. Use bathroom in the College of the Arts.)

856
00:57:11.347 --> 00:57:13.008
The College of the Arts is so far.

857
00:57:25.227 --> 00:57:28.898
- Hey. - Wasn't she really pretty?

858
00:57:28.898 --> 00:57:30.798
She was awesome.

859
00:57:35.767 --> 00:57:37.668
The arts major was my type.

860
00:57:37.938 --> 00:57:39.778
She was pretty. Anyway they were all hot.

861
00:57:39.778 --> 00:57:41.077
Goodness.

862
00:57:41.977 --> 00:57:44.278
Not her, but the history major.

863
00:57:44.477 --> 00:57:47.778
- She was so cute. She's my type. - Me too.

864
00:57:48.918 --> 00:57:50.318
These kids...

865
00:57:50.688 --> 00:57:52.017
have a good taste in women.

866
00:57:52.017 --> 00:57:55.088
Hey, Hyun Seok picked her at the club.

867
00:57:55.458 --> 00:57:58.287
Yes, she's mine. Don't lay your eyes on her.

868
00:57:58.887 --> 00:58:00.898
That's Dr. Park.

869
00:58:02.057 --> 00:58:03.298
Kids.

870
00:58:03.298 --> 00:58:06.068
I'll give her to you when I get bored with her.

871
00:58:07.097 --> 00:58:08.968
Why that...

872
00:58:10.108 --> 00:58:11.708
You're all dead.

873
00:58:11.968 --> 00:58:14.708
- She was amazing. - They were great.

874
00:58:15.508 --> 00:58:16.907
You're all dead...

875
00:58:25.588 --> 00:58:26.918
Did I drink too much?

876
00:58:27.988 --> 00:58:29.218
What...

877
00:58:43.407 --> 00:58:44.407
Well...

878
00:59:18.508 --> 00:59:19.668
What are you doing?

879
00:59:22.208 --> 00:59:23.378
What are you doing?

880
00:59:24.847 --> 00:59:25.878
What?

881
00:59:34.958 --> 00:59:35.958
(Epilogue)

882
00:59:35.958 --> 00:59:37.287
("Campus Talent Show", Hankook University)

883
00:59:37.287 --> 00:59:39.827
"Campus Talent Show" is at Hankook University today!

884
00:59:39.827 --> 00:59:41.697
Jin Joo's school is on TV. Come out and watch.

885
00:59:42.057 --> 00:59:43.197
- Really? - Yes.

886
00:59:44.227 --> 00:59:45.528
I heard they were there.

887
00:59:45.867 --> 00:59:47.537
Hey, Jin Joo! Come out!

888
00:59:48.697 --> 00:59:49.838
Why isn't she coming out?

889
00:59:50.738 --> 00:59:51.968
Doesn't she want to watch this?

890
00:59:52.208 --> 00:59:53.278
Leave her alone.

891
00:59:53.278 --> 00:59:55.407
Please give them a big hand!

892
00:59:55.878 --> 00:59:58.148
- Look at him. - "Nice to meet you."

893
00:59:59.347 --> 01:00:00.517
Hello.

894
01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.577
Please introduce yourselves.

895
01:00:02.577 --> 01:00:04.088
- Goodness. - Hello!

896
01:00:04.188 --> 01:00:06.617
I'm civil construction major...

897
01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:08.258
Choi Ban Do!

898
01:00:08.318 --> 01:00:09.787
Ahn Jae Woo!

899
01:00:10.528 --> 01:00:11.787
Go Dok Jae!

900
01:00:12.028 --> 01:00:13.057
2, 3!

901
01:00:13.227 --> 01:00:14.227
- Hello! - Hello!

902
01:00:14.227 --> 01:00:15.258
- They're cute. - They are.

903
01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:16.697
What will you show us?

904
01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:19.427
Is it a strength performance? Okay, good.

905
01:00:27.838 --> 01:00:29.077
He's so funny.

906
01:00:34.418 --> 01:00:35.577
- Wait. - He's funny.

907
01:00:36.588 --> 01:00:37.718
They're exactly the same!

908
01:00:38.787 --> 01:00:39.818
- Gosh. - That hurt.

909
01:00:40.688 --> 01:00:42.117
Why is he so funny?

910
01:00:43.017 --> 01:00:45.327
Students your age all have girlfriends.

911
01:00:45.327 --> 01:00:46.497
Do you have a girlfriend?

912
01:00:46.497 --> 01:00:47.597
History major!

913
01:00:49.128 --> 01:00:50.298
Ma Jin Joo!

914
01:00:55.267 --> 01:00:56.338
He's my boyfriend.

915
01:00:56.867 --> 01:00:57.938
I love you!

916
01:01:01.977 --> 01:01:03.347
Call him in now.

917
01:01:04.447 --> 01:01:05.577
Now!

918
01:01:05.907 --> 01:01:07.048
I love you too!

919
01:01:16.557 --> 01:01:18.227
I'm going to kill that guy!

920
01:01:41.747 --> 01:01:45.218
(Go Back Couple)

921
01:01:45.318 --> 01:01:46.858
Why are you opening the door like that?

922
01:01:47.657 --> 01:01:49.057
If you're in medical school,

923
01:01:49.057 --> 01:01:51.628
don't you have the "Medical Student's Night?"

924
01:01:51.628 --> 01:01:53.358
Do you want to go with me?

925
01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:55.758
There's no way to know unless you hear it from them directly.

926
01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:59.898
I told you Yoon Bo Reum was popular. That evil girl.

927
01:02:00.097 --> 01:02:02.168
Who are you going to bring to "Medical Student's Night?

928
01:02:02.298 --> 01:02:05.637
- How do you like it? - She's lost her mind.

929
01:02:05.668 --> 01:02:07.137
I bought it for you.

930
01:02:07.177 --> 01:02:10.508
You're living the dream imagining life with a tall, young man.

931
01:02:10.807 --> 01:02:13.378
Why aren't they picking up?
