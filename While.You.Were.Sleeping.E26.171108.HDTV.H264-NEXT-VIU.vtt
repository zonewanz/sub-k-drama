1
00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.500
Don't you think it's unnecessary to record how night duty is served?

2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.599
I mean, you'll spend two more days here.

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.470
I want to call it a day too,

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.039
but my boss wants me to record everything that happens here.

5
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.980
I must follow his orders. I have no choice.

6
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.980
- Oh, Ms. Son. - Yes, sir.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.519
Who's doing the night duty today?

8
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.549
It was supposed to be Mr. Lee, but he swapped it with Mr. Jung.

9
00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.460
Why did he swap it with that novice...

10
00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:34.730
out of everyone?

11
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.630
Well, can you cover it?

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.730
I have plans.

13
00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:42.799
Then what about Ms. Shin?

14
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.099
She said she also has plans tonight.

15
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.839
Just trust him and let him do it.

16
00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.940
Mr. Jung has been making a lot of effort, you know.

17
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.910
I know that he makes effort,

18
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.880
but he delivers no results after making all the effort day and night.

19
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.480
Sorry? She'll film me on night duty today?

20
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.450
Well, that's... No, she can't. I mean...

21
00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.490
Okay. Got it. Bye.

22
00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.559
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

23
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.890
Is someone coming?

24
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.029
We're done with the investigations for today.

25
00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.200
She'll come here to film me on night duty today!

26
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.569
Ms. Moon, please hide these documents in Mr. Lee's office.

27
00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:19.940
- Why? - I'd look like I have...

28
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.170
too many unsolved cases, which will make me look incompetent.

29
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.910
Don't make such a fuss. Just be your usual self.

30
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.380
Then I'd disgrace the entire prosecution.

31
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.410
At least he knows.

32
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.579
Gosh, I've never even washed this. I'm so doomed.

33
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.960
Mr. Choi, the smell can't be captured on camera, right?

34
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.730
Thank you for letting me record your dynamic day at work,

35
00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.099
Prosecutor Jung.

36
00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.529
- Gosh. - Then...

37
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.299
I guess we'll be on TV too.

38
00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:58.640
Gosh, good grief.

39
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.380
Why did you meet Mr. Park Dae Young?

40
00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319
I already told you.

41
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.289
The person who lost the phone asked me to find it,

42
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.920
so I met him on his behalf.

43
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.390
Strictly speaking, I'm the victim here.

44
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.660
Then what was the 10,000 dollars about?

45
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.059
I guess the cell phone was worth that much money.

46
00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.099
It probably had things that conjure up precious memories.

47
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.140
Then why did you dump such a precious phone into the river?

48
00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.269
It's not even yours.

49
00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:30.839
I didn't dump it.

50
00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.910
I told you that it slipped out of my hand.

51
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.880
There must be something in that phone, don't you think?

52
00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.720
Yes, I don't believe him. There's something very fishy about all this.

53
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.190
What would it be?

54
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.519
We can't even find the phone as he dumped it in the river.

55
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.789
Gosh, it's really frustrating.

56
00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.269
Mr. Park, you're okay with a video chat with the prosecutor, right?

57
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.339
No, I'd like to speak with him face-to-face.

58
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.410
I'd really like to meet him in person.

59
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.289
Well... Sir, aren't you leaving for the day?

60
00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.599
Oh, don't mind me. Just think that I'm not here...

61
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.599
and do your work.

62
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.900
Relax. Don't mind me at all.

63
00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.769
- Okay. - I'll leave you guys alone.

64
00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.910
- Do a good job. - Okay, I got this.

65
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.509
What are the main tasks to take care of when you're on night duty?

66
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.579
We mainly process tasks related to apprehending suspects...

67
00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.680
such as reviewing the police's arrest warrant applications.

68
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.549
Excuse me for a second.

69
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.319
Hello? This is Jung Jae Chan in Criminal Division Three.

70
00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.759
Sure, now?

71
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.069
Oh, my.

72
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.470
Good grief.

73
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.640
Is someone coming?

74
00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.180
Yes, come up. Okay.

75
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.849
Oh, what's the prosecutor's name?

76
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.990
I hope he's merciful and understanding.

77
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.559
- Goodness. - What?

78
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.460
There he is.

79
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.500
He's suspected of habitual cell phone theft.

80
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.470
The police has applied for an arrest warrant...

81
00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:37.140
because he might try to run away or destroy evidence.

82
00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:39.840
That man... Who is he?

83
00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.340
We usually interview suspects via phone or video calling,

84
00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.110
but he wanted to talk face-to-face, so he's on his way here now.

85
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.750
You'll interview him here...

86
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.079
before you decide whether you'll request the warrant or not, right?

87
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.250
- That's correct. - Mr. Jung.

88
00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.219
- Thank you. - This way.

89
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.889
All right. Please have a seat here.

90
00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.329
I heard that you really wanted to meet me in person.

91
00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:07.469
Yes.

92
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.469
(Arrest Warrant for Park Dae Young Theft Case)

93
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.900
You and our assistant chief prosecutor have the same name.

94
00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.570
He's Park Dae Young.

95
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.780
That's right. He's the jerk that disgraced my name.

96
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.610
Well... You may not believe me,

97
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.090
but I used to be a civil servant like you.

98
00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:30.860
But one day, My brother got himself in trouble,

99
00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.460
and I lost all of my money while trying to help him out.

100
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.030
My wife left me too.

101
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.230
I have a daughter, but she got into a car accident when she was nine...

102
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.570
and ended up with a back injury.

103
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.739
She can't even drink water without my help.

104
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.309
Then is she home alone now?

105
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.280
Goodness, I can't believe he's falling for that lie.

106
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.820
There are no jobs in this country that I could keep...

107
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.090
while taking care of my sick daughter.

108
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.820
That's why I stole phones.

109
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.590
I'm well aware of the fact that I don't deserve forgiveness.

110
00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:13.599
I'll cooperate with the investigation and go on trial...

111
00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.500
with a conscientious attitude. So, please...

112
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.769
Please don't...

113
00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.239
arrest me, Mr. Prosecutor.

114
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:23.440
My daughter, Joo Kyung...

115
00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:28.550
She might die if I'm not around.

116
00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:32.449
She must be folding origami cranes at the moment,

117
00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.090
waiting for me to come home with sweet pancakes.

118
00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:40.289
She thinks that if she folds 10,000 of them...

119
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.900
She believes that she'll be able to walk if she folds 10,000 of them,

120
00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.260
doesn't she?

121
00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.400
For goodness' sake.

122
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.340
It's been almost a decade, yet your story hasn't changed at all.

123
00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:53.539
He's lying, so don't let him fool you. Just request the warrant.

124
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.539
Sir, do you know this man?

125
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.940
I know him very well.

126
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.780
This jerk. Even a decade ago...

127
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.980
Sir, please. The camera is on.

128
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.119
Ms. Nam. Please edit it out.

129
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.489
This man here committed the same type of theft 10 years ago,

130
00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:13.219
and I requested an arrest warrant for him.

131
00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:14.489
Just go ahead, and request it.

132
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.130
Is your daughter really alone now?

133
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Yes.

134
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.940
She's alone.

135
00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:28.809
Mr. Jung.

136
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.110
Why are you being like this? Don't be such an amateur.

137
00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:39.119
Can't you tell that he's lying?

138
00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:41.849
He said that his daughter is 9 even 10 years ago.

139
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.920
Does she not age or what? Does she defy time?

140
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.460
I'm not saying I'll just let him go.

141
00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:48.889
I just want to go to his place and check whether it's true or not.

142
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.260
Gosh, five minutes is all you need to process something like this.

143
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.329
Why are you turning it into a two-hour thing?

144
00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:56.769
What you're doing now is like what a quack would do.

145
00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:00.239
You're like a foolish doctor who spends hours trying to put...

146
00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:02.340
a bandage on a patient with a scratch on his knee...

147
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.480
when traffic accident victims are dying in the emergency room.

148
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.980
You always fall for the suspects' obvious lies,

149
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.079
and you waste time. That's why you have so many unsolved cases.

150
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.250
No more excuses. Request a warrant immediately!

151
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.460
For goodness' sake.

152

(Video Recording and Observation Room)

153
00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:25.800
Are you okay?

154
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.170
I'm fine.

155
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:46.349
Mr. Jung doesn't get scolded like this every day.

156
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.820
How should I put this?

157
00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:51.960
A situation like this is very rare, so please don't be too disappointed.

158
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.429
Mr. Choi.

159
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.860
Yes?

160
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.929
Do you think he deserves that much scolding...

161
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.900
just because he was fooled by someone?

162
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:06.840
I mean, believing someone isn't really a bad thing.

163
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.039
That little bit of running got me hungry already.

164
00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:12.809
Shall we order fried chicken?

165
00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:14.880
Kyung Han.

166
00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:18.219
You know, don't you?

167
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.320
- Know what? - The fact that I...

168
00:09:22.989 --> 00:09:25.860
can't really differentiate colors.

169
00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:27.889
Yes, I know.

170
00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:32.900
Why aren't you saying anything?

171
00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:34.670
It can be a reason for dismissal.

172
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.170
Did you lie when you joined the force?

173
00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:38.739
No, there was an error with the test.

174
00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:39.900
Then it's fine.

175
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.070
You're already in the force, so don't worry about it.

176
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.710
Nothing will happen if I keep my lips sealed.

177
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.739
But still...

178
00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:49.480
Who caught the guy who tried to run away earlier today?

179
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.980
Was it me or you?

180
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.289
You'll find it hard to believe, but the issue with your eyes...

181
00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:57.420
is nothing compared to this in terms of deserving dismissal.

182
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.460
I'm way too slow to work as a police officer.

183
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.659
I need to do something about it. Let's not eat fried chicken today.

184
00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:05.659
Let's go in.

185
00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:13.469
(Police)

186
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:34.190
(Eun Ji's Honey Pancakes)

187
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.829
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

188
00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:42.429
I'd like two dollars' worth of pancakes.

189
00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:43.429
Sure, no problem.

190
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.690
Hello?

191
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.960
Kiddo, are you inside?

192
00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:13.630
Who are you?

193
00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:16.940
Hello. Do you know the man who lives here?

194
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.239
The man who lives in that tiny room? I know him, of course.

195
00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:21.070
I give him kimchi all the time.

196
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.610
Then do you know his daughter too?

197
00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:24.610
His daughter?

198
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.050
You must've come to the wrong address.

199
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.980
He lives alone.

200
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:50.300
Gosh, he sounded so sincere. How bizarre.

201
00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:53.440
What is wrong with that man? Why did he lie to my face?

202
00:11:53.739 --> 00:11:57.079
Darn it. What am I going to say to Mr. Park now?

203
00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:06.349
What? How did you know that I'd be here?

204
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.550
You must've dreamt about me again.

205
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.719
No, I don't even need to dream anymore.

206
00:12:11.119 --> 00:12:13.019
I can read you like a book now.

207
00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:15.460
I had a feeling that you'd be here.

208
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.159
Do you want a bite?

209
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.929
- It's so sweet. - No, I have no appetite.

210
00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:23.869
He doesn't have a daughter, right?

211
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:25.940
That man lied to you, didn't he?

212
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.809
Yes.

213
00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:31.679
I must've looked so pathetic today.

214
00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:35.409
I let a suspect fool me and got scolded by Mr. Park.

215
00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:39.420
Edit me out of what you recorded today.

216
00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:41.289
I don't want to disgrace the entire division.

217
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.360
I asked the lady who sells these pancakes over there.

218
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.599
That man had a daughter...

219
00:12:52.099 --> 00:12:53.230
10 year ago.

220
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.639
A nine-year-old girl who got a back injury from a car accident.

221
00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:04.579
He couldn't look after his daughter with his job as a mailman.

222
00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:06.880
I think that's why he quit his job and started stealing cell phones.

223
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.849
Then he got arrested.

224
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.519
His daughter was left home alone and eventually got rescued,

225
00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:15.750
but she died while he was in jail.

226
00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:17.960
He's been alone since then.

227
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.989
If he met...

228
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.230
a prosecutor like you instead of Mr. Park 10 years ago,

229
00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:25.929
his daughter might be alive now.

230
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.539
And don't worry about this.

231
00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:37.480
I'll be sure to edit you out and let no one else see it.

232
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.110
If this whole thing gets broadcast,

233
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.380
every woman in the world will fall head over heels for you.

234
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.980
I absolutely can't let that happen.

235
00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:52.460
My gosh, it is really sweet.

236
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:55.860
Give me one.

237
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.829
What? Okay.

238
00:13:58.659 --> 00:13:59.699
Here.

239
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.539
- You're wearing the ring. - What?

240
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.809
You just saw it now?

241
00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:10.840
What is wrong with your eyes?

242
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.949
Thanks.

243
00:14:34.973 --> 00:14:38.205

244
00:14:57.719 --> 00:15:00.260
Even if it's a 2.5-dollar can of beer,

245
00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:02.159
you'll get arrested if it's a repeat offense.

246
00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:03.829
You'll have to be ready for a short stretch behind bars.

247
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.530
- That's considered theft too? - It's the same thing.

248
00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:07.000
Yes. Of course it is.

249
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.030
Mr. Park Dae Young.

250
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.039
Gosh, Mr. Prosecutor.

251
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:18.980
Sir, what's going to happen to me now?

252
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.679
Will I be able to get out of here and be with my daughter?

253
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.280
No, I've already put in a request for your arrest warrant.

254
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.480
Your pre-arrest interview will take place today.

255
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:30.460
I'm doomed.

256
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.360
I was hoping you'd help me.

257
00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:34.260
What was I thinking?

258
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.730
I visited your place last night.

259
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.969
My place?

260
00:15:46.039 --> 00:15:47.269
Your daughter wasn't there.

261
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:48.809
Is that why you requested the warrant?

262
00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:51.610
Because you were offended that I lied to you?

263
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:55.280
I heard about what happened to your daughter 10 years ago.

264
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.179
They should've tried to help you when you got arrested back then,

265
00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.219
but they didn't.

266
00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:03.989
I know that it'll be meaningless to apologize to you on behalf of them,

267
00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:06.489
but I still would like to apologize to you.

268
00:16:15.369 --> 00:16:16.829
Wait, Mr. Prosecutor!

269
00:16:27.909 --> 00:16:29.949
I've used my daughter as an excuse and cried...

270
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.349
six times in total just to avoid getting arrested,

271
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.849
but you're the only prosecutor who visited my place.

272
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.989
I'd like to give you something...

273
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.860
to show you my gratitude.

274
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.739
What is that?

275
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:04.019
What is this?

276
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.420
I don't know what it is,

277
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:07.949
but there must be something very important inside.

278
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.219
Like what?

279
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.289
How would I know?

280
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.630
It's your job to find out what it is.

281
00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:30.780
Are you saying these are from the 10,000-dollar cell phone?

282
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.250
Yes. The owner was willing to spend 10,000 dollars to get it back.

283
00:17:34.449 --> 00:17:37.719
It must contain information that's worth even more.

284
00:17:37.719 --> 00:17:39.650
He gets fooled over and over.

285
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.320
It happens on a daily basis. It's like every day is April Fool's Day.

286
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.090
You never know.

287
00:17:44.389 --> 00:17:47.659
If there is something, I can start investigating it immediately, right?

288
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.929
Just recognizing a case doesn't mean you can start investigating it.

289
00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:52.429
The procedure is very complicated.

290
00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:55.699
Don't create more work for yourself.

291
00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:57.969
Let's just work on the cases that we already have.

292
00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.170
Gosh, what could it be? All I see is photos of dogs and food.

293
00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:02.969
What kind of information could this have?

294
00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:05.139
Wouldn't it be a company's secret information?

295
00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:06.409
From corporate espionage, you know.

296
00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:08.550
Hey, you can't record this. Stop it.

297
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.579
You're not even investigating it.

298
00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:10.719
- You can't. - Let me see it.

299
00:18:10.719 --> 00:18:12.250
You can't record it. You really can't.

300
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.690
Hey, film Ms. Moon instead.

301
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.050
Ms. Moon looks stunning today.

302
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.260
Aren't you here to interview Ms. Shin?

303
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.360
What are you doing in our office?

304
00:18:18.659 --> 00:18:20.190
Take a close-up shot.

305
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.159
- Zoom in. More. - I don't want to be in it.

306
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.760
Ms. Moon, you're still in the frame.

307
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:36.570
What is it, Mr. Choi?

308
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.309
They're photos of patients.

309
00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:43.079
Is the owner of the phone a doctor?

310
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.880
Why? Is there someone you know?

311
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.389
They're victims.

312
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.159
Victims? Of what?

313
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.659
The intravenous drip serial murder case.

314
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.500
Sorry?

315
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.130
Pardon?

316
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.679
Hey, don't worry.

317
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.849
I threw the phone into the river. How are they going to find it?

318
00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:21.789
You don't need to worry about the police.

319
00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:23.659
I told them that I don't know you at all.

320
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.489
Yes, it'll be fine.

321
00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:29.159
Well, why does this thing have photos of the victims?

322
00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:30.730
Is that from Myung Yi Suk's cell phone?

323
00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:33.500
That can't be. He got locked up in jail over a year ago.

324
00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:37.639
How many patients are there in total?

325
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.610
There are 19 in total.

326
00:19:41.769 --> 00:19:43.780
Were there 19 victims in the serial murder case?

327
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:48.179
No, there were only 11.

328
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.119
Then... Who are the eight people?

329
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.550
I'm getting scared.

330
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.260
The eight people must be alive, right?

331
00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.460
What does this mean?

332
00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:02.190
Did Myung Yi Suk have an accomplice?

333
00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:05.760
Or is the real killer someone else?

334
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.730
We should meet the owner of the phone first.

335
00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.639
Don't worry. Why would they try to find me?

336
00:20:19.239 --> 00:20:20.980
I'm telling you. They have no reason to do so.

337
00:20:21.309 --> 00:20:23.150
I've done nothing wrong. Why would they...

338
00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:27.489
What? I didn't know you were here.

339
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.389
Look, why did you go through what's in a stolen phone?

340
00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:38.730
Work on your unsolved cases if you have time to do such useless things.

341
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.030
It's not useless.

342
00:20:40.269 --> 00:20:42.369
That guy offered 10,000 dollars just to get the phone back,

343
00:20:42.369 --> 00:20:44.900
and it contains pictures of serial murder victims.

344
00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:47.469
It looks like one person took all the photos before they died.

345
00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:49.639
That person might be an accomplice or the real killer.

346
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.280
That habitual theft offender gave it to you, didn't he?

347
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.679
I told you that he lies habitually too.

348
00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:56.679
Even 10 years ago...

349
00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:59.420
His daughter actually died 10 years ago.

350
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.090
I verified it.

351
00:21:04.119 --> 00:21:05.389
He said that his daughter is ill,

352
00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.860
but a prosecutor assumed that it was a lie and didn't even check.

353
00:21:08.889 --> 00:21:11.030
He sincerely begged, but they didn't let him go.

354
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.559
That's how it happened.

355
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.070
I don't want to become a prosecutor like that.

356
00:21:25.539 --> 00:21:26.949
It could've been fabricated.

357
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:29.250
If the prosecutor and the forensic unit conspire...

358
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.579
and make up a few documents saying that Yoo Su Kyung's blood was found,

359
00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:33.820
getting him acquitted will be a piece of cake.

360
00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:36.320
Is such fabrication even possible?

361
00:21:36.849 --> 00:21:38.619
Prosecutors have the power and means to do it.

362
00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:51.099
Mr. Choi.

363
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.039
What brings you here? I wasn't expecting you.

364
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.980
About the Myung Yi Suk case...

365
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.909
Did you fabricate the evidence?

366
00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:05.880
- Pardon me? - Did you fabricate it?

367
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.360
Answer me!

368
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.769
You were with me that day.

369
00:22:37.719 --> 00:22:38.750
Du Hyun.

370
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.760
What? You called me. What do you want?

371
00:22:47.429 --> 00:22:48.860
It really suits you.

372
00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:52.860
Oh, aren't you close with Detective Ko at Hangang Police Station?

373
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.869
Yes, I am. Why?

374
00:22:55.199 --> 00:22:57.840
You remember the guy who was caught...

375
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.239
with the cell phone thief, right?

376
00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:01.110
The police thought that he was a stolen phone dealer.

377
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.610
Honey, I'll be good to you from now on.

378
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.639
Can you get his address for me?

379
00:23:05.639 --> 00:23:08.650
Well, that won't be too hard, but...

380
00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.980
Honey, I love you.

381
00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:16.960
There's something I'd like to check.

382
00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:19.090
You want to check something? What is it about?

383
00:23:20.059 --> 00:23:22.659
I want to show him that he wasn't fooled.

384
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.429
Where are you going?

385
00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:30.940
We have our team dinner today.

386
00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:33.909
I can't join you guys today. I need to do some research.

387
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:36.139
Why are you doing research after your work hours?

388
00:23:36.139 --> 00:23:38.579
Because Mr. Park is not letting me investigate it as a case.

389
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.550
All I can do is dig into it after my work hours.

390
00:23:42.579 --> 00:23:44.250
I'm off to do some digging.

391
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.099
Is this the right place?

392
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.070
I guess he lives in this container home.

393
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.239
- Jae Chan. - Hong Joo.

394
00:24:38.699 --> 00:24:39.739
What are you doing here?

395
00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:41.440
I'm here to find the owner of the phone.

396
00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:43.539
- You too? - Yes.

397
00:24:44.139 --> 00:24:45.440
I don't think it'll be easy to find him.

398
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.949
Why?

399
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.849
The person who knows his whereabouts is already dead.

400
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.530
It's locked.

401
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:24.079
What is that?

402
00:25:24.079 --> 00:25:25.119
Gasoline.

403
00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:45.699
It'll be okay.

404
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.090
Has something like that ever happened to you?

405
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.559
Feeling like you came back to life after a near-death experience.

406
00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:12.199
I've felt that too.

407
00:26:13.199 --> 00:26:15.300
Seriously? When?

408
00:26:16.369 --> 00:26:18.239
It was when I was very young.

409
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.000
I fell into deep water.

410
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.110
I... I don't resent you.

411
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.019
I'm glad...

412
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.449
that you're alive.

413
00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:52.199
I was incredibly grateful to you because of that very feeling.

414
00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:54.510
I thought, "I could've really died."

415
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.909
"I want to make sure I can repay him for saving my life."

416
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.679
That thought must be...

417
00:27:00.239 --> 00:27:01.849
what started those dreams.

418
00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:06.050
The dreams where I can foresee the future of the one who saved my life.

419
00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.579
Are you okay?

420
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.050
Mr. Jung.

421
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:14.849
Ms. Nam.

422
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.360
Can you hear me?

423
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:19.590
Can you recognize me?

424
00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.960
Mr. Choi.

425
00:28:26.829 --> 00:28:29.769
Thank goodness. What a relief.

426
00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.139
I'm truly relieved.

427
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.750
I'm so glad you're alive.

428
00:29:21.849 --> 00:29:24.159
Chief, we'll question him.

429
00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:25.460
Why can't you answer my question?

430
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.230
I manipulated my report cards.

431
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.699
Yu Beom said he'd be able to raise his rate if we did that.

432
00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:32.730
We split it in half.

433
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.369
Gosh, you punk. Why did you lie about your grades?

434
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.039
Your dad has been going on about how much your grades have improved.

435
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:51.980
(Choi Dam Dong)
