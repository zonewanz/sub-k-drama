00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:07.391
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.452
Are the reporters here?

3
00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:09.552
They've all arrived.

4
00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:11.382
Are all
the photo journalists here too?

5
00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:12.522
Yes.

6
00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.791
Just a second. Do you have
that thing by any chance?

7
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:17.821
What is it called?
The thing that makes you tear up.

8
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:18.891
Tear stick?

9
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:20.992
That's it.

10
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:25.931
(Hae Kwang Law Firm)

11
00:00:28.702 --> 00:00:32.271
I'm sorry I'm late. I had to visit
Ms. Yoo's father at the hospital.

12
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.542
Is her father ill?

13
00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:42.952
Yes, he's in the last stage
of pancreatic cancer.

14
00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:46.822
He collapsed as soon as he heard
about Do Hak Young getting released.

15
00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:48.521
As you're all aware,

16
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.792
he's the only suspect
in Ms. Yoo's murder case.

17
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:55.032
Even I can't understand why they'd
investigate it as a non-detention.

18
00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:56.932
Think about how
the bereaved must be feeling.

19
00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.631
I heard that the prosecution
thinks...

20
00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:00.962
that it could've been an accident,
not homicide.

21
00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:03.271
No defense wounds or signs
of homicide have been found.

22
00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:06.042
You think the lack of defense wounds
means it may not have been homicide?

23
00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:08.941
Many homicide cases with no
defense wounds have been reported.

24
00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.471
It's called "blitz attack".

25
00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:13.741
In case of such sudden attacks,
there can't be any defense wounds.

26
00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.982
Then do you think it's possible
for the culprit to have made...

27
00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:18.221
the drawing on the floor
with blood in 13 minutes?

28
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:19.351
It's hard.

29
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:22.292
I've tried simulating the situation,
and it was hard.

30
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:27.161
But you know what, Mr. Bong?

31
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.062
What sounds less likely?

32
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:33.101
Making that drawing with blood
on the floor in 13 minutes?

33
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.071
Or that drawing automatically
appearing with nobody around?

34
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.772
This investigation was obviously
not done properly.

35
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:43.712
I know what will happen
when people lose interest in it.

36
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:46.582
The prosecution will decide
not to indict him.

37
00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:49.052
To make sure that the killer
pays for what he did,

38
00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:52.351
all of you must continue
to show your interest in the case...

39
00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:54.182
and urge the prosecution
to investigate it properly.

40
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.101
When did you get home?

41
00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:10.471
Gosh, he's so worn out
from staying up all night.

42
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:14.171
Jae Chan, go into your room.
Jae Chan.

43
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:16.941
Mr. Choi, Do Hak Young...

44
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:19.381
Stop using your phone.

45
00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:20.981
It's Yu Beom, isn't it?

46
00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:33.761
Jae Chan, let's go to your room.

47
00:02:34.492 --> 00:02:35.862
Jae Chan, let's go.

48
00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:37.631
Stop it.

49
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:41.201
Darn it. He's so heavy.

50
00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:11.902
Gosh, who is it at this hour?

51
00:03:13.062 --> 00:03:14.101
Who's here?

52
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:16.101
Who's ringing the doorbell at 3am?

53
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:21.712
Jae Chan, it's Hong Joo.

54
00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:23.911
What? Who?

55
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.152
Hong Joo,
why are you here this late...

56
00:03:31.682 --> 00:03:32.751
Hong Joo!

57
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:34.691
Where is Jae Chan's room?

58
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:36.022
It's over there.

59
00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:39.191
Hey, where is Hong Joo?

60
00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:40.921
She went into your room.
What's going on?

61
00:03:43.132 --> 00:03:44.762
- Hong Joo, what are you doing?
- My gosh...

62
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:47.002
What should I do?

63
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.541
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

64
00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:54.772
Did something happen?
Why are you being like this?

65
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.611
Jae Chan.

66
00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:03.611
What should we do? What are we
going to do, Jae Chan?

67
00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.481
In my dream,

68
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.921
you...

69
00:04:09.592 --> 00:04:11.152
You...

70
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.291
I saw you bleeding...

71
00:04:16.592 --> 00:04:18.902
from an injury, a serious one.

72
00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:26.142
What should we do?

73
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.171
What should we do now?

74
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.311
It's all right. It's okay.

75
00:04:52.962 --> 00:04:54.462
Do everything you can...

76
00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:58.671
to avoid getting
into a situation like that, okay?

77
00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.171
Don't wear suits. You were
wearing a suit when you got hurt.

78
00:05:02.842 --> 00:05:05.041
And never cross the street
at any crosswalk.

79
00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:10.082
No, you should just never see me.

80
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:12.882
You were coming to meet me...

81
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:16.322
You were on your way to meet me
when that happened.

82
00:05:20.962 --> 00:05:24.231
So from now on, we should...

83
00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:26.061
I don't want to do that.

84
00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:33.002
I'm a prosecutor.

85
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:34.911
I have to wear suits.

86
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:37.311
And I look great in suits.

87
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.311
Also, are you saying that I should
jaywalk all the time?

88
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.411
That's crazy.

89
00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:45.551
And you want me to avoid you?
That's really crazy.

90
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.392
We won't be able to prevent it
with those sneaky tricks.

91
00:05:55.392 --> 00:05:56.491
You're well aware of that.

92
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.002
Tell me about your dream in detail.

93
00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:00.931
I want to know why it happened.

94
00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:02.931
Let's go over every detail so that
we can find out the reason.

95
00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:05.471
Only then, we'll be able
to prevent it. Aren't I right?

96
00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:13.842
I was standing in front
of a crosswalk.

97
00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:16.452
I could see lanterns behind you.

98
00:06:17.082 --> 00:06:19.351
You were standing amongst
a crowd of people.

99
00:06:19.822 --> 00:06:24.252
Then a man dressed in all black
approached you.

100
00:07:05.832 --> 00:07:08.132
This time,
it's my turn to keep you safe.

101
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.671
Will I be able to do it?

102
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:29.791
Don't worry.

103
00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:48.842
What you saw in your dream
will never happen.

104
00:07:53.442 --> 00:07:54.442
Please.

105
00:07:56.212 --> 00:07:57.411
Don't get hurt.

106
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:03.591
Okay.

107
00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:20.402
I like you.

108
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.581
Gosh,
why are you all being like this?

109
00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:04.211
You guys are making me feel as if
I'm actually going to die.

110
00:09:04.512 --> 00:09:06.152
Let's eat, okay?

111
00:09:06.522 --> 00:09:07.522
Eat your breakfast.

112
00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:09.691
Eat up.

113
00:09:10.622 --> 00:09:12.921
Who stabbed him?
Did you see the person's face?

114
00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:15.362
No, I couldn't.

115
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:19.102
One thing I know for certain...

116
00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:21.331
is that he must be
connected to Do Hak Young.

117
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:24.372
To Hak Young? Why do you think that?

118
00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.772
My dream changed
after he got released.

119
00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:30.941
In the first dream I had, he crossed
the street without any problems.

120
00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.541
But in the dream I had on the day
Do Hak Young got released,

121
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:35.752
Jae Chan couldn't finish crossing
the street and fainted...

122
00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:39.321
even though it was the same place
and situation.

123
00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:43.252
Something must've changed
because of Do Hak Young's release.

124
00:09:52.232 --> 00:09:54.262
Yes, sir. Why are you calling me
this early?

125
00:09:55.732 --> 00:09:56.872
The news?

126
00:10:04.142 --> 00:10:05.681
The prosecution released
the only suspect...

127
00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:09.012
in the Yoo Su Kyung murder case
due to lack of evidence...

128
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:11.352
and stated that the case will be
investigated as a non-detention.

129
00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:13.321
Even with the CCTV footage,

130
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.421
the prosecution decided to release
the prime suspect of the case.

131
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:18.522
It looks like controversy
and criticism will be unavoidable.

132
00:10:19.091 --> 00:10:22.032
Mr. Do was convicted of assault
and theft as well in the past.

133
00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:24.532
If they release him
due to lack of evidence,

134
00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:27.002
he may commit
additional crimes in the future,

135
00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:28.671
which means there will be
other victims.

136
00:10:29.232 --> 00:10:31.841
The prosecution will have to take
responsibility for it.

137
00:10:32.902 --> 00:10:35.571
Do Hak Young has a criminal record?
For assault and theft?

138
00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:36.811
That theft charge...

139
00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.711
He stole g.o.d's autograph
from a snack place.

140
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:42.051
He wanted to put it up
at his mom's gimbap restaurant.

141
00:10:42.112 --> 00:10:44.551
He stole an autograph?
Is that considered theft?

142
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:46.951
Yes, he learned it the hard way.

143
00:10:47.252 --> 00:10:48.821
Then the snack place owner
caused a scene...

144
00:10:48.821 --> 00:10:50.852
at his mom's restaurant,
and he tried to stop him.

145
00:10:50.852 --> 00:10:52.362
That's why he ended up
with the assault charge.

146
00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:55.492
It happened over 10 years ago.

147
00:10:56.032 --> 00:10:59.102
Jae Chan, your personal information
is all over the internet already.

148
00:10:59.102 --> 00:11:00.701
People are saying you didn't
investigate properly.

149
00:11:01.872 --> 00:11:05.841
(Ilyoo Middle School, Donggang
High School, Hankook University)

150
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:12.242
(Prosecutors are so pathetic.
Is his brother okay?)

151
00:11:12.782 --> 00:11:16.711
I don't know who stabbed Jae Chan
in my dream,

152
00:11:17.152 --> 00:11:18.622
but I can guess.

153
00:11:19.551 --> 00:11:22.392
It must be someone
who is outraged by the news.

154
00:11:24.122 --> 00:11:26.022
- How can the suspect be released?
- How can the suspect be released?

155
00:11:26.022 --> 00:11:27.821
- The prosecution is an accomplice.
- The prosecution is an accomplice.

156
00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.632
It's the people's order.

157
00:11:29.632 --> 00:11:31.091
It could be a fan
who's grief-stricken...

158
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:32.532
at losing his beloved star.

159
00:11:32.532 --> 00:11:34.132
Hey, isn't that man Do Hak Young?

160
00:11:34.972 --> 00:11:36.232
You know.

161
00:11:36.232 --> 00:11:38.242
The guy who killed Yoo Su Kyung
and made a drawing with her blood.

162
00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:40.372
It could be someone
who has to tolerate...

163
00:11:40.372 --> 00:11:43.142
people's unfair rage toward him.

164
00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:46.581
What should we do, honey?
What if he gets acquitted?

165
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.012
I'll feel horrible for Su Kyung.

166
00:11:50.382 --> 00:11:51.551
What should we do?

167
00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:54.992
It could also be someone...

168
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:58.492
who can't punish anybody
for his beloved daughter's death.

169
00:12:09.902 --> 00:12:11.132
What's for certain is that...

170
00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:13.972
in order to prevent the horrible
things that happened in my dream,

171
00:12:15.711 --> 00:12:19.282
we must prevent the rage due to
misunderstanding from growing...

172
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.411
and this wrath from becoming a sharp
knife ready to stab its victim.

173
00:12:25.782 --> 00:12:27.622
What should we do now?

174
00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:32.091
We must change the flow of time.

175
00:12:32.222 --> 00:12:33.321
Honey...

(Episode 17: The Usual Suspect)

177
00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:52.012
You call that an article?

178
00:12:52.911 --> 00:12:55.652
Do you even know anything
about Do Hak Young's theft charge?

179
00:12:56.211 --> 00:12:58.622
He stole g.o.d's autograph
from a snack place,

180
00:12:58.622 --> 00:12:59.921
and it happened 11 years ago.

181
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:03.291
So what? Is stealing money
the only kind of theft?

182
00:13:03.522 --> 00:13:06.722
Do you know how valuable g.o.d's
autographs were 11 years ago?

183
00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:08.831
That is undeniably theft!

184
00:13:10.232 --> 00:13:12.502
What does that have to do
with the Yoo Su Kyung case?

185
00:13:12.502 --> 00:13:14.532
Did he kill her because she
refused to give him her autograph?

186
00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:18.341
My goodness. People will think
that you're my supervisor.

187
00:13:19.372 --> 00:13:21.411
Be glad that you're my supervisor.

188
00:13:21.411 --> 00:13:22.941

190
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:30.811

00:13:36.992 --> 00:13:38.862
Hello? Did you get to work safely?

193
00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:40.461
Yes, I'm almost there.

194
00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:41.992
Everything's okay, right?

195
00:13:41.992 --> 00:13:43.331
Yes, nothing has happened.

196
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:46.132
I heard that the Hangang District
Prosecutors' Office...

197
00:13:46.132 --> 00:13:47.632
is surrounded by protesters
at the moment.

198
00:13:47.632 --> 00:13:50.301
They all know your face, so you
should use the rear entrance...

199
00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:51.502
or disguise yourself.

200
00:13:51.642 --> 00:13:53.742
Gosh, I've done nothing wrong.

201
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:55.972
They can come at me all they want.

202
00:13:55.972 --> 00:13:58.311
I'm totally confident,
whether it's fighting or arguing.

203
00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:00.311
Okay, don't worry.

- What are you doing?
- Oh, Mr. Lee.

207
00:14:16.132 --> 00:14:17.931
Hello. Good morning.

208
00:14:17.931 --> 00:14:19.561
- High five.
- Okay.

- How can the suspect be released?

212

Detain Do Hak Young!

213
00:14:33.482 --> 00:14:35.451
- You need help.
- It's the people's order.

- Detain Do Hak Young.

- Why are you...
- Just put it on.

216
00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:45.222
Will this make you unrecognizable?
No, they'll recognize you.

217
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:48.791
Take this off.

218
00:14:49.191 --> 00:14:50.392
Take it off.

219
00:14:57.372 --> 00:15:00.902
If they catch you, just tell them
that you're Lee Ji Kwang. Got it?

220
00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:04.642
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

221
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:08.612
Hey, if you want to thank me,

222
00:15:09.252 --> 00:15:10.782
don't forget about arranging
that blind date.

223
00:15:11.982 --> 00:15:13.051
All right.

224
00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:15.691
Let's go.

225
00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:18.421
Follow me.

- Detain Do Hak Young!
- Wait!

Isn't that Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan?

232
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:29.831
What? Where?

233
00:15:31.002 --> 00:15:32.071
- Run!
- Okay.

234
00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:40.142
- Get him.
- How could you do that?

235
00:15:40.282 --> 00:15:42.211
Gosh, I'm not Jung Jae Chan.

236
00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:44.081
Look at this picture.
I look nothing like him.

237
00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:45.622
You look just like the photo.

238
00:15:45.622 --> 00:15:47.152
Say something!

239
00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:48.691
Why on earth did you release
Do Hak Young?

240
00:15:48.691 --> 00:15:50.622
Listen. I didn't release him.

241
00:15:51.022 --> 00:15:53.122
What are you talking about?
You're lying.

242
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:55.892
It's illegal to protest within 100m
of government offices!

243
00:15:55.892 --> 00:15:57.961
- Shut it!
- Why did you release Do Hak Young?

244
00:15:57.961 --> 00:15:59.262
If you lay a finger on me,

245
00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:01.002
you'll be arrested for
obstructing justice.

246
00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:09.472
Prosecutor Jung!

247
00:16:09.472 --> 00:16:11.882
Do you see the guy over there
with glasses and popped collars?

248
00:16:11.882 --> 00:16:14.482
That tall guy. He's Jung Jae Chan!

249
00:16:14.482 --> 00:16:15.681
- What?
- Stop lying to our faces.

250
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:17.012
Catch the corrupt prosecutor!

251
00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:18.282
- Get him!
- You jerk!

252
00:16:20.782 --> 00:16:21.852
Mr. Choi.

253
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:24.091
I called security guards,
so he'll be fine.

254
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:27.061
If you go there now,
you'll get in deep trouble.

255
00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:28.191
But still, Mr. Lee is...

256
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:29.532
Just ditch him.

257
00:16:29.532 --> 00:16:31.432
You won't be able to help him
even if you go there.

258
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:35.401
Gosh! Do you see the two men over
there? The ones that are talking.

259
00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:37.071
The one on the left
is his senior assisting officer.

260
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:38.742
Jung Jae Chan is the one
on the right.

261
00:16:38.742 --> 00:16:40.772
- What's he saying?
- How dare you lie to us?

262
00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:44.912
I'm Jung Jae Chan at the Hangang
District Prosecutors' Office!

263
00:16:45.512 --> 00:16:46.841
What's that nonsense about?

264
00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:50.012
- You need to be taught a lesson!
- How could you do such a thing?

265
00:16:50.012 --> 00:16:52.682
Prosecutor Jung! Jung Jae Chan!

266
00:16:52.682 --> 00:16:54.321
Corrupt prosecutors
must leave the prosecution!

267
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:55.422
He's over there!

268
00:16:55.422 --> 00:16:57.522
Bring Yoo Su Kyung back to life!

269
00:17:07.002 --> 00:17:08.101
Hey, did you watch the news?

270
00:17:08.831 --> 00:17:10.232
That psycho, Do Hak Young,

271
00:17:10.672 --> 00:17:12.401
was even convicted
of assault and theft in the past.

272
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:15.071
Why did that prosecutor
release that psycho?

273
00:17:15.071 --> 00:17:16.541
There are only
two plausible explanations.

274
00:17:16.541 --> 00:17:18.782
He's either totally incompetent,
or he was bribed.

275
00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:20.242
About that stupid prosecutor...

276
00:17:21.311 --> 00:17:22.611
Isn't he Seung Won's brother?

277
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:23.851
Yes, that's right!

278
00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:27.081
He used to brag so much about
his brother who's a prosecutor.

279
00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:28.321
It has to be him, Jung Jae Chan.

280
00:17:28.321 --> 00:17:29.922
Gosh, this is crazy.

281
00:17:32.262 --> 00:17:33.762
Let's talk in the chatroom now.

282
00:17:36.061 --> 00:17:38.232
If he records our conversation
and gives it to his brother,

283
00:17:38.232 --> 00:17:39.432
we'll be put behind bars.

284
00:17:41.162 --> 00:17:43.002
Don't worry. We'll be let go.

285
00:17:43.002 --> 00:17:45.071
I mean, doesn't his brother
release all criminals?

286
00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:46.202
(That's true.)

287
00:17:56.151 --> 00:17:57.581
What are you guys doing now?

288
00:17:58.581 --> 00:18:00.252
Did you guys start
a new chatroom without me?

Why on earth did they think

I mean, you look...

nothing like Mr. Jung.

293
00:18:28.512 --> 00:18:31.482
They said they caught me
because they heard...

294
00:18:31.482 --> 00:18:34.222
that Mr. Jung is handsome.
It's all because I'm handsome.

295
00:18:34.222 --> 00:18:37.391
Apparently, being handsome
is a sin. I'm a big sinner.

296
00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:39.391
Does that make any sense to you?
My goodness.

297
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:41.061
It certainly makes no sense.

298
00:18:41.232 --> 00:18:45.032
They're stopping all men in suits,
assuming they're prosecutors.

299
00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:46.432
Be careful, okay?

300
00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:48.972
- Let's go.
- All right.

Are you heading out for lunch?

303
00:18:52.702 --> 00:18:53.702
- Mr. Lee!
- Close the door.

304
00:18:53.702 --> 00:18:54.841
Hit the close button.

305
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:57.571
It's dangerous out there. You
should refrain from going outside...

- and eat at the cafeteria.

Oh, Mr. Choi! Mr. Choi.

310
00:19:10.252 --> 00:19:11.262
Yes?

311

Would you like to have lunch

00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:30.242
Mr. Choi, what should I do?

318
00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:34.482
Why? Are you scared that people will
criticize you if he's not indicted?

319
00:19:34.982 --> 00:19:36.952
I'm a human too.
Of course I'm scared...

320
00:19:37.922 --> 00:19:39.222
Actually, I am not scared.

321
00:19:39.351 --> 00:19:41.252
I will indict him
if he's deemed guilty,

322
00:19:41.252 --> 00:19:44.022
but I will not indict him if I think
he's innocent. I'll go by the rules.

323
00:19:44.121 --> 00:19:45.821
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

324
00:19:46.762 --> 00:19:49.291
Oh, Lawyer Lee. Hello.

325
00:19:49.662 --> 00:19:51.831
You should indict him if you want
to go by the rules.

326
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:54.061
You're a prosecutor.
Shouldn't you put the victim first?

327
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:55.871
Let the accused's lawyer
worry about him.

328
00:19:55.972 --> 00:19:58.002
If the prosecutor sides
with the accused,

329
00:19:58.301 --> 00:19:59.871
who will take the victim's side?

330
00:19:59.871 --> 00:20:02.912
Since when prosecutors' job
was taking sides?

331
00:20:02.912 --> 00:20:05.381
My goodness, please.

332
00:20:05.381 --> 00:20:10.182
You two bicker at each other
every single time you meet.

333
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:13.282
Lawyer Lee, what brings you here
by the way?

334
00:20:13.282 --> 00:20:15.252
You remember Hyun Woo
from the Yeonju office, right?

335
00:20:15.252 --> 00:20:17.452
- He was our assisting officer.
- Of course. I know him very well...

336
00:20:18.462 --> 00:20:21.692
Right, he texted me a few days ago
and told me he's getting married.

337
00:20:21.692 --> 00:20:22.992
That's today.

338
00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:24.801
I came to get you
in case you forgot.

339
00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:26.002
Oh, really? I should go with you.

340
00:20:26.002 --> 00:20:29.032
Mr. Choi, you're supposed
to have lunch with me.

341
00:20:29.032 --> 00:20:31.202
What can I do? I have to attend
the wedding. I'll eat there.

342
00:20:31.202 --> 00:20:33.841
- Wait.
- Why are you acting like a kid?

343
00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:35.541
- Let's go.
- Okay.

344
00:20:35.541 --> 00:20:36.571
Mr. Choi.

345
00:20:36.942 --> 00:20:39.012
Well... Hang on! Hang on a second.

346
00:20:39.012 --> 00:20:42.311
Lawyer Lee, just a second, okay?

347
00:20:43.282 --> 00:20:46.821
All right, Mr. Jung. Can you lend me
50 dollars if you have cash on you?

348
00:20:48.321 --> 00:20:49.621
Just take some cash out on your way.

349
00:20:49.621 --> 00:20:51.692
I don't want to pay ATM fees.

350
00:20:51.762 --> 00:20:53.192
I'll lend you money. Let's go.

351
00:20:53.192 --> 00:20:54.222
Okay.

352
00:20:58.462 --> 00:21:00.232
Gosh, I'm hungry.

353
00:21:02.732 --> 00:21:05.442
My, it's such a beautiful day.

354
00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:07.101
What did Jae Chan say?

355
00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:10.311
Will he indict Do Hak Young or not?

356
00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.182
How would I know?

357
00:21:12.182 --> 00:21:14.651
It's not like I can go into his head
and figure out what he thinks.

358
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:17.512
My gosh, this car is amazing.

359
00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:19.452
Do you happen to know
a man named Han Woo Tak?

360
00:21:20.282 --> 00:21:22.091
It looks like he and Jae Chan
are very close.

361
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:24.992
I did some research...

362
00:21:25.722 --> 00:21:28.432
and found out that he and
Do Hak Young used to be roommates.

363
00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:32.962
Lawyer Lee, you're not trying to
connect the three together, right?

364
00:21:33.032 --> 00:21:36.301
Their friendship has nothing
to do with the case.

365
00:21:36.672 --> 00:21:38.571
Gosh, of course not.

366
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:41.341
I know how upright and clean
Jae Chan is in that regard.

367
00:21:42.712 --> 00:21:44.012
I am worried though.

368
00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:46.182
If reporters or the victim's family
hear about it,

369
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.051
they'll think differently.

370
00:21:50.712 --> 00:21:53.422
If Jae Chan lets Do Hak Young go,

371
00:21:54.121 --> 00:21:56.422
people will assume that it's because
they're acquainted.

372
00:21:56.422 --> 00:21:57.851
Lawyer Lee.

373
00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.821
So, you need to persuade Jae Chan
to indict him.

374
00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:01.932
A person died.
How can he be acquitted?

375
00:22:02.361 --> 00:22:03.791
I don't care whether he has to...

376
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:06.002
manipulate the report or fabricate
evidence. He must indict him.

377
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:09.432
Please persuade him.

378
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:14.712
If you don't, I'll tell reporters
about Han Woo Tak right away.

379
00:22:14.712 --> 00:22:16.712
That will put Mr. Jung in jeopardy.

380
00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:18.581
That's precisely why
I'm asking you for help.

381
00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:22.452
I don't want to see
Jae Chan getting jeopardized.

382
00:22:33.492 --> 00:22:35.492
(Do's Gimbap)

383
00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:42.002
The man who stabbed Jae Chan
in your dream.

384
00:22:42.002 --> 00:22:43.331
Tell me what he looked like.

385
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.702
I'm not too sure because
I only saw him from behind.

386
00:22:46.242 --> 00:22:48.571
I think he was about 180cm tall.

387
00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:52.412
He was wearing all black,
and he had a black hat on too.

388
00:23:03.922 --> 00:23:05.791
This just isn't coming off!

389
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:08.732
(Psychopath murderer,
Your son is a junkie.)

390
00:23:09.891 --> 00:23:11.301
You dummy.

391
00:23:11.532 --> 00:23:13.561
Paint won't come off
if you just rub on it.

392
00:23:14.401 --> 00:23:15.601
You need to wipe it with this.

393
00:23:17.432 --> 00:23:18.901
You're such a show-off.

394
00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:21.772
You know everything, don't you?

395
00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:27.641
Anyway, I'm relieved...

396
00:23:28.081 --> 00:23:29.212
that you got released.

397
00:23:34.752 --> 00:23:36.022
It doesn't make any difference.

398
00:23:37.222 --> 00:23:39.061
Everyone is still harassing me,

399
00:23:39.861 --> 00:23:41.232
calling me a murderer.

400
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:56.242
(Murderer)

401
00:24:14.992 --> 00:24:16.331
I knew you'd do this.

402
00:24:16.992 --> 00:24:20.432
I heard you almost got in trouble
with the protesters. What's this?

403
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:23.901
How can you wear a suit again
after what happened yesterday?

404
00:24:24.472 --> 00:24:27.341
Hey, Seung Won.
You should've talked him out of it.

405
00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:28.571
Well, I was...

406
00:24:28.571 --> 00:24:30.172
Go get changed. Right now!

407
00:24:31.242 --> 00:24:32.242
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:39.222
Jae Chan, there's a hoodie
in my room.

409
00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:51.361
Gosh, Mr. Park will probably
scold me if I show up like this.

410
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:52.561
Goodness.

411
00:24:53.732 --> 00:24:55.472
You can get changed
when you get to work.

412
00:24:55.472 --> 00:24:57.672
And getting scolded is much better
than getting attacked.

413
00:24:58.071 --> 00:24:59.702
Gosh, let go!

414
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:06.182
When will the Do Hak Young case
be finalized?

415
00:25:06.182 --> 00:25:08.512
I should decide what to do after
interviewing the witness today.

416
00:25:08.782 --> 00:25:10.311
I can't justify dragging it out.

417
00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:28.301
Can't you just indict him?

418
00:25:33.641 --> 00:25:35.871
I think that's the only way
we can make sure you'll be okay.

419
00:25:39.682 --> 00:25:42.311
No, never mind. I wasn't
being serious. Forget what I said.

420
00:26:00.631 --> 00:26:02.301
- How can the suspect be released?
- How can the suspect be released?

421
00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:03.972
- The prosecution is an accomplice.
- The prosecution is an accomplice.

422
00:26:03.972 --> 00:26:05.371
It's the people's order.

423
00:26:05.371 --> 00:26:06.901
Detain Do Hak Young.

424
00:26:06.901 --> 00:26:08.512
- It's the people's order.
- It's the people's order.

425
00:26:08.512 --> 00:26:10.212
- Detain Do Hak Young.
- Detain Do Hak Young.

426
00:26:10.212 --> 00:26:11.682
How can the suspect be released?

427
00:26:11.682 --> 00:26:13.141
The prosecution is an accomplice.

428
00:26:13.141 --> 00:26:14.811
- How can the suspect be released?
- How can the suspect be released?

429
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:16.381
- The prosecution is an accomplice.
- The prosecution is an accomplice.

430
00:26:16.381 --> 00:26:17.381
- It's the people's...
- Look!

431
00:26:17.381 --> 00:26:18.551
Isn't he Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan?

432
00:26:18.551 --> 00:26:19.682
No, you got the wrong person.

433
00:26:19.682 --> 00:26:20.782
- Stop right there!
- It must be him!

434
00:26:20.782 --> 00:26:21.952
- Get him!
- Hold on!

435
00:26:21.952 --> 00:26:23.821
- Gosh, wait.
- You're Jung Jae Chan, right?

436
00:26:23.821 --> 00:26:25.291
You are Jung Jae Chan!

437
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:26.762
Gosh, you got the wrong person!

438
00:26:26.762 --> 00:26:29.262
Don't lie. Why are you disguised
like this if you're not him?

439
00:26:29.262 --> 00:26:30.432
- What are you even saying?
- Gosh!

440
00:26:30.462 --> 00:26:33.032
- Don't let him get away!
- Have some pity!

441
00:26:33.702 --> 00:26:34.901
- Move out of my way.
- Stop!

442
00:26:34.901 --> 00:26:36.432
- Help!
- You piece of...

443
00:26:37.871 --> 00:26:40.702
Even more people came out
for the protest today. Did you see?

444
00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:43.472
Yes. Mr. Jung is in huge trouble.

445
00:26:43.972 --> 00:26:46.212
At this rate, he'll end up
with a million enemies in no time.

446
00:26:46.311 --> 00:26:48.012
There's one right here.

447
00:26:48.012 --> 00:26:50.581
Gosh, stop it.
Do you want to get me fired or what?

448
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:56.692
My gosh.

449
00:26:56.692 --> 00:26:59.492
Mr. Jung, you're wearing...

450
00:26:59.492 --> 00:27:02.291
Well, I had a bit of a situation.

451
00:27:02.291 --> 00:27:03.891
I'll get changed quickly.

452
00:27:07.131 --> 00:27:11.002
My gosh, we've only seen him
in suits. That style is...

453
00:27:11.002 --> 00:27:12.172
How refreshing.

454
00:27:13.242 --> 00:27:15.672
The fact that there's
such a good-looking prosecutor...

455
00:27:15.672 --> 00:27:17.442
delights me.
Don't you feel the same way?

456
00:27:18.141 --> 00:27:19.242
He's so cute.

457
00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:21.452
You said he's the type
girls get sick of quickly.

458
00:27:22.881 --> 00:27:24.881
He's the type you want to see until
you get sick of him.

459
00:27:25.682 --> 00:27:30.051
Excuse me. Where's
Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan's office?

460
00:27:30.051 --> 00:27:33.962
Oh, why do you need to see
Prosecutor Jung?

461
00:27:33.962 --> 00:27:35.532
I'm here for an interview with him.

462
00:27:35.962 --> 00:27:38.532
I'm Kim Song Ja.

463
00:27:38.532 --> 00:27:40.702
Oh, you worked at Ms. Yoo's place
as a housekeeper, right?

464
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:42.472
Yes, that's right.

465
00:27:42.472 --> 00:27:43.801
Good. Please follow me.

466
00:27:44.472 --> 00:27:49.212
Prosecutor Jung will be here soon,
so just wait in the office.

467
00:27:49.212 --> 00:27:50.242
Okay.

468
00:27:52.611 --> 00:27:54.242
Who is she?

469
00:27:54.651 --> 00:27:55.752
You know her.

470
00:27:55.952 --> 00:27:58.682
She's the first person to witness
Yoo Su Kyung's body.

- No, she's just a witness.

Oh, I see. She's just a witness.

Du Hyun,
about the story you wrote...

479
00:28:24.611 --> 00:28:25.841
The one that criticizes
the prosecution.

480
00:28:26.442 --> 00:28:28.381
People have posted
over 9,000 comments already.

481
00:28:29.151 --> 00:28:31.621
Congratulations. What's your secret?

482
00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:33.551
Gosh, are you really
going to keep that up?

483
00:28:36.851 --> 00:28:40.121
(I'm too scared to even step
out of the house.)

484
00:28:40.121 --> 00:28:42.831
Do they think that being able
to type is something to brag about?

485
00:28:42.932 --> 00:28:44.702
Does being a netizen mean...

486
00:28:44.702 --> 00:28:47.002
that they can reveal
someone's personal information?

487
00:28:47.202 --> 00:28:49.272
I can understand
Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan.

488
00:28:49.272 --> 00:28:51.742
He's trashy himself. How can he
punish another piece of trash?

489
00:28:51.742 --> 00:28:53.071
Trash?

490
00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:54.811
These little...

491
00:28:59.381 --> 00:29:02.611
You can be sued for defamation for
writing such a malicious comment.

492
00:29:04.151 --> 00:29:05.482
That doesn't scare me at all.

493
00:29:05.621 --> 00:29:08.992
I say that because he'll investigate
the case poorly and let me go.

494
00:29:09.891 --> 00:29:11.962
Do you have evidence
that he didn't investigate properly?

495
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:15.992
Prosecutor Jung Jae Chan,
you can't be doing this here.

496
00:29:15.992 --> 00:29:17.232
He must have a lot of time.

497
00:29:17.232 --> 00:29:18.901
Get some work done
if you have time to post comments.

498
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:24.742

I want to break their fingers.

Du Hyun!

505
00:29:46.891 --> 00:29:48.091
You need to see this.

506
00:29:48.091 --> 00:29:49.492
What now?
