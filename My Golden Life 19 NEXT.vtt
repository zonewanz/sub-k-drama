3
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:18.886
Let's...

4
00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:24.897
never meet again.

5
00:00:35.877 --> 00:00:36.917
Never again.

6
00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:51.287
I... I'll take a cab.

7
00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:53.027
Ji An.

8
00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:58.197
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:03.996
What have I done?

10
00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:08.637
(Episode 19)

11
00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:16.917
Secretary Yoo.

12
00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:18.546
Yes.

13
00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:21.046
How long have we known each other?

14
00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:23.417
5 years.

15
00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:26.387
You must be very drunk.

16
00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:30.697
It must be the alcohol.

17
00:02:32.727 --> 00:02:34.266
It should be.

18
00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:42.007
I only had two glasses of beer.

19
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:57.031
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

20
00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:11.796
Crazy. I must be crazy.

21
00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:15.137
What have I done?

22
00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:17.037
What have I done?

23
00:03:18.606 --> 00:03:21.806
Ji An, do you like him?

24
00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:27.146
Just because you stared at him so much,

25
00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:28.247
I was mistaken.

26
00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:32.387
I get it though. How could you think about love...

27
00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:34.556
given the situation you are in now?

28
00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:45.366
But why were you staring at his car?

29
00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:48.137
No way.

30
00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:54.007
You must be crazy, Seo Ji An.

31
00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:18.567
No way.

32
00:04:19.937 --> 00:04:21.307
Why did I do that?

33
00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.276
Seriously. Why?

34
00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:45.427
I hope he helps...

35
00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.567
my parents...

36
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:52.266
to be exempted from going to prison.

37
00:04:53.737 --> 00:04:55.067
I want Mother and Father...

38
00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:57.336
No, I mean...

39
00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:02.547
I wish he can stop the vice chairman and Ms. No.

40
00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:05.447
About what I did today.

41
00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:09.817
Will you tell your mother and father...

42
00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:12.187
for me?

43
00:05:15.956 --> 00:05:17.057
I will.

44
00:05:17.396 --> 00:05:20.627
Then promise you'll tell them...

45
00:05:21.127 --> 00:05:24.067
what I did to get...

46
00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:26.466
the blue fabric from the office.

47
00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:30.206
Please tell Ms. No and Mr. Choi for me.

48
00:05:31.737 --> 00:05:32.877
I will.

49
00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:35.747
I'll tell them.

50
00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:10.276
Ms. Seo, you're here early today.

51
00:06:15.846 --> 00:06:18.487
Ms. Seo, you're here early today.

52
00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.797
Gosh. Why... Why are you here?

53
00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:34.906
Did you forget I'm staying at the night duty room?

54
00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:37.307
I know that.

55
00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:39.846
But why aren't you at the event hall?

56
00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:42.007
Did you get drunk only after two glasses of beer?

57
00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:43.276
We agreed that other teammates will...

58
00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:45.076
take turns in the morning when we aren't busy.

59
00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.947
And we agreed that I'll be there in the afternoon.

60
00:06:47.086 --> 00:06:49.857
Right. We talked about that last night.

61
00:06:49.857 --> 00:06:50.857
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:54.757 --> 00:06:57.627
I made a mistake last night.

63
00:06:57.627 --> 00:06:58.927
I must have drunk too much.

64
00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:01.197
No, I'm sorry too.

65
00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:03.666
I should have apologized to you first.

66
00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:07.466
I'm sorry for my mistake.

67
00:07:08.437 --> 00:07:09.877
Well, we were both drunk.

68
00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.377
Then I will see you at the meeting.

69
00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:20.786
Wait.

70
00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:29.057
You hurt your knee.

71
00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:31.896
Thank you.

72
00:07:43.307 --> 00:07:44.706
Did you want to see me?

73
00:07:44.706 --> 00:07:46.447
It's about the promotion video.

74
00:07:46.576 --> 00:07:48.346
Are they filming according to the cue sheet?

75
00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:49.346
Yes, sir.

76
00:07:50.247 --> 00:07:52.947
Doesn't Haesung Apparel's 40th anniversary event...

77
00:07:53.187 --> 00:07:55.987
take an important part of the video?

78
00:07:56.456 --> 00:07:59.357
Well, as you have instructed...

79
00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:01.526
I think the focus has been set off.

80
00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:04.997
After the event, we must devote...

81
00:08:04.997 --> 00:08:06.596
all of our resources for the winter season.

82
00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:08.096
How is the marketing strategy coming along?

83
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:10.437
Well, during our last seminar,

84
00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:12.766
Ms. Seo suggested an idea for the commercial.

85
00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:16.206
So she can take on the project.

86
00:08:17.237 --> 00:08:20.177
Since I'm in charge of the anniversary event,

87
00:08:20.507 --> 00:08:22.507
I'd like someone else to lead the project.

88
00:08:22.677 --> 00:08:25.547
One's performance must be the choosing factor.

89
00:08:26.247 --> 00:08:28.817
But isn't it too big for a new employee to take on?

90
00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:31.216
We will discuss further about that matter.

91
00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:35.286
But why hasn't Ms. Yoon come to work yet?

92
00:08:37.097 --> 00:08:38.696
She's late even without any notice.

93
00:08:40.296 --> 00:08:41.997
I'm going to quit.

94
00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:44.867
I'll give her a call.

95
00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:49.877
Vice President Choi, take a look at this, sir.

96
00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:52.276
This is the Customers' Photo Board.

97
00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:53.577
Please take a look at this photo.

98
00:08:53.577 --> 00:08:56.146
Someone is stealing the fabric in this photo.

99
00:08:56.176 --> 00:08:57.276
- Let's look. - Right here.

100
00:09:06.987 --> 00:09:09.457
Isn't this Ms. Yoon?

101
00:09:12.127 --> 00:09:14.097
The person in this photo is Ms. Yoon?

102
00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:15.926
What?

103
00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:17.696
Yoon Ha Jung.

104
00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:21.137
Are you not coming to work because of what I said?

105
00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:23.276
Why wouldn't I come to work?

106
00:09:23.877 --> 00:09:25.436
I'm in front of the office.

107
00:09:25.436 --> 00:09:27.176
I'm handing in my resignation letter.

108
00:09:27.806 --> 00:09:29.607
Are you really going to quit?

109
00:09:35.686 --> 00:09:36.887
Ms. Yoon Ha Jung!

110
00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:43.426
General Manager Lee, don't yell at me.

111
00:09:44.257 --> 00:09:46.127
I'm no longer an employee of this company.

112
00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:48.497
Here's my resignation letter.

113
00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:50.967
Who says you can turn in your resignation letter?

114
00:09:54.337 --> 00:09:56.107
I didn't see you there.

115
00:09:56.237 --> 00:09:59.036
Ms. Yoon, how could you do something like this?

116
00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:00.776
Take a look at this!

117
00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:06.946
Gosh, that's not me. It's not me.

118
00:10:07.217 --> 00:10:09.016
Why... Why would that be me?

119
00:10:09.016 --> 00:10:10.516
You can't even see the face in the photo.

120
00:10:10.556 --> 00:10:12.457
The pants and the shoes are identical to yours.

121
00:10:14.087 --> 00:10:16.627
Are you the one who stole Mr. Jung's fabric...

122
00:10:16.796 --> 00:10:18.127
which almost ruined the fashion show,

123
00:10:18.127 --> 00:10:20.696
the most important show of the event, Ms. Yoon?

124
00:10:20.997 --> 00:10:22.696
Was that you?

125
00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:30.977
Yes.

126
00:10:31.837 --> 00:10:33.247
It was me.

127
00:10:35.577 --> 00:10:37.276
I didn't like Ms. Seo.

128
00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:38.916
So I wanted to ruin it.

129
00:10:41.046 --> 00:10:43.686
How can you rehire someone I kicked out?

130
00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:46.357
On top of that, as soon as she was hired again,

131
00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:48.757
she took charge of all the important tasks,

132
00:10:49.227 --> 00:10:50.857
and I didn't feel comfortable about that.

133
00:10:52.727 --> 00:10:54.066
I can't work...

134
00:10:54.066 --> 00:10:56.497
- because of Seo Ji An. - Ms. Yoon!

135
00:10:58.066 --> 00:11:00.207
Ms. Yoon, you have no right to say that.

136
00:11:00.207 --> 00:11:01.967
When you sent the messages with the wrong date,

137
00:11:01.967 --> 00:11:03.936
you got off after only writing an explanation.

138
00:11:03.936 --> 00:11:06.276
You mean the incident with 130,000 dollars?

139
00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:08.207
I'll pay it back.

140
00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:11.416
I will also pay for the fabric.

141
00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:13.217
You'll pay for the fabric?

142
00:11:13.887 --> 00:11:15.387
That was obstruction of business.

143
00:11:15.816 --> 00:11:18.257
File for the damage, and I'll pay it back.

144
00:11:18.257 --> 00:11:20.457
- What about the theft? - Sorry?

145
00:11:20.457 --> 00:11:21.457
You stole the company's property,

146
00:11:21.457 --> 00:11:22.926
so it's a theft and obstruction of business.

147
00:11:23.627 --> 00:11:25.457
There's no doubt that you're fired.

148
00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:27.727
You will pay for stealing the fabric...

149
00:11:28.497 --> 00:11:30.766
at the station, Ms. Yoon.

150
00:11:31.536 --> 00:11:32.936
At the station?

151
00:11:36.406 --> 00:11:37.936
We're from the security team.

152
00:11:37.936 --> 00:11:39.507
Take her to the station...

153
00:11:39.507 --> 00:11:41.077
on the charge of theft and obstruction of business.

154
00:11:41.507 --> 00:11:43.016
The legal team will accompany you.

155
00:11:43.016 --> 00:11:45.146
- Let's go. - No. Please, sir!

156
00:11:45.676 --> 00:11:47.946
Please spare me this once. I'm sorry.

157
00:11:48.587 --> 00:11:52.117
My dad... Call my dad, Kyung Min!

158
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:54.827
Ha Jung!

159
00:11:57.526 --> 00:11:58.757
What's up with those two?

160
00:11:59.997 --> 00:12:02.467
Come to think of it, why is Ms. Yoon's outfit...

161
00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:04.036
the same as yesterday?

162
00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:05.796
Yesterday, Kyung Min was supposed to...

163
00:12:06.806 --> 00:12:09.107
drop her off at her house.

164
00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:13.577
All right. Let's get back to our meeting.

165
00:12:25.087 --> 00:12:26.087
Vice President Choi,

166
00:12:26.457 --> 00:12:28.127
this is an email from the marketing team.

167
00:12:29.127 --> 00:12:31.227
They have decided not to include...

168
00:12:31.357 --> 00:12:33.227
the closing ceremony in the promotion video.

169
00:12:34.766 --> 00:12:37.066
Why did they change the cue sheet?

170
00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:40.337
It says that the footages of preparing the event...

171
00:12:40.337 --> 00:12:42.406
seems more suitable.

172
00:12:51.676 --> 00:12:54.087
I bought the wooden chair for 100 dollars.

173
00:12:54.087 --> 00:12:56.516
Handmade chairs are much better indeed.

174
00:12:56.516 --> 00:12:59.457
Manufactured chairs cost more than 130 dollars.

175
00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:00.727
I felt bad that it was so cheap.

176
00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:03.227
100 dollars for a handmade chair is too cheap.

177
00:13:03.327 --> 00:13:05.296
I hope you buy one for your husband too.

178
00:13:05.296 --> 00:13:07.426
Actually, I was thinking about buying another one.

179
00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:10.367
But I must pay the price the designer wants then.

180
00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:11.796
I think the owner of the cafe...

181
00:13:11.796 --> 00:13:14.737
wants to foster the designers.

182
00:13:15.207 --> 00:13:16.637
"Brad Pitt"?

183
00:13:17.477 --> 00:13:19.847
I saw his comment on some other blog.

184
00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:22.747
I guess he's a fan of yours.

185
00:13:23.316 --> 00:13:25.016
Did he buy a chair from here?

186
00:13:32.156 --> 00:13:33.526
Hello.

187
00:13:33.686 --> 00:13:34.827
Hello.

188
00:13:36.286 --> 00:13:38.556
Ji Soo, I made a big mistake.

189
00:13:39.056 --> 00:13:40.896
I put aside money for the bread,

190
00:13:40.896 --> 00:13:42.227
but I completely forgot.

191
00:13:42.227 --> 00:13:45.296
Tell your boss I apologize for paying so late.

192
00:13:45.337 --> 00:13:47.936
My boss didn't even ask about the payment.

193
00:13:49.507 --> 00:13:52.077
Ji Soo, are you keep going to let your hair down now?

194
00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:53.847
You look so much prettier with your hair down.

195
00:13:55.776 --> 00:13:57.416
My hair?

196
00:13:57.946 --> 00:14:00.546
My boyfriend told me he likes my hair down.

197
00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:03.257
Gosh, you have a boyfriend now?

198
00:14:03.656 --> 00:14:04.656
Yes.

199
00:14:05.587 --> 00:14:08.357
Well, I'll get going then.

200
00:14:08.357 --> 00:14:09.727
Goodbye.

201
00:14:10.727 --> 00:14:11.727
Bye.

202
00:14:16.337 --> 00:14:18.566
Don't you think she lied on purpose?

203
00:14:18.936 --> 00:14:21.406
At first, I thought she was a foolish stalker,

204
00:14:22.707 --> 00:14:23.837
but she's cute in her own way.

205
00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:30.847
Here.

206
00:14:30.877 --> 00:14:33.217
She left it under the counter and forgot.

207
00:14:33.217 --> 00:14:34.887
She said she's sorry.

208
00:14:35.217 --> 00:14:37.156
Gosh, she doesn't need to apologize.

209
00:14:37.156 --> 00:14:39.156
People forget things.

210
00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:45.127
I have more customers coming...

211
00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:47.367
because of your delicious bread.

212
00:14:47.727 --> 00:14:48.867
Thank you.

213
00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:51.566
From now on, I'd like to order two loafs...

214
00:14:51.637 --> 00:14:53.207
of castella bread as well.

215
00:14:55.806 --> 00:14:56.806
What?

216
00:14:57.477 --> 00:14:58.707
Why did she pay the full amount?

217
00:14:58.707 --> 00:14:59.707
Pardon?

218
00:15:00.176 --> 00:15:03.016
There's a 10 percent discount for cash.

219
00:15:03.117 --> 00:15:05.446
I told her that.

220
00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:10.487
And let me say this again.

221
00:15:10.957 --> 00:15:12.487
Are you looking for a part-timer?

222
00:15:12.487 --> 00:15:13.987
Hold on.

223
00:15:14.127 --> 00:15:16.227
Look at this. She wants to order...

224
00:15:16.227 --> 00:15:18.097
two loafs of castella bread from now on.

225
00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:22.266
I should put more eggs in it. I should.

226
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.296
What was that?

227
00:15:27.107 --> 00:15:29.436
(Product Supply Contract)

228
00:15:30.377 --> 00:15:32.837
The sample must have convinced them.

229
00:15:33.107 --> 00:15:34.806
Even I thought the products were good.

230
00:15:35.176 --> 00:15:36.877
Did you get the order sheet and the contract?

231
00:15:37.377 --> 00:15:38.717
Yes, I got it.

232
00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:40.686
I got half as the down payment.

233
00:15:40.946 --> 00:15:42.747
They will send the rest when the products arrive.

234
00:15:42.747 --> 00:15:44.117
So send me your bank details.

235
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:46.686
Just send me the money when they pay everything.

236
00:15:46.686 --> 00:15:48.727
But I got the down payment.

237
00:15:49.286 --> 00:15:51.526
Tae Soo, you're still good.

238
00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:53.727
You did this in such a short time.

239
00:15:53.727 --> 00:15:56.696
The margin is small. Don't make a fuss.

240
00:15:56.936 --> 00:15:58.467
Just because this one is small doesn't mean...

241
00:15:58.467 --> 00:15:59.566
the next deal will be small as well.

242
00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:03.936
Right. The next deal has to be much bigger.

243
00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:06.906
Take your bankbook.

244
00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:10.176
Please don't leave your belongings behind.

245
00:16:10.516 --> 00:16:13.617
(10,000 dollars)

246
00:16:14.747 --> 00:16:15.887
10,000 dollars.

247
00:16:17.556 --> 00:16:19.117
It's been such a long time.

248
00:16:24.227 --> 00:16:28.497
The closing ceremony will not be part of the video.

249
00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:42.847
Sir, Ms. Seo wants to see you.

250
00:16:48.646 --> 00:16:49.887
What are you doing?

251
00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:52.786
An employee requested to speak to me.

252
00:16:53.587 --> 00:16:54.727
Let her in.

253
00:16:55.156 --> 00:16:56.497
Okay.

254
00:17:10.877 --> 00:17:11.877
What is it?

255
00:17:12.807 --> 00:17:16.107
The closing event is left out in the video.

256
00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:19.716
So there's no need for me to be here.

257
00:17:20.317 --> 00:17:23.587
I thought I could tell your parents sooner.

258
00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:28.627
That's only a few days.

259
00:17:29.627 --> 00:17:31.456
As we promised, let's tell them when it's over.

260
00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:36.027
It's just too tough.

261
00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:38.637
Your brother already had the wedding,

262
00:17:39.297 --> 00:17:40.906
so you're done with your job. Is that it?

263
00:17:41.807 --> 00:17:43.077
That's not it.

264
00:17:43.976 --> 00:17:45.436
Then stick with it until the end.

265
00:17:46.777 --> 00:17:48.807
Shouldn't you finish the event well...

266
00:17:49.877 --> 00:17:51.176
to be able to take credit for it?

267
00:18:14.706 --> 00:18:18.006
He doesn't have money. How much did he spend?

268
00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.176
650...

269
00:18:21.676 --> 00:18:23.117
(Staff discount price)

270
00:18:24.017 --> 00:18:25.446
Staff discount price?

271
00:18:29.547 --> 00:18:32.456
He got every girl he picked.

272
00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:33.827
He's probably the best in the nation.

273
00:18:44.637 --> 00:18:46.607
I think she's being hunted by the player.

274
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:48.837
Should I tell Ji An?

275
00:18:53.107 --> 00:18:54.246
Can I trust you?

276
00:19:00.847 --> 00:19:03.357
(To Cinderella)

277
00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:08.827
(You should watch out for that guy.)

278
00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:11.857
(Dad)

279
00:19:15.297 --> 00:19:16.367
Yes, Dad.

280
00:19:16.367 --> 00:19:18.466
You are on break now, right?

281
00:19:19.097 --> 00:19:23.637
Right. You called me at the right timing.

282
00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:28.047
Yes. You bought shoes for Ji Tae and Soo A.

283
00:19:28.206 --> 00:19:30.047
Why does it say "staff discount price"...

284
00:19:30.047 --> 00:19:31.077
on the receipt?

285
00:19:31.646 --> 00:19:33.416
Right. That.

286
00:19:36.017 --> 00:19:38.956
I asked my friend who works at a mall.

287
00:19:40.087 --> 00:19:43.027
Did you? Okay.

288
00:19:43.127 --> 00:19:45.996
Dear our valued customers.

289
00:19:46.396 --> 00:19:48.597
The eighth floor of Nara Department Store...

290
00:19:50.097 --> 00:19:51.137
Ji Ho.

291
00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:57.577
(Nara Department Store)

292
00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:00.476
Nara Department Store?

293
00:20:14.027 --> 00:20:17.597
"I promised, so I won't tell Ji An about it."

294
00:20:17.726 --> 00:20:19.456
"But watch out for that guy."

295
00:20:20.027 --> 00:20:21.466
He stopped me from having the first kiss.

296
00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:22.696
Who is he to tell me to watch out for him?

297
00:20:23.137 --> 00:20:24.597
- Ma'am? - What?

298
00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:27.537
It's nothing. It's that guy from the club,

299
00:20:27.537 --> 00:20:29.006
and he won't tell Ji An.

300
00:20:29.506 --> 00:20:31.137
I see.

301
00:20:33.777 --> 00:20:36.246
By the way, where should we go and spend time?

302
00:20:48.057 --> 00:20:50.527
I will go buy some warm chamomile tea.

303
00:20:50.857 --> 00:20:52.656
- Hurry back. - Okay.

304
00:20:57.797 --> 00:20:59.337
Ms. Choi Seo Hyun?

305
00:21:00.206 --> 00:21:02.807
Who are you? I don't remember you.

306
00:21:03.936 --> 00:21:06.607
Are you my old classmate?

307
00:21:07.107 --> 00:21:08.847
No, I am not your classmate.

308
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:12.916
I am the wife of the man you are playing with.

309
00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:15.047
What? Wife?

310
00:21:15.047 --> 00:21:16.916
You will get it today. Get up.

311
00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:19.587
Is it fun playing with my husband?

312
00:21:19.587 --> 00:21:21.827
Stop it. You got the wrong person!

313
00:21:21.986 --> 00:21:24.797
I will kill you today.

314
00:21:24.797 --> 00:21:25.996
Come here.

315
00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:29.896
What are you doing? Are you mad?

316
00:21:29.966 --> 00:21:31.767
You should run. Hurry.

317
00:21:31.767 --> 00:21:33.236
Where are you going?

318
00:21:58.496 --> 00:22:00.027
I will take one more.

319
00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:07.267
Ji An.

320
00:22:08.436 --> 00:22:09.777
I heard it's yours.

321
00:22:09.777 --> 00:22:11.736
Right. Thank you.

322
00:22:17.547 --> 00:22:18.746
Good luck.

323
00:22:52.916 --> 00:22:54.047
Hey.

324
00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:58.716
You weren't answering your phone.

325
00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.887
I called your office and found out you were here.

326
00:23:01.256 --> 00:23:02.956
It's your first event as a vice president,

327
00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:04.627
so I've come to check it out.

328
00:23:06.567 --> 00:23:08.196
Why is that 20,000-dollar girl here?

329
00:23:08.597 --> 00:23:09.896
It's...

330
00:23:10.367 --> 00:23:12.597
She re-entered the company as a regular employee.

331
00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:14.367
Re-enter the company?

332
00:23:14.367 --> 00:23:16.067
She used to be a temporary employee.

333
00:23:16.807 --> 00:23:18.107
I don't care about her past.

334
00:23:18.506 --> 00:23:21.547
If she works here, why did you ask me to hire her?

335
00:23:21.577 --> 00:23:23.746
- That's... - It's because...

336
00:23:23.746 --> 00:23:25.877
it's dangerous to secretly date her, isn't it?

337
00:23:26.347 --> 00:23:28.916
Watch your mouth. She's nothing like that.

338
00:23:29.017 --> 00:23:31.986
Or are you going to date her secretly...

339
00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:35.557
and shock your family when time comes?

340
00:23:35.557 --> 00:23:38.456
Your imagination is too good for your own good.

341
00:23:39.357 --> 00:23:41.267
I watched you for about 20 minutes.

342
00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:43.196
And you stared at her the whole time.

343
00:23:44.297 --> 00:23:47.936
You frowned, became emotional, and smiled.

344
00:23:48.236 --> 00:23:49.436
You weren't yourself.

345
00:23:50.436 --> 00:23:51.537
Did I...

346
00:23:53.176 --> 00:23:54.176
do that?

347
00:23:55.047 --> 00:23:57.746
What is your plan? If you don't tell me,

348
00:23:57.976 --> 00:24:00.216
I will take back the job offer.

349
00:24:00.446 --> 00:24:03.617
It's not true, and I have no intention.

350
00:24:04.117 --> 00:24:07.057
I won't deceive your parents.

351
00:24:07.057 --> 00:24:09.057
It's nothing like that. It's not.

352
00:24:09.057 --> 00:24:10.226
Do you think I am a little child?

353
00:24:12.857 --> 00:24:15.196
I will put her in my uncle's company.

354
00:24:16.396 --> 00:24:20.236
Is this because you can't give her up if she's here?

355
00:24:24.307 --> 00:24:26.137
If I can keep her here,

356
00:24:26.847 --> 00:24:28.577
I would actually feel more relieved.

357
00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:31.176
What are you talking about now?

358
00:24:35.047 --> 00:24:38.117
Someone spilled drinks at the hand printing area.

359
00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:54.137
Are you okay?

360
00:24:54.767 --> 00:24:56.607
- Ji An, are you okay? - Are you okay?

361
00:24:57.476 --> 00:24:59.537
- I am okay. - I am sorry.

362
00:24:59.877 --> 00:25:01.547
- Are you all right? - Yes.

363
00:25:20.297 --> 00:25:22.196
(Seo Hyun)

364
00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:23.966
Is she okay?

365
00:25:25.797 --> 00:25:26.837
What happened?

366
00:25:26.837 --> 00:25:29.006
Ji An got burned by an iron.

367
00:25:29.307 --> 00:25:30.777
She got burned by an iron?

368
00:25:31.706 --> 00:25:33.176
Where is she now?

369
00:25:33.176 --> 00:25:35.206
She went to the staff's room to get first aid.

370
00:25:36.946 --> 00:25:39.017
Ms. Seo! Ji An!

371
00:25:41.617 --> 00:25:42.887
Where is Ms. Seo?

372
00:25:42.887 --> 00:25:44.486
She ran outside.

373
00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:46.327
- Outside? - Yes.

374
00:25:48.486 --> 00:25:49.587
Seo Hyun.

375
00:25:49.587 --> 00:25:52.097
I'm in front of the building you told me.

376
00:25:53.226 --> 00:25:54.567
Where are you?

377
00:25:55.196 --> 00:25:57.297
I am here. I am behind you.

378
00:26:06.506 --> 00:26:08.577
What happened to you, Seo Hyun?

379
00:26:10.746 --> 00:26:12.617
I had a fight with my friend.

380
00:26:12.986 --> 00:26:14.446
What was the driver doing?

381
00:26:14.547 --> 00:26:16.557
I left without him to meet my friend.

382
00:26:17.817 --> 00:26:19.726
When's your lesson?

383
00:26:21.456 --> 00:26:22.557
(Do Kyung)

384
00:26:23.426 --> 00:26:25.097
Don't answer it.

385
00:26:28.767 --> 00:26:30.496
If he finds out, he will kill me.

386
00:26:32.236 --> 00:26:33.607
You have the purse.

387
00:26:33.607 --> 00:26:35.837
You could've gone to a mall and bought clothes.

388
00:26:36.377 --> 00:26:38.176
How can I go to a mall looking like this?

389
00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:39.676
What if someone sees me?

390
00:26:45.377 --> 00:26:46.547
Then...

391
00:26:48.047 --> 00:26:49.287
Let's go buy clothes.

392
00:26:49.656 --> 00:26:51.986
Didn't you hear me?

393
00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:54.057
How can I pick clothes looking like this?

394
00:26:55.726 --> 00:26:56.756
Then...

395
00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:00.527
Let's order through here.

396
00:27:00.527 --> 00:27:02.367
We can just go pick it up. Is that okay?

397
00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:03.896
Here. Pick one.

398
00:27:09.676 --> 00:27:12.637
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

399
00:27:12.637 --> 00:27:14.676
Mr. Yoo, call all the clinics around here.

400
00:27:14.676 --> 00:27:16.006
Check if they got a burn patient.

401
00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:17.017
Okay, sir.

402
00:27:17.017 --> 00:27:18.216
Let's call on the way.

403
00:27:27.956 --> 00:27:29.456
Welcome.

404
00:27:29.587 --> 00:27:30.726
Yes.

405
00:27:30.726 --> 00:27:33.466
I've come to pick up what I ordered online.

406
00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:34.466
Okay.

407
00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:37.466
I will prepare it right away.

408
00:27:59.956 --> 00:28:01.456
Is it the emergency room?

409
00:28:01.557 --> 00:28:04.097
Is there a female burn patient there?

410
00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:09.027
Have you seen a girl with a burn on her hand?

411
00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:10.367
Her name is Seo Ji An.

412
00:28:13.006 --> 00:28:15.567
We didn't have any burn patients today.

413
00:28:16.906 --> 00:28:17.906
I see.

414
00:28:19.137 --> 00:28:21.176
If she didn't come here, where did she go?

415
00:28:22.077 --> 00:28:23.317
Sir,

416
00:28:23.317 --> 00:28:25.517
I called all the clinics around this area,

417
00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:26.646
but she's not in any of them.

418
00:28:28.787 --> 00:28:30.087
Perhaps she went to a university hospital?

419
00:28:31.857 --> 00:28:34.327
I called a cab. Let's wait here.

420
00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:36.456
You won't be late for the lesson, will you?

421
00:28:37.156 --> 00:28:38.196
Thank you.

422
00:28:38.857 --> 00:28:41.267
I am so glad that I have you.

423
00:28:45.436 --> 00:28:47.436
You can call Do Kyung.

424
00:28:48.307 --> 00:28:50.176
I can't. He...

425
00:28:51.037 --> 00:28:52.137
I will be in trouble.

426
00:28:53.307 --> 00:28:55.006
That's not true.

427
00:28:55.506 --> 00:28:58.377
If you sincerely ask for his help,

428
00:28:58.377 --> 00:28:59.716
he will help you.

429
00:29:00.446 --> 00:29:02.146
So from now on,

430
00:29:02.517 --> 00:29:04.587
ask for his help when something happens.

431
00:29:05.057 --> 00:29:07.186
You don't know him well.

432
00:29:07.756 --> 00:29:09.456
As the heir of Haesung Corporation,

433
00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.756
he's been training since his birth.

434
00:29:12.357 --> 00:29:13.966
He won't do anything...

435
00:29:13.966 --> 00:29:15.426
that goes against the rules of the family.

436
00:29:16.567 --> 00:29:18.466
I'm sure he's not always like that.

437
00:29:19.297 --> 00:29:22.006
Besides, I can just call you now.

438
00:29:22.006 --> 00:29:23.506
Why would I call him?

439
00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:27.077
I am grateful...

440
00:29:28.847 --> 00:29:30.017
and sorry.

441
00:29:30.817 --> 00:29:32.877
What are you grateful and sorry about?

442
00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:35.087
I only troubled you.

443
00:29:36.557 --> 00:29:37.617
I can't tell you now,

444
00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.426
but you'll find out soon.

445
00:29:55.006 --> 00:29:56.166
Where did she go?

446
00:30:10.617 --> 00:30:11.916
Why are you outside?

447
00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.357
Did something go wrong at the event?

448
00:30:13.357 --> 00:30:15.256
Why did you turn off your phone?

449
00:30:15.357 --> 00:30:17.756
You're so good at worrying me.

450
00:30:19.127 --> 00:30:21.097
Let me see. How badly are you hurt?

451
00:30:21.567 --> 00:30:23.436
It was a light burn.

452
00:30:25.067 --> 00:30:26.137
What?

453
00:30:26.236 --> 00:30:28.436
I had to do something.

454
00:30:28.436 --> 00:30:29.537
What was it?

455
00:30:30.377 --> 00:30:32.837
I can't tell you.

456
00:30:32.837 --> 00:30:34.146
You can't tell me?

457
00:30:34.706 --> 00:30:37.117
You made me so worried, and you can't tell me?

458
00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:39.416
Why did you turn off the phone then?

459
00:30:39.446 --> 00:30:40.847
Lower your voice, Do Kyung.

460
00:30:40.847 --> 00:30:42.246
Why would I lower my voice?

461
00:30:42.246 --> 00:30:43.887
We're at the event hall.

462
00:31:35.666 --> 00:31:37.906
Ji An! Why you...

463
00:32:03.736 --> 00:32:06.236
Why are you thankful and sorry to me?

464
00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:09.267
And why did I secretly take you here?

465
00:32:09.777 --> 00:32:11.537
I don't know what I am doing.

466
00:32:21.446 --> 00:32:22.787
You can't tell me?

467
00:32:23.287 --> 00:32:25.787
You made me so worried, and you can't tell me?

468
00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:27.926
Why did you turn off the phone then?

469
00:32:43.037 --> 00:32:45.037
I watched you for about 20 minutes.

470
00:32:45.476 --> 00:32:47.077
And you stared at her the whole time.

471
00:32:48.077 --> 00:32:50.617
You frowned, became emotional, and smiled.

472
00:32:50.617 --> 00:32:53.047
You weren't yourself.

473
00:33:41.597 --> 00:33:42.696
Dad.

474
00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:47.236
So, as soon as you got discharged,

475
00:33:47.236 --> 00:33:49.037
you got a job instead of studying for...

476
00:33:49.037 --> 00:33:50.877
the college entrance exam?

477
00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.777
I am sorry I lied, but I had no choice.

478
00:33:55.906 --> 00:33:58.317
You would've disapproved of my plan anyway.

479
00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:00.087
There must be a good reason for that.

480
00:34:00.446 --> 00:34:02.186
Is it so bad to tell you to go to college?

481
00:34:02.817 --> 00:34:05.517
Dad, I said this when I repeated the year...

482
00:34:05.517 --> 00:34:07.426
and also before I joined the army.

483
00:34:08.156 --> 00:34:09.356
I won't go to college.

484
00:34:09.356 --> 00:34:10.756
I don't want to go.

485
00:34:10.756 --> 00:34:12.897
If you studied well, you wouldn't have said that.

486
00:34:12.897 --> 00:34:15.227
If I studied well, I would've gone to college.

487
00:34:15.827 --> 00:34:17.367
But I am bad at studying.

488
00:34:17.836 --> 00:34:19.367
I neither enjoy or love studying.

489
00:34:19.367 --> 00:34:20.707
What's the point of going to college?

490
00:34:21.637 --> 00:34:23.736
People who studied abroad fill colleges.

491
00:34:23.736 --> 00:34:26.006
And so many qualified people can't find jobs.

492
00:34:26.006 --> 00:34:27.307
Even if I try my best,

493
00:34:27.876 --> 00:34:29.546
I won't be able to go to a decent college.

494
00:34:29.546 --> 00:34:31.376
So why should I go to college?

495
00:34:31.376 --> 00:34:32.847
It's a waste of my time and money.

496
00:34:32.847 --> 00:34:34.517
That's why you should study.

497
00:34:34.517 --> 00:34:36.687
You should try harder.

498
00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:39.957
Dad. Dad, please.

499
00:34:41.827 --> 00:34:43.256
What's the use of finishing college?

500
00:34:44.296 --> 00:34:46.156
Does college guarantee success?

501
00:34:46.156 --> 00:34:47.296
A good life?

502
00:34:48.026 --> 00:34:49.426
You went to college too, didn't you?

503
00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:50.997
Ji An went to college.

504
00:34:53.406 --> 00:34:54.667
Why would you waste money on me...

505
00:34:55.537 --> 00:34:57.977
when we are not even well off?

506
00:34:57.977 --> 00:35:00.276
It's better for me to start earning.

507
00:35:00.977 --> 00:35:03.917
I told you.

508
00:35:03.917 --> 00:35:05.716
I told you I won't...

509
00:35:05.716 --> 00:35:07.417
let you work while studying.

510
00:35:07.417 --> 00:35:08.647
I earn money now.

511
00:35:08.647 --> 00:35:10.756
Pay the debts with that.

512
00:35:12.216 --> 00:35:14.586
I am too old to be getting your help.

513
00:35:14.586 --> 00:35:17.026
I have the right to choose what to do with my life.

514
00:35:18.457 --> 00:35:19.926
Dad,

515
00:35:19.926 --> 00:35:22.367
I am saving up money to start my own business.

516
00:35:22.367 --> 00:35:24.497
I've saved all the money you've given me...

517
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:26.437
without spending a penny.

518
00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:28.637
I'll give it to Ji Tae.

519
00:35:30.307 --> 00:35:31.307
To Ji Tae?

520
00:35:34.147 --> 00:35:35.176
He's the one...

521
00:35:36.077 --> 00:35:37.617
paying off our debt.

522
00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:41.046
I always feel indebted...

523
00:35:41.586 --> 00:35:42.647
to Ji Tae.

524
00:35:46.827 --> 00:35:48.827
So are you saying...

525
00:35:49.557 --> 00:35:51.997
you'll give up college...

526
00:35:51.997 --> 00:35:54.497
and just make money...

527
00:35:54.696 --> 00:35:56.466
because we're poor?

528
00:35:58.397 --> 00:35:59.437
Just make money?

529
00:36:01.836 --> 00:36:05.937
People go to college to get a well-paid job.

530
00:36:11.147 --> 00:36:13.417
Everyone has a college experience.

531
00:36:13.917 --> 00:36:14.917
College experience?

532
00:36:16.316 --> 00:36:17.957
What's wrong about not having one?

533
00:36:18.586 --> 00:36:20.626
There are so many things I can do with money.

534
00:36:35.966 --> 00:36:36.977
If Mom finds out,

535
00:36:37.676 --> 00:36:40.446
she'll make a fuss when Ji Tae is back.

536
00:36:42.176 --> 00:36:43.747
I'll tell Mom about this.

537
00:36:46.586 --> 00:36:47.617
Dad.

538
00:36:49.446 --> 00:36:51.656
Dad, I'm sorry.

539
00:36:51.756 --> 00:36:54.626
But don't worry about me. I'm serious.

540
00:37:08.506 --> 00:37:11.037
When other people ignore me and despise me,

541
00:37:11.506 --> 00:37:14.276
it makes me so miserable, poor, and servile.

542
00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:16.917
I can't stand it anymore.

543
00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:21.086
Stop it. You don't know why I'm doing this.

544
00:37:21.316 --> 00:37:22.647
I just can't...

545
00:37:23.586 --> 00:37:26.117
pass down poverty to my children.

546
00:37:26.957 --> 00:37:28.156
So I won't get married.

547
00:37:28.387 --> 00:37:29.486
I heard...

548
00:37:32.227 --> 00:37:33.626
you're a day laborer.

549
00:37:35.327 --> 00:37:38.137
What on earth can you do for Ji An?

550
00:37:38.537 --> 00:37:39.736
In this situation,

551
00:37:40.736 --> 00:37:42.937
why would you waste your money on me?

552
00:37:43.137 --> 00:37:45.307
It's better I start my own business and make money.

553
00:37:45.307 --> 00:37:47.046
I suffered so much.

554
00:37:47.506 --> 00:37:50.577
I wanted to kill myself. There's nothing I can do.

555
00:37:53.917 --> 00:37:55.086
I can't...

556
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:57.617
trust you anymore.

557
00:38:20.176 --> 00:38:21.707
Seo Hyun, what's wrong?

558
00:38:22.707 --> 00:38:24.816
I got hiccups.

559
00:38:24.816 --> 00:38:27.247
I'm sorry, but I need to go to my room.

560
00:38:41.696 --> 00:38:43.367
What should I do?

561
00:38:44.236 --> 00:38:45.937
Why isn't he calling me?

562
00:39:05.017 --> 00:39:06.017
- Hello? - How does it feel to...

563
00:39:06.017 --> 00:39:07.586
kiss someone else's husband?

564
00:39:07.586 --> 00:39:09.856
Choi Seo Hyun, a daughter of Haesung Corporation?

565
00:39:10.426 --> 00:39:11.997
I didn't kiss him.

566
00:39:12.526 --> 00:39:14.397
Why are you sending me the photos?

567
00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:16.336
Let's meet and talk about it.

568
00:39:37.387 --> 00:39:39.017
You didn't call me or answered my calls.

569
00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:42.026
She took my phone.

570
00:39:43.397 --> 00:39:44.926
By the way, it's too early to go to school.

571
00:39:44.926 --> 00:39:46.696
Is what the crazy woman said true?

572
00:39:48.126 --> 00:39:49.227
It's not, is it?

573
00:39:50.497 --> 00:39:51.566
It's true.

574
00:39:51.836 --> 00:39:54.506
I'm married.

575
00:39:55.066 --> 00:39:56.477
Are you married?

576
00:39:57.906 --> 00:39:59.276
Why didn't you tell me?

577
00:39:59.906 --> 00:40:01.776
You didn't ask me.

578
00:40:02.807 --> 00:40:04.417
Are you kidding me?

579
00:40:06.046 --> 00:40:07.586
What should I do now?

580
00:40:07.847 --> 00:40:09.756
I told her it's not your fault.

581
00:40:12.387 --> 00:40:14.327
She keeps sending me photos of us.

582
00:40:17.827 --> 00:40:20.466
I asked for divorce. So she's threatening you.

583
00:40:20.597 --> 00:40:22.667
Divorce? Why did you ask for divorce?

584
00:40:23.336 --> 00:40:26.466
I need to take care of you.

585
00:40:27.006 --> 00:40:30.537
What do you mean? We're not meant to be.

586
00:40:36.917 --> 00:40:38.276
This is the additional purchase order.

587
00:40:38.747 --> 00:40:41.517
I made an extra order to have enough in stock.

588
00:40:41.517 --> 00:40:43.216
We'll get a refund for the remaining items.

589
00:40:43.517 --> 00:40:47.156
And this is the report on trends in other brands.

590
00:40:48.727 --> 00:40:51.856
What's the rush with the purchase order and report?

591
00:40:52.426 --> 00:40:53.926
Why would you hurry like this?

592
00:40:54.526 --> 00:40:56.367
I'm just giving you a report in advance.

593
00:40:57.537 --> 00:40:58.566
And this.

594
00:40:59.037 --> 00:41:02.367
I thought about it during the event of Purple Scent.

595
00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:05.106
I thought it'd be good to sell scented products...

596
00:41:05.106 --> 00:41:07.506
in our clothing shops.

597
00:41:07.506 --> 00:41:09.006
So I wrote this proposal.

598
00:41:09.276 --> 00:41:10.676
Are you a robot or something?

599
00:41:11.517 --> 00:41:12.747
Did you even sleep?

600
00:41:14.216 --> 00:41:15.687
I wish I were a robot.

601
00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:18.656
I'll go to the event hall then.

602
00:41:23.327 --> 00:41:25.656
Did you get the results yet?

603
00:41:36.676 --> 00:41:38.676
Why is she running so hurriedly?

604
00:41:53.727 --> 00:41:55.526
Why is she hiding there?

605
00:42:50.247 --> 00:42:51.647
- Secretary Yoo. - Yes, sir.

606
00:42:51.647 --> 00:42:53.586
Arrange meetings for today and tomorrow.

607
00:42:54.046 --> 00:42:56.356
What meetings are you talking about?

608
00:42:56.356 --> 00:42:59.617
Any meetings I've been putting off. Set the time.

609
00:43:00.287 --> 00:43:01.787
Until the day before the end of the event.

610
00:43:02.387 --> 00:43:03.796
Okay.

611
00:43:30.957 --> 00:43:32.917
Mr. Baker told me to give this back to you.

612
00:43:32.917 --> 00:43:36.086
For cash payments, you get 10 percent discount.

613
00:43:36.227 --> 00:43:37.856
Goodbye then.

614
00:43:38.696 --> 00:43:39.827
Bye.

615
00:43:49.707 --> 00:43:50.736
What?

616
00:43:50.736 --> 00:43:53.506
I'm thankful that you have more customers.

617
00:44:10.696 --> 00:44:12.997
Sunwoo Hee, you came to me...

618
00:44:12.997 --> 00:44:15.296
like the warm sun of a spring day.

619
00:44:15.897 --> 00:44:19.167
I'm happy I can spend the second winter with you.

620
00:44:19.966 --> 00:44:22.106
Merry Christmas. Kang Nam Goo.

621
00:44:35.847 --> 00:44:38.517
This handwriting is just like his.

622
00:44:47.926 --> 00:44:49.426
Hello.

623
00:44:49.796 --> 00:44:53.606
What should I drink today?

624
00:44:54.637 --> 00:44:57.207
You come here quite often.

625
00:44:57.207 --> 00:44:59.106
I know. I'm my own boss.

626
00:44:59.637 --> 00:45:00.847
My working hour is flexible.

627
00:45:02.946 --> 00:45:04.546
What do you do?

628
00:45:05.946 --> 00:45:08.546
You weren't like this in the past. You've changed.

629
00:45:09.046 --> 00:45:10.517
You just ask questions to anyone.

630
00:45:10.957 --> 00:45:11.986
Gosh.

631
00:45:12.856 --> 00:45:16.086
You're not just anyone to me.

632
00:45:16.327 --> 00:45:17.897
Then what am I to you?

633
00:45:19.296 --> 00:45:21.426
You're my regular customer.

634
00:45:22.827 --> 00:45:24.796
What coffee do you want?

635
00:45:24.796 --> 00:45:27.037
I'm not a regular customer yet,

636
00:45:27.037 --> 00:45:28.367
but I'll have a cappuccino.

637
00:45:29.307 --> 00:45:30.376
And that.

638
00:45:30.676 --> 00:45:33.106
That castella sponge cake.

639
00:45:35.106 --> 00:45:36.977
And stamp my card too.

640
00:45:39.247 --> 00:45:40.287
Sure.

641
00:45:46.426 --> 00:45:48.287
Where do you get these?

642
00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:50.196
Do they use good flour?

643
00:45:51.696 --> 00:45:52.957
Of course.

644
00:45:55.727 --> 00:45:58.037
You wouldn't remember,

645
00:45:58.137 --> 00:46:00.606
but I can't stomach flour.

646
00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:02.066
But their bread...

647
00:46:02.066 --> 00:46:04.106
has never given me indigestion.

648
00:46:04.977 --> 00:46:06.506
You don't have to worry.

649
00:46:07.546 --> 00:46:09.876
I just asked if they use good flour.

650
00:46:16.756 --> 00:46:18.457
It's really tasty.

651
00:46:20.557 --> 00:46:21.626
Isn't it?

652
00:46:24.727 --> 00:46:26.897
You picked a great supplier.

653
00:46:31.167 --> 00:46:32.696
A supplier?

654
00:46:34.966 --> 00:46:36.977
Is he trying to get revenge?

655
00:46:37.207 --> 00:46:38.776
Why is he so mean?

656
00:46:40.546 --> 00:46:44.716
The coffee's just amazing.

657
00:47:02.397 --> 00:47:04.437
It can't be the same guy.

658
00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:11.707
(Merry Christmas)

659
00:47:11.707 --> 00:47:13.207
(Kang Nam Goo)

660
00:47:13.376 --> 00:47:16.347
(Haesung Apparel 40th Anniversary Event)

661
00:47:18.917 --> 00:47:20.046
My stomach hurts.

662
00:47:21.946 --> 00:47:23.517
Where do you go...

663
00:47:23.517 --> 00:47:26.187
that you always come back with a stomach ache?

664
00:47:31.656 --> 00:47:32.656
Mr. Baker.

665
00:47:33.296 --> 00:47:34.827
Why aren't you hiring anyone?

666
00:47:34.827 --> 00:47:36.997
Are you ignoring what I said?

667
00:47:36.997 --> 00:47:39.867
I told you that I want to quit.

668
00:47:40.807 --> 00:47:43.006
Then you can't deliver the bread.

669
00:47:43.006 --> 00:47:44.577
Or see the bike guy.

670
00:47:44.707 --> 00:47:47.276
It can't be helped if that's my fate.

671
00:47:47.276 --> 00:47:48.676
Maybe I'm destined to...

672
00:47:48.676 --> 00:47:50.446
focus on baking.

673
00:47:50.446 --> 00:47:51.977
Okay, okay.

674
00:47:53.986 --> 00:47:56.756
Shall I put a help wanted sign on the door?

675
00:47:57.887 --> 00:48:00.727
Don't you get what your master's saying?

676
00:48:01.156 --> 00:48:03.926
And you want to learn?

677
00:48:03.926 --> 00:48:04.997
"Master"?

678
00:48:05.327 --> 00:48:07.667
Will you teach me how to bake?

679
00:48:07.767 --> 00:48:09.126
Don't call me "master".

680
00:48:09.597 --> 00:48:11.466
I need your help,

681
00:48:11.466 --> 00:48:12.767
so it's yes for now.

682
00:48:12.767 --> 00:48:13.867
If you'll teach me,

683
00:48:13.867 --> 00:48:15.707
I'm your first apprentice.

684
00:48:15.906 --> 00:48:17.676
What first apprentice?

685
00:48:17.676 --> 00:48:19.977
- Thank you so much. - What are you doing?

686
00:48:20.577 --> 00:48:22.977
You can't touch me.

687
00:48:23.176 --> 00:48:24.276
Or I'll take it back.

688
00:48:24.276 --> 00:48:25.577
Sorry, Mr. Baker.

689
00:48:26.046 --> 00:48:27.787
I mean Master.

690
00:48:29.787 --> 00:48:31.716
Seriously? I take it back.

691
00:48:31.716 --> 00:48:33.687
- I'll clean it for you. - Forget it.

692
00:49:03.656 --> 00:49:04.756
Hello.

693
00:49:09.486 --> 00:49:10.696
Over here.

694
00:49:14.827 --> 00:49:16.497
How are you?

695
00:49:17.267 --> 00:49:19.336
What are you doing here?

696
00:49:19.336 --> 00:49:21.566
It's my lunch break, so I came to...

697
00:49:21.566 --> 00:49:23.077
look around and see Ji An.

698
00:49:23.077 --> 00:49:25.307
She arranged all this, right?

699
00:49:25.437 --> 00:49:26.546
Yes.

700
00:49:27.647 --> 00:49:29.577
Where is my sister?

701
00:49:29.577 --> 00:49:31.716
I don't have long to talk to her.

702
00:49:32.446 --> 00:49:34.017
Do you have something to say?

703
00:49:34.017 --> 00:49:37.517
Yes. I became a baker's apprentice.

704
00:49:37.517 --> 00:49:39.187
He makes a great dough,

705
00:49:39.187 --> 00:49:41.156
and he never wanted to teach anyone,

706
00:49:41.156 --> 00:49:42.856
but he picked me.

707
00:49:44.097 --> 00:49:45.497
I see.

708
00:49:45.497 --> 00:49:47.296
Ji An would love to hear this.

709
00:49:47.296 --> 00:49:48.767
I wanted to tell her in person.

710
00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:50.037
Why isn't she here?

711
00:49:50.037 --> 00:49:51.667
She was worried that I always...

712
00:49:51.667 --> 00:49:54.336
work part-time and don't care about my future.

713
00:49:54.637 --> 00:49:56.207
You can't surprise her.

714
00:49:56.506 --> 00:49:58.876
She isn't here. She's out on business.

715
00:49:58.876 --> 00:50:00.276
She'll be gone a while.

716
00:50:00.347 --> 00:50:01.747
Oh, really?

717
00:50:02.106 --> 00:50:03.716
I should've called ahead.

718
00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:06.546
I'll tell her you were here.

719
00:50:06.716 --> 00:50:09.387
Tell her I became an apprentice then.

720
00:50:09.387 --> 00:50:12.017
I will. I'm heading out to see someone.

721
00:50:12.017 --> 00:50:13.287
I'll get you a taxi.

722
00:50:13.287 --> 00:50:14.327
Let's go outside.

723
00:50:14.327 --> 00:50:16.557
Ji An's brother's seeing me off.

724
00:50:17.296 --> 00:50:18.327
Let's go.

725
00:50:18.397 --> 00:50:20.026
- Come along. - Okay.

726
00:50:26.097 --> 00:50:27.606
It's really nice here.

727
00:50:39.617 --> 00:50:42.647
(Myung Shin)

728
00:50:46.187 --> 00:50:47.856
So what, you hid?

729
00:50:50.626 --> 00:50:53.126
I couldn't face her like I used to.

730
00:50:55.897 --> 00:50:58.667
Seeing the VP with her...

731
00:51:00.236 --> 00:51:01.367
made me feel...

732
00:51:01.836 --> 00:51:04.477
as if someone was strangling me.

733
00:51:06.747 --> 00:51:08.207
It's just a few more days.

734
00:51:09.716 --> 00:51:11.946
Your VP told you to wait until...

735
00:51:11.946 --> 00:51:13.417
the event's over.

736
00:51:14.847 --> 00:51:17.756
That's him looking out for me.

737
00:51:19.756 --> 00:51:21.327
He must feel...

738
00:51:22.356 --> 00:51:24.526
so frustrated when he sees Ji Soo.

739
00:51:24.526 --> 00:51:27.026
You shouldn't be worried about him.

740
00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:29.296
You have four days left.

741
00:51:30.037 --> 00:51:32.796
Just thinking of that...

742
00:51:32.796 --> 00:51:35.236
makes my heart beat faster.

743
00:51:36.477 --> 00:51:40.347
I deserve to be punished, so I'll take it.

744
00:51:42.546 --> 00:51:45.847
(Ms. No)

745
00:51:48.446 --> 00:51:49.957
It's his mother.

746
00:51:59.057 --> 00:52:00.066
Hello?

747
00:52:00.767 --> 00:52:02.426
You're with someone?

748
00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:04.037
Then just listen.

749
00:52:04.937 --> 00:52:05.997
After the event,

750
00:52:05.997 --> 00:52:09.207
let's have a meal with Mr. Seo and Ms. Yang.

751
00:52:09.776 --> 00:52:10.807
Pardon?

752
00:52:12.006 --> 00:52:13.446
You worked so hard...

753
00:52:13.446 --> 00:52:15.207
to become our daughter.

754
00:52:15.207 --> 00:52:16.617
It's a reward.

755
00:52:18.017 --> 00:52:20.586
You lived with them for 25 years.

756
00:52:20.586 --> 00:52:22.617
I wasn't going to make you cut ties with them.

757
00:52:23.787 --> 00:52:26.526
But you'll meet them as my daughter.

758
00:52:30.926 --> 00:52:33.426
Hello? Eun Seok.

759
00:52:34.497 --> 00:52:35.526
I will...

760
00:52:38.066 --> 00:52:40.537
talk to you at home this evening.

761
00:52:41.707 --> 00:52:43.336
Will you come home today?

762
00:52:46.077 --> 00:52:48.307
Yes. I'd like to...

763
00:52:50.647 --> 00:52:51.676
Could I...

764
00:52:52.847 --> 00:52:54.787
see you both this evening?

765
00:52:55.847 --> 00:52:57.057
Will you both...

766
00:52:57.057 --> 00:52:58.656
be at home?

767
00:52:59.057 --> 00:53:01.656
Yes. Your father doesn't have dinner plans.

768
00:53:01.656 --> 00:53:02.957
He'll be home early.

769
00:53:04.327 --> 00:53:05.327
Okay.

770
00:53:06.667 --> 00:53:08.227
I'll see you later.

771
00:53:23.276 --> 00:53:24.446
Welcome home.

772
00:53:24.446 --> 00:53:25.577
How was the trip?

773
00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:27.787
I'm tired after the long flight.

774
00:53:27.787 --> 00:53:29.347
You did well.

775
00:53:29.347 --> 00:53:30.557
Hello.

776
00:53:30.756 --> 00:53:31.856
You didn't suffer at all.

777
00:53:31.856 --> 00:53:33.986
Your faces are so glossy.

778
00:53:34.756 --> 00:53:36.256
We should both bow.

779
00:53:36.256 --> 00:53:38.196
Forget that old custom.

780
00:53:38.196 --> 00:53:40.296
Get changed so we can eat.

781
00:53:40.296 --> 00:53:41.426
Go upstairs,

782
00:53:41.426 --> 00:53:43.167
leave your things, and change.

783
00:53:43.167 --> 00:53:45.566
Okay then. I'll carry this.

784
00:53:53.477 --> 00:53:54.977
It's your sister's present.

785
00:53:55.376 --> 00:53:56.716
It's nicer than the photo.

786
00:53:57.917 --> 00:53:59.577
The room's nice too.

787
00:54:00.486 --> 00:54:03.486
My favorite feature in the room is you.

788
00:54:04.387 --> 00:54:06.086
You're two-faced.

789
00:54:06.327 --> 00:54:08.526
You used to play hard to get before.

790
00:54:08.526 --> 00:54:10.457
Marriage has changed you.

791
00:54:10.756 --> 00:54:12.827
I didn't think I'd end up like this.

792
00:54:12.827 --> 00:54:14.267
I'm confused myself.

793
00:54:17.437 --> 00:54:19.597
We should've focused on us.

794
00:54:20.006 --> 00:54:21.506
We thought too much.

795
00:54:23.077 --> 00:54:24.176
It's not that.

796
00:54:25.336 --> 00:54:27.606
My reality was a helpless case.

797
00:54:28.376 --> 00:54:29.776
You just have to...

798
00:54:29.917 --> 00:54:33.316
stick to your promise of being my best friend.

799
00:54:34.417 --> 00:54:36.216
Just your best friend?

800
00:54:36.316 --> 00:54:37.816
Husband, brother,

801
00:54:37.816 --> 00:54:40.287
what else? Surrogate father-in-law.

802
00:54:40.287 --> 00:54:42.057
I'll be your dad too.

803
00:54:43.097 --> 00:54:46.057
I'll just be a girlfriend-like wife.

804
00:54:46.626 --> 00:54:48.696
Don't expect a mom-like wife.

805
00:54:48.926 --> 00:54:51.397
Who would like that?

806
00:54:51.397 --> 00:54:52.466
Don't.

807
00:54:52.466 --> 00:54:54.167
We have to get changed.

808
00:54:54.167 --> 00:54:55.207
Okay.

809
00:55:00.046 --> 00:55:02.207
(Seo Ji An)

810
00:55:08.917 --> 00:55:09.917
Yes?

811
00:55:09.917 --> 00:55:13.227
Could I see you for a second?

812
00:55:13.227 --> 00:55:15.057
I have something to say.

813
00:55:15.856 --> 00:55:17.227
What is it?

814
00:55:17.356 --> 00:55:18.597
Say it now.

815
00:55:19.097 --> 00:55:20.926
We have to speak in person.

816
00:55:24.537 --> 00:55:25.637
Okay.

817
00:55:26.196 --> 00:55:27.836
Remember the membership restaurant?

818
00:55:29.006 --> 00:55:30.077
See you there.

819
00:55:30.276 --> 00:55:31.876
Okay, I will.

820
00:55:40.347 --> 00:55:42.247
(Letter of Resignation)

821
00:56:17.086 --> 00:56:18.617
Help me.

822
00:56:19.517 --> 00:56:21.656
When I tell your parents today,

823
00:56:22.086 --> 00:56:24.397
I'd like you to be there with me.

824
00:56:24.626 --> 00:56:26.256
That's my last favor.

825
00:56:31.167 --> 00:56:32.367
Help me.

826
00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:52.256
I ordered the coffees.

827
00:56:52.917 --> 00:56:54.856
I didn't want to be disturbed.

828
00:56:56.086 --> 00:56:57.156
Okay.

829
00:56:57.597 --> 00:57:01.296
Before you begin, I have something to say.

830
00:57:02.566 --> 00:57:03.637
Okay.

831
00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:08.606
First of all.

832
00:57:11.376 --> 00:57:13.077
I'll return your phone.

833
00:57:13.977 --> 00:57:15.046
Why...

834
00:57:15.906 --> 00:57:18.617
do you have it?

835
00:57:18.747 --> 00:57:21.417
I followed you in case the 20,000 dollars...

836
00:57:22.347 --> 00:57:23.656
involved a man.

837
00:57:24.417 --> 00:57:26.426
Mom didn't want anyone else to know.

838
00:57:29.656 --> 00:57:31.126
So I followed you.

839
00:57:35.097 --> 00:57:38.537
You ran off, not knowing you'd lost your phone.

840
00:57:39.537 --> 00:57:41.006
Was he Sunwoo Hyuk?

841
00:57:41.466 --> 00:57:43.336
I saw you with him.

842
00:57:43.707 --> 00:57:45.876
Sorry, it's my sister's.

843
00:57:48.406 --> 00:57:50.716
I saw you two entering a cafe.

844
00:57:59.656 --> 00:58:01.426
Suffer for a while.

845
00:58:02.756 --> 00:58:03.796
At the time,

846
00:58:04.656 --> 00:58:07.167
I took it to spite your carelessness.

847
00:58:08.097 --> 00:58:10.397
Mom wanted you to leave your past behind,

848
00:58:11.066 --> 00:58:12.367
so I kept it.

849
00:58:13.867 --> 00:58:15.037
You're so...

850
00:58:16.577 --> 00:58:17.937
unbelievable.

851
00:58:18.176 --> 00:58:20.347
It's too awkward to apologize,

852
00:58:20.876 --> 00:58:22.006
so let's let it go.

853
00:58:23.017 --> 00:58:25.046
You know how we do things now.

854
00:58:26.247 --> 00:58:28.647
I'll return it because I don't need to keep it.

855
00:58:30.756 --> 00:58:32.557
I'm not exactly pleased,

856
00:58:34.256 --> 00:58:36.426
but I'm in no position to complain.

857
00:58:36.997 --> 00:58:38.397
I'll take it.

858
00:58:40.796 --> 00:58:42.626
I found you another job.

859
00:58:44.566 --> 00:58:45.767
After the event,

860
00:58:46.196 --> 00:58:48.137
you can no longer work at Haesung.

861
00:58:49.006 --> 00:58:51.207
You found me a job?

862
00:58:51.836 --> 00:58:53.606
Eunseng Corporation's Marketing Team.

863
00:58:54.707 --> 00:58:56.477
It's a bigger company than Haesung Apparel.

864
00:58:57.517 --> 00:58:59.887
I won't work at Haesung Apparel.

865
00:59:00.847 --> 00:59:02.417
Or at Eunseng Corporation.

866
00:59:04.316 --> 00:59:05.687
Do you think I want...

867
00:59:06.626 --> 00:59:08.926
a job I got for a favor?

868
00:59:09.287 --> 00:59:10.526
You said you have no plans.

869
00:59:11.497 --> 00:59:13.397
So I went out of the way to help you.

870
00:59:15.767 --> 00:59:16.997
No thanks.

871
00:59:17.097 --> 00:59:19.236
I'm not giving you what you don't deserve.

872
00:59:19.807 --> 00:59:21.106
You're more than capable.

873
00:59:21.106 --> 00:59:22.336
Please, stop.

874
00:59:23.406 --> 00:59:25.937
That's not the help I need right now.

875
00:59:25.937 --> 00:59:27.747
Then what help do you need?

876
00:59:28.446 --> 00:59:31.776
Aren't you in no position to care about pride?

877
00:59:33.546 --> 00:59:34.816
Pride?

878
00:59:34.986 --> 00:59:36.716
Are you that short-sighted?

879
00:59:37.656 --> 00:59:39.486
Do you only care for your parents?

880
00:59:40.287 --> 00:59:41.586
Don't you care what'll happen...

881
00:59:41.586 --> 00:59:42.887
after you come clean?

882
00:59:43.327 --> 00:59:46.397
Why are you so foolish? I got you another job.

883
00:59:46.397 --> 00:59:48.997
I need consideration, not pity.

884
00:59:48.997 --> 00:59:51.196
That's up to the one giving the favor.

885
00:59:52.367 --> 00:59:54.537
The recipient doesn't have a choice.

886
00:59:55.836 --> 00:59:56.906
Why...

887
00:59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.046
would you say that?

888
01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:03.077
What do you mean?

889
01:00:03.276 --> 01:00:04.617
You sound charitable.

890
01:00:05.546 --> 01:00:08.517
As if you're doing this out of pity for me.

891
01:00:10.517 --> 01:00:13.057
Isn't it cowardice to put it like that?

892
01:00:13.926 --> 01:00:15.156
Cowardice?

893
01:00:15.926 --> 01:00:17.957
Say it's because you care for me.

894
01:00:17.957 --> 01:00:19.296
Can't you even say that?

895
01:00:22.727 --> 01:00:23.897
Must you...

896
01:00:26.137 --> 01:00:27.336
distance yourself?

897
01:00:30.676 --> 01:00:33.546
After all the time we spent together?

898
01:00:36.446 --> 01:00:37.647
You don't have to...

899
01:00:39.747 --> 01:00:42.046
be so forceful and demeaning.

900
01:00:45.656 --> 01:00:46.756
Yes.

901
01:00:48.156 --> 01:00:49.526
I care for you.

902
01:00:51.827 --> 01:00:53.597
But why should I admit to that?

903
01:00:55.066 --> 01:00:57.466
Why do you care? Why do you want to know?

904
01:01:00.037 --> 01:01:02.006
What can I do for you?

905
01:01:03.707 --> 01:01:04.776
What...

906
01:01:05.876 --> 01:01:07.376
do you want from me?

907
01:01:10.176 --> 01:01:11.776
What I want...

908
01:01:13.747 --> 01:01:15.446
- is for you... - You and I...

909
01:01:16.917 --> 01:01:18.117
have different paths.

910
01:01:20.026 --> 01:01:21.986
You stayed with us long enough to know that.

911
01:01:23.626 --> 01:01:25.356
What do you expect of me?

912
01:01:26.097 --> 01:01:27.796
Why do you look at me like that?

913
01:01:28.526 --> 01:01:31.566
What are you? Why? Because we kissed?

914
01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:34.566
Yes.

915
01:01:35.506 --> 01:01:37.537
I felt attracted, and I kissed you.

916
01:01:37.807 --> 01:01:39.906
So what? A kiss?

917
01:01:39.977 --> 01:01:42.477
I can kiss you 100 times. I could sleep with you.

918
01:01:43.647 --> 01:01:45.847
What can't I do? You aren't my sister.

919
01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.356
But that's all it can be.

920
01:01:53.986 --> 01:01:55.756
However much I like you.

921
01:02:00.696 --> 01:02:03.196
If you say that right now...

922
01:02:09.037 --> 01:02:10.106
I must...

923
01:02:11.906 --> 01:02:13.647
marry Jang So Ra.

924
01:02:14.006 --> 01:02:15.176
No, I will marry her.

925
01:02:16.477 --> 01:02:17.676
So...

926
01:02:18.477 --> 01:02:20.887
you live a life that suits you.

927
01:02:21.716 --> 01:02:23.656
I'll go on living mine.

928
01:02:26.426 --> 01:02:27.486
So...

929
01:02:29.586 --> 01:02:31.296
don't expect anything from me.

930
01:02:34.466 --> 01:02:36.026
What can I do for you?

931
01:02:38.736 --> 01:02:39.867
I'll see that...

932
01:02:41.006 --> 01:02:42.707
your parents don't...

933
01:02:44.807 --> 01:02:46.137
end up being sued.

934
01:02:51.676 --> 01:02:52.776
I have to go.

941
01:05:06.716 --> 01:05:09.917
What took you so long? We had dinner without you.

942
01:05:11.256 --> 01:05:12.517
I apologize.

943
01:05:13.457 --> 01:05:14.626
Sit.

944
01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:16.497
Okay.

945
01:05:22.426 --> 01:05:25.296
What were you trying to say to Eun Seok?

946
01:05:30.077 --> 01:05:32.106
He said he has something to say to you.

947
01:05:32.106 --> 01:05:34.006
He didn't even tell me what it is.

948
01:05:34.006 --> 01:05:35.847
He told me to wait until you're home.

949
01:05:40.046 --> 01:05:41.216
Eun Seok.

950
01:05:43.787 --> 01:05:44.887
Yes.

951
01:05:47.387 --> 01:05:48.626
Did you just say yes?

952
01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:53.727
Are you really Choi Eun Seok?

953
01:05:57.437 --> 01:05:59.196
What's wrong with you?

954
01:05:59.196 --> 01:06:01.137
She's your daughter.

How dare you!

960
01:07:05.367 --> 01:07:07.406
Where's my daughter? Bring my daughter.

961
01:07:07.406 --> 01:07:09.307
How could you do this to me?

962
01:07:09.307 --> 01:07:12.037
Ji An is your daughter?

That's not why.

964
01:07:13.207 --> 01:07:15.446
Then why did you send Ji An to them?

965
01:07:15.446 --> 01:07:16.647
You knew?

966
01:07:16.647 --> 01:07:18.577
I was going to tell you...

967
01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:20.446
How could you...

968
01:07:20.446 --> 01:07:22.387
