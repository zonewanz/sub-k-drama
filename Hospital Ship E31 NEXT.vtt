(Episode 31)

2
00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:23.074
Don't try so hard. You can take things easy.

3
00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:24.344
Okay.

4
00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:30.524
Doctor Kwak.

5
00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:32.284
Oh, Ms. Lee.

6
00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.825
This must be hard for you.

7
00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:37.064
Not at all.

8
00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:40.235
Hyun, I'm going to get some water.

9
00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:42.265
Excuse me.

10
00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:47.875
Your mother is beautiful.

11
00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:52.274
You're doing great.

12
00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:54.714
I want to get discharged soon.

13
00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:57.344
Why? What do you want to do so badly?

14
00:00:57.644 --> 00:00:59.045
Treat patients?

15
00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:02.115
I'm the only internal medicine doctor on the hospital ship.

16
00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:07.554
Goodness. You're all the same. You're workaholics.

17
00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:11.995
Let me see your wound now.

18
00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:13.594
Doctor Oh checked on me earlier.

19
00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:16.495
- Did he say it looks good? - Of course.

20
00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:18.965
I'm sure he did considering who did your surgery.

21
00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:21.004
Did you check your wound?

22
00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:22.974
Did she stitch it up nicely?

23
00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:26.545
No, it was sloppy and crooked.

24
00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.185
Why haven't I seen Doctor Song?

25
00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:32.614
She's my surgeon. Shouldn't she be on rounds at least?

26
00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:36.385
Why does she keep sending Doctor Oh as her substitute?

27
00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:38.224
Who said Doctor Oh was a substitute?

28
00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:42.795
Doctor Song handed over your case to Doctor Oh.

29
00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:45.965
- Why? - I'm not sure. She said she's busy.

30
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.795
Is she too busy to work at the ER?

31
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.295
No, she still works at the ER.

32
00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.135
She still works at the ER,

33
00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:52.465
but she hasn't come to see me?

34
00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:55.034
- She hasn't come to see you at all? - No.

35
00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:58.875
I guess she's seriously mad at you.

36
00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:02.015
- Mad at me? - Jae Geol said...

37
00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:05.644
Doctor Song doesn't even consider you as her colleague anymore.

38
00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:09.084
Did you do something to make her upset?

39
00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:15.454
If not, why wouldn't she come to see you?

40
00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:19.364
Think about what you might have done wrong.

41
00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:21.695
I'll be going now.

42
00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:04.845
Hi, this is Kwak Hyun.

43
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.644
Oh, my. I'm surprised to get your call so soon.

44
00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:09.874
I heard you were badly injured.

45
00:03:10.084 --> 00:03:11.714
No, I'm fine.

46
00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:13.885
I feel much better now.

47
00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:16.214
I'm glad to hear that.

48
00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:17.725
How is Father?

49
00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:19.825
I haven't contacted him.

50
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:21.195
Don't worry.

51
00:03:21.454 --> 00:03:23.565
Someone else is taking good care of him.

52
00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:26.024
Someone else?

53
00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:40.075
It's over there.

54
00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:42.374
Do you see the lighthouse?

55
00:03:42.374 --> 00:03:44.885
They seemed so close.

56
00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.614
- They're like father and daughter. - I see it.

57
00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:35.915
Are you okay?

58
00:06:36.884 --> 00:06:37.924
Are you...

59
00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:43.895
hurt anywhere?

60
00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:16.684
There you go.

61
00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:25.525
Who is it?

62
00:08:25.525 --> 00:08:27.134
It's just...

63
00:08:28.264 --> 00:08:29.295
Ji Eun.

64
00:08:29.764 --> 00:08:31.434
Tell her not to worry.

65
00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:34.335
Okay.

66
00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:43.845
Hello?

67
00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:44.845
Hello.

68
00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:46.514
This is Young Eun.

69
00:08:46.784 --> 00:08:47.784
Yes?

70
00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:50.254
May I see you?

71
00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:53.624
You ran away from me last time.

72
00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:55.325
What do you want now?

73
00:08:57.595 --> 00:08:58.725
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:01.534
Where are you?

75
00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:20.614
How are you?

76
00:09:20.614 --> 00:09:22.254
I'm not a psychopath.

77
00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:26.185
My son was shot. Of course I'm not well.

78
00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:29.195
That's not what I meant.

79
00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:31.494
I know. Sit down.

80
00:09:36.134 --> 00:09:37.835
Why are you still standing?

81
00:09:38.065 --> 00:09:40.004
The roof won't collapse. Sit down.

82
00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:45.975
Go on.

83
00:09:46.675 --> 00:09:49.044
- Pardon me? - What do you want to say?

84
00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:52.185
How is...

85
00:09:53.114 --> 00:09:54.185
Hyun?

86
00:09:54.715 --> 00:09:56.154
Is he doing better?

87
00:09:58.225 --> 00:09:59.455
He's getting better.

88
00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:02.494
I'm relieved to hear that.

89
00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:10.864
By the way,

90
00:10:12.105 --> 00:10:14.004
I'm going to New York soon.

91
00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:16.705
Once I leave,

92
00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.845
I won't come back if possible.

93
00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:23.414
Please don't tell Hyun...

94
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.585
The reason why you're leaving?

95
00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:29.784
Could you do that for me?

96
00:10:40.664 --> 00:10:42.634
Fine, I will.

97
00:10:44.235 --> 00:10:47.235
There's no point in destroying you.

98
00:10:48.675 --> 00:10:50.904
You don't look good at all.

99
00:10:51.845 --> 00:10:53.144
You couldn't eat or sleep?

100
00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:56.784
That's unnecessary.

101
00:10:57.384 --> 00:10:58.815
What's the big deal about love?

102
00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:03.254
It's been very hard,

103
00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:05.055
hasn't it?

104
00:11:08.325 --> 00:11:10.595
No matter how hard you tried...

105
00:11:11.124 --> 00:11:13.494
to mend your love, did it not work?

106
00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:18.164
That's how men are in my family.

107
00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:22.034
They may be gentle and forgiving.

108
00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:24.004
But beyond a certain point,

109
00:11:25.175 --> 00:11:27.514
they turn coldhearted and do nothing.

110
00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:30.845
You should have waited.

111
00:11:31.744 --> 00:11:34.715
He was busy with his residency and taking care of his father.

112
00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:37.124
He didn't have time.

113
00:11:40.294 --> 00:11:42.524
Why weren't you easier on him?

114
00:11:43.465 --> 00:11:44.764
Then...

115
00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:50.465
Hyun would still be with you.

116
00:12:15.124 --> 00:12:16.154
You are...

117
00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:18.024
really here.

118
00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:21.264
Doctor Kim Jae Geol.

119
00:12:22.494 --> 00:12:25.105
He told me that you'd be here.

120
00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:30.575
What brings you here?

121
00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:33.075
I heard...

122
00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:34.644
what happened.

123
00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:36.985
You did...

124
00:12:38.914 --> 00:12:40.315
Hyun's operation.

125
00:12:44.725 --> 00:12:45.784
I envy you.

126
00:12:48.154 --> 00:12:49.725
You are capable...

127
00:12:52.565 --> 00:12:54.335
of doing so many things...

128
00:12:55.595 --> 00:12:56.864
for Hyun.

129
00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.805
It was better...

130
00:13:00.835 --> 00:13:02.274
if I never had to do it.

131
00:13:07.644 --> 00:13:08.675
This is for you.

132
00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.244
It's to express my gratitude.

133
00:13:20.095 --> 00:13:21.624
You might think...

134
00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:26.894
I'm useless, childish, and not worth knowing,

135
00:13:27.664 --> 00:13:29.164
but actually...

136
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.504
what I'm most grateful to you about...

137
00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:37.274
is that you didn't tell Hyun...

138
00:13:39.075 --> 00:13:41.815
about my lie to the very end.

139
00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:44.085
You made it...

140
00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:47.384
possible for me to leave...

141
00:13:49.784 --> 00:13:51.654
with my self-esteem intact.

142
00:13:55.394 --> 00:13:57.195
That's what pleased me.

143
00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:01.494
I'm so terrible, aren't I?

144
00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:06.565
No. That's perfectly plausible.

145
00:14:06.874 --> 00:14:08.034
I understand.

146
00:14:11.605 --> 00:14:13.004
Thank you.

147
00:14:15.075 --> 00:14:18.644
Take good care of Hyun for me.

148

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

149
00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:32.414
Sorry for calling so late.

150
00:16:32.414 --> 00:16:34.914
I'm the hospital ship Internal Medicine doctor Kwak Hyun.

151
00:16:40.494 --> 00:16:42.355
(Blood test scheduled)

152
00:16:54.374 --> 00:16:56.675
Is this Ms. Mo Mak Jeom's number?

153
00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:01.445
She has a blood test scheduled, but the ship can't get there.

154
00:17:01.445 --> 00:17:03.485
(Blood test scheduled)

(Blood sugar check)

156

Is this Ms. Nam Wol Ran?

157
00:17:18.564 --> 00:17:22.264
She has to go to the local clinic to get her blood sugar tested.

158
00:17:22.764 --> 00:17:23.804
Okay, bye.

159
00:17:31.844 --> 00:17:34.415
Are you Park Joong Dan's guardian?

160
00:17:35.344 --> 00:17:37.584
The hospital ship can't sail tomorrow.

161
00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:40.754
The doctor prescribed the hyperlipidemia medication.

162
00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:43.215
We'll send it to you via the ferry.

163
00:17:51.024 --> 00:17:52.365
(Check via phone)

164
00:17:55.764 --> 00:17:57.804
Are you Mr. Go Gab Dong?

165
00:17:59.334 --> 00:18:00.475
Yes.

166
00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:04.705
You finished your medicine.

167
00:18:05.445 --> 00:18:07.544
The hospital ship can't sail.

168
00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:09.344
We'll send you...

169
00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:12.215
three days' worth of medicine via the ferry.

00:19:12.675 --> 00:19:14.074
- You're back. - Welcome.

173
00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:15.715
A hearty welcome!

174
00:19:15.715 --> 00:19:18.244
- How are you? - Are you okay?

175
00:19:18.244 --> 00:19:19.945
I wasn't the only one to get hurt.

176
00:19:19.945 --> 00:19:21.685
We're preparing lunch.

177
00:19:21.685 --> 00:19:24.155
Look forward to trying Mr. Chu's specialty.

178
00:19:24.155 --> 00:19:25.885
This meal is on me.

179
00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:28.024
- Yes! - Yes!

180
00:19:28.955 --> 00:19:31.024
Did you catch it yourself?

181
00:19:31.024 --> 00:19:33.094
- Get the cutlery. - Don't ask.

182
00:19:33.594 --> 00:19:35.195
It must be so delicious.

183
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:36.834
You look upset.

184
00:19:37.804 --> 00:19:38.965
I'm not.

185
00:19:39.965 --> 00:19:42.774
Are you not happy that Doctor Song's not here?

186
00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:46.405
Where is she?

187
00:19:48.044 --> 00:19:49.415
Where do you think?

188
00:20:24.084 --> 00:20:25.215
Yes.

189
00:20:27.284 --> 00:20:28.955
Via the ferry.

190
00:20:29.784 --> 00:20:33.024
No, the 3:30pm one.

191
00:20:34.254 --> 00:20:37.225
3:30pm. Ferry.

192
00:20:37.895 --> 00:20:42.534
There are a few others. I'll call the clinic's doctor.

193
00:20:43.705 --> 00:20:44.804
Bye.

194
00:20:48.504 --> 00:20:50.544
Why are there so many?

195
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.615
He didn't skip a single island.

196
00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:56.475
How can he not forget a single one?

197
00:21:04.284 --> 00:21:06.554
What are you doing in my office?

198
00:21:07.695 --> 00:21:08.925
Hello.

199
00:21:09.994 --> 00:21:12.994
I was really upset that you didn't come to see me even once.

200
00:21:14.135 --> 00:21:17.104
Were you here looking after my patients for me?

201
00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:19.334
And cleaning up?

202
00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:22.235
I haven't called all of them yet.

203
00:21:22.235 --> 00:21:25.004
You have way too many patients.

204
00:21:31.885 --> 00:21:33.044
Here.

205
00:21:34.784 --> 00:21:37.584
- What is it? - Open it.

206
00:21:43.425 --> 00:21:44.794
It's a stethoscope.

207
00:21:46.994 --> 00:21:49.294
I managed to put everything else back together,

208
00:21:49.494 --> 00:21:51.865
but your old one was beyond fixing.

209
00:21:51.865 --> 00:21:54.334
It's a nice model.

210
00:21:54.435 --> 00:21:55.905
I spent a fortune.

211
00:21:57.504 --> 00:22:00.774
A heart specialist should have a good stethoscope.

212
00:22:03.445 --> 00:22:04.814
Congratulations on your discharge.

213
00:22:04.814 --> 00:22:07.784
I'll let you take care of the rest.

214
00:22:12.084 --> 00:22:13.695
Didn't you miss me?

215
00:22:16.925 --> 00:22:18.665
No, that was...

216
00:22:18.665 --> 00:22:20.635
Why won't you even look at me?

217
00:22:26.064 --> 00:22:28.135
- Are you sick? - No.

218
00:22:49.655 --> 00:22:50.965
You are sick.

219
00:22:53.564 --> 00:22:55.794
As a heart specialist, my diagnosis...

220
00:22:55.994 --> 00:22:59.665
is that your heart rate is beyond the normal range.

221
00:23:04.475 --> 00:23:06.044
This heart.

222
00:23:09.715 --> 00:23:11.485
Who is it beating for?

223
00:23:24.395 --> 00:23:25.594
Shall we start dating?

224
00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:30.665
Let's...

225
00:23:32.665 --> 00:23:34.034
start dating.

226
00:24:43.074 --> 00:24:44.304
Let's go.

227
00:24:54.554 --> 00:24:56.054
This is the captain speaking.

228
00:24:56.254 --> 00:24:59.824
We've finally finished repairing everything.

229
00:24:59.824 --> 00:25:03.695
We're going to set sail again today.

230
00:25:04.195 --> 00:25:07.935
Our hospital ship is the lifeline of the residents of the island.

231
00:25:07.935 --> 00:25:09.465
For safe sailing,

232
00:25:09.594 --> 00:25:13.034
everyone in the medical team and the crewman,

233
00:25:13.034 --> 00:25:15.875
please do your very best.

234
00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:20.314
I'm so happy that I want to sing right now,

235
00:25:20.574 --> 00:25:22.945
but for safety reasons,

236
00:25:22.945 --> 00:25:25.685
I will drop it.

237
00:25:27.385 --> 00:25:29.955
Did you just tell me to remove Surgery from the hospital ship?

238
00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:33.455
Wait. My goodness.

239
00:25:33.494 --> 00:25:36.395
Get rid of Surgery? We cannot do that.

240
00:25:36.395 --> 00:25:37.865
If you don't,

241
00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:39.824
we might have to get rid of the hospital ship itself.

242
00:25:39.824 --> 00:25:42.264
- Sir. - You know that...

243
00:25:44.034 --> 00:25:45.405
we have a new governor now, right?

244
00:25:47.135 --> 00:25:48.675
As you probably expected,

245
00:25:48.675 --> 00:25:50.604
things are totally different now.

246
00:25:50.604 --> 00:25:53.344
There is a big fuss about cutting public expenditure.

247
00:25:53.344 --> 00:25:55.975
We're not wasting any expenditure on the hospital ship.

248
00:25:55.975 --> 00:25:58.744
Our doctors are very thrifty. They don't waste any equipment.

249
00:25:58.744 --> 00:26:01.385
The governor says the hospital ship is the biggest waste of money.

250
00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:04.385
- Why is that? - Because it's all for free.

251
00:26:04.685 --> 00:26:06.925
You treat patients, make house calls, and provide medicine.

252
00:26:06.925 --> 00:26:10.024
Above all, you even do surgeries for free.

253
00:26:10.524 --> 00:26:13.965
The governor will bite my head off if I can't stop it immediately.

254
00:26:13.965 --> 00:26:15.965
We only do surgeries when we have emergencies.

255
00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:18.304
Patients might die if they don't get the surgery,

256
00:26:18.304 --> 00:26:20.235
so we did it to save their lives.

257
00:26:20.504 --> 00:26:22.405
Our service on the hospital ship is supposed to be free.

258
00:26:22.405 --> 00:26:23.905
That's why we didn't charge them.

259
00:26:23.905 --> 00:26:26.604
I'm saying it can't be free anymore!

260
00:26:28.244 --> 00:26:30.445
Emergency service system is getting better.

261
00:26:30.445 --> 00:26:32.215
Let them take the emergency patients now.

262
00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:34.715
The government provides transportation to the hospital,

263
00:26:34.915 --> 00:26:38.084
so let them pay for their own surgeries.

264
00:26:38.084 --> 00:26:41.354
We would do that if we could, but this is...

265
00:26:41.354 --> 00:26:43.324
Stop talking, and do as I say!

266
00:26:43.324 --> 00:26:44.465
Sir!

267
00:26:47.865 --> 00:26:50.665
I'm telling you this beforehand...

268
00:26:50.665 --> 00:26:53.034
because I've known you for a long time.

269
00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:56.435
Don't make things worse.

270
00:26:56.435 --> 00:26:59.304
Discuss with Captain Bang and settle it quietly.

271
00:26:59.304 --> 00:27:01.675
Frankly, it's not like Doctor Song Eun Jae is...

272
00:27:01.774 --> 00:27:04.945
staying in the hospital ship because she has nowhere else to go.

273
00:27:05.215 --> 00:27:07.554
- My gosh. Move! - Sir!

274
00:27:07.554 --> 00:27:08.655
Darn it.

275
00:27:14.324 --> 00:27:15.794
What should I do now?

276
00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:47.955
What? Really?

277
00:27:48.395 --> 00:27:50.024
Was he that obstinate?

278
00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:53.125
It doesn't look like they will just let this slide.

279
00:27:53.695 --> 00:27:55.064
I understand.

280
00:27:55.834 --> 00:27:59.365
There wouldn't be no passenger ships at this hour,

281
00:27:59.534 --> 00:28:01.705
so get some rest at the dormitory.

282
00:28:01.905 --> 00:28:05.175
I'll meet you there as soon as we sail back.

283
00:28:07.375 --> 00:28:08.645
Is everything okay?

284
00:28:08.744 --> 00:28:10.685
Who went to the district office, and why?

285
00:28:11.514 --> 00:28:14.554
It's nothing serious. Don't mind it.

286
00:28:15.685 --> 00:28:20.695
Goodness, why does the sea fog keep getting thicker?

287
00:28:21.054 --> 00:28:24.925
It's so frustrating. I can't even see an inch ahead.

288
00:28:25.494 --> 00:28:27.435
My gosh.

289
00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:42.175
- Are you tired? - A little.

290
00:28:42.344 --> 00:28:43.615
Were there a lot of patients?

291
00:28:44.685 --> 00:28:47.885
Two fishing boats crashed because of the sea fog,

292
00:28:48.514 --> 00:28:50.655
and there were many patients with lacerated wounds.

293
00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:52.784
I couldn't even have a minute to sit down.

294
00:28:56.324 --> 00:28:57.865
I want to give you a massage.

295
00:28:58.824 --> 00:29:00.094
A good one.

296
00:29:00.494 --> 00:29:02.764
- Are you serious? - Why can't I?

297
00:29:05.135 --> 00:29:09.175
I think we need detailed rules.

298
00:29:09.574 --> 00:29:12.304
- Rules? - We spend time as colleagues...

299
00:29:12.304 --> 00:29:14.115
And as a couple...

300
00:29:15.115 --> 00:29:16.985
Be quiet. Someone might hear you.

301
00:29:20.185 --> 00:29:21.615
Detailed rules?

302
00:29:23.725 --> 00:29:26.455
Fine. When do you want to set them up?

303
00:29:27.195 --> 00:29:28.395
How about Saturday?

304
00:29:28.925 --> 00:29:32.465
It's your day off from here and the hospital ER.

305
00:29:33.195 --> 00:29:34.465
Good.

306
00:29:37.135 --> 00:29:40.034
That'd be our first date as well.

307
00:29:40.334 --> 00:29:42.375
- Am I right? - I guess so.

308
00:29:42.675 --> 00:29:45.445
Look forward to it. I'll find a good place we can go.

309
00:29:45.445 --> 00:29:48.544
No. Leave it to me this time.

310
00:29:48.915 --> 00:29:50.385
I'll handle it.

311
00:29:52.244 --> 00:29:53.485
All right then.

312
00:29:55.885 --> 00:29:59.485
Doctor. Doctor!

313
00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:01.695
- Please sit down here. - Gosh.

314
00:30:01.695 --> 00:30:03.625
Where does it hurt?

315
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:06.264
My baby... I think my baby is coming out.

316
00:30:06.594 --> 00:30:07.935
My water broke.

317
00:30:07.935 --> 00:30:09.865
Let's move her inside first.

318
00:30:09.865 --> 00:30:12.604
Okay. Hang in there, ma'am.

319
00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:15.604
Her due date isn't for another month. Goodness.

320
00:30:15.604 --> 00:30:18.574
- Hang in there. - Oh, dear.

321
00:30:22.014 --> 00:30:23.175
Mom.

322
00:30:23.814 --> 00:30:26.244
- I'm here, Min Kyung. - Ma'am.

323
00:30:26.244 --> 00:30:28.854
- Please calm her down. - Ma'am, the doctors will see her.

324
00:30:28.854 --> 00:30:30.284
Please come with me.

325
00:30:30.284 --> 00:30:32.155
- I'll examine her first. - My dear daughter.

326
00:30:32.155 --> 00:30:35.195
Ma'am, keep breathing. Slowly.

327
00:30:35.195 --> 00:30:37.064
You're doing great. Keep going.

328
00:30:37.264 --> 00:30:39.225
Good. Keep breathing.

329
00:30:42.052 --> 00:30:44.352
(Episode 32 will air shortly.)
