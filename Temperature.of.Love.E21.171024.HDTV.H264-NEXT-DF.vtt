00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.732
Mr. Jung Seon.

3
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.295
Let me introduce you two
properly to each other.

4
00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:41.038
This is my most favorite man
in the whole world.

5
00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.687
And this is my most favorite
woman in the whole world.

6
00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.158
I didn't know we'd be
coming here, Mr. Jung Seon.

7
00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:06.797
I'll tell the staff
to bring you your dinner.

8
00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:11.280
Okay, sure.

9
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.953
I had made plans with Mr. Jung Seon,
but I cancelled on him because of you.

10
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.306
I told you last time...

11
00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:00.799
that there was a man I loved,
but that he disappeared.

12
00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.017
I met that man again recently.

13
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:10.293
That man is Mr. Jung Seon.

14
00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:15.073
I wanted to tell you sooner

15
00:02:15.073 --> 00:02:18.198
but it hasn't been long since
we started dating again.

16
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.187
Here are your mushroom tarts.

17
00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:50.389
<i>[Temperature of Love]</i>

18
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:53.359
Send out the root vegetable dishes
for tables 3 and 5 together.

19
00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.627
Yes, Chef!

20
00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:58.013
Chef!

21
00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:00.595
It's time for the guests on
the terrace to get their dessert.

22
00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.305
Did you see CEO Park's girlfriend?

23
00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.752
Take care of things here
for me, will you?

24
00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:39.497
<i>This is the ring I'm going
to propose with.</i>

25
00:03:39.497 --> 00:03:42.333
<i>Hold onto this for me,
and send it out with our dessert.</i>

26
00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:53.704
We're meeting Ms. Yoo Hye Jung
next week, right?

27
00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:56.388
Yeah, I told you that.

28
00:04:00.388 --> 00:04:02.830
And we're meeting her
at your office, right?

29
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.181
I feel like you feel as if
you need to talk to me.

30
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:07.732
Yes, exactly.

31
00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:11.272
Something just feels off.

32
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.939
This is a special cake.

33
00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:47.532
Is this the only thing
you have for me?

34
00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:50.729
Something is missing.

35
00:04:51.285 --> 00:04:52.917
Let's talk for a second.

36
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:56.724
Sure, let's do that.

37
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.943
Sit tight.

38
00:05:01.777 --> 00:05:03.179
Sure.

39
00:05:18.023 --> 00:05:21.121
<i>I'm sketching an idea for
a cake for a proposal.</i>

40
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.571
Oh, you're sketching it out
before you actually make it?

41
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:26.200
Yeah, because a dish's aesthetics
contributes to its taste, too.

42
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:37.489
What did you want to talk to me about
that you brought me to your place?

43
00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:38.712
Would you like some tea?

44
00:05:39.794 --> 00:05:41.633
If you want to serve
me some, then go ahead.

45
00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:08.982
<i>[Mom]</i>

46
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:14.290
Yeah, Mom?

47
00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:18.554
You sure have amazing timing, Mom.

48
00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:20.515
I just felt like calling you
all of the sudden.

49
00:06:20.515 --> 00:06:22.559
Did you want to see me just now?

50
00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:25.186
Yeah, I was thinking of you.

51
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.299
Are you at home?

52
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:31.503
No, I'm out for dinner, but the person
I'm eating with got up for a moment.

53
00:06:31.503 --> 00:06:33.552
Why would they get up
in the middle of a meal?

54
00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:35.727
That's so rude!

55
00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:38.570
No, it's not like that.

56
00:06:40.398 --> 00:06:42.241
At any rate, thanks, Mom.

57
00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.782
Okay.

58
00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:54.465
Mom is right.

59
00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:58.513
It is rude.

60
00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:07.018
I have no idea where to even begin.

61
00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:14.833
I can't give this ring to her.

62
00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:18.578
My girlfriend, who was supposed
to come today, is Hyun Soo.

63
00:07:20.602 --> 00:07:21.861
Oh, really?

64
00:07:23.398 --> 00:07:26.855
Remember how I went to
visit you in Paris a lot?

65
00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.054
The woman I mentioned to you
on my second visit was Hyun Soo.

66
00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:36.350
Then, we loved the same woman.

67
00:07:36.982 --> 00:07:39.381
No, not past tense.
It's still going on.

68
00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:44.157
Did Ms. Hyun Soo come here today
knowing that you'd propose to her?

69
00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:48.590
Hyun Soo bears no responsibility
regarding this proposal.

70
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.100
So are you saying she knew about it?

71
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.806
Judging from the look on her face,
it seemed as if she didn't know.

72
00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.371
She didn't know.
I just brought her here.

73
00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:01.311
How could you think of proposing to
someone who doesn't feel the same way?

74
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.777
There are logical reasons
for my proposal.

75
00:08:03.777 --> 00:08:08.467
I was with Hyun Soo
the entire time that you weren't.

76
00:08:11.347 --> 00:08:13.393
When her work won
the open call competition

77
00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:15.063
when her work debuted
on TV for the first time

78
00:08:15.063 --> 00:08:17.948
when she was sick, on Christmas,
on New Year's Eve, and on New Year's...

79
00:08:19.948 --> 00:08:21.544
I was with her.

80
00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:27.973
I'd never once seen her date another
guy during the four years I was with her.

81
00:08:27.973 --> 00:08:30.314
I knew that she had another
man in her heart.

82
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.359
But that man wasn't by
Hyun Soo's side.

83
00:08:35.476 --> 00:08:37.644
I liked the fact that she treasured
her feelings for that man

84
00:08:37.644 --> 00:08:39.629
even if he wasn't right by her side.

85
00:08:40.643 --> 00:08:42.586
After all, if those feelings
were redirected toward me

86
00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:44.570
she would treat me like that too.

87
00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:47.755
That's why I didn't make any moves.

88
00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:50.133
Because she's not a woman
who'd be easily seduced.

89
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:56.946
I'm sure this isn't the case, but...

90
00:08:56.946 --> 00:08:58.739
I'm hoping that this
isn't the case, but...

91
00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:03.403
did you know that my
girlfriend was Ms. Hyun Soo?

92
00:09:04.849 --> 00:09:06.479
I did.

93
00:09:08.455 --> 00:09:09.909
You knew?

94
00:09:11.298 --> 00:09:15.071
You knew, and yet you gave me a ring
and made me set up your proposal?

95
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:18.339
It's only fair that you also
feel the pain that I felt...

96
00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:20.340
when I first found out about this.

97
00:09:23.007 --> 00:09:25.325
What did I do wrong?

98
00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:26.931
You didn't do anything wrong.

99
00:09:27.398 --> 00:09:29.297
You did nothing wrong, but...

100
00:09:30.716 --> 00:09:32.829
even so, I'm mad at you.

101
00:09:36.216 --> 00:09:38.245
Because I can't get mad at Hyun Soo.

102
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.263
The dice have been thrown now.

103
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:50.399
Let's just do as we want to,
moving forward.

104
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.244
I'll drive Hyun Soo home.

105
00:09:53.095 --> 00:09:56.158
No, Ms. Hyun Soo needs to
talk with me first.

106
00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.287
Because we have feelings for one another.

107
00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.156
I'll be going on ahead.

108
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.974
All right.

109
00:10:16.974 --> 00:10:18.976
You're not going to ask me
what's going on?

110
00:10:18.976 --> 00:10:22.010
You'd tell me if it was something
that I needed to know about.

111
00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:29.942
I prepared all of this today
to propose to you.

112
00:10:32.782 --> 00:10:34.095
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:35.556
For what?

114
00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:38.031
I should've told you sooner
about meeting with that man.

115
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:40.000
I already knew about it.

116
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.154
What I felt for you
was true.

117
00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:46.795
Our relationship may not be romantic

118
00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:50.201
but I thought that we fully
trusted one another.

119
00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:51.394
Am I wrong?

120
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:54.668
No, you're right.

121
00:10:54.668 --> 00:10:55.937
Some people use trust
as a basis to decide

122
00:10:55.937 --> 00:10:57.874
who they will spend
the rest of their lives with.

123
00:10:57.874 --> 00:11:00.369
I wanted to let you know that
I'll always be there for you

124
00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:03.034
if you ever fall into
a pit of despair.

125
00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:05.134
And I wanted you to rely on me.

126
00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.663
That's why I decided to propose to you.

127
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:13.100
I only found out after
I decided to propose.

128
00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:15.970
I saw you two at Yeosu.

129
00:11:18.826 --> 00:11:22.885
All right, I've laid all of my
cards on the table now.

130
00:11:22.885 --> 00:11:26.412
Consider this our beginning.

131
00:11:30.598 --> 00:11:31.793
Wow.

132
00:11:31.793 --> 00:11:33.567
- <i>[Two years ago, November 2015]</i>
- You're good at this now!

133
00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:36.157
This is so fun. I think I have
quite a knack for this.

134
00:11:38.805 --> 00:11:40.398
Oh, wow.

135
00:11:40.398 --> 00:11:42.950
Can't I take a swing now?
Or are you going to hog the bat?

136
00:11:43.878 --> 00:11:45.609
I couldn't bring myself to stop.

137
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:48.755
But, you know...

138
00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:50.695
your posture isn't that great.

139
00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:53.963
I can't do much about that.
You can worry about your own posture.

140
00:11:55.678 --> 00:11:57.416
Aren't you ever going to
date someone?

141
00:11:58.123 --> 00:12:00.295
The love cells in me
dried up and died.

142
00:12:00.372 --> 00:12:01.858
I'm going to focus only on work.

143
00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:06.080
Whoa!

144
00:12:15.374 --> 00:12:17.488
You must be happy now.

145
00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:21.753
The ratings for your show
are high, and the reviews are good.

146
00:12:21.753 --> 00:12:23.476
Yes, I'm happy.

147
00:12:25.032 --> 00:12:28.158
We've been getting a lot
of calls from other companies

148
00:12:28.158 --> 00:12:31.032
asking how much money
you signed on with us for.

149
00:12:31.032 --> 00:12:32.956
You've been getting
lots of calls too, right?

150
00:12:32.956 --> 00:12:34.391
Just a few.

151
00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:38.176
But when they call me and
ask me to meet with them

152
00:12:38.176 --> 00:12:40.404
I tell them that I like
On Entertainment.

153
00:12:41.374 --> 00:12:43.038
Really?

154
00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:47.019
At first, I thought you started
a business with your inheritance.

155
00:12:47.743 --> 00:12:50.666
It truly is impressive that
you've come so far, all on your own.

156
00:12:51.888 --> 00:12:53.824
I just got lucky.

157
00:12:53.824 --> 00:12:55.884
They say that being
lucky is a skill in itself!

158
00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:58.646
You're so diligent

159
00:12:58.646 --> 00:13:02.041
and you head straight toward
your goals once you set them.

160
00:13:02.633 --> 00:13:04.839
How could you not have succeeded?

161
00:13:06.364 --> 00:13:08.619
Why are you being like this today?

162
00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:10.079
Are you hungry, or something?

163
00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:13.161
I'm good at appreciating things
like this about other people.

164
00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:15.191
I respect you, CEO Park.

165
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.832
Oh yeah.

166
00:13:21.832 --> 00:13:23.433
Aren't you moving?

167
00:13:23.433 --> 00:13:25.373
Of course I will,
since I've made money.

168
00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:28.335
I found a big place and
signed a long-term lease.

169
00:13:28.867 --> 00:13:30.186
Good job.

170
00:13:31.095 --> 00:13:33.398
<i>[One year ago, March 2016]</i>

171
00:13:33.398 --> 00:13:35.753
Why isn't CEO Park here yet?

172
00:13:35.753 --> 00:13:37.701
Are you hungry?
We should eat already, then.

173
00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:39.468
CEO Park said that
he'd be here soon.

174
00:13:39.468 --> 00:13:42.216
I can't tell what CEO Park is thinking.

175
00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:43.950
What do you mean?

176
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.296
Why isn't he making any
moves toward Hyun Soo?

177
00:13:46.296 --> 00:13:48.365
Even though it's clear to me
that he likes her?

178
00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:50.003
It's not like that.

179
00:13:50.003 --> 00:13:51.476
He's super strict when it
comes to our contract.

180
00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:53.271
Stop getting ahead of yourself, Hong Ah.

181
00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:55.401
You're always trying to
link those two romantically.

182
00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.445
It seems to me that neither
of them are interested.

183
00:13:57.445 --> 00:14:00.571
You'll never be able to write melodramas
with that kind of dull intuition.

184
00:14:00.571 --> 00:14:02.032
- Hey!
- Ugh!

185
00:14:04.152 --> 00:14:06.860
What amazing timing.
There's CEO Park.

186
00:14:08.633 --> 00:14:10.161
CEO Park!

187
00:14:10.161 --> 00:14:11.297
Please come in.

188
00:14:12.403 --> 00:14:14.428
I have to go because
I have a prior engagement.

189
00:14:17.216 --> 00:14:19.235
You didn't have to come.

190
00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:21.420
But still, I need to congratulate you.

191
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.172
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:14:24.172 --> 00:14:25.441
I'll be going now.

193
00:14:28.043 --> 00:14:29.759
You didn't have to see me out.

194
00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:32.301
Thank you.
You didn't have to come.

195
00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:37.527
I'll have to give you a gift
since you saw me out.

196
00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:38.942
You have another present for me?

197
00:14:38.942 --> 00:14:41.240
It's not certain as of yet

198
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.921
but I think SBC will pick up
"Foul Detective."

199
00:14:46.398 --> 00:14:48.013
Shin Ha Rim said that he'd do it?

200
00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:50.267
Seeing as how he said that
he's seriously considering it

201
00:14:50.267 --> 00:14:52.600
I think he'll do it, as long
as we pay him what he wants.

202
00:14:59.195 --> 00:15:00.845
I haven't eaten yet.

203
00:15:00.845 --> 00:15:02.884
Hang on. I'll bring you something.

204
00:15:02.884 --> 00:15:04.721
No, I can just eat in the car.

205
00:15:08.814 --> 00:15:11.365
I hope you meet
a nice woman and marry her.

206
00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:14.657
The one I want is you.

207
00:15:14.657 --> 00:15:17.243
And I don't settle for anything
less than what I want.

208
00:15:18.768 --> 00:15:20.465
There's no need for
you to be nervous.

209
00:15:20.465 --> 00:15:24.364
I'll keep my promise about
not making you feel uncomfortable.

210
00:15:25.306 --> 00:15:26.686
I'm off.

211
00:15:46.393 --> 00:15:47.782
It's cold, huh?

212
00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:52.018
What took you so long?

213
00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:54.896
I'm working.

214
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.099
I told Won Joon to take care
of the kitchen for me.

215

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

216
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.125
We need to talk.

217
00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:12.715
Let's head inside first.

218
00:16:20.883 --> 00:16:23.204
You were really
taken aback before, right?

219
00:16:23.204 --> 00:16:28.075
I heard from Jung Woo that you didn't
know he'd be proposing to you today.

220
00:16:29.096 --> 00:16:31.864
I didn't know that you
and CEO Park...

221
00:16:32.662 --> 00:16:35.314
were that close.

222
00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:39.671
Jung Woo is a good person,
and I want him to be happy.

223
00:16:40.808 --> 00:16:43.659
But his happiness got
entangled with our relationship.

224
00:16:46.892 --> 00:16:51.965
We've both had new revelations today,
so let's talk about it tomorrow.

225
00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.886
I'll take you home after
you've finished your tea.

226
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:10.005
<i>She said that love is a rational thing.</i>

227
00:17:10.005 --> 00:17:14.532
<i>And that she will marry someone who
treasures her, and whom she can respect.</i>

228
00:17:16.212 --> 00:17:17.732
I respect you, CEO Park.

229
00:17:31.773 --> 00:17:36.600
<i>I was with Hyun Soo the entire time
you were away from her.</i>

230
00:17:44.344 --> 00:17:46.324
<i>Allow me to properly
introduce you two again.</i>

231
00:17:46.324 --> 00:17:48.783
This is my most favorite
man in the world.

232
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.925
And this is my most favorite
woman in the world.

233
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.447
Did I keep you from sleeping?

234
00:18:36.447 --> 00:18:38.130
No.

235
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.122
I thought about it...

236
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.000
and it's important that
our relationship doesn't change

237
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.964
no matter who may try
to test our relationship.

238
00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:49.259
But...

239
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.800
it's possible that our feelings may
change if there is someone testing us.

240
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:58.904
I feel thankful and sorry for CEO Park.

241
00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:01.163
That's not love.

242
00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:05.245
I won't get confused, nor will
my feelings for you change.

243
00:19:18.395 --> 00:19:20.245
That's all I need to hear.

244
00:19:21.704 --> 00:19:23.578
Head back inside.
I have to go to work.

245
00:19:24.092 --> 00:19:25.292
I have to work, too.

246
00:19:25.815 --> 00:19:30.722
I want to hug you, but I can't because
there are people walking by.

247
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.929
I want to tell you to come inside...

248
00:19:45.929 --> 00:19:48.120
but I can't because Kyung is there.

249
00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:08.347
<i>[A few days later]</i>

250

Insa-dong, and then we'll turn</i>

253

<i>to Cheonggyecheon, go past Gwanghamun,
and return to Gyeonbok Palace, okay?</i>

254
00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:23.372
I won't be able to run with you guys
if he does groups by skill level.

255
00:20:23.372 --> 00:20:25.867
There are always outliers (sounds like
radish kimchi), so don't worry.

256
00:20:25.867 --> 00:20:28.581
I love radish kimchi.
Now I want to eat some.

<i>[CEO Park Jung Woo]</i>

259
00:20:49.188 --> 00:20:51.036
Yes, CEO Park?

260
00:20:51.036 --> 00:20:52.752
Long time no talk.

261
00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:55.189
So you're making me
call you first, I see.

262
00:20:55.753 --> 00:20:57.032
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:57.032 --> 00:20:59.966
Are you aware of the fact that today is
the day you're meeting Ms. Yoo Hye Jung?

264
00:20:59.966 --> 00:21:01.109
I am.

265
00:21:01.109 --> 00:21:03.872
Is your promise still valid?

266
00:21:04.398 --> 00:21:06.674
I don't go back on my word easily.

267
00:21:06.674 --> 00:21:08.391
Do you want me to
cancel the appointment?

268
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.967
No.

269
00:21:11.451 --> 00:21:12.725
See you later, then.

270
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.564
Why are you here so early?
It's not time for you to be here yet.

271
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:44.718
Well, I had nothing going on
and I woke up early, so...

272
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.574
Good morning!

273
00:21:46.574 --> 00:21:48.169
Hey there.
What'd you buy?

274
00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:51.117
Sea bream.
I didn't like the ones we got in.

275
00:21:51.117 --> 00:21:52.942
We're 30 percent booked
for today, right?

276
00:21:52.942 --> 00:21:55.348
Yes, it's been like this all week

277
00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:57.353
and we have almost
no reservations for next week.

278
00:22:02.151 --> 00:22:04.689
Word-of-mouth sure is scary.

279
00:22:04.689 --> 00:22:06.248
How are we going to overcome this?

280
00:22:12.638 --> 00:22:14.170
Hey, Hong Ah!

281
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:18.112
Won Joon.

282
00:22:18.112 --> 00:22:21.980
I want to eat the pork belly
that you made me last time.

283
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.910
Are you not feeling well?
Your voice sounds weird.

284
00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:29.526
It was because I was lying down.
I stayed up all night.

285
00:22:29.526 --> 00:22:31.584
Oh. Well, that's a relief, then.

286
00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:33.106
When are you coming by to eat?

287
00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:35.809
Well, can't you just
bring it over to me?

288
00:22:35.809 --> 00:22:37.471
I can't leave during business hours.

289
00:22:38.405 --> 00:22:40.515
All right, then.

290
00:22:40.515 --> 00:22:43.748
Just have it ready for me, then.
I'll come by during your break.

291
00:22:43.748 --> 00:22:45.405
Okay.

292
00:22:50.126 --> 00:22:51.784
I'll leave this to you, then.

293
00:23:01.244 --> 00:23:03.910
Wow, you really put a lot of
thought into your outfit, huh?

294
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.495
Yeah, I totally did! I'm nervous.

295
00:23:06.495 --> 00:23:07.774
Are you that nervous?

296
00:23:07.774 --> 00:23:10.513
She said that she likes my writing,
so how could I not be nervous?

297
00:23:10.513 --> 00:23:12.550
Just get Yoo Hye Jung's
autograph, okay?

298
00:23:13.136 --> 00:23:15.072
I don't think I'll be able
to ask her for that.

299
00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:18.043
All right, don't ask her, then.

300
00:23:18.043 --> 00:23:19.391
You have to appear calm and cool.

301
00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:23.875
You can't be asking an actor you just met
for autographs, when you're a writer.

302
00:23:24.869 --> 00:23:26.401
Thanks for being so understanding.

303
00:23:26.896 --> 00:23:28.437
Have a safe trip, Hyun Soo.

304
00:23:28.437 --> 00:23:29.872
- Okay.
- Okay!

305
00:23:32.655 --> 00:23:34.582
I put a lot of thought into
my outfit, too.

306
00:23:34.582 --> 00:23:37.390
I put a lot of
thought into mine, too!

307
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.824
Kyung, you sure did put
a lot of thought into it!

308
00:23:55.014 --> 00:23:56.580
Welcome.

309
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.713
It's nice to see you.

310
00:23:57.713 --> 00:23:58.823
Why are you out here?

311
00:23:58.823 --> 00:24:01.492
You came all the way to our
office when you're so busy

312
00:24:01.492 --> 00:24:03.300
so it's only natural that
I'd come out to greet you.

313
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.670
Oh, I really love it when
people are formal with me!

314
00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:10.523
Is Writer Lee here?

315
00:24:10.523 --> 00:24:11.987
Not yet.

316
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:32.329
Why are there so few guests?

317
00:24:33.497 --> 00:24:35.117
Allow me to show you to your seats.

318
00:24:41.683 --> 00:24:43.403
Your office is really nice.

319
00:24:43.403 --> 00:24:45.341
And the painting is nice, too.

320
00:24:46.138 --> 00:24:48.815
Well, I do pretty much
everything here.

321
00:24:48.815 --> 00:24:50.503
Please drink it to see if
it's to your taste.

322
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.016
Oh, it's a bit salty!

323
00:24:55.403 --> 00:24:58.223
I can totally understand why
people love you so much.

324
00:24:58.223 --> 00:25:00.728
Writer Lee is here, CEO Park.

325
00:25:18.744 --> 00:25:20.863
All right, I'll introduce
the two of you now.

326
00:25:20.863 --> 00:25:22.488
There's no need.

327
00:25:22.488 --> 00:25:24.353
I looked her up before I came here.

328
00:25:24.353 --> 00:25:27.045
Hello, I'm Yoo Hye Jung.

329
00:25:27.045 --> 00:25:28.529
I'm Lee Hyun Soo.

330
00:25:30.068 --> 00:25:31.259
Shall we all sit?

331
00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:39.804
I begged CEO Park to
arrange a meeting with you.

332
00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:42.984
But you know, you're so pretty!
I was so shocked!

333
00:25:44.641 --> 00:25:46.807
You're taller and thinner
than I thought, too.

334
00:25:46.807 --> 00:25:48.785
The camera adds a couple of pounds.

335
00:25:48.785 --> 00:25:50.252
Even so, you look so pretty.

336
00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:54.025
My heart was racing after
I read your script!

337
00:25:54.025 --> 00:25:56.869
I only work nowadays because
my love cells have shriveled up.

338
00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:59.171
I wrote it hoping that it would
make people's hearts race.

339
00:25:59.171 --> 00:26:00.899
So I'm happy to hear that.

340
00:26:00.899 --> 00:26:02.753
I really want to work on
this project with you

341
00:26:02.753 --> 00:26:04.554
but I'm starting another show soon.

342
00:26:04.554 --> 00:26:05.761
It's really a shame.

343
00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:08.169
We can always work together
next time, if not this time.

344
00:26:08.802 --> 00:26:11.879
You have to let me be the first
to look at your next project, okay?

345
00:26:11.879 --> 00:26:14.857
Oh, of course!
I'm your fan.

346
00:26:14.857 --> 00:26:16.640
I'm your fan, too.

347
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.880
Wow, it's been so long since
I last felt this invisible.

348
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.100
Really?

349
00:26:23.535 --> 00:26:24.962
I'm here too, everyone.

350
00:26:24.962 --> 00:26:26.848
Oh, I'm sorry, CEO Park!

351
00:26:36.355 --> 00:26:37.809
Maybe something bad happened?

352
00:26:37.809 --> 00:26:40.127
It seems that the number of
customers has dramatically decreased.

353
00:26:40.127 --> 00:26:41.552
Problems?
What problems?

354
00:26:41.552 --> 00:26:44.217
Customers come and go.

355
00:26:44.217 --> 00:26:45.962
You should look into it.

356
00:26:45.962 --> 00:26:48.106
The fact that they suddenly have
so few customers means there's a problem.

357
00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:50.146
Why do you keep saying that
they're having problems?

358
00:26:50.146 --> 00:26:52.208
At this rate, you'll end up
creating a problem out of nothing!

359
00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:54.234
Do you not want my Chef Ohn to succeed?

360
00:26:54.234 --> 00:26:55.734
Who said anything about that?

361
00:26:55.734 --> 00:26:58.375
I'm just worried that you'll be
upset if he's not doing well.

362
00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:00.966
Oh, please! You upset me
more than he does!

363
00:27:00.966 --> 00:27:02.638
What did I do?

364
00:27:03.686 --> 00:27:06.055
Why haven't you been giving me
my living expenses since last month?

365
00:27:06.055 --> 00:27:08.074
I gave you my credit card!
You can just use that!

366
00:27:08.074 --> 00:27:09.708
I maxed out the credit limit.

367
00:27:10.365 --> 00:27:13.657
How can I just use a card?
I need cash, too.

368
00:27:13.657 --> 00:27:15.716
You know how little
professors make.

369
00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:17.881
And I need to spend a bit of money, too.

370
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:19.830
It's not "a bit."
You use all of it!

371
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.991
I'm trusting you and living with you

372
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:24.391
but what am I supposed to do
when you're acting this way?

373
00:27:25.901 --> 00:27:27.562
I have to start heading over
to my appointment.

374
00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:28.669
You're staying here, right?

375
00:27:29.573 --> 00:27:31.535
You sure are great at
slithering out of situations.

376
00:27:34.708 --> 00:27:36.811
Please stop nagging me.

377
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:38.513
It's making things difficult for me.

378
00:27:39.117 --> 00:27:42.396
You're the person who understands me
more than anyone else in this world.

379
00:27:44.449 --> 00:27:46.486
Are you going to come back
to pick me up afterward?

380
00:27:46.486 --> 00:27:48.288
Of course I will.

381
00:27:49.138 --> 00:27:50.579
Fine, then.

382
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.062
What brings you here?

383
00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:25.783
Professor Min is meeting someone, but
he's coming back to pick me up later.

384
00:28:25.783 --> 00:28:29.145
You seem to have a lot of free time these
days. You're coming to Seoul so often.

385
00:28:31.343 --> 00:28:33.497
Is there an issue
at you restaurant?

386
00:28:33.497 --> 00:28:35.285
You haven't had many guests
since last week.

387
00:28:35.285 --> 00:28:37.447
it's nothing for you to be concerned over

388
00:28:37.447 --> 00:28:39.577
so if you want to stay here,
go over there and rest.

389
00:28:39.577 --> 00:28:40.763
I have to work.

390
00:28:44.792 --> 00:28:46.086
When are you going back on TV?

391
00:28:46.086 --> 00:28:47.141
I'm not.

392
00:28:47.738 --> 00:28:52.234
Why not? You have to do those
sorts of things to get customers.

393
00:28:52.234 --> 00:28:54.417
It's just that I'm worried about you.

394
00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:56.340
What if your restaurant
has to shut down?

395
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.992
I won't be able to go on
if that happens.

396
00:28:57.992 --> 00:29:00.542
Let's each focus on our
own lives, Mom.

397
00:29:00.542 --> 00:29:02.828
This has nothing to do with you,
so mind your own business.

398
00:29:02.828 --> 00:29:04.965
Why do you say such
cold things to me?

399
00:29:04.965 --> 00:29:06.577
Your business is my business!

400
00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:08.834
Please.

401
00:29:08.834 --> 00:29:10.696
Let's not, okay?

402
00:29:19.725 --> 00:29:21.026
Won Joon is here, right?

403
00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:23.821
Yes. Take a seat,
and I'll get him for you.

404
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:25.388
I'll go to the kitchen.

405
00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:29.418
According to our protocols, unauthorized
personnel are not allowed in the kitchen.

406
00:29:30.468 --> 00:29:32.203
But I went in last time.

407
00:29:32.203 --> 00:29:34.513
That must have been
a time when I wasn't here, then.

408
00:29:41.898 --> 00:29:44.135
Ugh, I'm so hungry!

409
00:29:44.135 --> 00:29:45.767
We're going to head out for lunch.

410
00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:46.920
Okay.

411
00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:52.433
Ms. Hong Ah is here, Sous Chef.

412
00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:53.957
Yes, I'm all done.

413
00:30:15.048 --> 00:30:16.946
Where is it?

414
00:30:16.946 --> 00:30:18.372
Right here.

415
00:30:19.627 --> 00:30:21.564
Why did you pack it up?

416
00:30:21.564 --> 00:30:23.907
I was planning to eat here,
so I barely ate anything!

417
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:25.392
Oh, really?

418
00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:29.155
I thought you meant that you'd take it
home to eat, since you're busy now.

419
00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:31.871
Ugh, seriously, what is wrong with you?

420
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.959
Do you know how tired I am
from working so much?

421
00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:35.763
Do I really need to tell you
these things?

422
00:30:35.763 --> 00:30:38.988
If you were going to do this,
you could've just sent it to me!

423
00:30:38.988 --> 00:30:41.937
Do you think I came all the way here
just to pick up a lunchbox?

424
00:30:45.452 --> 00:30:49.390
Sorry to interrupt, but
I have something to say to you.

425
00:30:50.852 --> 00:30:52.215
To me?

426
00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:54.042
Yes.

427
00:30:54.042 --> 00:30:56.226
Go ahead.

428
00:30:57.344 --> 00:30:59.294
Give...

429
00:30:59.737 --> 00:31:01.606
this man to me.

430
00:31:02.362 --> 00:31:04.065
Ms. Soo Jung?

431
00:31:06.784 --> 00:31:11.337
