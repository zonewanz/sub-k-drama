1
00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:11.064
We were all someone's first love.

2
00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.705
Not us.

3
00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.205
I told you to stop putting me in your league.

4
00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:17.135
First love, my foot. I hope he dies.

5
00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:20.744
Hey, it looks like Jin Jin won't say anything until she dies.

6
00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:23.174
For how long won't you tell that you know they dated?

7
00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:26.185
They dated for three days. That's barely dating.

8
00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:28.385
- I don't count those flings. - You don't?

9
00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:29.385
Yes.

10
00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.485
- Gosh, it's cold. - Yes, it's really cold.

11
00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:34.494
- Can you come closer? - Yes, let's stick together.

12
00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:44.864
You're my first love.

13
00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:09.954
Good morning, Ji Won.

14
00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:11.655
- Hey, Mom. - Hey.

15
00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:19.195
What's this smell?

16
00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:22.334
Min Ho was just talking about his cologne.

17
00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:24.095
I guess he practically poured some on him.

18
00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:29.304
It smells great, doesn't it? It smells like soap.

19
00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:32.745
- Mom, where's my rice? - Here.

20
00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:40.315
Ji Won, I made your favorite, pork cutlet.

21
00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.785
Gosh, thank you.

22
00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:47.524
You're so big now,

23
00:02:47.524 --> 00:02:51.024
but you still like the food you liked as a baby.

24
00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:54.665
Oh, my, look at you.

25
00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:57.935
You look just like your dad.

26
00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:00.804
Really?

27
00:03:01.204 --> 00:03:03.704
He was so warm and thoughtful.

28
00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:06.074
I've never seen a nicer guy than him.

29
00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:07.975
Ji Won,

30
00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:11.084
if you can be half the man your dad was, you'll be a great husband.

31
00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:13.315
- Okay. - Ji Won.

32
00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:16.114
Are you dating anyone?

33
00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:18.324
- He's not. - Goodness.

34
00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:21.524
- Don't you have a girlfriend? - He doesn't.

35
00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:25.894
Goodness, why not?

36
00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:29.465
- You should meet someone. - He said there wasn't anyone good.

37
00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:31.864
Sa Jin Jin.

38
00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:34.834
- What are you so happy about? - What?

39
00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.234
You went around telling every single person...

40
00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:38.745
that you never dated anyone,

41
00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:41.915
so are you happy to have a comrade now?

42
00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:45.614
Wasn't Ah Reum and Young Shim enough? Are you taking him in too?

43
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:48.285
No, it's not like that.

44
00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:51.785
He said he doesn't have anyone. That's not my fault, is it?

45
00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:52.824
Why...

46
00:03:54.024 --> 00:03:55.755
Why isn't that your fault?

47
00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:59.065
You need to try hard to find your partner in life.

48
00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:02.294
Do you think you'll ever find someone...

49
00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:03.864
by sitting around and waiting at home?

50
00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:06.864
You need to try harder before it's too late.

51
00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:09.734
You know, Ji Won,

52
00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:13.945
there's no need to go far to find your companion.

53
00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:17.685
- Okay. - Good.

54
00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:20.084
You're right.

55
00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:24.885
Eat up.

56
00:04:31.464 --> 00:04:33.195
- Jin Jin. - Yes?

57
00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:35.295
Do you have some time before you go swimming?

58
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:37.065
I do.

59
00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:39.935
- That's great. - Why?

60
00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:42.274
Give me a ride.

61
00:04:42.974 --> 00:04:45.274
- What? - Take me to work.

62
00:04:46.774 --> 00:04:48.844
Oh, okay.

63
00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:50.445
Yes!

64
00:04:55.855 --> 00:04:57.584
I said I can drive.

65
00:04:57.584 --> 00:05:00.784
I'd rather drive myself. I drove your car before too.

66
00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:03.795
Is that so? Okay then.

67
00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:12.605
Are you going to eat that by yourself?

68
00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:15.105
Do you want some?

69
00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:20.644
Goodness, that's sweet. One more.

70
00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:21.774
One more?

71
00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:26.315
Isn't it great to take a break?

72
00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:28.815
Do you have any dramas or movies planned?

73
00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:30.755
I do.

74
00:05:31.784 --> 00:05:35.154
I do, but I can't tell you yet. It's still a secret.

75
00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:37.024
It'll be very shocking.

76
00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:40.024
Something very shocking?

77
00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:42.135
An R-rated movie? An erotic movie?

78
00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:43.235
More like romance and comedy.

79
00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:45.164
What could it be? I'm so curious.

80
00:05:45.164 --> 00:05:46.334
I can't tell you yet.

81
00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:48.474
Okay, I'll look forward to it.

82
00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.274
What's your plan today?

83
00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.404
I have to go to the broadcasting station today.

84
00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:55.014
Here.

85
00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:57.745
Gosh, that's sour.

86
00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:09.594
All right, we're here.

87
00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:12.295
- Is this your office? - Yes.

88
00:06:12.764 --> 00:06:14.125
Bye then.

89
00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.394
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

90
00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:25.574
Ji Won.

91
00:06:27.974 --> 00:06:29.014
Yes?

92
00:07:07.284 --> 00:07:10.255
- You're good to go. - Bye.

93
00:07:15.695 --> 00:07:16.995
Listen carefully.

94
00:07:17.094 --> 00:07:18.695
I killed your man.

95
00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:21.034
I turned that guy...

96
00:07:22.094 --> 00:07:24.034
into a handful of ashes.

97
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.534
And what did you say?

98
00:07:25.534 --> 00:07:27.204
Your love has no preservatives?

99
00:07:27.204 --> 00:07:30.105
Are you going to hold a ghost wedding with him?

100
00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:32.005
I will take your souls...

101
00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:34.474
and grind them to ashes with a goblin's club.

102
00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:37.474
Great job.

103
00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.615
("My Wife's Ghost Marriage")

104
00:07:50.824 --> 00:07:54.264
I'm sorry, the producer begged me to get you here.

105
00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:56.264
Don't worry. Of course I should come.

106
00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:58.334
Just think of this as doing him one last favor.

107
00:07:58.334 --> 00:07:59.764
This is the last time something like this happens.

108
00:07:59.764 --> 00:08:01.334
I can do more of this.

109
00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:03.574
If we go around auditioning, we might find a great role.

110
00:08:03.574 --> 00:08:06.875
What are you talking about? You can't do that anymore.

111
00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:10.574
Once "We Got Married" airs, you'll be Jin Jin's husband.

112
00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:12.745
I mean, people will give you more attention right away.

113
00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:15.784
We can pick out great dramas instead of cheap soap operas.

114
00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:17.855
You'll stop playing some company's manager.

115
00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:22.295
- Jeong Eun. - Yes?

116
00:08:23.954 --> 00:08:26.795
No. I don't want this. I don't want to do it.

117
00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:29.964
- Why not? - I know how you feel,

118
00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:33.965
but I don't want to benefit from it because I'm doing "We Got Married".

119
00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:35.904
So let's not get greedy.

120
00:08:35.904 --> 00:08:37.575
If you keep doing this,

121
00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:39.875
you'll embarrass me.

122
00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:44.544
We're done recording the narration for the documentary.

123
00:08:44.544 --> 00:08:45.784
Be quiet.

124
00:08:45.784 --> 00:08:49.585
My gosh, I literally almost cried!

125
00:08:49.585 --> 00:08:50.585
Goodness.

126
00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:53.154
- Was it interesting? - Yes, it was very touching.

127
00:08:53.154 --> 00:08:55.694
I really almost cried.

128
00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:58.394
- Let's go. - Let's go eat. Aren't you hungry?

129
00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:11.304
Who said that you'll always be an idol star?

130
00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:13.005
You. You!

131
00:09:13.644 --> 00:09:15.514
I'm talking about you.

132
00:09:15.514 --> 00:09:18.814
Either get a bit more greedy, or be cool in front of your fans.

133
00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:22.085
You can't do either of them. All you ever do is run away.

134
00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:24.784
Try doing that for a thousand years. It'll just hurt you.

135
00:09:30.024 --> 00:09:31.164
What can I do?

136
00:09:32.495 --> 00:09:33.894
You know I'm Anthony.

137
00:09:42.705 --> 00:09:43.804
Mr. Lawyer.

138
00:09:44.304 --> 00:09:45.745
Are you having a late lunch?

139
00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:47.044
(Lawyer Kang Kyung Seok)

140
00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:50.575
Your dessert.

141
00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:56.115
Do you need a hearing aid?

142
00:09:56.115 --> 00:09:57.885
Why do you never listen to me?

143
00:09:58.154 --> 00:10:00.755
- Don't stir coffee with that. - Okay.

144
00:10:01.495 --> 00:10:02.625
Sorry.

145
00:10:04.924 --> 00:10:06.924
You're dripping coffee!

146
00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.694
Are you making me clean up for the coffee?

147
00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:16.904
Excuse me.

148
00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:22.215
Hello?

149
00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:26.444
Yes, I'm Ham Jeong Hwa's grandma.

150
00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:28.684
What? The police station?

151
00:10:36.394 --> 00:10:39.394
It's her first offense, but 1,400 dollars in damages...

152
00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:40.825
is no small amount.

153
00:10:41.534 --> 00:10:43.635
I'll do everything I can to...

154
00:10:43.635 --> 00:10:46.005
get her tried as a juvenile.

155
00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:49.735
You'll need to brace yourself.

156
00:10:50.105 --> 00:10:52.075
She's in the detention center at the moment.

157
00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:55.444
I'll meet her and see what I can do.

158
00:11:02.184 --> 00:11:03.755
- Ms. Han. - What?

159
00:11:04.014 --> 00:11:06.385
- Can I go ahead first? - Why?

160
00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:08.495
My date's here.

161
00:11:14.934 --> 00:11:15.995
Go on ahead.

162
00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:18.904
- Thanks. Great job today. - You did well too.

163
00:11:18.904 --> 00:11:20.564
Ms. Han, I'll get going too.

164
00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:23.875
I don't usually do this, but it's our 100th day anniversary.

165
00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:25.544
He's over there.

166
00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:32.085
Okay, go ahead.

167
00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:33.784
Thanks. See you.

168
00:11:33.784 --> 00:11:35.184
- Bye. - Bye.

169
00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:37.284
Ms. Han, me too.

170
00:11:37.314 --> 00:11:39.054
Your boyfriend's here too?

171
00:11:39.054 --> 00:11:40.625
No, over there.

172
00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:49.735
Let me give you some money.

173
00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:51.664
It's fine. Maybe next time.

174
00:11:52.064 --> 00:11:53.735
- See you. - Bye.

175
00:11:53.735 --> 00:11:55.205
- Bye. - Bye.

176
00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:57.845
- Ms. Han. - What?

177
00:11:57.845 --> 00:11:59.345
We'll escort you.

178
00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:06.514
Sorry. I have plans too.

179
00:12:18.595 --> 00:12:21.064
Honey, I wasn't too late, was I?

180
00:12:25.264 --> 00:12:28.534
A toast to your lovely eyes.

181
00:12:31.304 --> 00:12:33.144
What am I doing?

182
00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:37.014
It's gotten cold.

183
00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:41.284
What's this?

184
00:12:46.924 --> 00:12:49.325
You made this for me?

185
00:12:49.325 --> 00:12:51.225
But I don't know how it tastes.

186
00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:54.995
It must taste great. It even looks tasty.

187
00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:58.505
Oh, I also made these.

188
00:12:58.705 --> 00:12:59.865
Do you want some?

189
00:13:00.064 --> 00:13:01.274
- Now? - Yes.

190
00:13:02.075 --> 00:13:03.105
Okay.

191
00:13:07.174 --> 00:13:10.014
If you can't open it, then maybe I can eat it later.

192
00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:11.284
I got it.

193
00:13:16.054 --> 00:13:17.924
Oh, gosh, thanks.

194
00:13:30.904 --> 00:13:33.365
Since you gave me such a great gift,

195
00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.875
in return, we'll do whatever you want,

196
00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:38.144
eat whatever you want, and go wherever you want.

197
00:13:38.774 --> 00:13:40.705
It's all up to you.

198
00:13:40.804 --> 00:13:42.914
Will you give me some time to think?

199
00:13:43.314 --> 00:13:45.514
I'll go and get something to drink.

200
00:13:46.014 --> 00:13:47.585
- Eat these. - Okay.

201
00:13:49.814 --> 00:13:51.654
- Take your time. - Okay.

202
00:13:59.678 --> 00:14:02.910
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E10 20th Century Boy & Girl "The Wedding"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

203
00:14:08.804 --> 00:14:10.174
It broke again.

204
00:14:16.044 --> 00:14:19.914
A toast to your eyes.

205
00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:25.154
A toast to my eyes. Cheers.

206
00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:33.125
Who was that?

207
00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:35.694
An alcoholic.

208
00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:38.034
- What? - Someone you don't need to know.

209
00:14:38.934 --> 00:14:41.404
- You want to watch a movie? - Yes.

210
00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:46.404
Shall we go to Apgujeong?

211
00:14:46.404 --> 00:14:49.174
- There's an 8:30pm showing. - Okay.

212
00:14:49.174 --> 00:14:53.085
Apgujeong's great, but I know a slightly better cinema.

213
00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:54.755
- Where is it? - The Han River.

214
00:14:54.755 --> 00:14:57.784
It's the perfect backdrop to watch a movie.

215
00:14:57.985 --> 00:15:01.755
Your choice. The river or Apgujeong. Apgujeong or the river.

216
00:15:02.095 --> 00:15:05.194
- Let's go to Han River. - A great choice.

217
00:15:06.194 --> 00:15:07.524
- Seatbelt on. - Okay.

218
00:15:09.434 --> 00:15:11.865
Isn't it great with the breeze?

219
00:15:12.105 --> 00:15:13.434
"I Seoul You."

220
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.434
This is the best place by the river.

221
00:15:20.304 --> 00:15:23.115
- Let's go and sit over there. - Okay.

222
00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:33.225
What do I see over there?

223
00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:36.125
Stand apart. Break up.

224
00:15:37.764 --> 00:15:39.394
- Woo Sung. - What?

225
00:15:39.394 --> 00:15:41.794
There's another couple. Break up.

226
00:15:41.794 --> 00:15:42.934
Look at her.

227
00:15:43.434 --> 00:15:45.735
You too, break up. Break up.

228
00:15:46.064 --> 00:15:49.135
Who are you two? Stand apart.

229
00:15:51.005 --> 00:15:52.904
- Woo Sung. - Who are you?

230
00:15:59.514 --> 00:16:01.014
Will you stay still?

231
00:16:01.755 --> 00:16:04.184
Hee Jin, get her shoe. Thanks.

232
00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:05.654
Jung Woo Sung!

233
00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:08.625
Did you not have a dream?

234
00:16:10.894 --> 00:16:13.164
Is she your date?

235
00:16:13.394 --> 00:16:15.365
I wish you the best.

236
00:16:15.365 --> 00:16:18.735
Get married. Get married.

237
00:16:18.735 --> 00:16:21.575
I'll buy you a fridge when you get married.

238
00:16:21.575 --> 00:16:24.205
And a TV, but not the curved ones.

239
00:16:24.205 --> 00:16:26.345
Those are way too expensive.

240
00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:27.975
I must have gone crazy.

241
00:16:28.014 --> 00:16:29.914
I shouldn't have come here.

242
00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:31.514
I'm a lunatic.

243
00:16:31.544 --> 00:16:33.314
Get married, okay?

244
00:16:37.985 --> 00:16:40.325
Oh, dear. This is so uncomfortable.

245
00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:44.424
Sorry.

246
00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:48.064
Sorry, Hee Jin.

247
00:16:51.505 --> 00:16:54.164
- I'm going to puke. - Hold back.

248
00:16:54.164 --> 00:16:55.534
Stop the car.

249
00:16:55.534 --> 00:16:56.934
Stop, stop!

250
00:16:56.934 --> 00:16:58.804
I can't stop right now.

251
00:16:59.075 --> 00:17:02.245
Breathe deeply through your nose.

252
00:17:02.274 --> 00:17:06.315
Ah Reum, you can't lean out the window.

253
00:17:06.714 --> 00:17:08.515
You'll get hurt.

254
00:17:12.025 --> 00:17:13.385
Hold the elevator.

255
00:17:33.805 --> 00:17:35.644
Shall we meet up with my brother?

256
00:17:36.275 --> 00:17:38.184
I want to introduce him to you.

257
00:17:39.345 --> 00:17:40.385
Okay.

258
00:17:41.785 --> 00:17:43.015
I think...

259
00:17:43.885 --> 00:17:45.385
you'll faint at least.

260
00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.494
Is he that good-looking?

261
00:17:49.055 --> 00:17:50.454
See for yourself.

262
00:17:51.694 --> 00:17:53.694
- Shall I set up the date? - Okay.

263
00:18:00.865 --> 00:18:02.504
Chul Min, Is she pretty?

264
00:18:04.545 --> 00:18:07.075
I think so.

265
00:18:07.075 --> 00:18:09.414
You seem to like foxy girls.

266
00:18:10.315 --> 00:18:11.615
Is she foxy?

267
00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:13.015
Can't you tell?

268
00:18:14.144 --> 00:18:16.414
- Why don't you know? - Did she upset you?

269
00:18:16.414 --> 00:18:19.684
She's the ideal type of my favorite boy band. How is that possible?

270
00:18:19.684 --> 00:18:21.855
I hate her. I hate her so much.

271
00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:24.924
Ha Ram.

272
00:18:25.924 --> 00:18:27.025
Hi.

273
00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:28.265
- Chul Min. - Hello.

274
00:18:28.734 --> 00:18:30.595
- Thank you. - Thanks.

275
00:18:32.105 --> 00:18:34.775
- We'll come back again. - Bye.

276
00:18:34.775 --> 00:18:38.004
- Do you like loach soup? - No, I can't stand it.

277
00:18:38.004 --> 00:18:39.305
Let's go somewhere else then.

278
00:18:39.775 --> 00:18:41.015
We can't.

279
00:18:43.275 --> 00:18:47.315
Mother, can we have three large loach soups?

280
00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:48.815
All right.

281
00:18:49.885 --> 00:18:52.154
- "Mother"? - She's his mom.

282
00:18:52.355 --> 00:18:53.385
Whose mom?

283
00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:55.095
Jeon Seol, my favorite singer's mom.

284
00:18:55.355 --> 00:18:58.565
His parents own this restaurant.

285
00:18:58.724 --> 00:19:00.095
We must eat here.

286
00:19:12.144 --> 00:19:14.315
He's my favorite.

287
00:19:15.815 --> 00:19:19.785
I found something I want to do.

288
00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:22.214
- What is it? - I want to work at YM.

289
00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:24.585
Chul Min, do you know anyone there?

290
00:19:24.684 --> 00:19:26.184
I do know some people there.

291
00:19:26.184 --> 00:19:29.325
You're the best. I like you the most in this world.

292
00:19:29.325 --> 00:19:30.355
No problem.

293
00:19:30.355 --> 00:19:32.424
Ha Ram, you said you wanted a puppy.

294
00:19:32.424 --> 00:19:34.494
- Shall we get one today? - Really?

295
00:19:34.494 --> 00:19:37.464
You're the greatest in this world.

296
00:19:37.464 --> 00:19:38.635
Of course I am.

297
00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:41.404
Do you want Jeon Seol's poster? I'll get his autograph for you.

298
00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:44.545
How about cats? They're fun too.

299
00:19:49.775 --> 00:19:51.744
Ha Ram, I'm your favorite, right?

300
00:19:51.744 --> 00:19:54.585
No, I'm your favorite, right?

301
00:19:55.454 --> 00:19:57.785
Well, then...

302
00:19:57.785 --> 00:20:00.585
Shall I see how good you two are? It's been a while.

303
00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:07.295
Let's see what I can get.

304
00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:14.105
Okay. I'm feeling it tonight.

305
00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:16.004
Yes, I got...

306
00:20:16.775 --> 00:20:20.004
Careful... Careful... I got it.

307
00:20:20.004 --> 00:20:22.315
- Amazing. - There it is. What did I say?

308
00:20:22.315 --> 00:20:25.315
- You're really good. - I'm coming back.

309
00:20:26.315 --> 00:20:28.214
Okay. I got it.

310
00:20:28.214 --> 00:20:31.555
Ha Ram, I got this one. Ha Ram...

311
00:20:31.825 --> 00:20:35.795
That's it, I got this. Ha Ram, I got it. No!

312
00:20:37.254 --> 00:20:38.894
There you go.

313
00:20:40.424 --> 00:20:43.394
Ha Ram, who's your favorite brother?

314
00:20:46.305 --> 00:20:47.835
My favorite...

315
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.775
is Jeon Seol.

316
00:20:59.385 --> 00:21:02.015
Oh, dear. Ji Won.

317
00:21:03.214 --> 00:21:04.885
Your beard grew.

318
00:21:16.595 --> 00:21:19.964
- Happy birthday, dear Mom - Happy birthday, dear Mom

319
00:21:20.035 --> 00:21:23.204
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

320
00:21:30.615 --> 00:21:33.984
I can't believe you cooked me a birthday meal.

321
00:21:33.984 --> 00:21:36.684
He wouldn't let us help at all, saying he'll make everything.

322
00:21:36.684 --> 00:21:37.924
He's so henpecked.

323
00:21:38.984 --> 00:21:41.795
- Did you eat something bad? - Stop it.

324
00:21:44.964 --> 00:21:47.494
Happy birthday, Mom. Here, your favorite gift.

325
00:21:47.494 --> 00:21:49.434
- Gosh. - Goodness.

326
00:21:49.635 --> 00:21:51.964
It's nice and fat.

327
00:21:52.434 --> 00:21:55.135
Your present has no soul.

328
00:21:57.944 --> 00:22:00.275
Happy birthday, Madam Kim.

329
00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:01.375
Let me see.

330
00:22:07.244 --> 00:22:09.015
Isn't it pretty?

331
00:22:09.414 --> 00:22:12.254
It's beautiful. It really is.

332
00:22:13.424 --> 00:22:15.855
No one cares for me like my son does.

333
00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:19.224
I'll wear this and cook even harder for you.

334
00:22:19.224 --> 00:22:21.734
- Okay. - You fool.

335
00:22:22.194 --> 00:22:24.135
When did you get that?

336
00:22:26.204 --> 00:22:28.234
Happy birthday.

337
00:22:29.904 --> 00:22:32.904
Someone finally got around to get me some flowers.

338
00:22:37.174 --> 00:22:39.244
(We Got Married)

339
00:22:43.885 --> 00:22:46.125
"We Got Married", season five.

340
00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:47.825
Sa Jin Jin and Anthony.

341
00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:50.494
Let's begin the second shoot.

342
00:23:02.434 --> 00:23:03.934
Give me the candy.

343
00:23:13.085 --> 00:23:14.754
Sorry, sorry.

344
00:23:18.525 --> 00:23:20.625
Anthony, Jin Jin.

345
00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:23.595
Here's your mission card.

346
00:23:27.525 --> 00:23:31.664
(Have a wedding...)

347
00:23:31.664 --> 00:23:34.934
(with the blessings of your loved ones.)

348
00:23:40.275 --> 00:23:42.575
What should we do about this?

349
00:23:43.144 --> 00:23:45.345
Do you have any dream wedding?

350
00:23:45.345 --> 00:23:46.414
No, I don't.

351
00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:51.625
We should do whatever you want.

352
00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:54.394
Will you tell me if there's anything you wanted to do?

353
00:23:55.055 --> 00:23:58.194
We should call some friends, right?

354
00:24:16.644 --> 00:24:20.285
Hey, how can they prepare a wedding without telling you first?

355
00:24:20.285 --> 00:24:23.484
Exactly. What should we do about her?

356
00:24:23.555 --> 00:24:25.825
Jin Jin. Sa Jin Jin.

357
00:24:27.154 --> 00:24:28.795
- Are you okay? - Hey.

358
00:24:29.325 --> 00:24:31.295
Don't you worry about celebrities.

359
00:24:31.565 --> 00:24:33.865
She'll be just fine when the cameras roll.

360
00:24:35.635 --> 00:24:39.704
Will the groom's friends be here as well?

361
00:24:42.135 --> 00:24:43.734
Where are you?

362
00:24:44.674 --> 00:24:47.045
Oh, Chuja Island.

363
00:24:48.815 --> 00:24:51.184
A black sea bream? 1.8m long?

364
00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:52.744
That's huge.

365
00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:57.625
No, no, I called you out of the blue.

366
00:24:58.555 --> 00:25:00.754
Hi, Bo Hoon, where are you?

367
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:04.125
I forgot you're on your honeymoon.

368
00:25:07.065 --> 00:25:08.795
It's okay. I know it can't be helped.

369
00:25:09.194 --> 00:25:13.434
Your baby's crying. Go and look after her. Okay.

370
00:25:15.974 --> 00:25:17.105
Hey.

371
00:25:19.045 --> 00:25:22.845
Do you want me to call Terius?

372
00:25:32.525 --> 00:25:34.694
- Hi, Ji Won. - Where are you?

373
00:25:35.355 --> 00:25:37.525
I was at a meeting near your place.

374
00:25:37.664 --> 00:25:39.924
How about we take on the claw machine again?

375
00:25:41.694 --> 00:25:42.894
Are you in Yeouido?

376
00:25:45.835 --> 00:25:47.875
Did you call Ji Won?

377
00:25:49.035 --> 00:25:51.545
- No. - It'll break his heart.

378
00:25:51.545 --> 00:25:52.875
She's his first love.

379
00:25:53.605 --> 00:25:56.244
Great. Let's make him pick again.

380
00:25:56.545 --> 00:25:58.615
Han Ah Reum versus Jang Young Shim.

381
00:25:58.615 --> 00:25:59.914
For real this time.

382
00:26:01.454 --> 00:26:04.984
- Jin Jin, it's time to change. - Okay.

383
00:26:06.385 --> 00:26:08.795
- Wait, Mi Dal. - Yes?

384
00:26:08.795 --> 00:26:11.565
Could you shade my face for me?

385
00:26:11.865 --> 00:26:14.635
Make my jawline look really slim and sharp.

386
00:26:16.335 --> 00:26:19.105
- Sorry. Let's go. - Wait.

387
00:26:19.105 --> 00:26:20.535
- We're leaving. - Just a little bit.

388
00:26:21.535 --> 00:26:24.174
(Ji Won)

389
00:26:24.174 --> 00:26:25.674
That bit is flat.

390
00:26:29.744 --> 00:26:31.585
Hey, are you here?

391
00:26:31.585 --> 00:26:34.484
- Yes, I'm almost there. - Come inside.

392
00:26:34.684 --> 00:26:35.714
Where?

393
00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:38.325
Oh, okay.

394
00:26:44.154 --> 00:26:46.724
- Come straight past the toilet. - Okay.

395
00:26:51.365 --> 00:26:52.464
Come on.

396
00:26:52.464 --> 00:26:56.135
You should've told me about this. It's worth celebrating.

397
00:26:56.734 --> 00:27:00.144
They asked me to keep it a secret. It's work. I'm sorry.

398
00:27:00.345 --> 00:27:04.045
Why won't you tell me the most important part?

399
00:27:04.115 --> 00:27:06.684
- What? - Who's the woman?

400
00:27:06.885 --> 00:27:09.714
Who are you getting married to?

401
00:27:11.525 --> 00:27:13.385
Your sister-in-law is...

402
00:27:13.385 --> 00:27:14.855
She's so beautiful.

403
00:27:14.855 --> 00:27:17.924
- Can someone be that beautiful? - It's unbelievable.

404
00:27:17.924 --> 00:27:20.565
The wedding dress is the best dress for any woman.

405
00:27:20.565 --> 00:27:23.035
- You're right. - I think she's here.

406
00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:25.704
- Jin Jin's over there. - Fantastic.

407
00:27:25.704 --> 00:27:27.575
- Fantastic. - Jin Jin?

408
00:27:27.575 --> 00:27:28.775
Get ready.

409
00:27:28.775 --> 00:27:31.704
Let's get things ready. Get to it.

410
00:27:31.974 --> 00:27:33.474
Okay.

411
00:27:34.644 --> 00:27:36.345
You're beautiful.

412
00:27:38.885 --> 00:27:39.984
Chul Min.

413
00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:43.785
What are you doing today?

414
00:27:44.355 --> 00:27:45.525
We're getting married.

415
00:27:46.385 --> 00:27:47.795
It's our wedding.

416
00:27:51.464 --> 00:27:53.694
Oh, no, the bouquet.

417
00:27:53.694 --> 00:27:55.434
- I'll go and get it. - Okay.

418
00:28:25.224 --> 00:28:27.095
You're here.

419
00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:32.004
Do I look awkward?

420
00:28:32.504 --> 00:28:35.204
I wear dresses a lot.

421
00:28:35.204 --> 00:28:37.644
Did you see me in "Couple of Fantasy"?

422
00:28:37.644 --> 00:28:39.075
I wore one in that.

423
00:28:39.075 --> 00:28:41.045
I did in "Will it Snow for Christmas?",

424
00:28:41.045 --> 00:28:43.345
and in "Birth of a Beauty" as well.

425
00:28:43.345 --> 00:28:45.815
I wear them all the time for ceremonies...

426
00:28:45.815 --> 00:28:47.385
or photo shoots.

427
00:28:48.414 --> 00:28:50.885
I wore so many dresses.

428
00:28:50.885 --> 00:28:53.424
I bet I tried on every single style.

429
00:28:53.424 --> 00:28:55.454
Cute, elegant, flashy,

430
00:28:55.454 --> 00:28:57.295
A-line, bell line, and mermaid style.

431
00:28:57.295 --> 00:28:58.595
I wore them all.

432
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:02.835
But today, I'm wearing something simple.

433
00:29:03.994 --> 00:29:05.504
It's a special day.

434
00:29:15.214 --> 00:29:16.414
You look pretty.

435
00:29:19.984 --> 00:29:23.585
Did the girls call you?

436
00:29:24.184 --> 00:29:26.025
I thought you'd be busy.

437
00:29:27.355 --> 00:29:30.295
- I'm here to meet my brother. - Oh, your brother.

438
00:29:32.825 --> 00:29:34.164
- Your brother? - Yes.

439
00:29:35.234 --> 00:29:36.295
My brother.

440
00:29:38.404 --> 00:29:39.464
Ji Won.

441
00:29:41.075 --> 00:29:42.305
Hey, Chul Min.

442
00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:44.404
You got here fast.

443
00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:49.115
- Have you two met already? - Yes.

444
00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:26.315
(Children of 20th Century/20th Century Boy & Girl)

445
00:30:26.315 --> 00:30:29.055
- I promise to be with you. - I promise to be with you.

446
00:30:29.055 --> 00:30:31.954
The bride can find her husband's hand...

447
00:30:31.954 --> 00:30:33.484
and put the ring on him.

448
00:30:33.484 --> 00:30:36.494
Ji Won, haven't you ever thought Jin Jin was pretty?

449
00:30:36.525 --> 00:30:37.724
Why didn't you tell me?

450
00:30:37.724 --> 00:30:40.565
It's not even real. "We got Married" is just a TV show.

451
00:30:40.795 --> 00:30:42.394
Jin Jin, don't you like the food here?

452
00:30:42.394 --> 00:30:44.164
I think he's really cool.

453
00:30:44.164 --> 00:30:45.404
Were you with Chul Min?

454
00:30:45.404 --> 00:30:47.035
Do you know what time it is?

455
00:30:48.004 --> 00:30:49.035
Hey, wait.

456
00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:53.345
If you're happy, I'm happy.
