1
00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.629
Were you an idol star?

2
00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:16.899
Idol stars are very problematic.

3
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:18.899
Gosh, I like your thighs. You get a lot of calls, don't you?

4
00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.429
He's on "We Got Married" with Sa Jin Jin.

5
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.070
Did you sleep with her? Was she great?

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.199
- My gosh. - Let go of me.

7
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.220
Chul Min.

8
00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:49.900
What brings you here?

9
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.749
Next, we'll share our marketing strategy...

10
00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.419
to dive into the global market.

11
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.290
First, I'll introduce our new face of National Chemicals.

12
00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.719
It's actress Sa Jin Jin.

13
00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.730
She was nominated in the Cannes Film Festival...

14
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.529
for her movie, "Universal Emotions".

15
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.600
We thought that her global image could be of help...

16
00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:35.469
to the marketing strategy of National Chemicals...

17
00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.010
as we're trying to expand the European distribution channel.

18
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.150
Hello. I'm the new model for National Chemicals, Sa Jin Jin.

19
00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:49.749
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.900
Please wait a moment.

21
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.279
I'm sorry. If you introduce yourself again, I'll translate it for you.

22
00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.979
It's all right. I can do it.

23
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.420
Good afternoon. Welcome to National Chemicals' launch event.

24
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.920
My name is Jin Jin Sa, and I'm an actress here in Korea.

25
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.890
From here on, I'll do my best...

26
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.969
to lead National Chemicals Cosmetics to become a global brand. Thank you.

27
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.319
He's the president of this company.

28
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.789
He's so cool.

29
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.059
Men need to be competent.

30
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.890
I heard that the new president is young, handsome, and competent.

31
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.999
I know, right? I didn't know it was him.

32
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.529
Did you know?

33
00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.539
- No, I didn't. - What does he do exactly?

34
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.370
I don't know.

35
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.740
- Why don't you know? - He told me, but I didn't get it.

36
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.650
Here.

37
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.020
(To Sa Jin Jin, from the President of National Chemicals, Gong Ji Won)

38
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.159
I've heard a lot about you from Ji Won.

39
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.360
I see. Nice to meet you.

40
00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.629
You're a president. You're not stupid nor are you the pink bear.

41
00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.469
You're the president.

42
00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.800
Please take care of Jin Jin.

43
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.770
I look forward to working with you.

44
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.439
Just by signing a contract with her, we gained more awareness.

45
00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.909
We're looking forward to an increase in our performance this year.

46
00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.650
Sa Jin Jin, I look forward to working with you.

47
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.189
I will do my best, President Gong.

48
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.099
Lee Chul Min!

49
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.569
Jeong Eun, I can explain.

50
00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.229
You're crazy. You jerk. You scum!

51
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.900
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you'd get in trouble.

52
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.940
No, I'm talking about Director Shin.

53
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.169
He's worse than what the rumors say.

54
00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.750
He called and shouted at me, asking whether I knew who he was.

55
00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.710
So I shouted some swear words back and hung up.

56
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.779
Gosh, I should have said more.

57
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.750
I know you're always trying your best.

58
00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.989
- I'm sorry. - No, I...

59
00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.429
I should be the one apologizing.

60
00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:45.729
I couldn't even protect you, and you had to go through a lot.

61
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.599
But still, you should have suppressed yourself.

62
00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.440
You didn't need to go down to his level.

63
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.200
My manager...

64
00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:53.969
seems to be so loyal to me.

65
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.779
I can hear the waves. You must be enjoying yourself at sea.

66
00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.479
I'm not just enjoying myself.

67
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.109
I'm following my dreams.

68
00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:05.479
You want to catch a black porgy...

69
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.719
so that you can make it on the cover of a fishing magazine?

70
00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:08.820
Yes.

71
00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:23.469
Would you give this to Anthony?

72
00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:24.469
All right.

73
00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.229
Did something happen to Anthony?

74
00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:50.830
Why?

75
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.299
Did something happen?

76
00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:55.869
It's his birthday today.

77
00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.010
It was his birthday then too.

78
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.080
You know, when I took the picture that we saw together.

79
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.679
The one I took with him.

80
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.520
- Yes. - What happened...

81
00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:12.650
on that day?

82
00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:15.489
His mother was sick.

83
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.520
- His mother? - Yes.

84
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.560
But...

85
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.090
his father was in the countryside,

86
00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.029
so my mom and I went to the emergency room.

87
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.969
The nurse kept asking us if she took any pills,

88
00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:34.810
if she had high blood pressure, if she's allergic to any food,

89
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:36.779
if she had been sick recently,

90
00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.150
or if she took aspirin. She was firing off these questions.

91
00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.150
And I was so scared.

92
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.750
But then, I saw him running towards us from faraway.

93
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.419
So I...

94
00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:56.760
I cried.

95
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.229
I'd never considered him my brother until then...

96
00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.099
or had eaten with him.

97
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:05.299
I hadn't even looked at him properly.

98
00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:06.869
That day, I wailed...

99
00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.010
in his arms.

100
00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.580
- My brother is... - Really cool.

101
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.679
I know that. I know it very well.

102
00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.219
Do you know how great he is?

103
00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.229
He's so great...

104
00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:36.640
that I don't stand a chance against him.

105
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.239
I know that.

106
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.849
No, I don't know. I don't want to know.

107
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:13.710
(The tenth story: Love Wind Love Song)

108
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.510
(The tenth story: Love Wind Love Song)

109
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.349
Mi Dal, can you bring my shoes?

110
00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:24.549
Okay.

111
00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.930
What's taking her so long?

112
00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:59.219
- Sorry. Sorry. - I'm so sorry.

113
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.960
Are you...

114
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.930
"Dew on the Swordtip"? No, right?

115
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.099
- "Forceful Moonlight"? - Yes.

116
00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:21.070
It's you. We met at the summer get-together.

117
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.440
Yes, the lamb skewer place in Sinchon.

118
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.540
What a coincidence.

119
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.649
- You're so pretty now. - Stop it.

120
00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:33.219
At midnight tonight on the Galleria server,

121
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.149
they'll hand out the Moon Sword of Tears to 100 people.

122
00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:39.060
Really? That's a really rare item.

123
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.229
Do you know where the closest internet cafe is?

124
00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:43.090
We might have to go to Seogwipo.

125
00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:45.530
Would you...

126
00:09:46.599 --> 00:09:48.899
like to go with me?

127
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.810
Shall I give you the opportunity to take me to an internet cafe?

128
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.739
- Yes. - Okay.

129
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.749
Sa Jin Jin left this for you.

130
00:10:01.749 --> 00:10:02.849
Thanks.

131
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.300
The sky is beautiful. Because it's a special day.

132
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.210
Congratulations. From Sa Jin Jin.

133
00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:40.050
He's the chairman of National Chemicals Korea.

134
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.119
You're beautiful on screen...

135
00:10:44.119 --> 00:10:46.759
but even more so in person.

136
00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:48.690
You came all the way to Jeju,

137
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.629
so I thought I should at least treat you to a meal.

138
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:54.070
Thank you.

139
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.670
I heard that you and Mr. Gong here...

140
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.440
are childhood friends.

141
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.310
What an interesting coincidence.

142
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.479
It is.

143
00:11:04.479 --> 00:11:06.979
Are you sure you're just friends?

144
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:10.950
You're both single and very good-looking.

145
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.519
Isn't there a possibility you'll end up together?

146
00:11:13.749 --> 00:11:16.989
Not at all, sir. We're friends.

147
00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:19.560
Oh, I see.

148
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.229
I've been trying to find Mr. Gong a date,

149
00:11:22.229 --> 00:11:24.359
but he kept refusing.

150
00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:27.369
I wondered if there was another reason.

151
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.739
You don't have to worry about that.

152
00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:33.469
Then may I ask you something?

153
00:11:34.609 --> 00:11:37.210
Objectively speaking, what do you think...

154
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.940
of Mr. Gong?

155
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.009
He's tall, quite fit,

156
00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:44.680
is pretty intellectual, and has great fashion sense.

157
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.320
Don't you think he'd stand out even when...

158
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.090
compared to your fellow actors?

159
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.389
He would.

160
00:11:51.859 --> 00:11:54.690
I believe you think too highly of me.

161
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.229
I have very high standards.

162
00:11:57.229 --> 00:11:59.229
That's why I'm trying to...

163
00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:02.430
get you to meet my niece.

164
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.800
Meet her.

165
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.540
Like you said, I like you.

166
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.469
Would I introduce you to someone mediocre?

167
00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:11.910
Did Secretary Kang pass you her number?

168
00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:13.649
Yes, he did.

169
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.249
- Did you set a date? - Not yet.

170
00:12:17.249 --> 00:12:19.820
Are you free this weekend?

171
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:26.759
I'll call your niece once I return to Seoul.

172
00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:29.259
It's good to work hard while you're young,

173
00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.430
but you can't just work.

174
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.129
It's meaningful to...

175
00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:36.469
meet someone, settle down, and start a family.

176
00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:40.410
- Isn't that the truth? - It is.

177
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.840
Ji Won should meet someone special.

178
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.950
See? She agrees with me.

179
00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:50.849
We should eat now.

180
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.090
- Come on, eat up. - Sure.

181
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.599
It was good to meet you. I'll see you again one day.

182
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.450
I'll see you later.

183
00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.560
- Jin Jin, let's get back. - Okay.

184
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.499
Why isn't it working?

185
00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:41.300
- It's not working? - No.

186
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.239
- I'll go and get a new one. - Okay.

187
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.710
Now that I walked you back, I'll call it an end to a long day.

188
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.680
- You did well. - Thanks.

189
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.379
Here's your key card.

190
00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:00.450
Thanks.

191
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:10.330
- I'm in suite 3000? - I'm in 3005.

192
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.030
- Yes, that's yours. - Okay.

193
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.099
Your suitcase is in my room. I'll bring it to you.

194
00:14:16.099 --> 00:14:18.840
- Give it to me now. - It's this way.

195

196
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.780
(Congratulations. From Sa Jin Jin)

197
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.560
I apologize for what happened.

198
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.499
(I apologize for what happened.)

199
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.139
(Delete)

200
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.810
Thank you.

201
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.979
(New message)

202
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:47.690
Is that you?

203
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.060
How did you get in?

204
00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:54.330
I thought it was my room. Our key cards got swapped.

205
00:16:56.899 --> 00:16:58.700
Why did it have to be us two?

206
00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:07.010
Because we're friends.

207
00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.280
I'm not going on the blind date.

208
00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:20.689
Why are you telling me this?

209
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.899
Because we're friends.

210
00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:39.470
Go.

211
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:43.040
You should go.

212
00:17:45.609 --> 00:17:46.750
Hurry up, and go.

213
00:19:08.929 --> 00:19:10.129
Hello.

214
00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:21.369
I printed out and left a precedent on your desk. Did you see it?

215
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:23.439
Yes, I did. Thank you.

216
00:19:23.439 --> 00:19:26.780
Each precedent is important, so make sure you look at each one.

217
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:27.980
Okay.

218
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.520
Have you looked over the preparatory documents?

219
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.649
Yes.

220
00:19:31.649 --> 00:19:33.590
Then it seems like you're almost ready.

221
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.490
Oh, I have a few more things I have to take.

222
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.689
(Throat Candy)

223
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.429
Before my trial, I must keep my throat clear.

224
00:19:44.899 --> 00:19:48.399
And I tend to get thirsty whenever I'm nervous.

225
00:19:51.139 --> 00:19:53.169
I'd be flustered if my pen stopped working.

226
00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:01.810
I don't usually sweat,

227
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.149
but you never know.

228
00:20:05.349 --> 00:20:07.050
- Lawyer Jang. - Yes?

229
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.720
I think there's someone who's probably more nervous than you.

230
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.659
Oh, you?

231
00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:16.090
Don't be nervous. I'll do my best and do very well.

232
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.230
Not me.

233
00:20:17.929 --> 00:20:18.959
Your client.

234
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.869
It's your first trial, but it's a first for your client too.

235
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.399
Right.

236
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.280
Hello, sir.

237
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.220
I'm Jang Young Shim, the lawyer in charge of your case.

238
00:20:44.389 --> 00:20:47.830
I thought you might be worried before your first trial.

239
00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:51.730
If you have time, you can come and see the trial.

240
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.939
If you have anything you'd like to say to the judge, you can.

241
00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.540
Oh, okay. Of course.

242
00:21:01.609 --> 00:21:06.040
Then I'll do my best to explain your frustrating situation to the judge.

243
00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:08.810
Okay.

244
00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:42.609
What's this?

245
00:21:42.879 --> 00:21:44.480
Is this really a moisturizer?

246
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.159
You didn't bring any products?

247
00:21:56.959 --> 00:21:58.000
I didn't.

248
00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:00.699
My gosh.

249
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:08.409
Chul Min.

250
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:11.409
- You're here. - Yes.

251
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.010
I took the first flight because I thought you went out fishing...

252
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.550
the first thing after the sunrise.

253
00:22:15.879 --> 00:22:17.879
What's gotten into you? You were here like a good boy.

254
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.580
I'm not going fishing.

255
00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:21.389
You always go crazy whenever you're here.

256
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.790
You talk about black porgy, striped beakperch, and ice fish...

257
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.020
again, again, and again.

258
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.929
I can't do that if I'm here to work.

259
00:22:27.129 --> 00:22:29.490
I couldn't even sleep because I was devoutly thinking about...

260
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.199
how I'd do the shooting and what my concept should be.

261
00:22:32.199 --> 00:22:33.429
Are you sure it was about work?

262
00:22:34.199 --> 00:22:37.099
You couldn't sleep because you were too excited...

263
00:22:37.099 --> 00:22:38.340
about meeting Jin Jin, right?

264
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.470
Yes.

265
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.240
- What? - I'm joking.

266
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:43.040
You're not joking.

267
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.439
- I'm not. - What?

268
00:22:45.879 --> 00:22:47.250
Be honest. Are you serious?

269
00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:50.149
I am.

270
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.959
Gosh, life would be so boring if I couldn't make fun of you.

271
00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:59.389
I always have the most fun whenever I make fun of you.

272
00:23:05.399 --> 00:23:06.459
Here.

273
00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:08.470
You said you had to go work.

274
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.340
I'm fine. I don't need that.

275
00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.000
The sun is really bright. It's not okay.

276
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.859
I heard you're doing the honeymoon episode for "We Got Married" today.

277
00:23:33.959 --> 00:23:34.990
Yes.

278
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.959
What will you do? Where do you want to go?

279
00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:38.929
I'm not sure. I haven't thought about that.

280
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.869
Well, you're on Jeju Island.

281
00:23:42.699 --> 00:23:43.939
It'll be beautiful no matter where you are.

282
00:23:46.199 --> 00:23:47.609
Of course, it's great.

283
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:52.139
Happy honeymoon!

284
00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:56.280
Here's your mission card for the Jeju Island special.

285
00:23:57.619 --> 00:23:59.619
(Traveling in Jeju Island)

286
00:24:08.429 --> 00:24:09.689
- "Happy honeymoon." - "Happy honeymoon."

287
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.159
- "Plan your honeymoon." - "Plan your honeymoon."

288
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:18.070
Jeju Island.

289
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.340
(Anything you wish to do on Jeju Island?)

290
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.010
It's all about fishing.

291
00:24:21.709 --> 00:24:24.310
In April and May, you can catch damselfish...

292
00:24:24.709 --> 00:24:28.810
(It's as if he's an honorary ambassador for fishing.)

293
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.580
(Her husband knows everything about the fishing calendar.)

294
00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.490
(So what's your plan for this honeymoon?)

295
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.889
Oh, the honeymoon.

296
00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:38.760
The honeymoon...

297
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.760
I debuted really early, and I was really busy in my 20s.

298
00:24:45.129 --> 00:24:47.129
So I never got a chance to go backpacking.

299
00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:50.599
I want to put on jeans and a backpack...

300
00:24:50.599 --> 00:24:53.369
and then travel around Jeju Island.

301
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.689
This is so awesome.

302
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.490
Jin Jin, you're good at riding bicycles.

303
00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:17.060
Yes, my dad taught me when I was young.

304
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.230
I was too scared to ride it at first,

305
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.500
but he said he'd be holding me, so I had nothing to worry.

306
00:25:23.129 --> 00:25:25.199
I finally got the courage to start pedaling.

307
00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:28.139
When I looked back, my dad was so far away.

308
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.980
I started screaming because I was so scared,

309
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.310
but I realized I was pedaling forward.

310
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.780
I was scared back then, but I'm glad I learned to ride the bicycle.

311
00:25:39.179 --> 00:25:41.050
I got to ride it today.

312
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.389
Anthony, hurry up.

313
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.260
I'll hurry.

314
00:25:50.699 --> 00:25:52.300
Jin Jin, catch that.

315
00:25:52.459 --> 00:25:53.699
I'll move them to your side.

316
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.470
Oh, no! I lost it.

317
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:07.550
You did it.

318
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.310
- That's it. - I got it.

319
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:16.820
- Wow, not bad. - That's amazing.

320
00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:21.790
Stop it.

321
00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:24.560
(Olle Trail, Sorang Village)

322
00:26:31.639 --> 00:26:33.040
I love this trail.

323
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.639
Jin Jin.

324
00:27:20.619 --> 00:27:22.619
Let's take a picture together.

325
00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:24.060
- Together? - Yes.

326
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.699
- Ji Won. - Yes?

327
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.470
When's the blind date with the Chairman's niece?

328
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.980
- I'm not going to do it. - Why not?

329
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.980
You don't want to be a son-in-law to a conglomerate?

330
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.619
You don't need to keep secrets from me. I'm good at keeping secrets.

331
00:27:51.619 --> 00:27:54.520
- I don't have any secrets. - What is it?

332
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.659
Is it because of Sa Jin Jin?

333
00:27:58.959 --> 00:28:01.659
See? I was right. See?

334
00:28:03.629 --> 00:28:06.230
You guys are dating, right? You're not just friends.

335
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.869
- It's nothing like that. - There's obviously something.

336
00:28:08.869 --> 00:28:12.369
Gosh, if it's true, then tell me. If not, go on the blind date.

337
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.270
If you're not going, let me go instead.

338
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.609
I'd love to be his son-in-law.

339
00:28:18.709 --> 00:28:20.810
So that's what this was all about.

340
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.179
- Manager Kim. - Yes?

341
00:28:23.179 --> 00:28:24.750
Why did you come to Jeju Island?

342
00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:27.919
- I came here to work. - Then why aren't you?

343
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.959
- I'm going to. - Let's get some work done.

344
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:30.990
All right.

345
00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:44.340
Yes?

346
00:28:45.369 --> 00:28:47.540
You couldn't follow me?

347
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.010
We must have missed each other.

348
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.810
All right. I'll be there soon.

349
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.250
- Then I'll wait here. - Okay.

350
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.250
Bye.

351
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.590
(Women Divers' Changing Room)

352
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.369
Let's just leave them be.

353
00:29:18.369 --> 00:29:21.169
- Will they be okay by themselves? - Don't worry.

354
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:23.169
Something fun will happen.

355
00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:25.840
- This is the real thing. - Okay.

356
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.250
Okay.

357
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.800
Producer Bong seems to have missed us.

358
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.070
We need to wait for another 30 minutes.

359
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.300
- Let's drink coffee while we wait. - Shall we?

360
00:29:53.609 --> 00:29:55.470
- Two cups of coffee, please. - Okay.

361
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.050
(I'm not always happy, but there are things to be happy about every day.)

362
00:30:09.689 --> 00:30:11.820
(I'm not always happy, but there are things to be happy about every day.)

363
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.659
- This... - What is it?

364
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:23.939
I'm looking for the person who made this.

365
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.480
Who made this?

366
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.109
- This... - Did someone here make this?

367
00:30:33.109 --> 00:30:36.520
No, we got this from the Cosmos Workshop.

368
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.949
Where is it?

369
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.669
I wanted to ask you if you could give us free time for two hours.

370
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.270
I'm sorry.

371
00:31:03.639 --> 00:31:05.909
Yes, it's something personal.

372
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.349
Let's go.

373
00:31:15.419 --> 00:31:18.689
- What? - Let's go find that person.

374
00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:20.459
Let's go together.

375
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.699
- Oh, my. - Where did they go?

376
00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:35.709
(Cosmos Workshop)

377
00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:42.149
- Is it locked? - I think so.

378
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.399
(I'm not always happy, but there are things to be happy about every day.)
