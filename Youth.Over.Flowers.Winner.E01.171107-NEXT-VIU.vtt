(Youth Over Flowers: Winner)

7
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:51.751
- Let's go. - Let's go.

8
00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:52.982
Let's go.

9
00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:56.351

(Leader, vocal, youngest)

12

(Kim Jin Woo)

14
00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:08.002
(Vocal, oldest who looks like the youngest)

15
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:09.701
My gosh!

16
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.672
(Extremely frivolous)

17
00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:17.311

(Special guest quokka)

(Let's take a selfie.)

25
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:39.032
No.

26
00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.472
- That looks like a kangaroo. - Right.

27
00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:47.412
(It's taking place in West Australia.)

28
00:01:47.412 --> 00:01:49.412
- National Geography. - I saw it.

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:52.841
(Average age 25.5)

30

(The youngest Youth Over Flowers of all times)

31
00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:01.151
(They began the journey in prison uniforms,)

32
00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:07.232
(but returned as Winner.)

33
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:11.862
(How did this happen...)

34
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.702
(in the first place?)

35
00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:19.142
(Before we start the long story...)

36
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:31.322
(They debuted 4 years ago with a song titled "Empty".)

37
00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:37.121
(They recently made a great hit with "Really Really",)

38
00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:42.691
(and spent the busiest time since their debut.)

39
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:44.702
(But this happened!)

40
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:50.031
("New Journey to the West" season 4 began with shaving Min Ho's head.)

41
00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.172
I prepared many events.

42
00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:54.811
(The wheel was for fun.)

43
00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:57.411
If I get it here, I get Lamborghini.

44
00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:58.811
It's so tiny.

45
00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:00.452
Porsche 911.

46
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.352
That's so tiny.

47
00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:04.952
(Min Ho aims at something.)

48
00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.792
(He unnecessarily spun 15 times,)

49
00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:12.922
(then he pointed at Lamborghini,)

50
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:15.792
(and then Porsche.)

51
00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:20.401
(This is how he became Finger Song.)

52
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.102
(Staffs need to cover 650,000 dollars.)

53
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.371
(My gosh.)

54
00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:29.242
I'm sorry. I'll apologize.

55
00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:31.482
You're sorry?

56
00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:35.281
(But an apology won't do,)

57
00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:42.392
(so the staff sold dream and hope instead of Lamborghini,)

58
00:03:43.552 --> 00:03:47.232
(and Min Ho wished for Youth Over Flower with Winner.)

59
00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:50.131
(And...)

60
00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:55.471
(the final Dragon Ball mission)

61
00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:59.272
(The moment staffs were doomed.)

62
00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:04.482
(Once again, Min Ho worked miracle,)

63
00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:10.012
(and that's how Youth Over Flower was made possible.)

64
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:13.581
(Min Ho cries, and so does the staffs.)

65
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:17.962
But the thing is all Winner members must agree.

66
00:04:18.162 --> 00:04:19.962
We've talked about it a lot.

67
00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:21.592
We always wanted to try Youth Over Flower.

68
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:25.831
(Before Min Ho joined "New Journey to the West")

69
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:27.271
Is there any variety shows you want to try?

70
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:29.032
There are so many.

71
00:04:29.032 --> 00:04:30.641
What do you want to try, Min Ho?

72
00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:32.472
I want to try Youth Over Flower.

73
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.511
(He wanted to try Youth Over Flower more than anything.)

74
00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:40.212
Hello.

75
00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:41.352
(He informs this happy news to his members.)

76
00:04:41.811 --> 00:04:43.451
Are you all together?

77
00:04:45.422 --> 00:04:46.621
Look at your hair.

78
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.792
Your hair is so hilarious.

79
00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:51.292
I have an important announcement.

80
00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:52.662
(It's so noisy because of his hair before the important announcement.)

81
00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:54.162
I'm going to make an important announcement.

82
00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:55.792
What's that?

83
00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:59.862
In "New Journey to the West"...

84
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.331
(The manager sensed something and started filming with his phone.)

85
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:03.501
Oh, you're hypebeast.

86
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.672
All Winner members...

87
00:05:06.842 --> 00:05:09.042
All four of us...

88
00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:12.282
(He's taking time.)

89
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:14.282
- What? - What?

90
00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:18.451
I wished on going Youth Over Flower with all four of us,

91
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.852
- Really? - and we can go because I succeeded!

92
00:05:20.852 --> 00:05:22.891
(We can go on Youth Over Flower.)

93
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.292
- Are you serious? - Really?

94
00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:28.831
(He smiles like a mother.)

95
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:29.992
I'm serious.

96
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.102
How?

97
00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:35.732
What are you?

98
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.501
- Me? - How did you do that?

99
00:05:39.102 --> 00:05:40.302
(So happy that they said something they didn't mean)

100
00:05:40.302 --> 00:05:42.742
- How did you do that? - "What are you?"

101
00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.881
- Hello. - Congratulations.

102
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:46.381
Have fun.

103
00:05:46.542 --> 00:05:48.181
Thank you.

104
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.922
- They're so excited. - Are you happy?

105
00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:52.482
- This is awesome. - Are we really going?

106
00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:53.891
You've gained weight, Min Ho.

107
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:55.352
(Applause to celebrate himself)

108
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:57.792
I can't believe it. Youth Over Flower.

109
00:05:58.592 --> 00:05:59.691
When are we leaving by the way?

110
00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:01.992
- Us? - Yes.

111
00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:04.162
- Let's leave tomorrow. - Tomorrow?

112
00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:08.571
(So they began waiting for Youth Over Flower.)

113
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.571
(We left our passports at tvN security office.)

114
00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:11.371
(They volunteered to give their passports.)

115
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.441
(They're ready to be caught.)

116
00:06:15.271 --> 00:06:17.712
(Youth Over Flower actually...)

117
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:20.581
(begins when they're not ready...)

118
00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:24.321
(without knowing who they're going with and where they're going.)

119
00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:28.621
(They're supposed to be amazed.)

120
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:32.061
(That's how it should be.)

121
00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:35.761
I thought if I were a staff,

122
00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:38.931
it'd be very difficult.

123
00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:41.371
Many people know about this,

124
00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:42.931
and so do we.

125
00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.742
I was wondering how you're going to kidnap us.

126
00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:47.672
("The producer asks to pretend as if you don't know anything")

127
00:06:47.672 --> 00:06:50.782
(So we even asked them.)

128
00:06:50.782 --> 00:06:52.982
("I always doubt first and dress up for everything")

129
00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:56.511
(They never go off guard.)

130
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:01.891
(How to kidnap someone who knows he'll be kidnapped?)

131
00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:04.521
(1st, find an assistant.)

132
00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:07.931
(The first assistant)

133
00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:11.131
None of their managers are aware.

134
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.902
They don't know when they're leaving.

135
00:07:12.902 --> 00:07:14.972
I didn't share it with them.

136
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:16.672
Are they still in doubt?

137
00:07:16.672 --> 00:07:17.701
Yes.

138
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.811
They don't ask me straight up,

139
00:07:21.472 --> 00:07:24.311
but they'd be like, "It's about time now."

140
00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:27.282
Even if they ask me, I say I don't know anything.

141
00:07:27.412 --> 00:07:29.112
They're only guessing.

142
00:07:29.352 --> 00:07:31.422
(Have you heard anything about Youth Over Flower?)

143
00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:33.521
(Seriously, there's nothing.)

144
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:35.152
(He's lying.)

145
00:07:35.152 --> 00:07:36.621
(It'll be fun. I'm excited.)

146
00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:39.521
I've been telling all the managers...

147
00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:42.561
to film them every time they have meals.

148
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:44.162
We have this.

149
00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:46.862
(With the help of assistants,)

150
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:50.742
(we decided to observe Winner.)

151
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.441
(Kang Seung Yoon on one ordinary day)

152
00:07:56.011 --> 00:07:58.641
(Song Min Ho on one ordinary day)

153
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:02.052
(Heavy bag)

154
00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:04.881
My bag was always packed.

155
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:08.191
I had a notebook, medicine, and a toothbrush.

156
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:09.852
Things that I need.

157
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:13.521
Seung Yoon did this too.

158
00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:15.631
We always dressed up.

159
00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:20.571
Even when I went to a supermarket in front of our house,

160
00:08:20.902 --> 00:08:22.402
I wore a pink jacket.

161
00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:26.042
I dressed up just in case.

162
00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:29.411
(This is how they dressed up at home to be ready.)

163
00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:31.082
- Hello. - Hello.

164
00:08:31.082 --> 00:08:33.982
(Min Ho always dressed up nicely even when he had no plans.)

165
00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:37.051
(His bag was always heavy.)

166
00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:39.952
(Seung Yoon as well)

167
00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.791
(His bag is packed.)

168
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:45.161
(When the staff found out, they asked their manager for help.)

169
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:48.592
If the members left anything in the car,

170
00:08:48.592 --> 00:08:50.732
take it out before they notice.

171
00:08:50.732 --> 00:08:53.202
Jin Woo barely carries anything with him.

172
00:08:53.202 --> 00:08:55.771
Seung Yoon and Min Ho always carry a bag with them,

173
00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:59.041
but Seung Hoon and Jin Woo have nothing.

174
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.202
- They only have cellphones. - I see.

175
00:09:00.411 --> 00:09:02.041
(But,)

176
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:05.881
(Jin Woo who never carried anything with him...)

177
00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:08.911
(suddenly showed up with a bag.)

178
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.582
(Even at the autograph event,)

179
00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:14.452
(he kept it with him.)

180
00:09:15.891 --> 00:09:18.291
(He keeps wearing it.)

181
00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:21.661
That was for this.

182
00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:23.391
For this.

183
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:27.031
I thought I should bring some money with me,

184
00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:28.531
and I had a credit card inside it.

185
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.742
I normally don't bring credit cards.

186
00:09:31.972 --> 00:09:33.842
Fans asked me too.

187
00:09:33.942 --> 00:09:36.171
They asked me what's inside the bag.

188
00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.411
I just said...

189
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.881
there are snacks inside.

190
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.482
Since then it became a snack bag.

191
00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:44.082
(A snack bag with a credit card inside)

192
00:09:44.182 --> 00:09:45.582
Where's the bag now?

193
00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:47.891
It's in the house.

194
00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:53.062
They don't say anything,

195
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:56.992
but they think they could leave at any time.

196
00:09:57.332 --> 00:09:59.102
All our schedules...

197
00:09:59.562 --> 00:10:02.271
We doubted all our schedules.

198
00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:04.202
We were like,

199
00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:06.801
"What is this?"

200
00:10:07.242 --> 00:10:08.671
"Are we leaving now?"

201
00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.041
- When you had a schedule? - Yes.

202
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.281
We thought on the way back home...

203
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:15.982
we could be dragged to the airport...

204
00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:18.381
all sweaty.

205
00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:21.051
(How to kidnap someone who knows he'll be kidnapped?)

206
00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:23.452
(2nd, try to fool them.)

207
00:10:24.492 --> 00:10:28.131
(Sechskies 20th anniversary concert on September 23)

208
00:10:29.031 --> 00:10:30.962
(Winner will be on as guest singers.)

209
00:10:31.062 --> 00:10:32.962
Because of Sechskies...

210
00:10:32.962 --> 00:10:35.171
(Winner managers are also Sechskies managers.)

211
00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:37.771
(With the support of managers,)

212
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:41.871
(The youngest producer of "New Journey to the West" in disguise)

213
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:45.182
(At the parking lot where Winner will arrive,)

214
00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:48.212
(we parked a tvN shooting van upfront.)

215
00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:50.822
(We decided to watch their reactions.)

216
00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:53.952
(We started shooting as if we're concert staffs.)

217
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:58.121
(Min Ho can't see what's in front of him.)

218
00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:01.791
(Seung Hoon's off guard.)

219
00:11:02.492 --> 00:11:05.001
(They all pass by without any suspicion.)

220
00:11:06.202 --> 00:11:08.031
(Jin Woo arrives.)

221
00:11:09.472 --> 00:11:10.842
(He automatically says hello to the shooting staff.)

222
00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:14.671
(He's carrying the precious snack bag again.)

223
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.242
(Then he runs fast.)

224
00:11:19.442 --> 00:11:21.511
(Lastly, Seung Yoon arrives.)

225
00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:27.722
(He also just passes by.)

226
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:32.322
I don't think they're suspicious.

227
00:11:32.322 --> 00:11:33.692
Really? They're usually very suspicious.

228
00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:36.131
Seung Hoon usually asks directly,

229
00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:37.801
"What's that car?"

230
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:40.932
Since he didn't ask me, I don't think they know.

231
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:44.742
(They can't do anything even if they get kidnapped now.)

232
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:49.072
(The youngest producer became bored.)

233
00:11:49.972 --> 00:11:52.041
I don't think they noticed at all.

234
00:11:54.112 --> 00:11:56.182
(He's excited.)

235
00:11:57.352 --> 00:12:01.452
Not at all. They have no idea.

236
00:12:01.992 --> 00:12:04.021
(Oh, love)

237
00:12:07.605 --> 00:12:09.845
(The youngest producer was on the phone carelessly.)

238
00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:13.745
(Min Ho brings his face up to her.)

239
00:12:14.437 --> 00:12:16.366
(Suspicion)

240
00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:19.407
(Did he notice?)

241
00:12:21.647 --> 00:12:23.076
(But he just turns around.)

242
00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.017
Yes. You can use that.

243
00:12:26.777 --> 00:12:29.647
(Winner at peace)

244
00:12:30.856 --> 00:12:33.517
(They finished their performance safely.)

245
00:12:34.356 --> 00:12:36.586
(They're going back home safely.)

246
00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:41.096
Awesome Sechskies.

247
00:12:41.366 --> 00:12:43.226
(Even though we're filming Winner at Sechskies concert,)

248
00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:44.866
(they're not suspicious at all.)

249
00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:46.637
Bye.

250
00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:51.007
(We must've overestimated Winner.)

251
00:12:51.007 --> 00:12:52.106
Bye.

252
00:12:52.106 --> 00:12:55.277
(It must not be true that they doubt every time they have a schedule.)

253
00:12:57.376 --> 00:12:59.277
(We thought it'd be easy to deceive Winner at this point.)

254
00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:01.116
- I don't know. - You didn't know?

255
00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:04.616
- The girl with a hat. - We know her?

256
00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.687
- She's from a broadcasting station. - Really?

257
00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:08.356
- She's from a broadcasting station. - Really?

258
00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:11.397
(Winner knew.)

259
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.333
Why is there tvN?

260
00:13:13.963 --> 00:13:15.103
Scary.

261
00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:18.504
Are we really going to Daejeon tomorrow?

262
00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:20.343
(Do we really have a schedule tomorrow?)

263
00:13:21.044 --> 00:13:22.573
It might not be true.

264
00:13:22.573 --> 00:13:24.113
(Winner knew everything, but they pretended like they don't.)

265
00:13:24.113 --> 00:13:26.443
Why is Ho Seop in this car?

266
00:13:26.443 --> 00:13:29.014
I have shooting on Tuesday. I can't go.

267
00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:30.113
That might be a lie.

268
00:13:30.113 --> 00:13:32.953
Seung Yoon could join us later.

269
00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:34.353
That's possible.

270
00:13:34.353 --> 00:13:38.093
Some people join the show later.

271
00:13:38.093 --> 00:13:39.994
Right.

272
00:13:40.823 --> 00:13:42.924
We don't have anything after Monday.

273
00:13:42.924 --> 00:13:44.063
Wait.

274
00:13:44.463 --> 00:13:46.563
I'm not ready yet. I haven't even packed yet.

275
00:13:46.563 --> 00:13:47.764
Where is it?

276
00:13:47.764 --> 00:13:50.034
I have to go home now,

277
00:13:50.634 --> 00:13:52.504
and pack for seven days.

278
00:13:54.174 --> 00:13:56.374
(But it was fake.)

279
00:13:56.914 --> 00:13:58.113
Are you going to eat anything?

280
00:13:58.113 --> 00:13:59.874
No, we're fine.

281
00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:01.813
We're waiting.

282
00:14:01.813 --> 00:14:04.713
(Nothing happened.)

283
00:14:05.654 --> 00:14:08.154
What if it's tomorrow after we're done?

284
00:14:08.384 --> 00:14:10.654
- I can't make it tomorrow. - Monday...

285
00:14:11.254 --> 00:14:13.664
(How to kidnap someone who knows he'll be kidnapped?)

286
00:14:13.664 --> 00:14:15.994
(3rd, it's war time.)

287
00:14:16.463 --> 00:14:18.394
They're expecting...

288
00:14:18.394 --> 00:14:21.164
to leave sometime in September.

289
00:14:21.534 --> 00:14:25.233
They think they'll leave in the middle of September.

290
00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:30.613
(So we decided to leave in October.)

291
00:14:32.073 --> 00:14:33.943
(The thing is how are we going to kidnap them?)

292
00:14:34.983 --> 00:14:39.384
Since they're not on TV often,

293
00:14:39.514 --> 00:14:41.384
when they have events or shoot commercials,

294
00:14:41.953 --> 00:14:43.494
or when they go recording,

295
00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:47.093
they're most likely to be off guard.

296
00:14:47.093 --> 00:14:49.394
The thing is when they have events,

297
00:14:49.394 --> 00:14:52.093
it's also on the internet.

298
00:14:52.534 --> 00:14:54.634
(Director Choi Jung Soo, YG advertising team.)

299
00:14:54.634 --> 00:14:57.333
If I say they're shooting a vehicle commercial,

300
00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:00.174
they'll be amazed,

301
00:15:00.174 --> 00:15:02.703
but excited to do it.

302
00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:06.843
But in the recent commercial,

303
00:15:06.843 --> 00:15:09.544
Winner members talked about it.

304
00:15:09.544 --> 00:15:11.713
They said they want to shoot a vehicle commercial.

305
00:15:13.054 --> 00:15:16.723
(So we lied that they have a vehicle commercial.)

306
00:15:16.723 --> 00:15:17.723
(Are we shooting a commercial on October 10?)

307
00:15:17.723 --> 00:15:21.394
(Yes.)

308
00:15:21.994 --> 00:15:23.894
Every time we shoot a commercial,

309
00:15:24.463 --> 00:15:27.634
there's a manager named Byung Young.

310
00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:31.833
He texts each member separately...

311
00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:33.804
about the money and how long it will be on.

312
00:15:33.804 --> 00:15:35.804
(He informs them about the money and the contract conditions.)

313
00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:38.343
He even sent me the text. I was excited.

314
00:15:38.744 --> 00:15:40.213
(He gave them the exact amount to deceive them.)

315
00:15:40.213 --> 00:15:41.683
Everyone was excited.

316
00:15:42.113 --> 00:15:43.483
(The thing is...)

317
00:15:43.483 --> 00:15:45.384
(how are we going to shoot a vehicle commercial?)

318
00:15:45.853 --> 00:15:49.254
To tell you a brief story,

319
00:15:49.254 --> 00:15:51.754
there is an idol group...

320
00:15:51.754 --> 00:15:53.924
named Winner.

321
00:15:55.463 --> 00:15:59.693
(This famous commercial is also Director Chun Sung Jae's work.)

322
00:16:00.363 --> 00:16:02.034
I don't know...

323
00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:04.774
why we have to invite a real commercial director.

324
00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:07.004
I can't believe we're having a meeting here.

325
00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:09.343
Here's our plan.

326
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:11.413
When you watch a drama,

327
00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:14.714
you put the car on a trailer for shooting.

328
00:16:14.984 --> 00:16:17.454
We get Winner in the car,

329
00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:20.054
and drive to Incheon airport.

330
00:16:20.054 --> 00:16:21.524
(In short,)

331
00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:23.923
Okay.

332
00:16:23.923 --> 00:16:25.954
(we're going to kidnap them in a car.)

333
00:16:26.893 --> 00:16:29.593
We want to dress them in something funny.

334
00:16:29.863 --> 00:16:33.833
One of the members is shooting a drama about prison.

335
00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:35.464
We got the idea from that,

336
00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:37.073
and we're thinking about prison uniforms.

337
00:16:37.073 --> 00:16:38.903
(Prison Uniforms)

338
00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:41.373
Prison uniforms sounds fun,

339
00:16:41.373 --> 00:16:44.944
but I'm not sure if they'll fall for it.

340
00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:47.244
They must look cool for a vehicle commercial. Will they wear it?

341
00:16:47.514 --> 00:16:49.014
(So!)

342
00:16:49.313 --> 00:16:51.313
She's in charge of outfit.

343
00:16:51.313 --> 00:16:54.353
I'm in charge of makeup, and he's in charge of hair.

344
00:16:54.984 --> 00:16:57.593
We're planning to dress them in prison uniforms.

345
00:16:58.054 --> 00:17:00.093
- Prison? - Like Papillon.

346
00:17:00.294 --> 00:17:01.623
It'll be hilarious.

347
00:17:02.994 --> 00:17:04.194
In a trailer?

348
00:17:04.194 --> 00:17:06.333
I want to make them wear the hat too.

349
00:17:07.004 --> 00:17:09.464
- That will be hilarious. - Let's make Seung Yoon wear it.

350
00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:11.734
(Prison uniforms are ready.)

351
00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:16.343
I'll say there's a collaboration...

352
00:17:17.014 --> 00:17:18.373
between the car and Winner,

353
00:17:18.373 --> 00:17:20.643
so we're planning to shoot...

354
00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:22.744
as if we're shooting a music video...

355
00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:25.054
with their song.

356
00:17:25.583 --> 00:17:29.184
(Winner's song "Island" says this.)

357
00:17:29.823 --> 00:17:33.764
(I'll save you from the gray building prison)

358
00:17:34.464 --> 00:17:38.333
(I'll save you from the gray building prison)

359
00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:42.204
(So the theme is they're shooting a commercial for a new car, "I-Land".)

360
00:17:42.964 --> 00:17:45.373
(They receive a long text message from Manager Jang.)

361
00:17:45.373 --> 00:17:47.444
(It's all a big fat lie,)

362
00:17:48.373 --> 00:17:51.744
(but they fell for it.)

363
00:17:51.744 --> 00:17:53.613
(2 days before the departure)

364
00:17:54.413 --> 00:17:55.583
Hello.

365
00:17:57.214 --> 00:17:59.083
("New Journey to the West" is having a small get together.)

366
00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.454
Did you have dinner?

367
00:18:01.454 --> 00:18:03.353
I'm fine. I'm on a diet.

368
00:18:04.054 --> 00:18:05.994
I have a shooting the day after tomorrow.

369
00:18:06.224 --> 00:18:08.724
I have a vehicle commercial.

370
00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.863
(He wanted to show off.)

371
00:18:12.494 --> 00:18:14.264
(The day of departure.)

372
00:18:15.004 --> 00:18:16.663
(Finally, it's the day.)

373
00:18:18.103 --> 00:18:20.373
(This is where Winner will shoot the fake commercial.)

374
00:18:21.573 --> 00:18:23.843
(The lights are set in the studio.)

375
00:18:24.573 --> 00:18:26.573
(The white fabric goes up too.)

376
00:18:27.913 --> 00:18:30.383
(Finally, the car enters.)

377
00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:32.514
(The car's already released,)

378
00:18:32.514 --> 00:18:33.853
(but we pretend it's a new car.)

379
00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:36.323
(At the same time, in the waiting room,)

380
00:18:37.554 --> 00:18:40.663
("Encyclopedia of Useless Facts" producer is hiding the camera.)

381
00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:43.464
(Ta-da)

382
00:18:44.593 --> 00:18:46.163
("Three Meals a Day" producer who never met Winner before...)

383
00:18:46.163 --> 00:18:47.504
(is here too.)

384
00:18:48.434 --> 00:18:50.774
(There are cameras hidden everywhere in the waiting room.)

385
00:18:51.373 --> 00:18:52.673
(In the small waiting room)

386
00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:54.804
(In the hall)

387
00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:58.413
(In the studio)

388
00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:02.514
(Most hidden cameras in history of "Youth Over Flower".)

389
00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:05.284
(At the same time, outside the studio...)

390
00:19:06.284 --> 00:19:09.184
(Staff is hiding in a window tinted car.)

391
00:19:09.184 --> 00:19:10.323
(It's uncomfortable.)

392
00:19:10.794 --> 00:19:12.593
(3 YG people are here.)

393
00:19:13.224 --> 00:19:14.694
(Lee Byung Young, Choi Jung Soo,)

394
00:19:14.694 --> 00:19:16.024
(Jo An Na)

395
00:19:17.194 --> 00:19:18.934
(Director Yoon Sang Sik)

396
00:19:18.934 --> 00:19:20.663
(18 years of experience)

397
00:19:21.633 --> 00:19:23.133
(We rented a real commercial camera...)

398
00:19:24.274 --> 00:19:26.133
(to deceive Winner.)

399
00:19:27.343 --> 00:19:30.143
(You'll soon watch the most useless high resolution screen...)

400
00:19:30.143 --> 00:19:33.173
(in history of prank.)

401
00:19:35.014 --> 00:19:37.514
(Everything is ready.)

402
00:19:38.413 --> 00:19:43.083
(The biggest kidnap plan begins.)

403
00:19:44.194 --> 00:19:45.254
(Seung Hoon arrives first.)

404
00:19:45.254 --> 00:19:47.423
He's here. Seung Hoon's here.

405
00:19:49.294 --> 00:19:51.964
(The commercial manager marks him.)

406
00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:54.903
(Jin Woo arrives)

407
00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:59.073
(He's carrying the snack bag again.)

408
00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:03.173
(An ordinary day of shooting a commercial begins.)

409
00:20:04.073 --> 00:20:06.913
(It's an ordinary waiting room.)

410
00:20:08.444 --> 00:20:11.454
Min Ho's here.

411
00:20:13.054 --> 00:20:16.254
(He even dyed his hair nicely for the commercial.)

412
00:20:17.123 --> 00:20:18.323
Hello, everybody.

413
00:20:18.323 --> 00:20:19.724
- Hi. - Hello.

414
00:20:19.724 --> 00:20:21.494
Hey, guys. Hi.

415
00:20:22.093 --> 00:20:24.333
It was just like any other shoot.

416
00:20:24.694 --> 00:20:26.163
I saw the meal trucks.

417
00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:29.004
(The trucks came under the pretext of it being a real commercial.)

418
00:20:29.264 --> 00:20:31.934
We have a big studio and a waiting room as well.

419
00:20:32.234 --> 00:20:33.673
I saw our usual crew.

420
00:20:34.103 --> 00:20:36.274
Even the supervisor of the advertising team came.

421
00:20:36.704 --> 00:20:38.014
The plan was utterly perfect.

422
00:20:38.714 --> 00:20:40.544
(To make sure the plan was unbreakable,)

423
00:20:41.444 --> 00:20:43.853
(their agent comes into the room with a bunch of documents.)

424
00:20:44.454 --> 00:20:46.454
(And these documents are...)

425
00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:47.583
Are those for the confidentiality clause?

426
00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:48.653
Yes.

427
00:20:49.454 --> 00:20:52.393
(The advertising team drew up contracts, used for real ads.)

428
00:20:52.724 --> 00:20:57.393
(This is a commercial shoot without any red flags for doubt.)

429
00:20:58.464 --> 00:21:01.163
(And the outfits Winner will wear today are brought.)

430
00:21:02.534 --> 00:21:05.704
(Those are prison uniforms!)

431
00:21:06.504 --> 00:21:08.403
(The filming plan for today.)

432
00:21:09.274 --> 00:21:11.514
(First, they will wear fancy suits and costumes.)

433
00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:14.944
(They will film the scene with the intention of looking the coolest.)

434
00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:20.284
(Afterward, they'll put on the prison uniform and head outside.)

435
00:21:21.184 --> 00:21:24.353
(They will film several scenes.)

436
00:21:25.123 --> 00:21:28.393
(And we plan to kidnap them straight out of the shoot.)

437
00:21:29.893 --> 00:21:31.563
Is this commercial supposed to be funny?

438
00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.363
No, it's not.

439
00:21:33.563 --> 00:21:34.903
But why are we wearing those prison uniforms?

440
00:21:35.964 --> 00:21:39.103
(The supervisor in charge of the commercial is taken aback.)

441
00:21:40.343 --> 00:21:44.413
(How should I explain about these outfits?)

442
00:21:44.673 --> 00:21:46.573
They are not prison uniforms.

443
00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:48.944
They symbolize our society.

444
00:21:48.944 --> 00:21:52.313
After being locked up at work, they are leaving their work.

445
00:21:52.313 --> 00:21:53.823
That's why you're wearing that outfit.

446
00:21:53.883 --> 00:21:56.684
You'll leave the company as you take off that outfit.

447
00:21:56.684 --> 00:21:59.194
(Please just believe me.)

448
00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:03.833
I don't know the particulars as the whole storyboard is confidential.

449
00:22:03.863 --> 00:22:05.593
But this is the director's storyboard.

450
00:22:07.103 --> 00:22:09.464
(She shows him the storyboard we paid a lot of money for.)

451
00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:12.833
(It was a big investment. An expert drew the storyboard.)

452
00:22:14.173 --> 00:22:18.274
You're escaping after being jaded by work.

453
00:22:18.343 --> 00:22:19.714
Sort of like a prisoner.

454
00:22:20.514 --> 00:22:21.944
- So this is... - It's not supposed to be funny.

455
00:22:23.214 --> 00:22:26.784
- You used our lyrics, right? - Yes, we did.

456
00:22:26.784 --> 00:22:29.623
(They're slowly convincing him.)

457
00:22:30.623 --> 00:22:32.454
Let's leave this island

458
00:22:33.724 --> 00:22:36.593
(So Seung Hoon is convinced.)

459
00:22:37.663 --> 00:22:40.264
(He even signs the non-disclosure agreement.)

460
00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:44.333
(This time, Min Ho is looking through the storyboard.)

461
00:22:45.274 --> 00:22:46.474
What is this?

462
00:22:48.403 --> 00:22:51.214
(Min Ho seems serious as he looks over the storyboard.)

463
00:22:52.444 --> 00:22:53.544
The concept...

464
00:22:57.284 --> 00:22:58.413
was strange.

465
00:22:59.554 --> 00:23:02.984
I talked to the supervisor of the advertising team about the concept.

466
00:23:04.454 --> 00:23:06.754
(He's the supervisor of the advertising team.)

467
00:23:07.563 --> 00:23:09.923
(Isn't it weird to wear prison uniforms for a car commercial?)

468
00:23:10.563 --> 00:23:13.764
(They are convincing him that the outfits are not weird at all.)

469
00:23:14.534 --> 00:23:17.633
(The clip with the uniform won't be long. It'll be brief.)

470
00:23:19.173 --> 00:23:20.444
I talked about the prison uniform.

471
00:23:22.204 --> 00:23:24.714
All of us are supposed to wear the hats too.

472
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:29.984
(Now, Jin Woo takes interest in the concept of the commercial.)

473
00:23:34.984 --> 00:23:38.754
(He doesn't find anything strange about it.)

474
00:23:40.494 --> 00:23:42.464
- Seung Yoon has arrived. - He's getting out.

475
00:23:42.464 --> 00:23:43.494
(Seung Yoon arrives last.)

476
00:23:44.194 --> 00:23:47.633
(He's coming from a poster shoot for the drama this morning.)

477
00:23:48.903 --> 00:23:51.073
(He's wrung out, but...)

478
00:23:52.034 --> 00:23:54.143
(he's happy that he's shooting a commercial.)

479
00:23:55.603 --> 00:23:57.343
(Lunch break)

480
00:23:58.073 --> 00:24:00.583
(Seung Hoon is happy lunch is delicious.)

481
00:24:01.613 --> 00:24:04.583
(Min Ho forgot all about the uniform over a cup of coffee.)

482
00:24:05.813 --> 00:24:07.823
(He seems cheerful.)

483
00:24:09.684 --> 00:24:11.694
(He seems cheerful 2.)

484
00:24:13.423 --> 00:24:16.123
(In no time, the crew is almost done with preparing the set.)

485
00:24:17.633 --> 00:24:20.434
(The cameraman for behind-the-scene clips is ready to roll.)

486
00:24:21.734 --> 00:24:24.704
(Seung Yoon, the leader of the group, enters the set first.)

487
00:24:24.704 --> 00:24:27.774
Let me explain you about the shoot.

488
00:24:27.774 --> 00:24:29.304
(He's being briefed about today's shoot.)

489
00:24:29.304 --> 00:24:30.913
Try to look...

490
00:24:31.073 --> 00:24:33.514
- cool standing in front of the car. - Okay.

491
00:24:34.044 --> 00:24:36.744
(The director of the advertising team is listening too.)

492
00:24:37.383 --> 00:24:38.784
(His usual job requirements are...)

493
00:24:38.784 --> 00:24:41.383
(mediating between artists and directors and checking the concept.)

494
00:24:41.383 --> 00:24:43.184
(His job requirement for today...)

495
00:24:43.184 --> 00:24:45.754
(is just watching.)

496
00:24:46.224 --> 00:24:47.623
- You two can dance. - I see.

497
00:24:47.623 --> 00:24:48.794
Yes, dance around a bit.

498
00:24:49.163 --> 00:24:51.434
Now, about the set.

499
00:24:51.694 --> 00:24:55.133
We'll do a 3D modeling for the car.

500
00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:57.274
- It will be a different car. - I see.

501
00:24:57.274 --> 00:24:58.534
We're going to do a lot of computer graphics.

502
00:24:58.534 --> 00:25:02.103
Today's shoot is just to get us some footages to work on.

503
00:25:02.343 --> 00:25:04.373
(This is 3D modeling.)

504
00:25:05.343 --> 00:25:07.343
(If we were to apply this incredible process to our footages.)

505
00:25:08.383 --> 00:25:10.184
(Before the 3D modeling)

506
00:25:10.883 --> 00:25:12.784
(After the 3D modeling)

507
00:25:13.883 --> 00:25:16.623
(They will be identical, for we don't have the budget for it.)

508
00:25:17.024 --> 00:25:18.694
So the set will...

509
00:25:18.694 --> 00:25:20.024
(The director wins their confidence.)

510
00:25:20.224 --> 00:25:21.464
change completely.

511
00:25:21.464 --> 00:25:25.063
- We haven't done 3D modeling yet. - Really?

512
00:25:25.393 --> 00:25:27.034
Imagine that this will be a completely different scene.

513
00:25:27.704 --> 00:25:30.873
- This will look totally different. - Okay. I got it.

514
00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:35.103
Our clients will arrive late today.

515
00:25:35.103 --> 00:25:36.244
Can I...

516
00:25:36.244 --> 00:25:37.813
(She asks to take photos of the outfits.)

517
00:25:37.813 --> 00:25:39.544
- Can I take photos? - Go ahead.

518
00:25:40.514 --> 00:25:43.143
(To, the director of the advertising company.)

519
00:25:44.353 --> 00:25:46.754
(This place is slightly far from the set.)

520
00:25:47.984 --> 00:25:51.994
(And the director of the company is checking the outfits.)

521
00:25:52.554 --> 00:25:55.494
If they find out, it'd be funny either way.

522
00:25:56.123 --> 00:25:58.534
- We used a lot of money on this. - I'm sorry.

523
00:25:58.994 --> 00:26:00.603
We spent a good chunk of money on it.

524
00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.434
I'm sorry.

525
00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:05.304
(The prank has begun.)

526
00:26:05.403 --> 00:26:07.544
- Back to your locations. - Okay.

527
00:26:09.474 --> 00:26:11.514
(This prank took 2 months long to prepare.)

528
00:26:11.514 --> 00:26:13.413
- Hold that for me. - Okay.

529
00:26:13.944 --> 00:26:15.444
(An expensive camera)

530
00:26:16.014 --> 00:26:18.353
(Let the high-budgeted prank begin.)

531
00:26:20.784 --> 00:26:23.353
(He starts acting for the commercial.)

532
00:26:26.224 --> 00:26:30.294
(I'm irresistible.)

533
00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:34.403
Are we shooting a music video?

534
00:26:35.403 --> 00:26:36.804
- What is he doing? - He's automatic.

535
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:39.434
Trying this and that. He's trying to look cool.

536
00:26:41.403 --> 00:26:44.573
(Trying to look cool)

537
00:26:45.544 --> 00:26:48.143
(He's doing everything to look awesome.)

538
00:26:50.214 --> 00:26:52.913
(My gosh. I'm utterly irresistible.)

539
00:26:54.153 --> 00:26:56.054
- Great. Cut! - Cut.

540
00:26:56.153 --> 00:26:57.393
That was amazing.

541
00:26:58.224 --> 00:27:00.524
(There's an unexpected round of applause.)

542
00:27:01.294 --> 00:27:02.724
What? They're clapping for Seung Yoon?

543
00:27:03.794 --> 00:27:06.163
(Next up is Jin Woo, the oldest member of the group.)

544
00:27:06.534 --> 00:27:07.534
- Jin Woo. - Yes?

545
00:27:07.534 --> 00:27:09.403
- You saw Seung Yoon, right? - Yes.

546
00:27:10.204 --> 00:27:11.673
- Do you want me to look cheerful? - You got it.

547
00:27:11.734 --> 00:27:13.643
Exchange a few glances. Try to look groovy.

548
00:27:13.643 --> 00:27:16.673
- Try to communicate with the car. - Sure.

549
00:27:17.514 --> 00:27:20.643
(He's communicating with the car.)

550
00:27:24.984 --> 00:27:26.214
(Bending)

551
00:27:27.853 --> 00:27:30.524
(I'm fine. That looked natural.)

552
00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:37.464
(Slippery)

553
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:41.704
(That was fine. That looked natural as well.)

554
00:27:41.704 --> 00:27:45.234
After this, I'll give you more directions when everyone is here.

555
00:27:45.804 --> 00:27:49.304
Your looks are very out of this world.

556
00:27:50.343 --> 00:27:51.373
(The compliment relaxes him.)

557
00:27:51.373 --> 00:27:52.744
- You're good looking. - Are we just ugly?

558
00:27:53.444 --> 00:27:55.944
(He's professional.)

559
00:27:57.454 --> 00:28:00.853
(And the fake commercial shoot continues to go smoothly.)

560
00:28:01.984 --> 00:28:05.853
The car is covered. Will they use CG for the car in post-production?

561
00:28:05.853 --> 00:28:07.623
- The car is covered? - The car...

562
00:28:09.123 --> 00:28:12.133
(They did a poor job of covering for 3D modeling.)

563
00:28:12.633 --> 00:28:13.734
They covered it up.

564
00:28:13.863 --> 00:28:16.403
They concealed the bumper.

565
00:28:17.573 --> 00:28:20.774
(The doubt begins to creep in.)

566
00:28:21.004 --> 00:28:23.073
- Why is the bumper covered? - Did you lock it?

567
00:28:23.714 --> 00:28:26.514
Aren't they going to change the color of it?

568
00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:29.313
- Since they are four of you, - Will they do it with CG?

569
00:28:29.313 --> 00:28:31.284
they're probably trying to have it in four colors.

570
00:28:31.353 --> 00:28:33.853
(I see.)

571
00:28:35.024 --> 00:28:36.954
(He's convinced by nonsense.)

572
00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:39.893
They'll probably use CG. I forgot about that.

573
00:28:40.694 --> 00:28:41.923
It's going to be legendary.

574
00:28:41.994 --> 00:28:43.663
(He is gullible.)

575
00:28:43.663 --> 00:28:44.833
Maybe, a dragon might be in it.

576
00:28:44.833 --> 00:28:45.893
You know what I mean, right?

577
00:28:45.893 --> 00:28:47.234
(Imagining cool CG effects)

578
00:28:47.234 --> 00:28:48.333
All right.

579
00:28:49.804 --> 00:28:52.204
(He comes through with no hesitation.)

580
00:28:54.403 --> 00:28:56.643
(He's doing his best.)

581
00:29:01.184 --> 00:29:02.284
Nice!

582
00:29:10.323 --> 00:29:11.393
(Winking)

583
00:29:12.653 --> 00:29:17.633
(We don't know what to say. He's overzealous.)

584
00:29:18.893 --> 00:29:22.264
(His actions are passionate.)

585
00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:26.434
(He's acting the best he can as he feels the car on his body.)

586
00:29:27.573 --> 00:29:29.873
(And Min Ho goes last.)

587
00:29:31.274 --> 00:29:33.214
(He makes good use of the floor.)

588
00:29:34.514 --> 00:29:37.153
(He prefers to stand out from others.)

589
00:29:37.153 --> 00:29:38.353
(Shooting)

590
00:29:39.413 --> 00:29:41.853
(His primary weapon is a gun with bullets of love.)

591
00:29:43.994 --> 00:29:46.194
(He's shooting a lot.)

592
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:49.123
(When Min Ho and Seung Hoon come together,)

593
00:29:50.734 --> 00:29:53.764
(they become two bubbly rappers.)

594
00:29:55.764 --> 00:29:58.204
(They're exploding with excitement.)

595
00:30:08.383 --> 00:30:09.913
(Their primary weapons are dual weld pistols.)

596
00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:13.413
(Unlike these two vocalists who seemed laid-back,)

597
00:30:15.184 --> 00:30:17.794
(these two rappers deliver a joint acting performance.)

598
00:30:20.294 --> 00:30:23.694
(They're the most hard-working rappers.)

599
00:30:30.633 --> 00:30:33.673
(This time, four of them film together.)

600
00:30:34.843 --> 00:30:36.343
(When these four come together,)

601
00:30:37.913 --> 00:30:40.073
(the group radiates a different vibe.)

602
00:30:41.313 --> 00:30:43.143
(Dear advertising companies, look how hard-working Winner is.)

603
00:30:43.143 --> 00:30:44.784
(From the crew who feels extremely guilty)

604
00:30:45.784 --> 00:30:48.224
(Even the commercial director is fully satisfied.)

605
00:30:48.224 --> 00:30:49.423
That's so much better!

606
00:30:51.694 --> 00:30:54.024
(Winner is filming a fake commercial,)

607
00:30:54.024 --> 00:30:56.593
(and the concept of the commercial is a music video.)

608
00:30:59.794 --> 00:31:03.234
(Island)

609
00:31:04.173 --> 00:31:06.774
(They express how much they want to go to the island.)

610
00:31:08.444 --> 00:31:10.913
(Island)

611
00:31:13.343 --> 00:31:16.583
(We'll let you go to the island soon.)

612
00:31:21.754 --> 00:31:22.784
Okay!

613
00:31:24.024 --> 00:31:25.853
(The filming in the studio set is over.)

614
00:31:27.563 --> 00:31:29.464
(Only the outdoor filming remains.)

615
00:31:31.694 --> 00:31:34.403
(At corners of the studio set,)

616
00:31:36.063 --> 00:31:38.304
(several prisoners are spotted.)

617
00:31:40.343 --> 00:31:41.474
They're coming out.

618
00:31:43.744 --> 00:31:46.044
(These prisoners are about to escape the city.)

619
00:31:47.944 --> 00:31:50.014
Jin Woo, you look great in the prison uniform.

620
00:31:50.014 --> 00:31:51.083
(They seem cheerful even in the uniform.)

621
00:31:52.684 --> 00:31:55.024
Let's wear the outfit and take a photo.

622
00:31:55.024 --> 00:31:56.653
So when your drama airs,

623
00:31:56.653 --> 00:31:59.194
let's upload the photo to show our support.

624
00:31:59.194 --> 00:32:02.093
- I don't wear this uniform there. - On your drama?

625
00:32:02.163 --> 00:32:04.764
(However, they do their best taking the photo to promote the show.)

626
00:32:06.494 --> 00:32:08.004
I bet these outfits must have thrown you off.

627
00:32:09.063 --> 00:32:12.734
This scene won't take long.

628
00:32:13.133 --> 00:32:15.744
(It's because you'll have to board the plane soon.)

629
00:32:16.103 --> 00:32:17.573
The concept is fleeing from the city.

630
00:32:18.073 --> 00:32:21.143
Pretend this is your previous outfit before the transformation.

631
00:32:21.744 --> 00:32:24.353
(You can buy clothes on your trip.)

632
00:32:25.554 --> 00:32:27.823
(We'll transport the whole car to the airport.)

633
00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:29.623
- We need one more of these. - We don't need the mask.

634
00:32:30.024 --> 00:32:32.593
(Winner, please give us a moment.)

635
00:32:32.593 --> 00:32:35.194
(He's drawing while the rest of them are on their phone.)

636
00:32:36.194 --> 00:32:39.163
(Producer Na is on his way to kidnap them.)

637
00:32:39.764 --> 00:32:41.603
(The last operation)

638
00:32:42.234 --> 00:32:44.173
You're going to...

639
00:32:44.173 --> 00:32:47.343
bring them here to film the last scene shortly.

640
00:32:47.343 --> 00:32:49.004
Please shoot the last scene...

641
00:32:49.004 --> 00:32:51.613
as you would do on any other filming which you've been doing.

642
00:32:52.974 --> 00:32:56.613
You're going to pretend to take care of something and get off the car.

643
00:32:57.054 --> 00:32:58.583
When you're off the trailer,

644
00:32:58.784 --> 00:33:00.984
I'll get on the trailer and pretend I'm fixing the audio equipment.

645
00:33:00.984 --> 00:33:03.184
I'll crouch down while doing so.

646
00:33:03.454 --> 00:33:06.193
The car will leave without you on the trailer.

647
00:33:06.523 --> 00:33:07.624
The crew will look for the director.

648
00:33:07.624 --> 00:33:09.963
When someone says the director is not on it,

649
00:33:09.963 --> 00:33:13.093
someone will say on a walkie-talkie that the guy crouching down...

650
00:33:13.093 --> 00:33:14.363
is good at filming.

651
00:33:14.704 --> 00:33:15.963
Then I'll say, "Let me film this then."

652
00:33:15.963 --> 00:33:18.304
- He'll be alone. - When I show myself...

653
00:33:18.304 --> 00:33:20.244
(The end of their operation)

654
00:33:21.204 --> 00:33:22.874
(While everyone is planning the operation...)

655
00:33:23.644 --> 00:33:25.543
(with one mind...)

656
00:33:26.144 --> 00:33:27.644
- Let's go! - Okay.

657
00:33:28.814 --> 00:33:32.584
(Tired of waiting, Winner gets out of the room.)

658
00:33:33.584 --> 00:33:35.454
(At the news that Winner is coming out,)

659
00:33:36.124 --> 00:33:38.793
(the crew is in a hurry.)

660
00:33:40.093 --> 00:33:43.164
(Producer Na hides in the van that will tail them.)

661
00:33:44.334 --> 00:33:47.403
(Winner has arrived.)

662
00:33:48.204 --> 00:33:51.773
(They get on the trailer without an ounce of doubt.)

663
00:33:56.003 --> 00:33:57.874
- We'll start rolling. - This is nice.

664
00:33:58.644 --> 00:34:00.244
- There are cameras here. - For this scene,

665
00:34:00.244 --> 00:34:02.043
we'll play the music for you.

666
00:34:02.343 --> 00:34:04.554
- You're escaping from the city. - Okay.

667
00:34:04.554 --> 00:34:07.383
- Just feel the music. - Please wrap it up.

668
00:34:07.383 --> 00:34:10.823
- Shout for joy while escaping. - Okay.

669
00:34:10.823 --> 00:34:13.054
- We'll be focusing on that. - Got it.

670
00:34:13.764 --> 00:34:15.193
- Do you want a mask? - Sorry?

671
00:34:15.193 --> 00:34:16.323
Do you want a mask?

672
00:34:16.624 --> 00:34:18.934
A hat and a mask would help.

673
00:34:18.934 --> 00:34:19.994
Right.

674
00:34:20.093 --> 00:34:22.164
(He's done putting on the mask.)

675
00:34:22.764 --> 00:34:24.273
(He puts on the hat for his disguise.)

676
00:34:24.273 --> 00:34:26.073
- It's tight. - You won't wear it for long.

677
00:34:26.403 --> 00:34:28.003
- You don't look suspicious. - With the mask...

678
00:34:29.374 --> 00:34:30.914
Let's get ready.

679
00:34:30.914 --> 00:34:31.974
(Everything is set.)

680
00:34:33.443 --> 00:34:37.054
All right. The trailer is going to start now.

681
00:34:39.653 --> 00:34:41.784
(It seemed as if everything was going smoothly.)

682
00:34:42.523 --> 00:34:43.793
All right.

683
00:34:43.793 --> 00:34:45.354
(All of a sudden, the camera in the backseat was turned off.)

684
00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:46.753
We'll get going.

685
00:34:47.693 --> 00:34:49.693
(Rattling)

686
00:34:50.633 --> 00:34:51.994
I didn't do anything wrong.

687
00:34:52.963 --> 00:34:54.003
- What was that? - It wasn't us.

688
00:34:54.104 --> 00:34:56.733
(Will our plan...)

689
00:34:56.733 --> 00:34:59.104
(be successful?)

690
00:34:59.834 --> 00:35:04.014
(The plan they prepared for over 2 months is nearing the end.)

691
00:35:05.943 --> 00:35:08.883
- On standby. - On standby.

692
00:35:09.514 --> 00:35:11.153
- Look at the camera. - At the camera.

693
00:35:11.153 --> 00:35:12.383
Action!

694
00:35:12.713 --> 00:35:13.753
Let's go!

695
00:35:13.753 --> 00:35:15.354
(Singing)

696
00:35:16.923 --> 00:35:20.193
(He's a rapper.)

697
00:35:23.693 --> 00:35:26.394
(He draws everyone's eyes.)

698
00:35:27.104 --> 00:35:28.903
(I'm in such a good mood!)

699
00:35:30.034 --> 00:35:32.434
(Laughing)

700
00:35:33.273 --> 00:35:35.343
(One more time!)

701
00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:38.999
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E01 Youth Over Flowers - Winner

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

702
00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:42.113
(Everybody, put your hands up!)

703
00:35:45.284 --> 00:35:47.124
(Sticking out his hand)

704
00:35:52.894 --> 00:35:54.293
Great.

705
00:35:55.124 --> 00:35:57.934
(Winner is enjoying the outdoor activity.)

706
00:36:00.403 --> 00:36:02.304
Let's go!

707
00:36:04.334 --> 00:36:06.474
(Winner literally does everything they're asked to do.)

708
00:36:07.704 --> 00:36:10.073
(They don't even seem tired.)

709
00:36:10.443 --> 00:36:11.443
We did that.

710
00:36:11.443 --> 00:36:12.543
(Screaming)

711
00:36:14.144 --> 00:36:15.644
- Okay, okay. - Go!

712
00:36:16.184 --> 00:36:18.684
(We have to take a 16-hour flight soon.)

713
00:36:18.684 --> 00:36:22.054
Sir, let's go back to where you made the turn.

714
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:24.423
We're going back to where we started.

715
00:36:26.224 --> 00:36:28.823
- Island - We're going to stop for a moment.

716
00:36:28.823 --> 00:36:30.064
(An assistant director is speaking.)

717
00:36:32.793 --> 00:36:35.733
- We'll check the lights. - Let's check the lights.

718
00:36:35.863 --> 00:36:37.633
- Please stay seated. - Let me see that.

719
00:36:37.633 --> 00:36:39.974
- What about this? - We'll quickly check the lights.

720
00:36:39.974 --> 00:36:42.343
(The director has to get off now.)

721
00:36:42.343 --> 00:36:44.244
- We'll quickly check the lights. - Please wait.

722
00:36:44.573 --> 00:36:46.644
- Take a look around it. - Yes, sir.

723
00:36:46.644 --> 00:36:48.343
Please block the windows on the side.

724
00:36:48.343 --> 00:36:50.753
- Cover them up with the blanket. - Please block the windows.

725
00:36:51.784 --> 00:36:54.724
(A big black blanket appears.)

726
00:36:56.054 --> 00:36:57.224
It's for the car.

727
00:36:57.293 --> 00:36:59.994
(This is a high-tech method of blocking the view.)

728
00:37:00.863 --> 00:37:04.334
(They completely blocked their side views.)

729
00:37:04.963 --> 00:37:06.903
(Producer Na takes this moment as an opportunity and moves.)

730
00:37:08.463 --> 00:37:09.903
I need to check the screen.

731
00:37:10.064 --> 00:37:12.704
(He gets on the trailer carefully.)

732
00:37:12.704 --> 00:37:13.903
Let's check the screen.

733
00:37:16.673 --> 00:37:18.573
(It's a blind spot.)

734
00:37:18.573 --> 00:37:20.584
(A spot where Winner can't see.)

735
00:37:21.483 --> 00:37:23.653
(Just to hide Producer Na,)

736
00:37:24.414 --> 00:37:25.854
(they cover the windows with a curtain and monitor.)

737
00:37:25.854 --> 00:37:27.423
(They even use makeup as an excuse.)

738
00:37:28.124 --> 00:37:29.923
(So Winner didn't see anything.)

739
00:37:30.923 --> 00:37:32.894
(The director who is done with his task...)

740
00:37:33.894 --> 00:37:35.323
(gets on the van for the crew.)

741
00:37:35.323 --> 00:37:36.863
- Get in, please. - Stay on this van.

742
00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:42.463
We're going to start now.

743
00:37:44.773 --> 00:37:46.273
Get the music ready.

744
00:37:47.804 --> 00:37:50.914
(30 seconds before their surprise)

745
00:37:50.914 --> 00:37:51.943
All right.

746
00:37:53.514 --> 00:37:55.343
(The assistant director begins acting.)

747
00:37:55.343 --> 00:37:56.343
All right.

748
00:37:57.213 --> 00:37:58.253
Where's the director?

749
00:38:00.054 --> 00:38:02.423
- Where's the director? - Sorry?

750
00:38:03.354 --> 00:38:04.693
Where is the director?

751
00:38:05.023 --> 00:38:07.664
- Take a look at this. - 2, 3.

752
00:38:07.664 --> 00:38:09.693
He said he had to use the bathroom.

753
00:38:11.193 --> 00:38:14.463
Who's going to check the scene? The director is not here.

754
00:38:14.463 --> 00:38:15.903
He has to check the details.

755
00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:19.573
I thought he came back.

756
00:38:19.573 --> 00:38:21.343
(Of course, Winner can hear everything.)

757
00:38:21.943 --> 00:38:23.914
Gosh, you should have checked it.

758
00:38:23.914 --> 00:38:25.213
(He has gotten wind of the situation.)

759
00:38:25.213 --> 00:38:26.343
The director didn't get on?

760
00:38:26.843 --> 00:38:29.144
There's a guy in a black outfit...

761
00:38:29.144 --> 00:38:31.354
in the front.

762
00:38:31.653 --> 00:38:33.253
He's a solid director.

763
00:38:33.253 --> 00:38:34.724
Can he fill in for the time being?

764
00:38:35.624 --> 00:38:38.293
(Black outfit? A solid director?)

765
00:38:38.293 --> 00:38:39.724
Is he hiding somewhere?

766
00:38:41.724 --> 00:38:45.064
Tap the guy in the black outfit.

767
00:38:45.534 --> 00:38:46.934
Hey, get that out of the way.

768
00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:51.474
(The guy in the black outfit is right here.)

769
00:38:54.474 --> 00:38:56.374
Get that out of the way. Move it.

770
00:38:56.374 --> 00:38:58.043
(He's curious of the solid director.)

771
00:38:58.573 --> 00:39:00.644
- What is this? - Wait.

772
00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:02.543
(In disbelief)

773
00:39:02.543 --> 00:39:04.483
- What is this? - Wait.

774
00:39:05.054 --> 00:39:07.184
- What's going on? - Can you take over now?

775
00:39:07.584 --> 00:39:09.954
Sure. I'll take over starting now.

776
00:39:10.323 --> 00:39:12.224
I'll take over starting now.

777
00:39:12.554 --> 00:39:13.994
- What's going on? - I got it.

778
00:39:14.224 --> 00:39:16.124
I'll take over starting now.

779
00:39:16.124 --> 00:39:17.863
- What's going on? - I got it.

780
00:39:17.863 --> 00:39:19.334
What is this?

781
00:39:19.534 --> 00:39:21.334
- What? - Are you serious?

782
00:39:21.534 --> 00:39:23.133
(Are you serious?)

783
00:39:23.133 --> 00:39:25.573
- What's going on? - Seriously?

784
00:39:27.003 --> 00:39:30.713
(I don't have the faintest idea what's happening right now.)

785
00:39:30.713 --> 00:39:32.744
We're going to film the last scene.

786
00:39:33.213 --> 00:39:35.414
(When Producer Na takes off his hat,)

787
00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:37.084
(they're terrified.)

788
00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:39.784
- Is this really happening? - The last line is,

789
00:39:40.224 --> 00:39:43.124
"We're going to Incheon Airport to find freedom."

790
00:39:43.124 --> 00:39:44.124
What?

791
00:39:44.124 --> 00:39:45.253
(They're shocked.)

792
00:39:45.593 --> 00:39:46.963
What is this?

793
00:39:47.323 --> 00:39:49.963
- I can't believe this! - What in the world...

794
00:39:51.564 --> 00:39:54.334
Let's start with Min Ho.

795
00:39:54.334 --> 00:39:56.233
"We're going to Incheon Airport to find freedom."

796
00:39:57.034 --> 00:39:58.673
You've got to be kidding me!

797
00:40:00.604 --> 00:40:02.003
- What is this? - My gosh.

798
00:40:02.003 --> 00:40:03.204
Come on!

799
00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:04.673
- Unbelievable. - They totally got me.

800
00:40:04.673 --> 00:40:06.474
"We're going to Incheon Airport to find freedom."

801
00:40:06.474 --> 00:40:10.213
Sir, take the Jayu-ro all the way to Incheon International Airport.

802
00:40:10.213 --> 00:40:11.784
No!

803
00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:13.584
They got us. My goodness.

804
00:40:14.124 --> 00:40:16.124
- How I... - How could you not see this coming?

805
00:40:16.184 --> 00:40:18.523
How could I have seen it coming?

806
00:40:18.954 --> 00:40:20.494
(The back of my head hurts.)

807
00:40:20.724 --> 00:40:23.164
How did this happen?

808
00:40:23.394 --> 00:40:24.994
Why didn't we suspect it?

809
00:40:24.994 --> 00:40:26.334
Who are you?

810
00:40:26.863 --> 00:40:29.233
Does that mean there is no commercial?

811
00:40:29.733 --> 00:40:31.673
- A commercial? - Isn't this for a commercial?

812
00:40:32.073 --> 00:40:34.673
This isn't a commercial, but a kidnapping.

813
00:40:35.244 --> 00:40:37.244
We're kidnapping you right now.

814
00:40:39.343 --> 00:40:40.613
This is unbelievable.

815
00:40:40.943 --> 00:40:42.543
Where did it...

816
00:40:42.543 --> 00:40:44.653
Where did it go wrong?

817
00:40:44.814 --> 00:40:46.784
Where did it go wrong?

818
00:40:46.784 --> 00:40:47.823
They had the alibi.

819
00:40:47.823 --> 00:40:50.994
(It probably went wrong from here.)

820
00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:54.394
Did you recruit the advertising team of our agency?

821
00:40:55.363 --> 00:40:58.834
We recruited the advertising team, coordinating team, styling team,

822
00:40:58.834 --> 00:41:00.034
- and managing team. - I should have known.

823
00:41:00.034 --> 00:41:01.934
- Director. - Director.

824
00:41:01.934 --> 00:41:03.034
Thank you.

825
00:41:03.034 --> 00:41:04.073
(Chun Sung Jae is the real director of commercials.)

826
00:41:04.204 --> 00:41:05.773
Have a safe trip!

827
00:41:05.773 --> 00:41:07.244
Who are you?

828
00:41:08.273 --> 00:41:11.043
The storyboard was high-quality.

829
00:41:11.744 --> 00:41:13.014
We had it made.

830
00:41:13.314 --> 00:41:14.414
Who made it?

831
00:41:14.843 --> 00:41:16.084
Maybe you did.

832
00:41:16.084 --> 00:41:17.684
This is incredible.

833
00:41:18.883 --> 00:41:20.923
For goodness' sake.

834
00:41:20.923 --> 00:41:22.753
Back during the get-together,

835
00:41:23.124 --> 00:41:24.354
I... What should I call it?

836
00:41:24.354 --> 00:41:25.854
Wait a minute. Was that fake?

837
00:41:27.323 --> 00:41:28.823
What was that?

838
00:41:28.894 --> 00:41:30.593
- The producer told me... - You were fooled.

839
00:41:30.593 --> 00:41:32.834
that she is sorry.

840
00:41:33.093 --> 00:41:34.403
She said Youth Over Flowers won't come until later.

841
00:41:34.403 --> 00:41:35.664
She said I can put myself at ease.

842
00:41:35.664 --> 00:41:37.003
Perhaps I shouldn't share this.

843
00:41:37.573 --> 00:41:39.934
Winner is joining the show, right?

844
00:41:40.403 --> 00:41:41.543
Are you talking about Youth Over Flowers?

845
00:41:41.543 --> 00:41:43.304
- Winner is joining the show. - Youth Over Flowers.

846
00:41:43.474 --> 00:41:44.514
That was the plan.

847
00:41:44.514 --> 00:41:46.414
- That was the plan. - That was the plan.

848
00:41:46.814 --> 00:41:49.814
"Kang's Kitchen" will have to come first.

849
00:41:49.814 --> 00:41:52.153
(She talked about Youth Over Flowers filming next year.)

850
00:41:52.684 --> 00:41:55.084
(The production crew lied all the time.)

851
00:41:55.653 --> 00:41:57.653
(The broadcasting station is ruthless.)

852
00:41:57.653 --> 00:42:00.394
- I can't believe it. - I put myself at ease.

853
00:42:00.693 --> 00:42:02.894
I have a shoot for the drama the day after tomorrow.

854
00:42:04.693 --> 00:42:06.164
What are you going to do?

855
00:42:06.293 --> 00:42:07.764
- A shoot for the drama? - Yes.

856
00:42:07.963 --> 00:42:09.264
It's a lie.

857
00:42:11.434 --> 00:42:12.633
Hey!

858
00:42:13.173 --> 00:42:14.604
Hey, what is going on?

859
00:42:14.874 --> 00:42:16.644
You could have given us a hint!

860
00:42:17.043 --> 00:42:19.814
- Is a shoot for the drama a lie? - I had an hour of sleep...

861
00:42:19.814 --> 00:42:21.514
- last night. - It's practically the same crew.

862
00:42:21.543 --> 00:42:23.713
The main scriptwriter of the drama writes this program too.

863
00:42:25.414 --> 00:42:26.684
- He is right? - Who is that?

864
00:42:26.684 --> 00:42:28.753
(He has an epiphany.)

865
00:42:30.423 --> 00:42:31.593
(My goodness.)

866
00:42:31.994 --> 00:42:33.593
I thought...

867
00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:35.564
Since you were on the alert,

868
00:42:35.564 --> 00:42:38.093
we had no choice but to do this.

869
00:42:38.093 --> 00:42:41.403
- They got us. - They got us good.

870
00:42:41.463 --> 00:42:44.804
I bragged to my mom about filming a commercial.

871
00:42:44.804 --> 00:42:45.974
Me too!

872
00:42:45.974 --> 00:42:48.043
When else would we film a car commercial?

873
00:42:48.043 --> 00:42:49.843
Me too. I even thought about what to buy with the money.

874
00:42:50.104 --> 00:42:51.874
- I was happy to film a commercial. - Listen, everyone.

875
00:42:51.874 --> 00:42:54.014
You don't have your purse or wallet.

876
00:42:54.014 --> 00:42:55.483
You don't have your clothes.

877
00:42:55.483 --> 00:42:56.684
- No. - We don't have our cell phones.

878
00:42:56.784 --> 00:42:57.954
We don't even have our cell phones.

879
00:42:58.713 --> 00:43:01.124
You will head to the airport in this state.

880
00:43:01.124 --> 00:43:03.454
We will give you your passport and cell phone later.

881
00:43:03.554 --> 00:43:05.454
- Give me a second. - This is unbelievable.

882
00:43:05.494 --> 00:43:06.894
I have a confession to make.

883
00:43:06.994 --> 00:43:08.394
I got in the car with my cell phone.

884
00:43:09.164 --> 00:43:11.264
The others will get their cell phones. It's okay.

885
00:43:11.264 --> 00:43:12.434
You fool!

886
00:43:12.834 --> 00:43:14.733
- I don't have a battery. - You should have brought a wallet.

887
00:43:15.233 --> 00:43:17.304
- I don't have a battery. - How would I have thought of that?

888
00:43:17.304 --> 00:43:20.204
Why would I bring my wallet to film a commercial?

889
00:43:20.204 --> 00:43:21.673
I have my wallet at the car.

890
00:43:21.804 --> 00:43:23.874
- Mine is inside the bag. - It's with my clothes.

891
00:43:24.073 --> 00:43:26.883
(Your belongings arrived at your dormitory already.)

892
00:43:27.014 --> 00:43:30.814
(We even sent your snack bag with a card.)

893
00:43:30.954 --> 00:43:32.084
- What? - Firstly,

894
00:43:32.084 --> 00:43:35.084
we are thankful that you are talking us on a trip.

895
00:43:35.084 --> 00:43:36.554
We are thankful, but this is too...

896
00:43:36.554 --> 00:43:38.823
We need to look cool during a trip!

897
00:43:38.854 --> 00:43:41.494
A trip in your youth is all about its suddenness.

898
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:43.264
Are we leaving in these clothes?

899
00:43:43.593 --> 00:43:46.034
Yes, you will enter Australia and pass through airport security...

900
00:43:46.034 --> 00:43:47.363
in those clothes.

901
00:43:47.604 --> 00:43:48.633
- Australia? - Australia?

902
00:43:49.434 --> 00:43:50.804
Did I reveal your destination?

903
00:43:51.474 --> 00:43:52.673
Gosh, I shouldn't have done that.

904
00:43:53.573 --> 00:43:55.104
- Australia! That's incredible. - Australia?

905
00:43:55.104 --> 00:43:56.644
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

906
00:43:56.744 --> 00:43:58.173
- Wait a minute. - Stop it.

907
00:43:58.744 --> 00:44:00.914
(More on Australia later)

908
00:44:00.914 --> 00:44:02.914
Are we really going to Incheon International Airport?

909
00:44:03.443 --> 00:44:06.354
Since it's the rush hour, we shouldn't go in this state.

910
00:44:06.454 --> 00:44:07.923
You will move to the staff's vehicle.

911
00:44:08.423 --> 00:44:09.584
Hey!

912
00:44:10.494 --> 00:44:12.354
- For goodness' sake. - Who is that? The production crew?

913
00:44:12.354 --> 00:44:13.593
- Hello. - Hello.

914
00:44:14.124 --> 00:44:15.423
- Everyone is here. - Hello.

915
00:44:15.423 --> 00:44:16.564
(The staff members of "New Journey to the West" appears.)

916
00:44:16.724 --> 00:44:18.363
While I am happy to see them...

917
00:44:18.363 --> 00:44:19.494
(He is both happy and flustered.)

918
00:44:19.633 --> 00:44:21.934
It's no wonder you were filming us!

919
00:44:22.463 --> 00:44:24.733
I should have known. He never comes in the morning.

920
00:44:25.034 --> 00:44:26.503
He came so early today.

921
00:44:26.503 --> 00:44:27.573
(He is having a lot of fun.)

922
00:44:28.503 --> 00:44:30.713
- Bye. - Did you know?

923
00:44:30.744 --> 00:44:32.144
Bye.

924
00:44:32.443 --> 00:44:35.784
My heart felt heavy to lie to you. I am sorry.

925
00:44:35.784 --> 00:44:38.014
- Let's get out of the car. - You are good at lying.

926
00:44:38.613 --> 00:44:40.554
Let's get out of the car.

927
00:44:40.554 --> 00:44:41.653
Where is Si Mon?

928
00:44:41.653 --> 00:44:43.454
Do I really not have a shoot for the drama?

929
00:44:44.023 --> 00:44:45.894
(Can I join the shoot of Youth Over Flowers?)

930
00:44:46.823 --> 00:44:49.293
For goodness' sake. When they left...

931
00:44:49.293 --> 00:44:51.394
without picking up the director,

932
00:44:51.394 --> 00:44:53.704
- I thought they had a fight. - I didn't know who he was.

933
00:44:53.704 --> 00:44:55.133
- Me neither. - I thought they had a fight.

934
00:44:55.133 --> 00:44:57.104
"The man in black clothes is leaving."

935
00:44:57.204 --> 00:44:59.204
- He suddenly disappeared. - It was sudden.

936
00:45:00.543 --> 00:45:02.474
We got completely fooled.

937
00:45:02.474 --> 00:45:04.014
(His legs give out.)

938
00:45:05.443 --> 00:45:06.814
(The hero of the hidden camera prank)

939
00:45:06.814 --> 00:45:07.914
Have a safe trip.

940
00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:09.613
- Thank you. - Let's film...

941
00:45:09.613 --> 00:45:11.084
a great commercial in the future.

942
00:45:11.084 --> 00:45:13.213
Are you an actor or a director?

943
00:45:13.213 --> 00:45:14.483
- He is the real director... - Is he real?

944
00:45:14.483 --> 00:45:16.023
of commercials.

945
00:45:16.383 --> 00:45:17.454
Really?

946
00:45:17.454 --> 00:45:20.054
It really felt like we were filming a commercial.

947
00:45:20.323 --> 00:45:21.923
Let's film a great commercial in the future.

948
00:45:21.923 --> 00:45:23.363
They are filming us again.

949
00:45:24.363 --> 00:45:25.963
Why are you filming us?

950
00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:28.304
- Why are you filming us? - We can't help it.

951
00:45:28.704 --> 00:45:31.204
It's an incredibly nice camera.

952
00:45:31.304 --> 00:45:33.644
- Director, thank you. - It was a good shoot.

953
00:45:34.144 --> 00:45:35.804
- Have a safe trip. - Thank you.

954
00:45:35.804 --> 00:45:37.014
I had a lot of fun.

955
00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:38.713
Let's move to Incheon International Airport.

956
00:45:39.343 --> 00:45:41.113
Let's go. We don't have much time before the flight.

957
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:42.914
- Let's go. - The flight...

958
00:45:42.914 --> 00:45:45.454
Say goodbye to the staff. They will get going now.

959
00:45:45.454 --> 00:45:47.084
You!

960
00:45:47.383 --> 00:45:49.784
(It's a rather violent goodbye.)

961
00:45:52.093 --> 00:45:53.354
Thank you for your hard work.

962
00:45:53.693 --> 00:45:55.293
Thank you for your hard work.

963
00:45:55.793 --> 00:45:57.693
I am almost in tears.

964
00:45:58.394 --> 00:45:59.834
You can talk about it now.

965
00:45:59.834 --> 00:46:01.003
(He planned the kidnapping for 2 months.)

966
00:46:01.003 --> 00:46:03.264
- I need to make a report. - Call President Yang Hyun Suk.

967
00:46:03.903 --> 00:46:05.403
He will be surprised.

968
00:46:06.104 --> 00:46:07.773
(They prepared for the kidnapping for 2 months.)

969
00:46:07.773 --> 00:46:09.043
I can't believe it.

970
00:46:09.043 --> 00:46:12.144
(In the end, they are dragged empty-handed.)

971
00:46:13.644 --> 00:46:15.644
I even bought...

972
00:46:16.184 --> 00:46:18.084
a lot of clothes...

973
00:46:18.084 --> 00:46:20.113
because of this commercial.

974
00:46:20.883 --> 00:46:22.023
You thought you would get money.

975
00:46:22.023 --> 00:46:24.753
I thought I would get money and bought a lot of clothes.

976
00:46:25.093 --> 00:46:26.253
Bye.

977
00:46:26.253 --> 00:46:28.323
- Bye. - Thank you.

978
00:46:28.394 --> 00:46:30.264
- Thank you for your hard work. - Have a safe trip.

979
00:46:32.693 --> 00:46:34.264
How long is the trip?

980
00:46:34.334 --> 00:46:36.104
This is unbelievable.

981
00:46:36.104 --> 00:46:37.834
(They board the staff's vehicle.)

982
00:46:38.434 --> 00:46:40.133
This is unbelievable.

983
00:46:41.503 --> 00:46:43.104
I should have eaten a lot.

984
00:46:44.173 --> 00:46:46.014
(He already worries about money.)

985
00:46:46.343 --> 00:46:47.914
My legs are about to give out.

986
00:46:47.914 --> 00:46:49.914
Seriously. This is...

987
00:46:50.314 --> 00:46:52.383
I have a shoot for the drama.

988
00:46:52.383 --> 00:46:54.253
- It was a lie. - No.

989
00:46:54.253 --> 00:46:56.224
The shoot needs to take place soon.

990
00:46:56.284 --> 00:46:57.693
In my bag...

991
00:46:58.093 --> 00:47:00.023
- It's Producer Shin Won Ho. - What?

992
00:47:02.023 --> 00:47:03.934
- Producer. - Hello.

993
00:47:03.934 --> 00:47:05.233
Is it true that I don't have a shoot?

994
00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:07.104
Yes.

995
00:47:07.104 --> 00:47:08.104
(Cool-headed)

996
00:47:08.564 --> 00:47:09.664
"Yes."

997
00:47:10.173 --> 00:47:12.403
Is it okay if I am not there?

998
00:47:12.934 --> 00:47:14.903
The schedule was...

999
00:47:15.104 --> 00:47:16.673
made up.

1000
00:47:18.644 --> 00:47:21.744
(The "Prison Playbook" team adjusted the schedule.)

1001
00:47:22.284 --> 00:47:23.343
This is nice.

1002
00:47:23.343 --> 00:47:24.613
"This is nice."

1003
00:47:26.213 --> 00:47:28.184
Have fun...

1004
00:47:28.224 --> 00:47:30.894
and wear sunscreen for continuity.

1005
00:47:30.894 --> 00:47:34.193
I will take care of my hair and skin.

1006
00:47:34.363 --> 00:47:36.664
- Thank you. - Have a safe trip.

1007
00:47:36.664 --> 00:47:38.233
- Okay. - All right.

1008
00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:39.334
My goodness.

1009
00:47:39.494 --> 00:47:41.503
What a surprise!

1010
00:47:41.503 --> 00:47:42.903
I am still in a daze.

1011
00:47:43.604 --> 00:47:46.374
How did everyone team up...

1012
00:47:46.434 --> 00:47:48.474
to fool the four of us?

1013
00:47:48.773 --> 00:47:54.883
(Thank you for helping us fool Winner.)

1014
00:47:55.713 --> 00:47:57.383
You know,

1015
00:47:57.383 --> 00:47:59.514
please take good care of Haute.

1016
00:48:00.153 --> 00:48:01.423
- Don't worry. - Walk him...

1017
00:48:01.423 --> 00:48:03.494
in the morning, afternoon, and night.

1018
00:48:05.523 --> 00:48:08.264
(We now go to the airport.)

1019
00:48:10.233 --> 00:48:11.693
Do you know where we are going?

1020
00:48:12.164 --> 00:48:14.064
- I told you by mistake earlier. - Yes.

1021
00:48:14.463 --> 00:48:15.903
It was a mistake.

1022
00:48:16.003 --> 00:48:17.334
I told you by mistake.

1023
00:48:17.434 --> 00:48:19.273
We are going to Australia. Has anyone been there?

1024
00:48:19.403 --> 00:48:20.503
- No. - No.

1025
00:48:21.443 --> 00:48:24.514
(Western Australia)

1026
00:48:28.684 --> 00:48:31.314
(The country of kangaroos)

1027
00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:34.023
(Welcome.)

1028
00:48:35.383 --> 00:48:38.423
(Situated next to the Indian Ocean,)

1029
00:48:39.624 --> 00:48:43.593
(it's the paradise of the surfers.)

1030
00:48:46.394 --> 00:48:47.564
Hi.

1031
00:48:48.264 --> 00:48:49.963
(They meet new people.)

1032
00:48:50.773 --> 00:48:52.934
(You can meet me if you are lucky.)

1033
00:48:53.704 --> 00:48:56.503
(We are incredibly rare animals.)

1034
00:48:57.073 --> 00:48:59.843
(When it's the time for sheep to go home,)

1035
00:49:01.443 --> 00:49:05.554
(beautiful sunset unfolds before your eyes.)

1036
00:49:09.554 --> 00:49:13.494
(Over the thousands of limestone columns...)

1037
00:49:15.394 --> 00:49:18.994
(are the endless stars of the southern hemisphere.)

1038
00:49:21.434 --> 00:49:23.434
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1039
00:49:23.434 --> 00:49:28.343
(A trip of the beautiful youths will unfold here.)

1040
00:49:30.474 --> 00:49:34.914
(It starts now.)

1041
00:49:35.113 --> 00:49:36.284
This is incredible.

1042
00:49:37.653 --> 00:49:39.454
(They need to study the basics.)

1043
00:49:39.613 --> 00:49:43.184
We made a booklet of travel information.

1044
00:49:43.184 --> 00:49:45.593
- Here you go. - Did you make it yourself?

1045
00:49:46.093 --> 00:49:48.023
- Thank you. - There are only two booklets.

1046
00:49:48.023 --> 00:49:49.994
- Let's read it carefully. - Western...

1047
00:49:49.994 --> 00:49:51.434
- Australia. - There is Perth.

1048
00:49:51.793 --> 00:49:53.363
(The locations are unfamiliar to them.)

1049
00:49:53.363 --> 00:49:54.503
Margaret River.

1050
00:49:54.733 --> 00:49:56.764
The paradise for surfing, Margaret River.

1051
00:49:56.764 --> 00:49:57.773
Surfing!

1052
00:49:58.003 --> 00:49:59.034
Isn't it cold there?

1053
00:49:59.573 --> 00:50:01.244
Am I wrong? Is it a warm country?

1054
00:50:01.244 --> 00:50:03.244
- It must be pretty cold. - It's between spring and summer.

1055
00:50:03.244 --> 00:50:05.443
The seasons are reversed.

1056
00:50:05.443 --> 00:50:06.673
Is that possible?

1057
00:50:08.613 --> 00:50:11.084
You will arrive in Western Australia...

1058
00:50:11.084 --> 00:50:16.323
and travel for 6 nights and 8 days.

1059
00:50:16.383 --> 00:50:17.693
It's a pretty long trip.

1060
00:50:17.693 --> 00:50:19.894
There is no set plan.

1061
00:50:20.124 --> 00:50:22.224
Once you arrive in Perth,

1062
00:50:22.463 --> 00:50:24.894
you are free to go where you want to go...

1063
00:50:24.894 --> 00:50:27.264
and do what you want to do.

1064
00:50:27.334 --> 00:50:28.804
You will need money.

1065
00:50:28.804 --> 00:50:30.374
- That's right. - Do we get money to go shopping?

1066
00:50:30.374 --> 00:50:31.773
This is for your trip.

1067
00:50:31.773 --> 00:50:34.474
Then what about the advertisement shooting then?

1068
00:50:34.474 --> 00:50:35.903
- The envelope is thick. - I know.

1069
00:50:35.903 --> 00:50:37.443
You did a good job of filming the commercial.

1070
00:50:38.113 --> 00:50:39.314
It's the money gift!

1071
00:50:39.914 --> 00:50:41.784
- Thank you. - How much is in it?

1072
00:50:41.784 --> 00:50:42.814
You are the best!

1073
00:50:42.814 --> 00:50:44.854
Each person can use 100 dollars a day.

1074
00:50:47.253 --> 00:50:48.454
- That's incredible. - Why are you taking it?

1075
00:50:48.454 --> 00:50:49.684
We have a bag here.

1076
00:50:49.684 --> 00:50:50.793
Let's check the amount.

1077
00:50:50.793 --> 00:50:52.823
Why would you put it down your top?

1078
00:50:52.994 --> 00:50:54.164
There is a lot of money.

1079
00:50:54.164 --> 00:50:55.963
Each person gets 100 dollars a day for 8 days.

1080
00:50:56.164 --> 00:50:57.293
I see.

1081
00:50:57.463 --> 00:51:00.363
Use this money to eat,

1082
00:51:00.363 --> 00:51:02.104
sleep, travel,

1083
00:51:02.104 --> 00:51:03.573
go on a tour,

1084
00:51:03.573 --> 00:51:05.604
and buy skincare products and clothes.

1085
00:51:05.804 --> 00:51:07.073
Are you giving us this money...

1086
00:51:07.474 --> 00:51:09.343
with no catch?

1087
00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:11.914
(This isn't "New Journey to the West".)

1088
00:51:12.014 --> 00:51:14.744
This is a healing program.

1089
00:51:15.043 --> 00:51:16.713
Forget "New Journey to the West".

1090
00:51:16.713 --> 00:51:18.084
Forget it for a second.

1091
00:51:18.084 --> 00:51:19.854
They won't fool us again.

1092
00:51:19.854 --> 00:51:21.584
It feels strange to receive a big amount of money...

1093
00:51:22.054 --> 00:51:23.653
when it's hard to eat a decent meal in "New Journey to the West".

1094
00:51:23.653 --> 00:51:25.023
(They are near the airport.)

1095
00:51:25.023 --> 00:51:27.764
It will be tasty.

1096
00:51:28.423 --> 00:51:31.633
The hotel will be cheaper if we book now.

1097
00:51:31.633 --> 00:51:33.733
I think it will be better...

1098
00:51:33.733 --> 00:51:35.704
to book the lodging...

1099
00:51:35.704 --> 00:51:37.173
when we have Wi-Fi...

1100
00:51:37.173 --> 00:51:38.403
in Korea.

1101
00:51:38.403 --> 00:51:40.204
I have done it once.

1102
00:51:40.974 --> 00:51:42.874
Are you booking the hotel?

1103
00:51:42.874 --> 00:51:44.514
(They decide to book the hotel for the first day.)

1104
00:51:44.514 --> 00:51:45.874
Let's do this before we arrive there.

1105
00:51:45.874 --> 00:51:47.983
It will be fun to sleep at the dormitory.

1106
00:51:48.343 --> 00:51:50.043
- We live in a dormitory. - Wait.

1107
00:51:50.284 --> 00:51:51.454
I think we should book this one.

1108
00:51:51.814 --> 00:51:53.954
Take a look at this.

1109
00:51:54.523 --> 00:51:58.153
80 dollars for a night is a steal.

1110
00:51:58.394 --> 00:52:00.894
- 80 dollars for a night. - There are 4 of us.

1111
00:52:00.894 --> 00:52:02.164
We should book it quickly.

1112
00:52:02.164 --> 00:52:04.494
People from all over the world...

1113
00:52:04.934 --> 00:52:07.204
- want to sleep here. - People from all over the world?

1114
00:52:07.534 --> 00:52:09.434
Do people from all over the world want to sleep there?

1115
00:52:09.934 --> 00:52:12.204
It's asking me to write a request in English.

1116
00:52:12.204 --> 00:52:14.304
Who wants to do it?

1117
00:52:14.304 --> 00:52:15.974
- You should do it. - Okay.

1118
00:52:15.974 --> 00:52:17.713
- Let's go. Let's go. - You received A in English.

1119
00:52:17.713 --> 00:52:19.314
Write it with confidence.

1120
00:52:19.314 --> 00:52:20.483
Free...

1121
00:52:21.343 --> 00:52:22.514
Wi-Fi.

1122
00:52:23.554 --> 00:52:26.213
Free water.

1123
00:52:26.613 --> 00:52:28.684
- That's right. - Maybe we are making...

1124
00:52:28.753 --> 00:52:29.753
an impossible request.

1125
00:52:29.753 --> 00:52:31.693
"Why are they asking us to give everything for free?"

1126
00:52:31.693 --> 00:52:32.753
"Who do they think they are?"

1127
00:52:32.753 --> 00:52:34.724
Then let's change "Free" to "Full".

1128
00:52:34.923 --> 00:52:36.664
- What? - Full Wi-Fi.

1129
00:52:36.664 --> 00:52:37.934
Fast Wi-Fi.

1130
00:52:39.994 --> 00:52:41.963
Add "Please" in the end.

1131
00:52:41.963 --> 00:52:43.204
That's polite.

1132
00:52:43.463 --> 00:52:44.503
Booking confirmed.

1133
00:52:45.133 --> 00:52:46.534
Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys.

1134
00:52:46.534 --> 00:52:47.903
Good job. Good job.

1135
00:52:47.903 --> 00:52:49.173
We are at Incheon International Airport.

1136
00:52:50.443 --> 00:52:51.713
Let's go. Let's go.

1137
00:52:52.173 --> 00:52:53.784
- Let's go. - All right. Let's go.

1138
00:52:53.784 --> 00:52:54.784
Let's go. Let's go.

1139
00:52:54.784 --> 00:52:56.443
It feels strange...

1140
00:52:56.954 --> 00:52:59.713
to walk around the airport in this outfit.

1141
00:52:59.713 --> 00:53:02.184
For "New Journey to the West",

1142
00:53:02.184 --> 00:53:04.494
Min Ho dressed up as a monster.

1143
00:53:04.494 --> 00:53:05.693
- That's right. - That's right.

1144
00:53:05.693 --> 00:53:07.593
He wore makeup on his face.

1145
00:53:07.593 --> 00:53:08.764
- This is nothing compared to that. - I am grateful.

1146
00:53:08.764 --> 00:53:10.764
(Hold on.)

1147
00:53:10.764 --> 00:53:12.233
(Since it's forbidden to film in the airport,)

1148
00:53:12.233 --> 00:53:14.963
(you will listen to the audio.)

1149
00:53:15.003 --> 00:53:16.434
(At the counter)

1150
00:53:16.874 --> 00:53:18.374
All right. Lee Seung Hoon.

1151
00:53:18.374 --> 00:53:19.934
- Do we go in right away? - Yes.

1152
00:53:19.934 --> 00:53:21.403
- Song Min Ho. - Thank you.

1153
00:53:21.403 --> 00:53:23.644
Would you take a picture of our back?

1154
00:53:24.814 --> 00:53:26.883
Walk pitifully.

1155
00:53:28.414 --> 00:53:30.883
(That's how this picture came to be.)

1156
00:53:30.883 --> 00:53:33.253
(Pitiful)

1157
00:53:34.023 --> 00:53:35.923
People are asking...

1158
00:53:36.423 --> 00:53:37.624
if we are being apprehended.

1159
00:53:37.954 --> 00:53:39.854
They are asking why we are dressed as prisoners.

1160
00:53:40.523 --> 00:53:42.363
It's funny because there are four of us.

1161
00:53:42.523 --> 00:53:45.093
- Let's walk separately. - Do you want to go first?

1162
00:53:45.434 --> 00:53:48.164
If we do that, they will say, "They must be a team!"

1163
00:53:48.264 --> 00:53:50.133
(At a duty free store)

1164
00:53:50.604 --> 00:53:52.104
Let's decide...

1165
00:53:52.104 --> 00:53:53.943
which brand to buy.

1166
00:53:54.104 --> 00:53:55.204
The cheapest one.

1167
00:53:55.204 --> 00:53:56.914
Even though all four of us have different skin types,

1168
00:53:56.914 --> 00:53:59.213
we must share a skincare product.

1169
00:53:59.644 --> 00:54:01.914
(They need to buy toner and lotion.)

1170
00:54:02.184 --> 00:54:04.554
Please show us the cheapest skincare product...

1171
00:54:04.554 --> 00:54:05.914
of any brand.

1172
00:54:06.514 --> 00:54:08.483
Do you mean toner, astringent, and lotion?

1173
00:54:08.483 --> 00:54:10.724
We don't need astringent. Face cream is enough.

1174
00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:12.224
We don't care what it is as long as it's cheap.

1175
00:54:12.224 --> 00:54:13.664
We need the cheapest one.

1176
00:54:13.664 --> 00:54:15.363
- Would you like this one? - How much is it?

1177
00:54:15.363 --> 00:54:17.193
It's 65 to 68 dollars.

1178
00:54:17.193 --> 00:54:18.293
It's too expensive.

1179
00:54:18.293 --> 00:54:20.863
This one is okay. I have used it earlier.

1180
00:54:20.863 --> 00:54:22.463
It's expensive... Wait, it only costs 10 dollars.

1181
00:54:22.463 --> 00:54:24.773
It's 13 dollars.

1182
00:54:24.773 --> 00:54:26.034
We will be set...

1183
00:54:26.034 --> 00:54:27.843
- if we buy two of these. - Let's do that.

1184
00:54:28.644 --> 00:54:31.073
It's moisturizing. It's nice face cream.

1185
00:54:31.343 --> 00:54:32.943
(Patting)

1186
00:54:33.483 --> 00:54:34.943
(The four of them wash their faces.)

1187
00:54:36.244 --> 00:54:38.454
- This is nice. - The view is nice.

1188
00:54:38.684 --> 00:54:39.854
I am here.

1189
00:54:40.584 --> 00:54:42.753
- There are two seats behind. - Okay.

1190
00:54:42.753 --> 00:54:44.153
(They sit as they come...)

1191
00:54:44.593 --> 00:54:46.354
- Hello. - Hello.

1192
00:54:46.354 --> 00:54:47.624
(and end up with these pairs.)

1193
00:54:48.463 --> 00:54:51.264
(The members in the back seats get ready to sleep.)

1194
00:54:52.293 --> 00:54:55.104
(The members in the front seats are reading something seriously.)

1195
00:54:56.564 --> 00:54:59.304
Korean food is the best for an in-flight meal.

1196
00:54:59.733 --> 00:55:02.003
I want to try beef goulash.

1197
00:55:02.244 --> 00:55:03.543
Then order that one.

1198
00:55:03.943 --> 00:55:06.744
(Passed out and dazed out)

1199
00:55:07.113 --> 00:55:10.354
Maybe we should wake them up for meals to save money.

1200
00:55:10.983 --> 00:55:13.784
Choose between braised chicken and cheese omelet.

1201
00:55:15.124 --> 00:55:18.624
(They eat with relish when they are wakened up.)

1202
00:55:20.093 --> 00:55:21.363
(Eating)

1203
00:55:22.394 --> 00:55:23.494
It's tasty.

1204
00:55:24.764 --> 00:55:28.463
(Taking a big bite)

1205
00:55:30.334 --> 00:55:32.273
(He clears the dish.)

1206
00:55:32.273 --> 00:55:33.334
It's tasty, right?

1207
00:55:33.943 --> 00:55:35.043
It's tasty.

1208
00:55:36.304 --> 00:55:38.443
(The members in the front seats are eating as well.)

1209
00:55:39.773 --> 00:55:42.514
(The cheese stretches.)

1210
00:55:44.854 --> 00:55:48.253
(He steals a bite of Seung Hoon's braised chicken.)

1211
00:55:49.153 --> 00:55:52.354
(Yogurt tastes the best when you lick the lid.)

1212
00:55:53.253 --> 00:55:55.523
(He is licking the yogurt lid too.)

1213
00:55:56.394 --> 00:55:57.894
(He spills it.)

1214
00:55:57.894 --> 00:55:58.963
Good job.

1215
00:56:00.204 --> 00:56:01.604
I washed it.

1216
00:56:02.503 --> 00:56:03.804
I only have one pair of clothes.

1217
00:56:03.804 --> 00:56:04.903
(The poor man in his only outfit becomes sad.)

1218
00:56:05.334 --> 00:56:07.704
(Please become clean.)

1219
00:56:08.443 --> 00:56:09.943
(Korea)

1220
00:56:09.943 --> 00:56:14.914
(They have a layover at Singapore before they arrive at Perth.)

1221
00:56:14.914 --> 00:56:17.684
(Perth)

1222
00:56:19.153 --> 00:56:20.184
This is incredible.

1223
00:56:20.184 --> 00:56:21.554
(Western Australia comes into view.)

1224
00:56:21.923 --> 00:56:24.293
The air will be delicious here.

1225
00:56:25.253 --> 00:56:26.823
There are so many trees.

1226
00:56:31.334 --> 00:56:33.863
(Perth Airport)

1227
00:56:34.463 --> 00:56:35.534
We arrived.

1228
00:56:35.534 --> 00:56:37.673
(They arrived at Perth Airport.)

1229
00:56:37.874 --> 00:56:38.903
Seriously.

1230
00:56:38.903 --> 00:56:41.073
Let's take a picture since we arrived.

1231
00:56:41.073 --> 00:56:43.644
- Okay. - Okay.

1232
00:56:44.414 --> 00:56:46.514
- Control tower, okay. - Okay.

1233
00:56:47.483 --> 00:56:49.713
- Control tower. - The weather is really nice.

1234
00:56:50.284 --> 00:56:52.253
The weather is really nice.

1235
00:56:53.084 --> 00:56:57.054
(The clear sky makes them forget fatigue.)

1236
00:56:57.954 --> 00:56:59.593
Let's take a picture. Where should we take it?

1237
00:57:00.894 --> 00:57:03.494
(They take it under the control tower.)

1238
00:57:04.593 --> 00:57:06.934
(We were kidnapped.)

1239
00:57:07.733 --> 00:57:10.503
(Perth)

1240
00:57:12.173 --> 00:57:15.273
(The capital of Western Australia is surrounded by the Indian Ocean.)

1241
00:57:16.673 --> 00:57:19.914
(It's the center of community, economy, and culture.)

1242
00:57:21.883 --> 00:57:23.814
(The business of the city...)

1243
00:57:24.613 --> 00:57:27.284
(and the relaxation of the nature coexist here.)

1244
00:57:30.854 --> 00:57:32.854
(You will face relaxation Australia has to offer.)

1245
00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:39.664
(Winner's first destination, Perth)

1246
00:57:40.463 --> 00:57:42.003
This is cool.

1247
00:57:42.633 --> 00:57:43.934
Shall we take this one?

1248
00:57:43.934 --> 00:57:46.403
- I think this is the taxi. - No, it's not.

1249
00:57:46.733 --> 00:57:47.744
What?

1250
00:57:47.744 --> 00:57:50.073
Don't we need to figure out how to get to the city?

1251
00:57:50.073 --> 00:57:52.043
It's the most important information. Airport shuttle.

1252
00:57:52.314 --> 00:57:54.543
It costs 16 dollars.

1253
00:57:55.414 --> 00:57:56.744
It's cheaper to take a taxi.

1254
00:57:57.383 --> 00:57:59.153
- It's 34 dollars. - I know.

1255
00:57:59.983 --> 00:58:01.224
It's cheaper to take a taxi.

1256
00:58:01.724 --> 00:58:03.624
- There is a taxi. - Okay, let's go.

1257
00:58:03.624 --> 00:58:05.093
- Let's go. Let's go. - Isn't it Uber?

1258
00:58:05.093 --> 00:58:06.753
- Jin Woo, there is a taxi. - It's a taxi.

1259
00:58:06.753 --> 00:58:08.224
There is a taxi sign.

1260
00:58:08.624 --> 00:58:10.064
Okay, there is a taxi.

1261
00:58:10.934 --> 00:58:12.664
Maybe only 3 people are allowed in 1 vehicle.

1262
00:58:12.664 --> 00:58:16.434
Okay. The last one will have to walk.

1263
00:58:16.974 --> 00:58:18.834
We are going to Perth.

1264
00:58:18.934 --> 00:58:20.804
Ask him how much it is to go to Perth.

1265
00:58:21.043 --> 00:58:23.204
How much is how much? I mean...

1266
00:58:23.943 --> 00:58:25.713
- How do I say it in English? - Where was it?

1267
00:58:25.713 --> 00:58:26.983
Look at the sky.

1268
00:58:27.414 --> 00:58:28.483
Taxi.

1269
00:58:29.483 --> 00:58:31.954
How many of you are there? Are you all together?

1270
00:58:31.954 --> 00:58:33.014
Four.

1271
00:58:33.014 --> 00:58:34.954
- Four people. - No problem.

1272
00:58:34.954 --> 00:58:37.193
- Okay. Thank you. - How much is it?

1273
00:58:37.193 --> 00:58:38.624
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

1274
00:58:39.124 --> 00:58:40.564
This...

1275
00:58:42.093 --> 00:58:43.963
We want to go to this address.

1276
00:58:44.463 --> 00:58:46.093
85 Stirling Street.

1277
00:58:46.693 --> 00:58:49.403
- Sedric? - Stirling.

1278
00:58:49.633 --> 00:58:52.003
- 85? - 85.

1279
00:58:53.233 --> 00:58:54.804
- It's pretty expensive. - What?

1280
00:58:55.503 --> 00:58:56.673
85 Stirling Street.

1281
00:58:57.314 --> 00:58:58.573
85 Stirling Street.

1282
00:58:59.113 --> 00:59:00.284
40 to 45 dollars.

1283
00:59:00.284 --> 00:59:02.843
Okay. 40 dollars. Let's go.

1284
00:59:03.043 --> 00:59:05.584
40 dollars. Thank you.

1285
00:59:06.113 --> 00:59:08.084
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1286
00:59:08.084 --> 00:59:09.954
I am on the opposite side.

1287
00:59:11.753 --> 00:59:13.054
The driver's seat is on the right-hand side.

1288
00:59:13.354 --> 00:59:14.793
- Lucky. - Very lucky.

1289
00:59:14.793 --> 00:59:15.994
(They are off to a good start.)

1290
00:59:16.494 --> 00:59:17.894
(Thinking)

1291
00:59:18.394 --> 00:59:20.034
We are at four dollars now.

1292
00:59:20.633 --> 00:59:22.003
It went up very quickly.

1293
00:59:23.164 --> 00:59:25.304
Don't worry. Be happy.

1294
00:59:28.704 --> 00:59:29.744
Look at the weather.

1295
00:59:31.974 --> 00:59:33.043
Perth.

1296
00:59:34.514 --> 00:59:36.684
- The weather is so nice. - Nice weather.

1297
00:59:38.113 --> 00:59:41.784
(Looking at the blue sky lightens their hearts.)

1298
00:59:46.593 --> 00:59:48.664
It's going up.

1299
00:59:54.564 --> 00:59:56.403
(They are at 8.5 dollars.)

1300
00:59:57.434 --> 00:59:59.403
He said it will be around 40 dollars.

1301
01:00:00.204 --> 01:00:01.744
He said it will take only 15 minutes.

1302
01:00:01.874 --> 01:00:03.773
It goes up every 5 seconds.

1303
01:00:06.043 --> 01:00:07.644
(Worried)

1304
01:00:10.314 --> 01:00:15.354
(They enter the downtown of Perth.)

1305
01:00:18.093 --> 01:00:20.764
- I think we're almost there. - Yes, I think so.

1306
01:00:20.894 --> 01:00:22.264
We made it!

1307
01:00:22.264 --> 01:00:23.633
It's 85th street.

1308
01:00:23.733 --> 01:00:25.793
It's 85th street!

1309
01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:26.834
(They're excited.)

1310
01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:28.104
Here, here.

1311
01:00:28.164 --> 01:00:29.834
There, there!

1312
01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:30.903
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

1313
01:00:31.104 --> 01:00:33.403
(They're excited again.)

1314
01:00:33.403 --> 01:00:35.073
- It's a lake. - We're doing this so smoothly.

1315
01:00:35.073 --> 01:00:36.573
I can't believe it we're doing it so well.

1316
01:00:36.673 --> 01:00:38.244
- Look at that. - Let's get off here. Thank you.

1317
01:00:38.244 --> 01:00:39.874
We should have some coffee here.

1318
01:00:39.874 --> 01:00:40.914
Hey, it's 30 dollars.

1319
01:00:40.914 --> 01:00:43.613
- It cost less than 40 dollars. - It's less than 40 dollars.

1320
01:00:43.613 --> 01:00:45.084
(36.3 Australian dollars)

1321
01:00:45.084 --> 01:00:46.554
- Thank you so much. - Thank you, sir.

1322
01:00:46.923 --> 01:00:48.084
Thank you.

1323
01:00:48.883 --> 01:00:50.354
The weather is really nice.

1324
01:00:52.653 --> 01:00:53.994
I feel so good!

1325
01:00:54.523 --> 01:00:56.193
I feel so good!

1326
01:00:56.994 --> 01:00:58.894
- It's a cool weather. - Yes, it's cool.

1327
01:00:58.894 --> 01:01:00.434
I've heard it's very dry here, but it's not.

1328
01:01:00.434 --> 01:01:02.434
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1329
01:01:02.434 --> 01:01:03.934
I feel great.

1330
01:01:04.733 --> 01:01:06.943
- I feel so good. Here's the hotel. - It's open.

1331
01:01:07.903 --> 01:01:10.414
This place is cute.

1332
01:01:11.773 --> 01:01:14.043
(They take a selfie to celebrate finding the hotel.)

1333
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:17.084
- You should do it upward. - The sign should be in the picture.

1334
01:01:17.954 --> 01:01:19.014
(He holds the phone higher)

1335
01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:20.253
No, that's not it.

1336
01:01:20.454 --> 01:01:22.224
- The lens should be upward. - He held the phone higher.

1337
01:01:22.224 --> 01:01:23.224
(He holds the phone upward.)

1338
01:01:23.284 --> 01:01:24.624
1, 2, 3!

1339
01:01:26.753 --> 01:01:29.293
(They arrived at their first accommodation!)

1340
01:01:29.423 --> 01:01:30.793
- It's good. - Yes!

1341
01:01:30.793 --> 01:01:32.564
You look horrible.

1342
01:01:32.733 --> 01:01:33.963
Seung Yoon, let's go in.

1343
01:01:34.133 --> 01:01:36.363
- I'll check in with Seung Yoon. - Okay, go.

1344
01:01:36.804 --> 01:01:38.573
- Seung Yoon, take out the money. - It's here.

1345
01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:42.673
I have a feeling that this place is small.

1346
01:01:43.043 --> 01:01:44.144
- Hello. - Hello.

1347
01:01:47.414 --> 01:01:48.843
- Are you a Korean? - Yes, I am.

1348
01:01:48.843 --> 01:01:50.584
- Game over. - Game over.

1349
01:01:50.584 --> 01:01:52.554
- Go ahead. - It's the booking information.

1350
01:01:52.554 --> 01:01:54.253
- We're lucky. - It's amazing.

1351
01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:56.253
It's like we finished the game.

1352
01:01:56.253 --> 01:01:58.253
- He's a Korean. - Who is he?

1353
01:01:58.253 --> 01:01:59.624
The guy at the reception desk.

1354
01:01:59.653 --> 01:02:00.963
We completed the game.

1355
01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:04.293
(They feel lucky.)

1356
01:02:04.463 --> 01:02:06.394
Did you just talk to a Korean?

1357
01:02:06.394 --> 01:02:08.003
- He's a Korean. - He's a Korean.

1358
01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:10.804
(He suddenly comes in.)

1359
01:02:11.003 --> 01:02:13.003
This staff is a Korean.

1360
01:02:13.073 --> 01:02:14.144
How are you?

1361
01:02:14.573 --> 01:02:15.773
How are you? It's nice to meet you.

1362
01:02:16.343 --> 01:02:18.914
- I think we should do this program. - He's Korean.

1363
01:02:18.914 --> 01:02:22.684
Brother, we can speak freely, right?

1364
01:02:22.684 --> 01:02:24.414
- Brother? - He's already calling him brother.

1365
01:02:24.414 --> 01:02:26.014
He's already calling him brother.

1366
01:02:26.014 --> 01:02:27.023
(They're somewhat embarrassed.)

1367
01:02:28.023 --> 01:02:29.023
(They checked in very easily.)

1368
01:02:29.023 --> 01:02:30.394
Let's go in the room.

1369
01:02:32.423 --> 01:02:34.264
- Unbelievable. - Everything's going well.

1370
01:02:34.264 --> 01:02:35.423
We're amazing.

1371
01:02:36.064 --> 01:02:38.693
- We need to see the room first. - Okay.

1372
01:02:38.693 --> 01:02:40.304
What if we go into the room and...

1373
01:02:40.764 --> 01:02:43.064
(It might be very small.)

1374
01:02:43.834 --> 01:02:44.874
It might be too small to even lie down.

1375
01:02:47.543 --> 01:02:50.104
- They must be really happy. - They look so happy.

1376
01:02:50.514 --> 01:02:52.713
It's our first time to do something like this.

1377
01:02:53.943 --> 01:02:55.943
- Thank you. - The game is over.

1378
01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:58.153
- First, we met a nice guide... - Be quiet.

1379
01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.923
- Great. - Gosh.

1380
01:03:01.224 --> 01:03:02.354
Hello.

1381
01:03:03.054 --> 01:03:04.193
Hi.

1382
01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:06.793
Do you have a Wi-Fi access in this hotel?

1383
01:03:07.164 --> 01:03:09.193
- They have. I asked already. - Okay.

1384
01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:10.963
(He has a simple mind.)

1385
01:03:10.963 --> 01:03:12.394
He said, "In hotel, Wi-Fi?"

1386
01:03:12.394 --> 01:03:13.463
What?

1387
01:03:13.463 --> 01:03:15.434
- Jin Woo. - Why? It's correct.

1388
01:03:15.434 --> 01:03:16.804
You're unbelievable.

1389
01:03:16.804 --> 01:03:18.474
That's his character.

1390
01:03:20.034 --> 01:03:22.804
(What would their room be like?)

1391
01:03:24.573 --> 01:03:26.244
- It's a nice room. - Thank you.

1392
01:03:26.314 --> 01:03:27.784
There are six beds.

1393
01:03:27.983 --> 01:03:29.383
- Or do you have more beds? - Okay.

1394
01:03:29.383 --> 01:03:30.684
(4 of them booked a room for 6 people.)

1395
01:03:30.684 --> 01:03:32.253
I guess two more people are coming.

1396
01:03:34.054 --> 01:03:36.483
- That'll be nice. - We'll be with strangers?

1397
01:03:36.653 --> 01:03:37.793
I like that.

1398
01:03:38.323 --> 01:03:39.454
What are we going to do?

1399
01:03:39.454 --> 01:03:40.624
Let's take a shower first.

1400
01:03:40.624 --> 01:03:42.164
- Let's go to the bathroom. - You're right.

1401
01:03:42.164 --> 01:03:44.093
- Let's see if there's shampoo. - We need to check it out.

1402
01:03:44.494 --> 01:03:46.863
- If two more people come in... - We're in trouble. No shampoo.

1403
01:03:46.863 --> 01:03:48.534
We're not going to be here all together.

1404
01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:49.834
- There's no shampoo. - Let's just go.

1405
01:03:49.834 --> 01:03:51.704
- Let's go the front... - Let's ask them.

1406
01:03:51.704 --> 01:03:53.133
- Let's go and buy some. - Okay.

1407
01:03:54.003 --> 01:03:55.673
Hey, give me some money.

1408
01:03:56.204 --> 01:03:58.814
First, this is emergency fund for each of us.

1409
01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:01.784
Mom ordered with her emergency fund

1410
01:04:02.084 --> 01:04:03.854
You can use this.

1411
01:04:03.854 --> 01:04:05.883
Take 50 dollars each.

1412
01:04:05.983 --> 01:04:08.054
- Give me money to buy shampoo. - Add that.

1413
01:04:08.054 --> 01:04:09.323
- That's... - Is that mine?

1414
01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:11.454
- Then take 50 dollars. - Let's go.

1415
01:04:11.624 --> 01:04:13.454
I think 20 dollars will be enough.

1416
01:04:13.564 --> 01:04:15.323
- It will be enough. - Just in case.

1417
01:04:15.724 --> 01:04:17.564
You can buy if there's anything else you need.

1418
01:04:17.894 --> 01:04:19.793
But you should tell me how much you spent.

1419
01:04:20.804 --> 01:04:23.903
(Seung Yoon is the worst frugal ever.)

1420
01:04:25.204 --> 01:04:27.974
You're buying too many things we don't need.

1421
01:04:28.604 --> 01:04:30.043
We should save on eating today.

1422
01:04:30.043 --> 01:04:31.343
We should also save tomorrow.

1423
01:04:32.573 --> 01:04:33.883
(He's excited.)

1424
01:04:35.244 --> 01:04:36.584
(He's indifferent.)

1425
01:04:37.084 --> 01:04:38.253
Come here.

1426
01:04:38.253 --> 01:04:39.753
It's one dollar.

1427
01:04:41.284 --> 01:04:43.693
That costs 95 cents, and this costs 4 dollars.

1428
01:04:44.494 --> 01:04:45.854
- It's just 4 dollars. - It's 4 dollars.

1429
01:04:46.693 --> 01:04:49.593
- It's not much. - It's okay.

1430
01:04:50.093 --> 01:04:54.604
If we spend less than 100 dollars, we can save some tomorrow.

1431
01:04:54.863 --> 01:04:57.834
We need to pay the bus fare.

1432
01:04:57.974 --> 01:05:00.073
- That one. - Let's save the money.

1433
01:05:00.744 --> 01:05:01.943
Tell me if you need more.

1434
01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:04.443
Buy me just a pair of sunglasses.

1435
01:05:05.514 --> 01:05:06.573
No.

1436
01:05:07.713 --> 01:05:09.244
No shopping.

1437
01:05:09.843 --> 01:05:13.213
(When an issue of money arises...)

1438
01:05:14.084 --> 01:05:15.724
Give me back the three dollars change.

1439
01:05:17.093 --> 01:05:19.423
(He doesn't forget to get back the money the staff borrowed.)

1440
01:05:19.994 --> 01:05:22.264
(It must be the happiest moment of a day for Seung Yoon.)

1441
01:05:23.193 --> 01:05:25.164
(He's calculating their balance.)

1442
01:05:25.334 --> 01:05:27.564
(He's happy.)

1443
01:05:28.764 --> 01:05:31.704
(Super Great, Seung Yoon!)

1444
01:05:31.974 --> 01:05:33.773
- Let's... - Yes, here...

1445
01:05:33.773 --> 01:05:35.403
How about having some Americano when Seung Yoon's not here?

1446
01:05:35.403 --> 01:05:36.443
Shall we?

1447
01:05:37.014 --> 01:05:39.814
- Ordered with her emergency fund - Ordered with her emergency fund

1448
01:05:41.584 --> 01:05:43.914
Let's add the price of Americano to the price of shampoo.

1449
01:05:43.914 --> 01:05:46.253
- Let's tell him it's the price. - Tell him it's rather expensive.

1450
01:05:46.253 --> 01:05:48.054
We don't need to give him the receipt.

1451
01:05:48.054 --> 01:05:49.124
- Let's do that. - You're right.

1452
01:05:49.784 --> 01:05:51.454
The weather is so nice.

1453
01:05:51.454 --> 01:05:52.554
(The fellowship of the shampoo is looking for trouble.)

1454
01:05:52.954 --> 01:05:54.124
It's nice.

1455
01:05:54.593 --> 01:05:56.564
- Everything's going well. - Right.

1456
01:05:56.724 --> 01:05:59.064
- Even the traffic light is on. - I feel weird.

1457
01:05:59.064 --> 01:06:00.133
It's so nice.

1458
01:06:00.133 --> 01:06:01.604
Except for when they took the hidden camera.

1459
01:06:01.604 --> 01:06:03.104
It must have driven all the bad luck from us at that time.

1460
01:06:03.104 --> 01:06:04.434
- Right. - It drove all the bad luck.

1461
01:06:04.434 --> 01:06:06.733
It's not like us when everything goes so well.

1462
01:06:07.704 --> 01:06:09.443
- I think we're here. - We're here.

1463
01:06:11.213 --> 01:06:12.374
Everything's on sale.

1464
01:06:13.613 --> 01:06:14.684
The shampoo is here.

1465
01:06:15.244 --> 01:06:16.314
It's here.

1466
01:06:16.414 --> 01:06:17.713
It's two dollars.

1467
01:06:17.784 --> 01:06:19.113
It's good. Two dollars.

1468
01:06:19.454 --> 01:06:20.684
The strawberry one is also two dollars.

1469
01:06:21.284 --> 01:06:22.624
I like the strawberry one.

1470
01:06:23.184 --> 01:06:24.523
The strawberry one is selling well.

1471
01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:26.963
- I like strawberry - I like strawberry

1472
01:06:26.963 --> 01:06:29.264
- Let's get the mango conditioner. - What are you saying?

1473
01:06:29.764 --> 01:06:30.963
That one for the body.

1474
01:06:30.963 --> 01:06:32.064
(It's time to buy the body?)

1475
01:06:32.064 --> 01:06:34.704
- Aren't we buying the soap? - We can just clean with water.

1476
01:06:35.664 --> 01:06:36.664
Still…

1477
01:06:36.804 --> 01:06:37.874
Is this the body wash?

1478
01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:40.474
- Shower cream. It's the body wash.

1479
01:06:40.644 --> 01:06:42.144
Shower gel, shower cream, five dollars.

1480
01:06:43.173 --> 01:06:44.874
I think this one's better than a soap.

1481
01:06:45.273 --> 01:06:46.474
- That's enough. - We're done.

1482
01:06:46.843 --> 01:06:48.144
- Let's go. - Is there anything else we need?

1483
01:06:48.543 --> 01:06:50.684
- How about a deodorant? - No, we don't need it.

1484
01:06:52.514 --> 01:06:54.454
(On his way to check-out, he saw...)

1485
01:06:54.454 --> 01:06:55.753
Can we buy a Doritos?

1486
01:06:57.793 --> 01:06:59.494
(It's more expensive than the strawberry shampoo.)

1487
01:06:59.494 --> 01:07:00.624
Would you like some snack?

1488
01:07:01.164 --> 01:07:02.894
Let's save money on snacks.

1489
01:07:03.193 --> 01:07:04.394
Are you going to eat if I buy one?

1490
01:07:04.394 --> 01:07:05.894
- I surely will. - Okay.

1491
01:07:07.003 --> 01:07:09.003
- That Doritos is... - I'll get a small one.

1492
01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:11.604
I'll get a small one, okay? It's a small one.

1493
01:07:11.604 --> 01:07:13.774
(He lied.)

1494
01:07:14.774 --> 01:07:17.944
Doritos is sold everywhere. It's even sold in Korea.

1495
01:07:19.144 --> 01:07:20.184
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1496
01:07:20.184 --> 01:07:21.843
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1497
01:07:21.843 --> 01:07:23.014
- Thank you. - Have a nice day!

1498
01:07:23.554 --> 01:07:25.453
- Why are you eating it alone? - That's what I'm saying.

1499
01:07:25.453 --> 01:07:26.614
It tastes great.

1500
01:07:26.854 --> 01:07:27.883
It tastes great.

1501
01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:29.753
- It's delicious. - It is.

1502
01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:33.764
(They buy a 2-dollar shampoo and eat a 2.5-dollar snack.)

1503
01:07:33.764 --> 01:07:34.793
This is delicious.

1504
01:07:36.324 --> 01:07:37.333
I feel happy.

1505
01:07:38.734 --> 01:07:40.093
- By the way, - What?

1506
01:07:40.093 --> 01:07:42.003
- I feel like we're here for fun. - Right.

1507
01:07:42.734 --> 01:07:44.873
Those who want to take a shower, do it.

1508
01:07:44.873 --> 01:07:46.074
- Go ahead. - Okay.

1509
01:07:48.373 --> 01:07:49.444
What irritates me is...

1510
01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:51.413
that even if I take a shower, I have no clean clothes to change.

1511
01:07:51.614 --> 01:07:53.314
You have to put on the same clothes again.

1512
01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:54.814
You have to put on the same ones again.

1513
01:07:54.814 --> 01:07:56.343
I want to change at least my underwear.

1514
01:07:56.343 --> 01:07:57.783
I have nothing to change.

1515
01:07:57.913 --> 01:08:00.114
The shampoo doesn't make a lot of bubbles.

1516
01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:02.684
It's the cheapest one. Can't help it.

1517
01:08:03.283 --> 01:08:05.253
I heard the one with fewer bubbles is better for health.

1518
01:08:05.953 --> 01:08:08.024
I mean I like it.

1519
01:08:09.764 --> 01:08:11.264
If only I have a scissor,

1520
01:08:11.734 --> 01:08:13.604
I can make a backpack with it.

1521
01:08:13.864 --> 01:08:15.404
- You mean this one? - No, that one.

1522
01:08:16.304 --> 01:08:17.373
Which one?

1523
01:08:17.373 --> 01:08:18.633
(Does he mean the plastic bag?)

1524
01:08:19.853 --> 01:08:21.594
(Does he mean the plastic bag?)

1525
01:08:22.323 --> 01:08:23.563
- Did you get the scissor? - Yes.

1526
01:08:23.993 --> 01:08:25.164
How are you going to make it?

1527
01:08:26.264 --> 01:08:28.733
(He suddenly takes off his shoes.)

1528
01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:30.974
I thought about it a while ago.

1529
01:08:31.903 --> 01:08:34.943
(1st, he takes out his shoelaces.)

1530
01:08:35.603 --> 01:08:37.974
(2nd, he cuts them in half.)

1531
01:08:38.474 --> 01:08:39.714
I calculated it already.

1532
01:08:39.714 --> 01:08:41.243
(3rd, he gets the plastic bag from the duty-free shop.)

1533
01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.783
(4th, he makes holes with some spaces.)

1534
01:08:44.084 --> 01:08:46.014
It might be torn if we put something heavy in.

1535
01:08:46.283 --> 01:08:48.224
- I think it's quite possible. - Right.

1536
01:08:48.483 --> 01:08:49.953
But I trust you, Min Ho.

1537
01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:55.164
I want you to trust me

1538
01:08:55.563 --> 01:08:57.594
(He ties the shoelaces together.)

1539
01:08:59.164 --> 01:09:03.033
(He ties them tight not to come undone.)

1540
01:09:04.203 --> 01:09:07.044
I trust you as we're team members.

1541
01:09:07.674 --> 01:09:08.703
- It's amazing. - It's done.

1542
01:09:08.703 --> 01:09:11.273
(The duty-free plastic backpack is done.)

1543
01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:14.113
You need to be careful when you put it on and off.

1544
01:09:14.214 --> 01:09:15.613
You shouldn't do it roughly.

1545
01:09:15.613 --> 01:09:16.853
(Being careful)

1546
01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:19.014
You shouldn't put your last arm in like this.

1547
01:09:19.014 --> 01:09:20.254
- Show us. - Amazing.

1548
01:09:20.254 --> 01:09:22.624
- You have to put your arms at once. - It looks great actually.

1549
01:09:23.794 --> 01:09:25.693
My pants are too long.

1550
01:09:26.393 --> 01:09:27.823
That's why I folded the bottom of my pants.

1551
01:09:27.823 --> 01:09:29.693
(They travel in Western Australia.)

1552
01:09:29.693 --> 01:09:31.834
Why am I even doing this?

1553
01:09:32.233 --> 01:09:34.834
(His backpack becomes a burden.)

1554
01:09:36.874 --> 01:09:38.004
(It breaks.)

1555
01:09:38.403 --> 01:09:39.504
It broke.

1556
01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:42.374
(His backpack can be fixed while moving.)

1557
01:09:42.374 --> 01:09:44.143
- Have you seen this? - Okay. Great.

1558
01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:45.813
Thank you.

1559
01:09:45.813 --> 01:09:47.243
(Please stay with me this summer.)

1560
01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:51.453
- Did you buy this? - Let's go. Let's go.

1561
01:09:52.014 --> 01:09:53.554
Let's buy underwear first.

1562
01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:56.054
This is a shopping mall, though.

1563
01:09:56.584 --> 01:09:58.353
- We shouldn't go in here. - Let's go back.

1564
01:09:58.353 --> 01:09:59.953
- Don't even look at it. - We shouldn't.

1565
01:09:59.953 --> 01:10:01.294
We should go to a market.

1566
01:10:01.794 --> 01:10:03.693
Don't turn your head to the left.

1567
01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.964
- We can't go in there. - Of course.

1568
01:10:07.334 --> 01:10:09.233
If we find a good market,

1569
01:10:09.233 --> 01:10:12.174
- we can find cheap underwear. - Can we find something cheap?

1570
01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:13.233
That's right.

1571
01:10:13.603 --> 01:10:16.374
(Let's find the cheapest market in Perth.)

1572
01:10:16.914 --> 01:10:18.243
City Beach.

1573
01:10:18.374 --> 01:10:20.283
Let's get our underwear from here.

1574
01:10:21.914 --> 01:10:23.214
I think it will cost us a lot.

1575
01:10:23.214 --> 01:10:26.283
Let's check out the prices first. It's a multishop.

1576
01:10:27.483 --> 01:10:29.483
- It's expensive here. - It's a multishop.

1577
01:10:29.823 --> 01:10:31.653
Let's leave.

1578
01:10:31.653 --> 01:10:32.794
It's way too expensive.

1579
01:10:33.153 --> 01:10:34.863
They have all the streetwear brands.

1580
01:10:35.393 --> 01:10:37.733
(Look for a shop which is placed just out side of the city center.)

1581
01:10:38.863 --> 01:10:40.964
- It looks cheap here. - I think so too.

1582
01:10:41.664 --> 01:10:44.004
- I think they sell underwear. - All the prices are low.

1583
01:10:44.804 --> 01:10:47.374
But I don't think it's cheap to buy it here as it's a souvenir shop.

1584
01:10:47.804 --> 01:10:49.573
I think I will find nice underwear here though.

1585
01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.813
We're lack of our ability.

1586
01:10:53.813 --> 01:10:54.884
Yes.

1587
01:10:57.283 --> 01:10:58.414
There it is.

1588
01:10:59.453 --> 01:11:00.823
He's dancing like this.

1589
01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.624
Ask people for some money.

1590
01:11:02.624 --> 01:11:05.054
Or 23rd avenue. I think it's that way.

1591
01:11:05.653 --> 01:11:07.964
(They check the map.)

1592
01:11:10.334 --> 01:11:12.434
- We were here earlier. - We were here just now.

1593
01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:14.504
It's the Murray Street Mall that we went earlier.

1594
01:11:15.203 --> 01:11:16.304
- Is it? - Yes.

1595
01:11:16.804 --> 01:11:19.033
(There's one sentence that you need to say when you are lost.)

1596
01:11:19.974 --> 01:11:21.344
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1597
01:11:21.874 --> 01:11:24.743
May I ask you something? Which is...

1598
01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:27.184
the most cheap shop in this area?

1599
01:11:27.943 --> 01:11:28.943
We don't know.

1600
01:11:29.044 --> 01:11:30.914
- Let's ask someone else. - Okay.

1601
01:11:31.384 --> 01:11:32.684
Let's ask one person.

1602
01:11:32.684 --> 01:11:34.254
We are putting so much effort...

1603
01:11:34.254 --> 01:11:36.624
to buy cheap underwear.

1604
01:11:37.823 --> 01:11:40.063
Where is the Reject Shop please?

1605
01:11:40.693 --> 01:11:43.164
- Are there any cheap shops to buy? - Shops with low prices.

1606
01:11:45.193 --> 01:11:47.264
- I don't remember the names. Sorry. - Okay.

1607
01:11:47.264 --> 01:11:49.504
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1608
01:11:49.903 --> 01:11:51.974
Everyone is saying we should just go to the Murray Street.

1609
01:11:52.334 --> 01:11:53.674
How many people did you ask?

1610
01:11:53.674 --> 01:11:54.773
- We asked 2 people so far. - 2 people.

1611
01:11:56.443 --> 01:11:59.014
- Let's have a look in Target. - Target!

1612
01:12:00.584 --> 01:12:02.544
"The Reject Shop, Target, is where..."

1613
01:12:02.544 --> 01:12:03.953
"you can buy daily necessities and clothes..."

1614
01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:05.983
"with fairly cheap prices."

1615
01:12:06.983 --> 01:12:09.783
(They read it twice actually.)

1616
01:12:10.294 --> 01:12:13.393
(They walked past a few times.)

1617
01:12:14.124 --> 01:12:16.594
- Let's have a look in Target. - Target!

1618
01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:18.764
- We can buy things with low prices. - Let's buy them here.

1619
01:12:18.764 --> 01:12:20.063
We read it in the book.

1620
01:12:20.063 --> 01:12:22.004
- We chose you, Target. - We chose you, Target.

1621
01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.603
(They look funny.)

1622
01:12:24.603 --> 01:12:26.703
- It said they sell cheap things. - We found Target.

1623
01:12:26.703 --> 01:12:28.603
- Great work, guys. - They sell everything cheap here.

1624
01:12:28.603 --> 01:12:30.214
The book said Target sells everything cheap.

1625
01:12:30.214 --> 01:12:31.914
- It's here. - Great work guys.

1626
01:12:32.174 --> 01:12:33.643
Hey, it's only four dollars.

1627
01:12:33.643 --> 01:12:36.184
- 4 dollars. - 4 dollars.

1628
01:12:36.184 --> 01:12:39.014
Hey, it's 25 dollars for 7.

1629
01:12:39.014 --> 01:12:40.153
Really?

1630
01:12:40.684 --> 01:12:41.754
Good.

1631
01:12:42.384 --> 01:12:45.323
We were looking for a shop like this.

1632
01:12:45.323 --> 01:12:48.323
- Let's take everything. - Hey, check this out.

1633
01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:51.563
- 6 dollars. - 6 dollars.

1634
01:12:51.563 --> 01:12:53.063
Put it down.

1635
01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.334
15 dollars?

1636
01:12:56.603 --> 01:12:58.573
(He chose 4 different colors.)

1637
01:12:59.703 --> 01:13:00.773
It's amazing here.

1638
01:13:00.773 --> 01:13:02.743
The T-shirt is only five dollars.

1639
01:13:02.743 --> 01:13:05.313
- Let's just buy these for now. - Okay.

1640
01:13:05.773 --> 01:13:07.243
It's 117 dollars.

1641
01:13:07.243 --> 01:13:08.813
117 dollars, right?

1642
01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:11.254
We were lucky.

1643
01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:13.214
We only wandered a little and found this shop.

1644
01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:14.323
That's right.

1645
01:13:14.554 --> 01:13:17.853
- We made it. - We made it.

1646
01:13:18.323 --> 01:13:20.063
Where are the hoodies that are under 30 dollars?

1647
01:13:20.264 --> 01:13:21.363
It's at the back.

1648
01:13:21.794 --> 01:13:23.124
I want a grey one.

1649
01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:25.393
Shall we all have matching hoodies?

1650
01:13:26.164 --> 01:13:27.533
I want a black one.

1651
01:13:27.964 --> 01:13:29.103
I will take this one then.

1652
01:13:29.403 --> 01:13:31.304
- It looks nice. - Good.

1653
01:13:32.974 --> 01:13:35.703
It's been so long since I put the clothes on...

1654
01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:37.174
straight after I bought.

1655
01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:40.813
It was a good price for hoodies like this.

1656
01:13:40.813 --> 01:13:42.983
- Was it? - It was a good purchase.

1657
01:13:42.983 --> 01:13:44.813
- We did well. - It was almost 100 dollars.

1658
01:13:45.914 --> 01:13:47.684
As we're wearing matching hoodies,

1659
01:13:48.184 --> 01:13:50.594
we look like escaped prisoners...

1660
01:13:50.594 --> 01:13:52.124
who are trying not to look like escaped prisoners.

1661
01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:57.294
(They are not prisoners in disguise.)

1662
01:13:58.164 --> 01:14:01.804
(A long day passes.)

1663
01:14:04.103 --> 01:14:08.174
(We're from Rottnest Island.)

1664
01:14:08.603 --> 01:14:10.974
(Are you here to see me?)

1665
01:14:11.374 --> 01:14:13.584
(They're excited to see a Quokka.)

1666
01:14:14.113 --> 01:14:16.084
(He fails to take a selfie with Quokka.)

1667
01:14:16.384 --> 01:14:18.554
(Quokka is strong.)

1668
01:14:21.483 --> 01:14:23.554
(It's a place where they can enjoy many activities.)

1669
01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.523
(The experienced skydivers are enjoying it.)

1670
01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:29.393
(Actually not.)

1671
01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:32.493
(Scream!)

1672
01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:39.603
(Jin Woo does not have any experience in skydiving.)

1673
01:14:40.374 --> 01:14:42.143
I don't think I will do it well.

1674
01:14:42.304 --> 01:14:44.573
(Can he make it this time?)

1675
01:14:45.544 --> 01:14:48.584
(They fill their tummies.)

1676
01:14:49.813 --> 01:14:52.453
(They spend a great day.)

1677
01:14:57.054 --> 01:14:58.594
I am disappointed in Seung Yoon.

1678
01:14:59.224 --> 01:15:01.363
It's funny he mentioned it.

1679
01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.924
- No, it's just that... - I still feel bad about it.

1680
01:15:02.924 --> 01:15:05.794
I don't want to hear it.

1681
01:15:06.533 --> 01:15:08.434
So are you saying you're upset about it?

1682
01:15:08.603 --> 01:15:10.073
Yes. I am.

1683
01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:11.903
Let's just do one thing today.
