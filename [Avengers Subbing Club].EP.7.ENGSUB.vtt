00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Episode 7

3
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400
Y-yeobo, you’re awake?

4
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.350
Yes, I came to get the medicine that Director Lee gave me.

5
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.550
Yes. As it is, we had totally forgotten about this earlier, so…

6
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.550
Let’s go in. Yes.

7
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.150
What is that?

8
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.000
You… have a foolish side to you.

9
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.400
These days, I keep having moments of forgetfulness.

10
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.400
Are you going through menopause?

11
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.500
Why is this like this?

12
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.500
It was already there.

13
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.150
Let’s go in now.

14
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.500
Was it?

15
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.250
So, everything we did last night was pointless, wasn’t it?

16
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.300
We even recorded everything, but there was nothing to get.

17
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.300
Just a lot of supporting that wasn’t any fun.

18
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.100
I think that illegal methods definitely don’t suit us at all.

19
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.750
Trying to get revenge nicely on bad guys just may be a Mission Impossible.

20
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.750
What’s this?

21
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.950
-Did he hit you again?
-Ay… ay…

22
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.400
When? Yesterday?

23
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.200
Ay… it’s just that he grabbed my wrist…

24
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.750
Aish. Do you still want to make excuses for that person?

25
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.650
Now, we can’t tolerate it any longer.

26
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.730
Rather than a big revenge, I think this is more urgent.

27
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.660
Aooo. Aooo. My insides are going to burst. I should have seriously just broken his wrist before.

28
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.260
Ay, that isn’t a method for our Avengers Club…

29
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.500
Yah! If that person takes the health tonic and becomes stronger, and he hits you again…

30
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.700
That’s it. That’s it. That… Come here. Come here.

31
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.400
Oh! Oh, they’re totally crazy.

32
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.000
Oh. That’s right. Totally.

33
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.000
Usually, I’m satisfied with even little things,

34
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.400
and I spend time comfortably with family and acquaintances.

35
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.900
However, occasionally, there are times when a face that even I don’t recognize comes out.

36
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.000
No one is trustworthy…

37
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.200
and it feels as if everyone in the world is looking down on me, so that I get overcome with anger!

38
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.160
Then! I just can’t control it by myself.

39
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.760
Of course, it’s hard on you, but it must also be very hard on your family.

40
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.130
How do you, her guardians, see it?

41
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.830
She just runs into cars, and throws water at strangers.

42
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.060
Ah! And she curses very well.

43
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.830
The thing is that when alcohol is involved, things get a lot worse.

44
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.230
She just throws things…

45
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.030
and, she even hits people.

46
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.800
That’s right.

47
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.160
It’s this h-hand, that’s the problem.

48
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.000
And, I can’t even break off this wrist!

49
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.330
Passages and blockages. The blockages must be made passages.

50
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.630
If the blockages are cleared, then the pain will go away.

51
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.560
If it’s blocked, however, so that it can’t go through, then the problem will appear.

52
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.760
To put it simply, it’s an anger disease. Eh?

53
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.000
If it’s blocked, it has to be pierced and cleared out.

54
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I’ll make up medicine for 15 days, so take it and see what happens.

55
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.230
However, if it’s taken by someone whose body won’t accept it,

56
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.230
will there be any issues?

57
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.130
That is, could taking this cause any health problems with the body or anything?

58
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.230
Don’t worry about health.

59
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.230
Then, since you’re making it anyway, could you put something in it so that alcohol doesn’t seem desirable?

60
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.060
It’s all in here.

61
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.930
Since it contains medicine to purify the body, alcohol and meat will become unappealing for the time being.

62
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.300
This is the specialty of my practice.

63
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.530
So, when the health tonic that we ordered today arrives…

64
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.330
Change it with the ones that Lee Byung Soo had given him.

65
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.360
That’s right. That’s right.

66
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360
Morning and night, make sure to feed them to him diligently.

67
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.800
You’re good at that kind of thing.

68
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.260
The effect will be definite, won’t it?

69
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.630
I don’t know how effective that medicine will be, but we need to try it.

70
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.930
We can’t just beat him in the same way.

71
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.530
And, we can’t make it so that he can’t use his hand at all!

72
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.700
If it’s a method like this, then I think I can do this any time.

73
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.000
Okay. Okay. Let’s try to make him into a person.

74
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.930
Before Seo Jin left, he really wasn’t like that.

75
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.330
Eh-hey, I told you that you can’t fix a person, but…

76
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.330
Okay. Let’s at least try it once.

77
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.500
Since Mi Sook says that she’ll keep him until the end.

78
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.160
Morning and night, diligently.

79
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.760
Morning and night, diligently.

80
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.060
We have to keep doing the campaign support project as well.

81
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.060
So that they don’t become suspicious.

82
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.230
<i>The rebirth project, is it going well?</i>

83
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.630
<i>Then the medicine that you swapped out, you eat it.</i>

84
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.130
Yeobo, the health tonic that Director Lee had given you.

85
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.430
Oh yes, there’s that, isn’t there?

86
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.900
I had forgotten also,

87
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.430
but now I’ll make sure you get them morning and night without fail.

88
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.660
Now, you finally seem like yourself. Mmm. Mmm.

89
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.160
Water

90
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.430
I slept well, but my body is just settling down.

91
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.860
Already?

92
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.900
Yes?

93
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.230
No.

94
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.330
No. I mean that there is no way it could have an effect already.

95
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.530
If you eat the health tonic diligently, then your condition will improve.

96
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.160
If you’re going to campaign, you should eat well and be strong.

97
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.560
What’s wrong?

98
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.260
Does it not taste good?

99
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.830
No.

100
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.960
Don’t you have any marinated fern?

101
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.530
Thank you. Thank you.

102
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.960
I had run out of money and run out of courage as well.

103
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.960
Definitely, there is no one like Baek Seo.

104
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.960
You. Cold one.

105
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.130
Sunbae, hello.

106
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.130
Why do you break into the queue?

107
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.830
I’m saying that you should drink a cold one and settle your insides.

108
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.230
And, stop worrying your mother.

109
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.260
What business is it of yours?

110
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.960
You should get rid of that hand.

111
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.000
Can’t you see Baek Seo’s expression?

112
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.000
Do you dislike it?

113
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.800
She says that she doesn’t dislike it.

114
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.100
As for you, it’s best that you don’t open your mouth.

115
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.860
Yah. He attacked you by the fact.

116
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.460
Ay.

117
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.700
Don’t. Don’t.

118
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.800
What? Daebak!

119
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.500
Did sunbae just pay for your drink then go?

120
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.100
Isn’t he interested in you perhaps?

121
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.430
What is this now?

122
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.160
Are you dating? With that country jerk?

123
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.260
What? What? Aish. I’m always the last…

124
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.830
Huh?

125
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.600
What’s going on? At this hour?

126
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.960
There is some place we have to go together.

127
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.430
With me?

128
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.530
A couples gathering.

129
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.730
<i>Plan B is necessary.</i>

130
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.860
Ahhh.

131
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.130
What is this? You said it’s a couples gathering.

132
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.360
They’re coming now.

133
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.360
-Oh.
-Yes.

134
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.760
Oh, sunbae!

135
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.760
Director Lee, how are you here?

136
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.230
This is the yoga studio that I attend with your wife.

137
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.030
They say that couple yoga is so great.

138
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.230
Mr. Candidate, you’re so busy campaigning that I thought you might be tired.

139
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.230
So, I reserved this session for us.

140
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.900
Oh, yes. Anyway, thank you for thinking of me.

141
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.160
Please sit.

142
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.800
Put both feet together, and raise your right leg.

143
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.030
Put the flat of your foot against your thigh and resting it there lightly,

144
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.630
put both hands together in front of you.

145
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.730
Now, both hands should be released first,

146
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.600
and now release your leg slowly as well.

147
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.330
We will breathe deeply now.

148
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.230
The two couples should now put their backs together and sit.

149
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.160
Please make sure your backs are completely touching.

150
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.430
And, then slowly, slowly turn your bodies to the left and put your hand on top of your partner’s knee.

151
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.660
Then with the right hand, grab your knee.

152
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.400
Then the men will lie back as they are.

153
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.360
Enough

154
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.730
Enough

155
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.260
Ow. Do it gently, gently.

156
00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.560
Class will finish here now. You’ve worked hard. Namaste.

157
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.630
Namaste. Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.560
Ow.

159
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.160
Ow. It was okay.

160
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.100
Did you find it worth doing?

161
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.860
Wait. Today, there is still a highlight left.

162
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.930
There is a teacher who is really famous for her meditation.

163
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.030
Someone else is coming?

164
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.960
They say that even the highest levels of politicians relax their minds with this person.

165
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.460
They say that just by looking at one’s aura, she is able to completely understand a person.

166
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.300
-What is this?
-What’s this? Why have the lights been turned off?

167
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.000
Hello.

168
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.400
We will start the meditation.

169
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.760
Close your eyes.

170
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.300
Do not look behind you.

171
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.900
Yeobo, do as she says.

172
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.360
Close your eyes.

173
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:20.200
Today we will become the selves inside us who had been scarred.

174
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.330
Follow me.

175
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.130
It is not my fault.

176
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.400
It is not my fault.

177
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:36.430
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

178
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.560
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

179
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.530
Ow!
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

180
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.130
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

181
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.530
Say it loudly. Once again. The inferior and lacking me is not me.

182
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.260
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

183
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.000
Well done.

184
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.630
The blaming and angry me is not me.

185
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.400
The blaming and angry me is not me.

186
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.500
The hitting me is also not me.

187
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.860
Do not look behind you.

188
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.100
Yeobo.

189
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.300
The angry person should follow along.

190
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.360
The hitting me is not me.

191
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.460
The hitting me

192
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.700
is not... me.

193
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.430
Good.

194
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.830
Now, I am not the me that I used to know.

195
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.900
I am reborn.

196
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.360
Healing time.

197
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:52.460
We will now have time to face our inner selves.

198
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I’m going out.

199
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.400
Do not look behind you.

200
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.300
Shee

201
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.700
Yeobo

202
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.550
Is it finished?

203
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.750
She’s gone.

204
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.150
Yeobo, you liked it, didn’t you?

205
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.200
Yes. It was a bit scary though.

206
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.500
I am not me.

207
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.300
She’s really a famous person?

208
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.700
Of course.

209
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.300
<i>…has started.</i>

210
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:52.650
<i>Because they’re caring for their young, the dads lose almost half of their body weight.</i>

211
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:58.150
<i>Even from bitter colds of 50 degrees below zero, they are protecting their eggs.</i>

212
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.750
<i>They put the eggs on the tops of their feet,</i>

213
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.600
<i>and while it’s heavy for them to even walk,</i>

214
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:11.600
<i>if it’s cold on the outer edges, then they take turns going to the inner part where it’s warmer.</i>

215
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.450
Yeobo. What are you doing instead of sleeping?

216
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.250
Oh. Oh.

217
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.550
Are you crying?

218
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:43.050
Wildlife and us, were we always this sad?

219
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.700
<i>He cried! Our plan must be having an effect.</i>

220
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.650
<i>Candidate Baek Young Pyo Rebirth Project must continue.</i>

221
00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.000
The Support Project is also continuing.

222
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.250
Oh. Oh, are we being too much?

223
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.850
I said that I would try.

224
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.350
Thank you.

225
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.700
As it was, I was feeling weak and tired.

226
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.400
Why don’t you take one upstairs?

227
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.000
He said that he wants to think of you as his mother and do his best as a family.

228
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.500
Go ahead and take care of him.

229
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.700
You can just take care of him then.

230
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.000
These days, they say the parents’ ability is determined by the outcome of the child.

231
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.710
Just think of it as helping me out, and please take care of him.

232
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.860
Do you want to drink this?

233
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.240
Is there a secret plan that I don’t know about?

234
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.600
It’s part of the Support Plan.

235
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.950
Ahh.

236
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.660
Thank you, mother!

237
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.480
I think I have finally figured out what you are good at.

238
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.310
Being a good wife and wise mother. It’s two jobs.

239
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.080
I don’t expect a good husband.

240
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.710
I’ll expect at least a good dad.

241
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.440
Will those two be able to become close?

242
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.460
Are you taking the medicine that mother is giving you and studying well?

243
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.640
Yes, father.

244
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.370
Thank you, mother.

245
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.570
It sounds good to hear you say mother.

246
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.866
What would be good for a student studying for his exams…

247
00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:53.300
I’ll look into it some.

248
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.730
Mother and son. It looks good.

249
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.350
<i>Praise often.</i>

250
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.820
Your style today is good.

251
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.710
It’s the school uniform that I wear every day.

252
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.840
<i>Properly select and provide snacks.</i>

253
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.800
What are you doing?

254
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.130
Mmm. Since you’re studying, so that you can eat some fruit before you continue studying.

255
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.750
Give it to me. Give it to me.

256
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.800
Was the apple originally this small?

257
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.840
Oh, give it to me.

258
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.840
Is there really anything you can’t do?

259
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.440
<i>I speak 'I am' sentence.</i>

260
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.620
Because you do everything so well, I really like it.

261
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.350
Aren’t you trying too hard?

262
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.710
When it’s just the two of us, you should just act comfortably.

263
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.820
Because you are considerate of me, I am very happy.

264
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.640
I am comfortable even now.

265
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.460
It’s because I am very uncomfortable.

266
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.440
They say the skin has a lot of nutrients.

267
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.400
I’ll eat it well.

268
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:48.080
Aigoo. Ai, today’s dinner, what shall I feed my children?

269
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.260
Unnie is really a good mother.

270
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.080
A “good mother” - that’s our Mi Sook, isn’t she?

271
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.310
Oh, no.

272
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.970
I still don’t know how to become a good mother.

273
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:05.020
I think unnie must have been born a good mother from the start.

274
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.510
If I had been born as a mother,

275
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.970
do you think I would confidently be able to do it well?

276
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.640
I thought that if one just had some children and raised them, that made one a mother.

277
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.530
Since I never lived as a daughter, is that why it’s so hard to be a mother?

278
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.640
I sometimes get thoughts like those.

279
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.800
Ehy.

280
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.220
It’s not as if there is a formula to being a mother. That’s enough of that.

281
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.660
It’s just that if you follow your fate, then you become a mother

282
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.880
and live as a mother.

283
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.000
I…

284
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.000
Jung Hye is already a good mother.

285
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.440
The name “mother”,

286
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.730
I do want to hear it and I did want to call someone that.

287
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.620
But, from the time I was born, I don’t think that was mine to be.

288
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.710
Living as one family is still difficult, isn’t it?

289
00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.640
And, the word “mother” still sounds strange.

290
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.040
There needs to be time spent between parents and children.

291
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:14.420

292
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.700
Tada!

293
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.520
Ohhhhhh

294
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.160
It’s good.

295
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:47.780
Heol~

296
00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.500
You should have cut it up before you put it in.

297
00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.480
I should?

298
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.820
I read that putting in some green onion makes it more delicious.

299
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.100
Try it!

300
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.000
I'll eat well.

301
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.220
How is it?

302
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.920
It's delicious.

303
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.300
Is it?

304
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.960
Mmmm

305
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.980
Less delicious than Hee Soo's...

306
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.220
but better than yours.

307
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:33.880
Eh?

308
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.520
I'll eat well.

309
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.280
Mmm

310
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.020
Cooking ramyun is quite easy.

311
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.220
<i>What should we eat next time?</i>

312
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.400
Are you really cutting it up to eat?

313
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.160
Son!

314
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.720
Take some breaks.

315
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.860
Shall we play a game together, it’s been awhile.

316
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.620
I have many things to study.

317
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.580
Yes.

318
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.340
Tail them.

319
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:52.760
Yes.

320
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.340
Yes, father!

321
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.540
The site in the Philippines has been dealt with well.

322
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.680
A few years ago,

323
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.840
you also said it had been dealt with well.

324
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.100
I learned a lot from that case, father.

325
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.520
If you learned a lot,

326
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.420
then isn’t it about time to show some results?

327
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.400
I understand fully.

328
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.500
Let’s do it properly.

329
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.620
Did you find out anything?

330
00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.180
It seems like a parents' meeting.

331
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.260
What’s with this woman?

332
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.080
I will find out more.

333
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.040
She is strange in many ways.

334
00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.600
I can't step back like this.

335
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.260
Ah hot!

336
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.340
Ah, it’s been a long time since I was at school.

337
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.180
Ah

338
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.360
Son...

339
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.300
Wow

340
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.900
That car is hella expensive.

341
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.900
Wow, that ajumma is totally pretty.

342
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.920
Is she a celebrity?

343
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:22.700
Yah!

344
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.440
Why would a celebrity meet with such a country kid?

345
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.980
She can't be his mom.

346
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.740
Your style today is good, too.

347
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.420
Could it be something like that?

348
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.380
What? What?

349
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.460
You know that Sunbae is quite good looking.

350
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.860
So he takes money from ajummas and...

351
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.900
does reckless things?

352
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:39.920
Daebak!

353
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.800
Wonjo Gyoje!
<i>(Wonjo Gyoje: paid relations with minors)</i>

354
00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.680
Hey Hey Baek Seo!
Did you see it?

355
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.800
The country punk is having a Wonjo Gyoje?

356
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:02.660
What?

357
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.560
Wonjo Gyoje!

358
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.860
Not too long ago, I saw some ajumma take that punk away in her very luxurious car.

359
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.080
If they get into a luxury car, are they all in wonjo gyoje?

360
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.400
Yah

361
00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.260
Are you taking that punk’s side?

362
00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.400
Hey, Baek Seo!

363
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.720
You are not dating that country kid, right?

364
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.460
Yah

365
00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.200
Why she is not answering?

366
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.400
Why are you laughing?

367
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.540
I was surprised that you actually came to the school.

368
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.920
I just did it,
as a treat for a brain.

369
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.240
I thought you came as a mother.

370
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.400
Mmm

371
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.400
I can't do it.

372
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.040
Let's go back to the original!

373
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.560
Yes!

374
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.380
Madam.

375
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.140
You’re saying this is in front of the school?

376
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.560
Yes.

377
00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.380
It seems she went to pick him up.

378
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.180
That's all?

379
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.280
Yes

380
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.840
Keep watching them!

381
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.680
Baek Seo, why?

382
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.680
Nothing. We'll be late for school.
Let's hurry.

383
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.800
By the way, that senior, he’s definitely using his looks to get what he wants.

384
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.740
You, stay away from him!

385
00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.780
Ah, why do you care?

386
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.500
Ay, why are you holding that, Student Soo Gyum?

387
00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.500
Aigoo

388
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.900
I'm late. I'm late.

389
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.480
Where's Jung Hye?

390
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.960
She went to the rest room.

391
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:43.860
What's that?

392
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.640
Mi Sook Ajumma's while hair.
It's the third.

393
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.080
Aigoo

394
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.420
Why are you holding it?

395
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.040
Unnie is the one who needs to be taking the health tonic.

396
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.400
As it is, I’m already taking it.

397
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.500
- It’s what gives me energy.
- That’s right. That’s right.

398
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.460
You need to eat it and become more energetic.

399
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.000
Will you exercise with me?

400
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.660
Kick boxing? Fencing?

401
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.260
You will, Madam?

402
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.840
Shall we all do it together?

403
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.130
No, no!

404
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.380
By the way, this time, our operation is something proper, right?

405
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.660
If we keep on like this,
I think this will be the real revenge.

406
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.660
No one will get hurt, a peaceful revenge.

407
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.860
Aigoo aigoo, you're so gentle.

408
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.060
Give me your phone!

409
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.320
Keep it in your mind whenever I call.

410
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.500
[Never forgive]

411
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.180
Oh?

412
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.180
I like it.

413
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.280
I will too.

414
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.540
I will store it.

415
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.880
N.E.V.E.R F.O.R.G.I.V.E

416
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.900
Mom came and took her son away already.

417
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.200
With his aunts, there were three people who came.

418
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:18.840
One

419
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:19.860
Two

420
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.580
Three

421
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.460
What's that? That combination?

422
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.320
Going home?

423
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.340
Yes.

424
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.660
I have an appointment with President Kim Jung Yun.

425
00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:55.920
Ok

426
00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.480
Keep trying to do well with that.

427
00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.440
By the way,

428
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.680
sister-in-law has an unexpected side to her.

429
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.160
What?

430
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.200
Apparently, she said that being born was not that child’s fault.

431
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.040
Why don’t you mind your own business?

432
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.100
Those two seem to be getting along well.

433
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.880
That probably wasn’t an easy thing to do.

434
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.600
Yes

435
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:15.600
Fortunately

436
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:17.760
However,

437
00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.080
she should be more careful.

438
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:21.620
What?

439
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:22.480
Well...

440
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.260
People talk about others easily.

441
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.500
President Kim Jung Yun is worried too.

442
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.540
Sister-in-law is so young and the child is all grown up.

443
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.160
If people who like to talk put about baseless rumors anyway,

444
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.560
then that could be problematic for the company as well.

445
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.600
Ha ha ha what...

446
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.860
Your imagination is too much.

447
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.120
OK.
Work hard!

448
00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.420
- It looks good.
- Everyone, let's drink.

449
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.460
The smoke hurts, right?

450
00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:21.900
Aigoo

451
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.640
Our Mr. Candidate is too out of energy these days.

452
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.280
Ok

453
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.880
Have some meat

454
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.560
and get some energy.

455
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:29.660
Energy!

456
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.020
Here!

457
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.440
Does it...

458
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.100
keep hurting your eyes?

459
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.160
Do you know?

460
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.820
That the food we're eating is...

461
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.440
ourselves.

462
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.700
I feel like I'm chewing my karma.

463
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.900
Ah, Mr. Candidate,

464
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.660
you're not drinking these days.

465
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.880
You're too boring.

466
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.200
Chook~

467
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.100
One shot!

468
00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.420
Yes.

469
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.280
Let's have a drink.

470
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.640
You've worked hard!

471
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:02.830
- You’ve arrived?
- Yes.

472
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.450
Oh Baek Seo Yeon.

473
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.000
You see your dad, and you don’t even greet me?

474
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280
Aigoo.

475
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.020
Oh, go on in.

476
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.020
Uh. Alcohol.

477
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.266
Yeobo. Put away the alcohol.

478
00:36:33.266 --> 00:36:36.800
Even if I just smell it, I feel nauseous and I can’t breathe.

479
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.780
- Get rid of all these. Get rid of all the alcohol.
- Yes.

480
00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.850
Seo Yeon!

481
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.170
Come help your mom!

482
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.170
Seo Yeon, come out!

483
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.850
Seo Yeon!

484
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.010
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

485
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.170
It’s alright now. Dad is changing, too.

486
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.680
Seo Yeon.

487
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.040
Who did you meet today?

488
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.550
- My friends.
-  Friends?

489
00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.740
- Lee Soo Gyum is your friend?
- He is a son of my friend.

490
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.490
- But why him?
- I saw.

491
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.530
- What?
- I saw you two were in the cafe.

492
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.430
Why do you meet your friend's son
separately in the cafe?

493
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.430
Why do you keep lying to me?

494
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.430
I'm not lying.

495
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.740
- My friends were there too.
- Do you know what my friends say about him?

496
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.800
It's rumored he is in Wonjo Gyoje
(paid relationship with minors).

497
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.380
Ah..

498
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.566
Soo Gyum is not that kind of kid.

499
00:37:52.566 --> 00:37:55.400
What does mom know about him that you’re taking his side?

500
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.740
Why do I have to hear him nagging me about treating mom well or not.

501
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.890
Ai.

502
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.360
- That is, Seo Yeon.
- The one changing is you, mom.

503
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:07.290
So strangely.

504
00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.530
Empathy. Ability to feel another’s emotions.

505
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.690
Empathy. Ability to feel another’s emotions.

506
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.970
Empathy. Ability to feel another’s emotions.

508
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.280
<i>Seo Yeon seems sensitive these days...</i>

509
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.240
<i>She is misunderstanding you and feeling uncomfortable about you.</i>

510
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.890
<i>How about keeping a distance for a while?</i>

511
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.720
She should have told me.

512
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.420
Mi Sook ajumma texted me that...

513
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.180
Have you come?

514
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.040
- Uh. Yes.
-  Mother, father.

515
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.440
Good night.

516
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.620
Hyung!

517
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.450
Hyung!

518
00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.800
Hyung! Hyung!

<i>The 270 bus is arriving imminently.</i>

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.100
Hey!

521
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.400
What's this?

522
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.390
Why are you avoiding me?

523
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.000
You said you're uncomfortable, didn't you?

524
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.500
If you don’t like me, you should just say that you don’t like me.

525
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.250
Did you hear that from my mom as well?

526
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.266
Yes. She worries a lot.

527
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.900
Who are you to be meeting my mom?

528
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:51.600
MFS. Don't you know MFS?
I am your Mother's Friend's Son.

529
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.140
Let’s say it’s not so with my mom.

530
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.680
But, is it true with the other ajummas?

531
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.570
What? What is?
What are you talking about?

532
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.600
Don’t you know what the kids
are saying about you?

533
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.120
- Um... Cool?
- Ah... what the hell.

534
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.300
There are rumors that you are having a wonjo gyoje with ajummas.

535
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.470
What?

536
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.200
Who? Me?

537
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.640
Wonjo Gyoje?

538
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.040
You’re not?

539
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.933
Can't you see by looking at me?

540
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.680
I can't.

541
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.100
Wah, I’ve come to Seoul, and have to hear all sorts of weird things!

542
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.250
Hey, my family is rich!

543
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.680
I don’t have any reason to do such a thing!

544
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.680
Ah, I see the way it is.

545
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:34.680
Hey.

546
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.140
By any chance, did you tell your mom that?

547
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.940
That your mom

548
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.900
and I have that kind of relation…

549
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.966
Wah, you’re really too much.

550
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.033
I can’t believe you. I can’t.

551
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.866
- You know what kind of person your mom is...
- Ha you're so talkative.

552
00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.466
If you’re not doing it, that’s fine!

553
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.900
Ah what else?

554
00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:10.066
You really hate your mom?

555
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:14.990
You don’t really.

556
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.240
You’re not the only one having a hard time.

557
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.130
My life is somewhat complicated, too.

558
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.066
You don’t know how lucky you are
to have such a mom, do you?

559
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.950
Don't pretend you know everything.
Because you're annoying.

560
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.090
If I'm annoying, you're rude.

561
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.166
I don’t know what’s happened between you,
but don’t make your mom’s heart hurt too much.

562
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.980
You don’t really feel that way in your heart.

563
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.800
Yah! If you think that just because you’re crying,

564
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.533
that I’ll hug you or something, that’s a big miscalculation.

565
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.630
What’s he talking about.

566
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.080
This will rip your eardrums out.

567
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:45.410
[Han Soo Ji]

568
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:46.770
Yah.

569
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.650
I told you to take my call.

570
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.840
What's this?

571
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.500
Aw.

572
00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.080
I really..

573
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.100
Ay!

574
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.520
What are you trying to do now?

575
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.380
Well. I am wondering to whom
I should give what I have now.

576
00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.360
- So I want some advice.
- Stop playing, meet me first.

577
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.880
Oh, it’s only now that you seem to be to my taste.

578
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.100
I prefer someone who chases after me.

579
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.630
Rather than someone that I have to contact first.

580
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.800
Hello, brother-in-law.

581
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.800
Hello, Soo Gyum's mother.

582
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.860
Brother-in-law?

583
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.000
Genetics is so amazing.

584
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.033
My Soo Gyum looked after you...

585
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.333
I think our Soo Gyum resembles you a little.

586
00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.360
Soo Gyum does not seem to resemble you at all.

587
00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.120
They say that the first child naturally resembles the father the most in order to be acknowledged.

588
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.640
You are so brave in many ways.

589
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.280
From giving a birth to a baby by yourself to this.

590
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.790
A parent is someone who can do anything for their child.

591
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.250
You also have raised kids so you know well, don't you?

592
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.650
Oh. You said that you only have three daughters, didn’t you?

593
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.410
Different than daughters,

594
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:49.820
more is expected from sons,
so I feel more responsibility as a mother.

595
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.110
<i>Please guide my Soo Gyum well.
Please treat him as your son.</i>

596
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.800
<i>I don't know.</i>

597
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.630
<i>What's your reason to see me?</i>

598
00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:02.700
Wouldn’t it be the same reason that you came out so willingly?

599
00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.950
Hello. Hey Hey!

600
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.490
Aish.

601
00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.630
What the hell are those two planning!

602
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:28.430
Wonjo Gyoje!

603
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.200
Yes, father-in-law.

604
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.920
With that child?

605
00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:02.760
Child,

606
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.433
how long has it been since you
became a member of my family?

607
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.466
It has been 10 years.

608
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.700
Our Hae Rang was releasing new technology...

609
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.333
and the company was growing a lot at the time.

610
00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:17.433
Chairman Kim (Jung Hye's father) needed Hae Rang, and I needed you.

611
00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.860
You are someone that I am always grateful for.

612
00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.000
I hope that it will continue that way in the future.

613
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.133
She must be more comfortable for you than your father.

614
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.466
- Yes?
- Since it looks as if you are closer to your stepmother.

615
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.630
Child.

616
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.466
- Yes.
- The role of the father also depends on you.

617
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:48.866
Usually in father-son relationship, when the son’s head grows, then it becomes awkward anyway.

618
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.333
However, meeting him when he’s all grown up, it probably isn’t easy for Byung Soo either.

619
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.300
You have to make an effort to even develop some affection.

620
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.300
Yes, grandfather. I will try to do well...

621
00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.200
And, help them both well from in between them.

622
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.200
Yes, I understand.

623
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.360
Also,

624
00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.310
the two of you getting along well,

625
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.770
of course, it is gratifying for me,

626
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.750
but the world isn’t like that.

627
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.166
If you two don’t get along,

628
00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.733
they’ll say it’s because you’re a stepmother.

629
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.450
And, even if your relationship is too good,

630
00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.833
then strange rumors will start as well.

631
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.366
Grandfather! What does that mean?

632
00:48:26.366 --> 00:48:28.360
Already,

633
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.020
there are rumors that I’ve heard.

634
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:34.670
- That’s why I’m saying that. Be careful.
- Yes.

635
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.070
I will be cautious.

636
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.650
Just because of me,
you even had to listen to that.

637
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:55.530
It’s not because of you,

638
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.500
but because of strange people.

639
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:00.000
Oh, those bastards!
Do they really have nothing else to do?

640
00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.770
You understand that we can’t become close,

641
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.060
don’t you?

642
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.350
As per our agreement,

643
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:11.770
let’s not become close.

644
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.500
I also don’t want to do campaign support activities anymore.

645
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.040
<i>President Kim Jung Yoon Reveals Building
a ‘Traditional Hanok Hotel’ in Seoul Center.</i>

646
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.950
The two of you,
how many years apart are you in age?

647
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.480
It must be embarrassing to be even called mom.

648
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.520
How do you live together in the same house
when it’s so uncomfortable?

649
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.100
Sister-in-law is so young,
and the child is all grown up…

650
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:57.000
If people who like to talk
put about baseless rumors anyway,

651
00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.533
then, that could be problematic for the company as well.

652
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.940
You’re coming in together again.

653
00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:15.600
I’ve returned.

654
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:19.500
Where are you coming back from?

655
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:20.600
I just asked you a question!

656
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.370
- Well, grandfather...
- Now, did I,

657
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.910
ask you?

658
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.050
Yah!

659
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.140
Just now,

660
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.340
what's that attitude?

661
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:34.060
Why are you being like this?

662
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:34.770
Are you drunk?

663
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.430
You kept ignoring my words, but,

664
00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.630
you’re willing to speak up for this bastard?

665
00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:42.450
What?

666
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.520
Whatever.

667
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.233
Just tell me what you were doing
before you came home.

668
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.600
Father-in-law called us.

669
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.900
The two of you together?

670
00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.633
Yes.

671
00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:53.966
Why?

672
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.900
He warned us

673
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.133
to be careful.

674
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.833
What are you saying?

675
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.800
If a stepmother and a child are too close,

676
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.333
then, strange rumors will start.

677
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.400
You even made father say those kinds of things.

678
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.000
You’re behaving so well.

679
00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:15.730
So well.

680
00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:18.720
Anyway, you...

681
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.670
You have no middle ground.

682
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.610
Even playing a mother role should be done moderately.

683
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.470
Your sister,

684
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.390
and that bastard Byung Hun,

685
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.440
all those assholes who just want to cut me down!

686
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.460
There’s a legion of them!

687
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.300
Don't you know that?!

688
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.680
Do you know what those assholes are saying right now?

689
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.280
Huh?

690
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.066
The stepmother and illegitimate child
who aren’t even that far apart in age are...

691
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:38.430
Aigoo...

692
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:44.490
Why the hell do I have to listen to such bullshit?

693
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.240
Huh?

694
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.480
Why did you two have to go around outside together?

695
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.910
You shouldn’t say those things.

696
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.480
The rumors are not from me!

697
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.600
Father, I think you’ve had too much to drink.

698
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.133
Go to your room.

699
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.580
Ah, really, you two...

700
00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.200
put me in such a foul mood.

701
00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.100
Since I walked around just smiling and laughing all the time,

702
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:11.270
did you two

703
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:14.150
decide to gang up

704
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.880
to cause me grief?

705
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.580
Father!

706
00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.370
Please go inside your room.

707
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:24.870
Where are you going?!

708
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:28.700
Please stop now.

709
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.000
What?

710
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:31.350
I asked you to stop.

711
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:33.990
You.

712
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:36.100
What makes you believe,

713
00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.040
that you can be so disrespectful?

714
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:38.966
Because, Father...

715
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.640
You need me.

716
00:52:44.133 --> 00:52:56.266
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"

717
00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.380
Ah, I’m sorry, honey.

718
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:03.360
My work ran late.

719
00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:05.600
Are you sure I have to go to there?

720
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.533
Is there a reason why I should buy from that store?

721
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.133
Okay, yes, yes, I understand.

722
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.400
Okay, if the quality is so good,
I guess I should go there.

723
00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:14.800
Ah, but that store,

724
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.466
where is it exactly?

725
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:18.760
Fourteen…

726
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.200
Thirteen…

727
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.530
Ah!

728
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.930
Ah, Fifteen.

729
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.030
Fish...

730
00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.800
- Ah!
- Ah, you startled me!

731
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:29.690
You’re the principal.

732
00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.380
Oh, you must be one of the school parents?

733
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.790
- That’s right, that’s right.
- Ah...

734
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:35.710
I can’t believe the principal is here.

735
00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.750
Instead of your wife you’re doing the shopping.

736
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:39.630
How nice that you’re helping her.

737
00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:42.080
I heard that the quality is good here…

738
00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:43.970
This is such an honor.

739
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:45.950
What does your wife like?

740
00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:47.920
I’ll select some very fresh ones for you.

741
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.440
- Sure, yes, whatever you choose.
- Ah, wait here.

742
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.580
Follow me.

743
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.420
Only the best for you.

744
00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.040
Too bad my two kids aren’t here to say hello.

745
00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.040
This is my care (devotion) for you.

746
00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.100
Aigoo, aigoo. You didn’t have to do all this.

747
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:05.660
Thank you so much.

748
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:06.790
Then...

749
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:08.750
It’s $25.

750
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.540
Huh? But I thought,

751
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.560
you said it was your care.

752
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.410
I meant, it was my care to select
the best quality seafood for you.

753
00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.080
Oh, sure...

754
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.080
Surely…

755
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.520
Surely you weren’t thinking…?

756
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.990
What kind of era is it now?

757
00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.850
Kim Young Ran is watching.
<i>(Kim Young Ran's law: Public officer should not receive any gift)</i>

758
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.120
We seem to be in on the same joke.

759
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.540
Here you go.

760
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:34.960
It’s $25.

761
00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:35.580
Huh?

762
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:36.360
$25.

763
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:38.720
Ah, yes, of course.

764
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:39.990
Okay, then.

765
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.090
How did I get stuck with such a jerk? Aish.

766
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.210
Come out, come out.

767
00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.040
Come out, come out.

768
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:52.550
Come out, come out.

769
00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.920
Oh, aigoo, it’s cold.

770
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:02.510
Is he gone?

771
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:03.700
Yeah, he’s gone.

772
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.670
He didn’t recognize you, unnie, did he?

773
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:06.340
No.

774
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.090
Not at all.

775
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.150
This… doesn’t seem very good either.

776
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.180
You should still be careful.

777
00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:12.850
That bug-like jerk.

778
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:14.430
Still, I was very nervous.

779
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.220
It’s just that…

780
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.833
when I saw his sleezy self, my feelings of dislike came rushing up.

781
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:22.220
Principal Hong…

782
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.380
Hee Soo’s mother...

783
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.650
How could you ask such an
inappropriate question of the principal?

784
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.360
It’s because I had heard some stories, that’s why!

785
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:34.580
By any chance...

786
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.920
You don't think the person who took the photo,

787
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.600
was Hong Sang Man, don’t you?

788
00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:39.670
Omo.

789
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.400
It could be him.

790
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:42.166
Then...

791
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:43.140
Then, so what?

792
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.506
What? Even if he took the photo,

793
00:55:45.666 --> 00:55:47.366
what’s he going to do about it?

794
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.800
It’s not as if we’ve committed some big sin.
Isn’t that so?

795
00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.930
Avengers Social Club! Fighting!
That’s what I mean.

796
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:55.280
Shhh…

797
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.510
Unnie…

798
00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.480
Oh, I... I feel off.

799
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.120
Unnie, can you watch my store for me?

800
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:02.140
Where are you going now?

801
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.410
Just watch the store for a bit.

802
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.130
I’ll be right back.

803
00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.360
Avengers Social Club?

804
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.020
Avengers?

805
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:16.633
B.J.?

806
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.080
Just know that this isn't the end,

807
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.920
you bug-like son of a bitch.

808
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.280
BJ?

809
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.210
What is it?

810
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.270
Can’t we go to our usual place?

811
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:33.200
Well, we could.

812
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.560
Ah, this place is okay.

813
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:34.920
Huh?

814
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:36.820
We can have some beer,

815
00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:37.800
and make a plan.

816
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:38.680
Mi Sook, what do you think?

817
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:39.830
Yes, that sounds good.

818
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.100
Ah, wait.

819
00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.720
So, should we call Soo Gyu-

820
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.530
What are we going to do?

821
00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:50.010
Do what?

822
00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.760
Let’s call Soo Gyum and have him come here.

823
00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.750
No, that’s not what I meant.

824
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:54.800
What’s wrong?

825
00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:58.100
H-he’s watching us.

826
00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.160
Watching what?

827
00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:00.350
No, he already saw us!

828
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.670
Who are you saying saw what?

829
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.410
Hong Sang Man!

830
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:10.830
Ah, don’t turn around and look.

831
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:14.460
He followed us.

832
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:17.750
What to do? What to do?
What are we going to do?

833
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.500
 L-let’s go. Go. Go.

834
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:22.290
- Go?
- Go!

835
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.130
Go. Go. Go.

836
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.210
Ah, Jung Hye.

837
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.350
Over here. It’s over here.

838
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.470
It's over here, Mi Sook, Jung Hye. Over here.

839
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:31.790
Ah, over here.

840
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:01.600
Is he still following?

841
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:03.666
I-I don’t know.

842
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.700
Don’t turn around. Don't.

843
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.266
How long are we going to walk?

844
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.766
On the count of three...

845
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.366
Run.

846
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:17.220
- One.
- One

847
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:18.370
- Two.
- Two.

848
00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:19.240
Three.

849
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.280
Wait!

850
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.900
Why do we have to be the ones to run away?

851
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.240
Huh?

852
00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:30.970
1, 2, 3.

853
00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.320
Hello, Principal Hong.

854
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:36.640
Hello as well.

855
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:38.560
So, we meet here.

856
00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.400
Now, where is the house I’m looking for?

857
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:43.570
Aren't the autumn leaves nice?

858
00:58:44.333 --> 00:58:46.160
Well then, see you again.
You can go back to whatever you were doing.

859
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:46.966
I’ll be…

860
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.600
Yes.

861
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.666
My apologies for being late.

862
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.060
- Oh...
- Oh...

863
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:09.450
- You’re here.
- You're here?

864
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.100
Did something happen?

865
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.370
That jerk...

866
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.790
He saw us.

867
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:16.560
Secretary Joo?

868
00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:17.840
What?

869
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.190
Who's that?

870
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:20.590
There’s someone else?

871
00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:23.480
My father had Secretary Joo follow us.

872
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:24.450
What?!

873
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.860
Then who were you being chased by?

874
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:32.790
- Hong Sang Man.
- Hong Sang Man.

875
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:33.880
What?!

876
00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.030
Then...

877
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.290
At least your husband’s project is going well?

878
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:46.570
To be honest, it’s…

879
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.470
<i>The next news.</i>

880
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.590
<i>It’s been revealed to be a shocking thing.</i>

881
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:53.900
<i>We have a report about a woman in her 40s</i>

882
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.180
<i>who attempted to harm her husband's health</i>

883
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:57.360
<i>by swapping the medicine</i>

884
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.080
<i>that he consumed every day.</i>

885
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.530
<i>The wife, Ms. Kim, gave her husband of 20 years </i>

886
01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:10.130
<i>such doctored medicine because he was abusing her.</i>

887
01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:10.870
Here's your medicine.

888
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:13.690
<i>And the reason she gave him doctored medicine</i>

889
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.480
<i>was because she couldn't bear</i>
- Is something wrong?

890
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.160
Why don’t you have it instead?

891
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.710
<i>the violence from her husband anymore</i>
- Huh?

892
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:23.100
Because it’s so good for the body,
you should have some as well.

893
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.130
Should I get you one, too?

894
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.666
No, that’s okay.

895
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.500
Since I started taking the pills,
my body hasn't been the same.

896
01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:44.233
I don’t think it’s for me.

897
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.090
I-is that so?

898
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:46.200
Just throw it out.
I-is that so?

899
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.100
Just throw it out.

900
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.966
Or you can have the rest.

901
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.233
So...

902
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.933
Hong Sang Man followed us.

903
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.100
Your husband is suspicious.

904
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.933
Unnie, that means your husband could be as well.

905
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.200
Perhaps, our Avengers Social Club

906
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:17.730
should suspend activities for a little while?

907
01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.233
What have we done wrong?

908
01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.510
Why should we be afraid?

909
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:23.100
It’s not as if we completely didn’t do anything.

910
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.433
That is true.

911
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.066
If we compare it to what those bastards did, it’s nothing at all.

912
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.266
For the time being, it would be better if we took it easy.

913
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.566
Nothing will come of it.

914
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:41.633
Avengers Social Club!

915
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.333
Fighting!

916
01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:34.766
Madam

917
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.700
The mail came.

918
01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.840
<i>Avengers Social Club, I know what you did!!!</i>

919
01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.950
Avengers Social Club, I know what you did.

920
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:31.000
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"

921
01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.140
<i>Who could it be? </i>

922
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.640
<i>He says that he knows what we’ve been doing.</i>

923
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.660
<i>However...</i>

924
01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:57.910
Why are we here like this?

925
01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.440
<i>The police came by today,</i>

926
01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.230
<i>and it caused such a ruckus!</i>

927
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.500
<i>Yes?</i>

928
01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.500
Our mother couldn’t restrain herself and got angry again?

929
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:04.350
Let’s get suspended.

930
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.760
<i>They want to catch just me?</i>

931
01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.150
<i>There is no evidence.</i>

932
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.920
<i>We have to find it. </i>

933
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:08.560
<i>Evidence.</i>

934
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.850
<i>You know that if we don’t have anything definite,
then it all comes to nothing, don’t you?</i>

935
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.550
<i>Is the whole family made up of gangsters?! </i>

936
01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.000
<i>How dare you kick another’s precious son!</i>

937
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.400
<i>Unnie seems to be very angry.</i>

938
01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:18.040
<i>You just want me to allow it to happen?! </i>

939
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.080
This person, I’ll just…!
