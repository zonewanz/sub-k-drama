EPISODE 8

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.880
Who could it be?

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.960
He says that he knows what we've done.

7
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.840
In that case...

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.320
Husband?

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.320
There has been something
that worried me a bit.

10
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700
Yeobo, what are you doing?

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.520
Oh.

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.360
I'll throw it away.

13
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.800
Oh, it's nothing.

14
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.080
You mean,
you just left that in the house?

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.820
Because it wasn't the day to
take the recycling out yet.

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.460
Ohhh

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.840
However,

18
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.540
would a gentleman who has been a professor
take the time to cut and glue this together?

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.800
I don't think that he would
do something like this...

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.640
If it was Lee Byung Soo, then you
would think it possible, wouldn't you?

21
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.240
Did your husband somehow
catch a hint as well?

22
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.360
Ah...

23
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.320
You know that meditation
teacher that time?

24
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.840
Couldn't we see her one more time?

25
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.500
No, we can't.

26
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.700
Her schedule is completely
filled until next year.

27
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.280
Oh. Really?

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.460
Then,
I guess there is nothing we can do.

29
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.680
However, that busy gentleman,

30
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.740
is he the kind of human
being who might do this...

31
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.860
Ah!

32
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.880
Hong Sang Man?!

33
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.620
That's right, there is that person.

34
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.300
Now that I think of it,
he did chase us as well.

35
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.840
However...

36
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.080
why are we being like this?

37
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.960
It's just that an open
space is dangerous.

38
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.580
This is my house.

39
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.020
Tell them to come.
Tell them all to come.

40
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.880
Oh.

41
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.520
Oh. However,
shouldn't we really be careful?

42
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.040
That is true.

43
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.500
That's why...

44
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.180
We shouldn't have gone
to Mi Sook's house.

45
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.160
And,
we even somehow met your husband there.

46
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.700
Let's suspend things then!

47
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.380
For the time being,
we just pretend to do things.

48
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.340
Oh.

49
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.680
So, then to Soo Gyum...

50
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.840
I'll let him know.

51
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.400
Then, our dinner meeting today?

52
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.140
Suspend.

53
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.800
Suspend.

54
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.120
Suspend.

55
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.960
They say that they don't
offer any such classes.

56
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.800
What about the instructor woman?

57
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.240
They say that there is
no such person either.

58
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.960
So, what is she up to?

59
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.400
I can't give you information
on another patient.

60
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.380
However,

61
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.580
you can tell me about the medicine
and the effects, can't you?

62
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.060
It's a special medicine for
people who have a lot of anger.

63
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.297
The medicine makes a person
not want alcohol or meat,

64
00:03:24.497 --> 00:03:26.100
and so it makes a person very relaxed.

65
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.520
and is a specialty of our practice.

66
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.480
Oh.

67
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.460
Oh. What is it? Why?

68
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.020
Why would I have come?

69
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.080
To a fish shop, I came to buy fish.

70
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.420
Oh. What would you like?

71
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.360
Anything. Just give me some.

72
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.960
What does your wife like?

73
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.960
Seeing you at the last parents meeting,
it seems

74
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.100
as if you know Jung Hye
and Candidate Baek's wife.

75
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.820
I don't just know them.

76
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.840
I'm very close to them.

77
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.260
Then, do you perhaps have meetings?

78
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.140
Of course we do.

79
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.180
Mutual aid meetings.
That thing that all the ajummas do.

80
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.020
Principal!

81
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.300
The expensive fish...
way over there on the street,

82
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.420
Soon Hee's Fish,
they have a lot of them.

83
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.080
Go there from now on.

84
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.700
I'll do that.

85
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.040
$10

86
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.560
I do think it's him after all.

87
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.380
<i>Hong Sang Man just came by.</i>

88
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.440
<i>If he deliberately went to find you and
ask such things, then that's daebak.</i>

89
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.580
<i>Shall we cancel the suspension?</i>

90
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.040
<i>If it's Pervert Hong, then we
have to get him back immediately.</i>

91
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.820
<i>Still,
since we're not completely sure yet.</i>

92
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.460
<i>For the time being, I think it would
be better for us to be careful.</i>

93
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.380
Your wives, hasn't there been
anything in particular these days?

94
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.780
Yes?

95
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.220
A person who only stays at home,
what particular thing could there be?

96
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.820
A person who doesn't even do any housework,
what particular thing could there be?

97
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.780
Aren't you being too
trusting of your wives?

98
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.480
It's not that I'm thinking strangely
about your wives that I'm saying this.

99
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.600
If you have something to say,
please say it comfortably.

100
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.800
That is,
have you felt a bit in danger or...

101
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.800
perhaps your stomachs
were suddenly hurting?

102
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.440
Yes?

103
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.880
What are you trying to say?

104
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.960
It's a special medicine for
people with a lot of anger.

105
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.940
Morning and night,
I will make sure to bring it to you.

106
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.052
The medicine makes one not
want alcohol or meat

107
00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:27.920
and so makes one very relaxed,
and is a speciality of ours.

108
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.480
Anyway, don't you think that
something is a bit different?

109
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.620
Well, these days,
she seems to be going out a lot.

110
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.660
So, I have given her some warning.

111
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.240
That's right!

112
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.840
Even as parents of students, she has to
be careful of who she associates with.

113
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.960
What about you?

114
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.800
That person?
Well, I don't know what she does anyway.

115
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.720
Does your wife do any
mutual aid meetings?

116
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.080
She's a bored person,
so she must do some things.

117
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.600
I mean the wives doing mutual aid meetings,
how would we keep track of that anyway?

118
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.600
When ajummas do something,
it can be scary. Hm?

119
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.580
Anyway, don't trust them too much,
even if they're family.

120
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.700
Be careful!

121
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.520
Don't worry. I have some ideas as well.

122
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.080
Sunbae should also be careful.

123
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.880
Yes.

124
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.900
Here.

125
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.240
Do you want a drink as well?

126
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.600
Don't you have any meat appetizers?

127
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.800
Since I haven't eaten meat in so long,
I keep wanting to eat meat.

128
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.000
Oh, should I at least defrost
something from the freezer?

129
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.940
What did you do with the health
tonic that Director Lee gave me?

130
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.080
Well, you said that you weren't
going to take them any more.

131
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.800
No.

132
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.860
Not that medicine.

133
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.220
Do I have anger disease?

134
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.320
Y-yes? Who did...?

135
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.680
Why didn't you talk to me?

136
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.380
I thought you were feeding
me some poison or something.

137
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.000
How could you think that?

138
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.660
If you were the old you, then I
wouldn't have thoughts like these.

139
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.020
You go out constantly.

140
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.000
You bring strange people home.

141
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.884
It's the wife of Director
Lee who is campaigning for you,

142
00:08:35.084 --> 00:08:36.700
so being close to her
is helpful to you...

143
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.200
You only do what I tell you to do.

144
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.860
Don't go doing your own thing!

145
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.020
Do you understand?!

146
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.140
Yes.

147
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.120
<i>That letter.
I don't think it's from my husband.</i>

148
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.560
That time

149
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.040
when we went to couples yoga,

150
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.340
they say that they don't have
any such meditation class.

151
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.100
Yoga?

152
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.020
When did you do that?

153
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.420
Of course.

154
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.440
Since I rented the place so that I could
have that instructor come teach us.

155
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.100
By the way,

156
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.580
I have something that
I wanted to show you.

157
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.420
It's something that was in
our mailbox this morning.

158
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.460
What is this?

159
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.580
What have you been doing that such
a thing was sent to the house?

160
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.860
Who would... such a thing...?

161
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.320
I don't know.

162
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.951
Maybe someone is playing a prank.

163
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:11.580
I was wondering if you had any clue
of what it could be.

164
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.600
Who around me would do
something like this?

165
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.640
Oh? I? What?

166
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.120
Letter?

167
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.200
Have you ever seen me
write something like that?

168
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.420
Wh-wh-wh-what...club?

169
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.120
Why would I...

170
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.500
Hello? Hello!

171
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.680
Yah! Lee Byung Soo!

172
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.480
Oh really. So unbelievable.

173
00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.920
Oh!

174
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.140
I have to have some money
in order to go to a club.

175
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:12.820
Ah.

176
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.780
Even though only half of their blood is
the same, they do resemble each other.

177
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.820
Ok.

178
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.800
Take action!

179
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.920
Take off your pants.

180
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.040
How can I take my pants off?
Call 119. 1-1-9.

181
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.140
Just know that this is not the end of it.
To be continued

Today, the fish is really good.

Omega-3. Natural Botox. Try eating some!

188
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.040
Excuse us!

189
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.360
Yes?

190
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.380
You're the owner here, aren't you?

191
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.580
Yes, I am.

192
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.020
At a fish store, if you make sushi,
don't you know that's illegal?

193
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.380
What are you...?
I've never done anything like that.

194
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.860
There is a person who said that they
ate this, and got food poisoning even.

195
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.800
What are you saying?
I said I've never done that.

196
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.200
Ah, that will be revealed
by the investigation.

197
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.860
And, at least, the investigation has been
started, so you have to cooperate with us.

198
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.860
Ay, who-who is it? Who said that?
Let me meet him!

199
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.860
We cannot reveal who reported it.

200
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.800
Please cooperate with the investigation.

201
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.500
Take samples.

202
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.480
What? Wait. Wait a moment.
What are you doing?

203
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.880
Ay. Ay. How is this happening?

204
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.420
If you take everything,
how do I run my business?

205
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.320
Until the investigation is complete,
you are not able to sell here.

206
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:01.980
What?

207
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.660
Oh my son!

208
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.440
You've been busy studying, haven't you?

209
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.320
Oh, your school is just too nice.

210
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.620
I had to come here and
meet your homeroom teach...

211
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.460
Didn't we agree to live
without seeing each other?

212
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.340
Ay, not...

213
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.500
Son!

214
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.900
See that. See that.
Another one came to meet him.

215
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.720
How many ajummas is he meeting anyway?

216
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.480
Oh, stop doing things like this!

217
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.840
What are you doing?

218
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.440
Stop being concerned with
other people's business.

219
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.720
Yah,

220
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.800
but that ajumma seems like the real one.

221
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.040
However, the other ajumma
seemed to have a lot more money.

222
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.580
It's probably his mom's friend.

223
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.900
What's this? Are you now just
totally taking that sunbae's side?

224
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.960
Aish. Yah!

225
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.880
I'm going to keep an eye on it.

226
00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.640
Yah, yah, where are you going?!

227
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.580
Ah,
go in already and stop being petulant.

228
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.180
Mom had to have a bigger picture.

229
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.580
Do you want to hear mom's plans?

230
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.900
Mom is going to meet... Yah, Yah!

231
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.760
How can he...? Son! Son! Where?!

232
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.360
Let's see each other again soon!

233
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.800
Who are you?

234
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.780
Stop!

235
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.240
Why?

236
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.340
Hand it over.

237
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.380
What?

238
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.780
You took a picture of me!

239
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.480
Omo.

240
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.700
Omo! Children are so scary.

241
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.220
I mean,
you just stare at me and you just...

242
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.760
I'm not that kind of person!

243
00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.778
What do you mean you're not?
Here.

244
00:14:59.978 --> 00:15:01.560
There is apicture of me!
What do you mean you're not?!

245
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.360
Oh, give that to me! Why are you
taking someone else's things?

246
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.900
You. You're taking secret photos of me,
and I'm going to report you to the police.

247
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.720
Stay right there! Don't move!

248
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.140
Ahhh

249
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.300
What are you doing?

250
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.860
I thought I was leaving with empty hands,
but you've done one big thing, cutie.

251
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.480
Yes?

252
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.740
She's a crazy ajumma.

253
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.680
Ahh, that country boy. What is he?

254
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.160
Suspension of business?

255
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.660
I've been running a fish business for
10 years and I've never made sushi.

256
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.120
Today was the first time I
even knew that was illegal.

257
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.800
It's kind of strange.

258
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.700
That as soon as we received the
threatening letter, that this happens.

259
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.560
Wait a second!

260
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.020
That as soon as we received the
threatening letter, that this happens.

261
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:15.860
Wait a second!

262
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.220
I think there was something to that.

263
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.800
You said that yesterday,
Hong Sang Man had come by.

264
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.720
Yes. Yesterday, he bought some fish...

265
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.080
That is...

266
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.820
That person!

267
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.300
Oh, Unnie.

268
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.280
You mean just sit back
and let it happen?

269
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.040
We don't have any proof.

270
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.940
We have to find it. The evidence.

271
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.240
I'm sure it's Hong Sang Man.
That's why with the police even.

272
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:43.800
Bribery?

273
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.660
That's right.

274
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:46.580
But,

275
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.140
just to catch me?

276
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.780
Would he have involved public officers?

277
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:53.720
Yes.

278
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.260
Let her go after 2 or 3 days.

279
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.880
That woman has to get a scare.

280
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.200
When I think of what I had to suffer...
ehy.

281
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.180
This is what's so good about
a person from one's hometown.

282
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.960
I will host you lavishly sometime,
Captain Kim.

283
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:13.800
Yes.

284
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.120
Oh, Hee Soo.
And, Hee Kyung has come as well.

285
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:24.920
Hello

286
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.940
We came so that we could
go home together with mom.

287
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.700
Did mom go home already?

288
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.480
Don't even talk about it!

289
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.140
Today, the police came and
there was such a ruckus raised.

290
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.740
Yes?

291
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.940
Because our mother was not able to be
patient and just let her temper fly?

292
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.780
Aigoo. It's nothing like that. Aigoo.

293
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.520
Wow!

294
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.540
Hong Do Fish Store's best
fish have all gathered here.

295
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.000
Today, mom had a great day,
so I was in such a good mood

296
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.900
that I decided
to make a feast for once.

297
00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:55.800
Mom!

298
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.900
Eat. It's delicious.

299
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.900
Wow. I'm the daughter of a fish store,
but...

300
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.740
today is the first time that
I've eaten enough fish properly.

301
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.520
Was mom that stingy?

302
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.860
You mean you didn't know that?

303
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.920
To be honest, until today, I didn't know
that there was so much body on a hairtail.

304
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.340
I thought that it only
had a head and a tail.

305
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.320
That's right!

306
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.397
I told you that
there was that time

307
00:18:16.597 --> 00:18:17.860
that I opened a steamed pollack dish
and was totally amazed.

308
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.960
Underneath the soybean sprouts, there
were just severals heads of the pollack.

309
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.000
You were too much, mom!

310
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.020
Aigoo.

311
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.476
It's because we lived
so cheaply that

312
00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:28.920
we were able to do well and
live with full stomachs.

313
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.960
You can live somewhat blandly* now.
<i(metaphor for "thrifty")</i>

314
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:34.900
Here.

315
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.100
Mom eat some, too.

316
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.080
Okay. Okay.

317
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.740
Now, we also should eat
the whole fish from now on.

318
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.060
I have to go to the restroom.

319
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.060
Noona

320
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.880
Mom's trouble...

321
00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.360
Pretend you don't know!

322
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.080
It seems as if mom doesn't
want to talk about it.

323
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.240
Still, if it's suspension of business.

324
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.420
Until the results come out,
let's just wait and see.

325
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.920
There is going to be a family interview.
Get ready for it.

326
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.720
If it's family...

327
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.960
Seo Yeon will have to do it, too.

328
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.800
Go buy her some clothes. Something
that will make her look like a girl.

329
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.920
Wouldn't it be okay if
you did it by yourself?

330
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.800
Do I not have a wife or a child?

331
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.600
It's a family interview.

332
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.800
Still, including Seo Yeon...

333
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.940
It's just once.
She can't cooperate even that much?

334
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.180
I understand.
I'll try to speak with her.

335
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.260
I won't do it.

336
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.160
Dad said it would be good
if we all did it together.

337
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.360
Mom doesn't like it either.

338
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.100
If you don't like something, why
can't you say that you don't like it?

339
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.860
Following dad, you lie and
force yourself to smile,

340
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.820
do you really want to
do things like that?

341
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.780
No.

342
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.460
Mom dislikes it, too.

343
00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.520
Then, don't do it!

344
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.140
I understand.
I'll try talking to your dad.

345
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.100
Just because mom alone is trying
so hard, is anything changing?

346
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.660
Even back then,
you weren't able to stop dad.

347
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.420
Even though Oppa said so much
that he didn't want to go.

348
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.280
What happened? Did it turn out okay?

349
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.180
Of course.

350
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.800
I'm Hong Do Fish's Hong Do Hee.

351
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.540
It wasn't unnie's fault, was it?

352
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.540
Of course not.
Since, I've never done such a thing.

353
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.140
They said that there isn't
anything wrong with my fish.

354
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.380
Okay! Okay, okay!

355
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.300
I'm selling at even
cheaper than half price.

356
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.560
$7 mackerel, I'll sell it to you for $3.

357
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.140
Welcome. Yes, yes, that fish is really
good. I'll give you 30 minutes. 30 minutes.

358
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.200
Hey, they say that someone ate this
store's fish and got food poisoning.

359
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.860
Let's go! Let's go!

360
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.740
Omo. Omo. I almost made a big mistake.

361
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.760
Yes. For 30 minutes only,
I'm having a big sale. $7 fish for $3...

362
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.400
The police even came and
suspended her business.

363
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.040
It's so scary, could anyone
eat that store's fish again?

364
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.500
Yes. Yes, I just came from the police
station after being investigated.

365
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.360
They say that our store's
fish have no problems at all!

366
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.800
It's fish that can be
eaten without fear!

367
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.980
Come and see!
I'll give it to you for $3. $3. Yes?

368
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.500
Sale! Sale! $3.
$7 fish, I'll give it to you for $3.

369
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.780
Mother, come and look!

370
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.420
How much is everything here?

371
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.580
Ah, Jung Hye.

372
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.340
The fish today is really good.

373
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.220
Do you want to buy some?

374
00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.260
Yes.
Give me all of it!

375
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.780
You can't have all of it,

376
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.220
but enough for your respective families.

377
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.660
Unnie is treating.

378
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.400
I've thought of a good method.

379
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.840
Ehy...

380
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.140
What kind of fish is without
fishiness and so fresh?!

381
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.960
I heard that the fish
here is so delicious!

382
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.440
Because we're long time regular
customers, we know it well!

383
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.008
Because more than anyone else,

384
00:22:19.208 --> 00:22:21.540
this store has a conscience,
so we trust her and eat them!

385
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.740
Do you think that will do?

386
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.460
<i>Plan B is necessary.</i>

387
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.440
Do you have any mackerel?

388
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.280
Yes, I have mackerel. There. There.
Give me just two beltfish, please!

389
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.280
Two beltfish!

390
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.760
I would like some Korean anchovy.

391
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.060
Wait just a moment, please!
Do you not have any anchovies?

392
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.840
Of course, I have anchovies. Why
wouldn't I? Just wait a little, please.

393
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.720
Yes, Hong Do Hee.

394
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.980
You didn't live a bad life.

395
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.550
The money for promoting that this
shop's fish is good is included.

396
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.950
If Hong Do unnie knew what we're doing...
We will be scolded.

397
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.730
So..
We should not get caught.

398
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:11.580
Next person.

399
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.490
Here it is.

400
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.980
Cheers!

401
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.080
Aigoo.

402
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.020
Eat as much as you want.

403
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.600
I've sold out all today,
so this unnie will treat.

404
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.080
Yes. You treat because you can
just sell out tomorrow, too.

405
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:38.320
Yes yes.
Sold out today and sell out tomorrow.

406
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.580
Aigoo there's no rule that I should die.
(feel relieved to find a way to survive)

407
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.380
Here are the chicken feet you ordered.
Yes.

408
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.840
Please enjoy your food.
Yes.

409
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.720
Ah..

410
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.010
Ah!

411
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.010
It seems like magic. Woa.

412
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.660
We need an emergency measure.
Ah, yes,

413
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.660
Jung Hye, this.

414
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.540
Are you alright?

415
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.110
Don't do too much.

416
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.340
It seems our madam likes
to eat fish these days.

417
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.220
One is for you, Ajumma.
Ah..

418
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.250
Oh, this expensive thing... Thank you.

419
00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.200
Is it going well?
Yes.

420
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.260
Hong Do unnie doesn't know at all.

421
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.440
But don't do too much. If business
is much better than before...

422
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.320
Don't worry. How about you?

423
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.320
Please wait a while.
I'm watching closely.

424
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.910
You know if there's no evidence,
it's all a waste?

425
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.910
If only it were that easy of a job!

426
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.680
Still, I should do it.

427
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.060
Honey.

428
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:27.820
Honey..

429
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.580
If I'm in this state,

430
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.090
I've lived quite well, haven't I?

431
00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:46.080
Uhm.

432
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.500
Hong Do-ya, don't cry.

433
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:10.620
Oppa is here.

434
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.560
Follow...

435
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.070
your.

436
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.120
Hong Do-ya,

437
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.390
don't cry.

438
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.760
This is good too.
Give me 1 kilo of short arm octopus.

439
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.430
Ah yes. One kilo of short arm octopus.
Come on, autumn short arm octopus.

440
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.290
This is great. If you eat this, you don't
need to take a separate vitamin pill.

441
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:44.750
One kilogram?

442
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.250
But you came a while ago too?

443
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.810
No, I didn't. This is my first time.

444
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.325
A salesperson has quick eyes.

445
00:28:57.525 --> 00:28:59.850
My eyes are so accurate...

446
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.960
You came yesterday, too.
You bought one kilo of ark shell.

447
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.440
I said I didn't.
$9

448
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.860
The ch-change!

449
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.050
Here it is.

450
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.360
What are you doing here?

451
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.900
Uh unnie...

452
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.620
Ah, get ready.

453
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.440
You did well.

454
00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.510
Come on,
straighten your arms and hit it upward.

455
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.160
Straighten your arms.

456
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.320
This way, like this.

457
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.950
You hit it like this.

458
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.080
Teach, I'm sorry.

459
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.560
Don't play around.
Yes.

460
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.130
Aish.

461
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.480
Attention! Attention!

462
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.560
Double fishy!

463
00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.240
Your brother-sister
affection is so tear jerking.

464
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.810
Hey Hwang Jung Wook!

465
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.280
I bet you won't hit me. Why?

466
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.280
You can't cause trouble carelessly.

467
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.410
And you don't have money to
pay settlement money again.

468
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.220
I have nothing to be afraid of.
You have many things to beware of.

469
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.420
So different, right?
Right.

470
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.420
I restrain myself
because we're different.

471
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.010
Anyway after graduation, you and I have
no business to see each other again.

472
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.600
Ah, that's right. It will be different.

473
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:21.530
You and I will be swimming
in different waters.

474
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.410
Aww, fishy smelling family.
The original fishy smelling mother...

475
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:30.490
I said to never touch my family, didn't I?
Aigoo this tear jerking family affection.

476
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.910
Until when will you stop
these childish acts?

477
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.690
Until you kneel and beg?

478
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.160
Thinking about it,

479
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:43.020
I realized I didn't get
any apology from you.

480
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.730
You had your mom kneel down instead,
you cowardly bastard.

481
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.760
Hey what did I say? This is why
family instruction is important.

482
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.250
When the child did wrong,
why would the parent beg instead?

483
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.740
If the child did wrong,
the child should kneel and beg.

484
00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.880
Who are you saying knelt?

485
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.120
Hey.

486
00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.450
I have a very precious lecture video.

487
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.620
Watch and study, okay?

488
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.600
This is quite good for a life lecture.
<i>Please forgive once.</i>

489
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.480
<i>Let me go. What the hell are you doing.</i>

490
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.560
Her knees just
automatically kneeled down.

491
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.110
You bastard!
Stop it!

492
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.033
Gee how can I live without a sister.

493
00:32:32.233 --> 00:32:35.350
Where is the sister right now?

494
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.610
Teacher, do you want to watch it too?

495
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.980
Hey!

496
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.980
Aww.

497
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.980
Aww.

498
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.980
Aww.

499
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.980
Aww.

500
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.080
Mi Sook, even you too!

501
00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.430
Unnie..

502
00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.430
It's because I insisted we do it.

503
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.130
What were you guys making me?
But I didn't spend that much...

504
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.190
Jung Hye,

505
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.410
it's not a matter of money. You...

506
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.450
<i>Hong Do-ya, don't cry</i>

507
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.340
Hello?

508
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.280
Thank you, it's enough for today.
I'll call you.

509
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.490
Unnie. Unnie.

510
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.850
Shall we wait for her till she came out?
She said it's enough.

511
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.850
Let's do what she said.

512
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.420
Unnie seems to be very angry,
doesn't she?

513
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.080
See what happened.
I said we should not do it.

514
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.840
We did it together. That's...

515
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.430
Yes, that's right.

516
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.130
It's not the first time,

517
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.690
the victim's parent
will respond strongly.

518
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.180
As you know,
she is not an ordinary person.

519
00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:39.180
I do know.

520
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.180
Mom, sister didn't do that.

521
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.900
He put on a show by himself.
Stay quiet.

522
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.370
It's my fault to cause
this trouble with students.

523
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.310
We trust you, Teacher Kim, but...

524
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.010
seeing the CCTV, it seems there
is cause for misunderstanding.

525
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.360
If that person wants you to be
punished as a violent teacher,

526
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.360
we don't have any way to stop...

527
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.090
Yes, Mr. Principal.

528
00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.540
Yes yes, I see.

529
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.170
The victim's mother is in
the principal's office now.

530
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.100
This isn't the first time.

531
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.290
Last time, her situation was so
miserable, I agreed on a settlement.

532
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.970
This time, the boy alone wasn't enough,
his sister joined in.

533
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.040
How can a teacher act like this?

534
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:41.130
Calm down please.
Teacher Kim's mother is coming here.

535
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.980
Ah, she must have come. Yes, come in.

536
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.970
Uh, why are you here?

537
00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.970
I am Teacher Kim Hee Kyung's mother.

538
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.180
Ah! really...

539
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.840
Look at this.

540
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.900
Casting down your eyes and lying down
on your face would not be enough,

541
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.510
but how dare you look at me so directly?

542
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.750
Your face is so thick.

543
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.960
Are you a gangster family?
I've watched the CCTV.

544
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.490
Since you've watched, now you know.

545
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.410
Our son is in the hospital.
His trauma is so, so great!

546
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.750
This time there will be no settlement. So
if you say anything like asking for a favor,

547
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.340
I will sue...
I don't intend to.

548
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.500
I..

549
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.420
Whatever anyone says,
I trust my children.

550
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.160
If you want to follow the
legal procedure, please do so.

551
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.350
I'll prepare a countersuit as well.

552
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.350
This time,

553
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.880
please provide the diagnosis beforehand.

554
00:36:56.270 --> 00:37:00.800
You do know how scary a false
accusation is, don't you?

555
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:10.410
But isn't it true that the sister and
brother as a team harassed a single student?

556
00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.800
That's what I'm saying, Mr. Principal.

557
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.497
A teacher who is supposed
to guide students properly,

558
00:37:15.697 --> 00:37:17.870
how can that teacher
kick a precious student?

559
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.133
I will want compensation for my
son's mental health damage as well.

560
00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:26.190
So, be prepared.

561
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.290
It seems you don't have anything
more to say, I'll see you at court.

562
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.130
Oh.

563
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.080
What is it? This attitude?

564
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:40.970
Oh.

565
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.060
I will..
Ah ah..

566
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.260
Today, you don't do it, mom.
Come on, come on.

567
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.250
Today, you just eat, mom.

568
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.710
Anyway, it seems I raised
my children really well.

569
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.480
Ha! I feel mortified.
I should have punished him properly.

570
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.120
Still...

571
00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.420
even if I were in the same situation
again, I would still stop Hee Soo again.

572
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.560
You restrained yourself well.
You did well, you did well.

573
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:18.730
Don't worry. I will give him a punch.

574
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.130
I will give him the real punch.

575
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.670
You will?
Success is the best revenge.

576
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.050
I will become much more
successful than him...

577
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.690
Whose brother are you? You're great.

578
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.360
Of course. Look who gave birth to him.

579
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.360
Here, here, here.
It's hot.

580
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.706
<i>[Shall we cancel the suspension?</i>

581
00:38:49.906 --> 00:38:52.060
<i>If it's Pervert Hong,
we should repay him right away. ]</i>

582
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.430
<i>[Unnie, are you alright?]</i>

583
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.680
She said she would call, so...

584
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.980
Aigoo, everyone must be sleeping.

585
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.680
The liquor tastes bitter, too.

586
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.470
Here I see you again.

587
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.740
Oh.

588
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.740
Ah.

589
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.790
Ah, it's good.

590
00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.200
How come you are outside
at this time of night?

591
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:18.922
Because I can't sleep.

592
00:40:19.122 --> 00:40:21.560
It's dangerous, so why
are you out by yourself?

593
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.340
If it's dangerous,
then why is a man out by himself?

594
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.310
Do you know this?
An octopus has three hearts.

595
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.680
Does it?

596
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.890
I've lived thinking I
have three hearts too.

597
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.740
One turned off when my husband died.

598
00:40:55.050 --> 00:41:00.000
Another one turned off when the money
lenders wanted their debt repaid.

599
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.720
The last one,

600
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.010
I'm keeping it well
because of my children.

601
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:16.940
Why am I saying these things?
I must be drunk after just one drink.

602
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.320
It's okay if you become more drunk.

603
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.190
I'm sorry for leaving a man
alone when it's dangerous.

604
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.630
Hmm.

605
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.560
Hello.

606
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.370
Ah, did I put too much stress on that?

607
00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.240
Then..

608
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.220
This. Uh?

609
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.490
Aish.

610
00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:08.780
Really.. it's too weak.

611
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.510
Oh, I have no clothes.

612
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.040
This one? Like this?

613
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:18.810
Ah really...

614
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.144
Finally, I've met someone
I can communicate well with.

615
00:42:30.344 --> 00:42:31.520
Get to the point.

616
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.160
Your impatient personality
is similar to hers.

617
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.000
Here it is.

618
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.940
Won't it generate rumors?

619
00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.010
Geon Ah Group's youngest daughter
and an illegitimate child.

620
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:56.810
So, I already wrote something up.

621
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.230
I may not look it,
but I have some talent with writing.

622
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.950
Do you think it isn't being
reported because they don't know?

623
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.280
Oh, that's not working here either.

624
00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.280
Then how about this?

625
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.180
Geon Ah Group's youngest
daughter's rival.

626
00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:26.620
A sudden interview with a
mistress hidden for 20 years.

627
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.360
How much is it?

628
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.370
Definitely! I knew we could communicate.

629
00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.390
Aigoo... Sister-in-law.

630
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.460
Since you came over here,
why didn't you see me before you go?

631
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.890
Thanks to you,
I've already wasted my time.

632
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:56.450
That's why I've come personally

633
00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.150
to apologize to you.

634
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.290
From now on,

635
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.050
forget the past unpleasantness

636
00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.060
Sister-in-law and I

637
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.200
can grow a prosperous relationship...

638
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.360
So, are you happy talking to Byung Hoo?

639
00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.990
Is there a business that
doesn't need more funds?

640
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.740
Exactly, exactly.

641
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.330
Didn't you say you only need 10 minutes?

642
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.370
Ah, yes.

643
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.250
Actually, it's like this.

644
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.030
As sister-in-law knows,
the situation on my side has changed.

645
00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.030
So?

646
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.700
Just because one 19-year-old
child has come to you

647
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:41.680
doesn't mean that the Chairman
has decided on you after all.

648
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.910
Yes, that's right.

649
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.040
Nothing has been decided yet.

650
00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.990
There isn't any reason for sister-in-law
to be treating me like this.

651
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.520
If we happen to get along well,
it shouldn't lead to a loss for you.

652
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:02.210
I'll think about it.

653
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.240
We should see each other often,
sis-in-law.

654
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.360
However

655
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.440
Inheritance, Love. You all are
talking about either the father

656
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.510
or the son.

657
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.930
Isn't this somewhat old-fashioned?

658
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.510
Can't you make it on your own?

659
00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.250
I prefer independent people.

660
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.900
I don't know if I can go forward
trusting in Hae Rang Construction or not.

661
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.840
It's so scary,
how can I even come to school anymore?

662
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.410
Yah, don't look. Do you want to get hit?

663
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.720
<i>Violent Teacher, go away</i>

664
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.640
Hee Soo, you seen this?

665
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:34.400
What?

666
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.280
This has been spread around a lot.

667
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.520
Hwang Jung Wook uploaded
this everywhere.

668
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:44.830
Yah, Hee Soo!

669
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:45.730
Kim Hee Soo!

670
00:46:57.490 --> 00:46:57.840
She's coming out.

671
00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.400
Quickly!
She's coming out, she's coming out.

672
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:01.430
Teacher Kim Hee Kyung!

673
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.960
You've heard the news of the complaint
by the victim's parents, haven't you?

674
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.475
Is it true that you have
a black belt in Taekwondo?

675
00:47:06.675 --> 00:47:08.850
Did you know the video of
the incident is going viral?

676
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.840
Do you plan to countersue?

677
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:10.966
Teach!

678
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.690
Please make sure of the actual facts
before you write your articles.

679
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:23.970
That student has lied before.

680
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:27.500
About having a broken arm.
He even wore a cast to fool everyone.

681
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:28.720
Let's go.

682
00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:30.320
Teacher, please say something.

683
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.430
How can you just leave?

684
00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:33.270
Teacher!

685
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.680
Wait.

686
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:35.530
What?

687
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.740
Noona!

688
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:42.730
Are you okay?

689
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.400
Hee Soo...

690
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:47.810
Let's go.

691
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.120
Madam is really a beautiful woman.

692
00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.520
I'm very lucky.

693
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.850
Where will the interview be held?

694
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:34.660
Aigoo... Really...

695
00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.760
You should have told me ahead of time.

696
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.550
If I did, would you have come?

697
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:41.530
Cancel it.

698
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.890
How long are you just going to avoid it?

699
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.280
You do it by yourself, then.

700
00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.060
You go first.

701
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.660
My wife is a little bit nervous.

702
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:57.080
If I didn't bring Seo Yeon,
you said you'd cooperate with me.

703
00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.970
Don't you know what
this place meant to me?

704
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.400
I know.

705
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.240
That's why I brought you here.

706
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:04.830
You should try to overcome it.

707
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:08.480
Aigoo, Director!

708
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.120
Aigoo
Aigoo, hello.

709
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.250
It's been a long time since
we've seen each other.

710
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.160
Aigoo, hello, hello.
You're in good health?

711
00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.640
Aigoo, thank you. Thank you.

712
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.350
Aigoo. Kids, say your greetings.

713
00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.290
Hello!
Hi! Hi!

714
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:20.200
Thank you.

715
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.720
I should have come
more often before this.

716
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.500
No, that's okay. That's okay.

717
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.100
Aigoo, you have come here personally.
Aigoo...

718
00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.140
They say that you've been supporting
this orphanage for many years.

719
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.690
Is there any particular reason why?

720
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.690
Actually

721
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.230
my wife spent her childhood years here.

722
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.710
Ah, I see.

723
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.640
Besides, today

724
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.510
isn't about me going public
about funding this place.

725
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.250
Rather, I want to take this interview

726
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.170
as an opportunity

727
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.290
to say thank you to my wife.

728
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.810
You've always said that
your wife is your role model in life.

729
00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.590
Yes, that's right.

730
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.040
My wife spent her childhood in this
orphanage, and left at 19 years old

731
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.360
to enter society.

732
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.850
Afterwards,

733
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.840
she educated herself and she worked.
She lived a very difficult life.

734
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:11.610
Seeing how strong of a person she is

735
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:12.330
has always

736
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.320
amazed me.

737
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:18.570
It seems that your education philosophy
is also influenced by your wife.

738
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.420
Ah, yes, of course.

739
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:20.430
Especially

740
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.060
when I see students who study
hard in difficult circumstances.

741
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.410
It reminds me of the struggles
my wife went through.

742
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:26.900
That's why...

743
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.300
So that any child won't be lacking,

744
00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.790
at least in education,

745
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.560
that's the society that I want to build.

746
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.080
Because of her.

747
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.030
Are you alright?
Yes.

748
00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:06.560
I heard your son is studying abroad?

749
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.920
Yes.

750
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:08.340
Is he a high school student?

751
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.720
Yes, according to our country's system,
he's in his senior year of high school.

752
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:16.010
Many might ask if the person who sent
his son to study abroad is qualified

753
00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.660
to become our
Superintendent of Education.

754
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.680
Yes,
of course they could think like that.

755
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:21.180
However

756
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.900
I don't think that my position

757
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:27.600
should stop my son from being
able to fulfill his dreams.

758
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:29.160
Ah, yes.

759
00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:45.400
You.

760
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.880
You're a bad and stupid kid.

761
00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.270
Repeat after me.

762
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:52.690
You.

763
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.070
You're a bad and stupid kid.

764
00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:55.920
That's why

765
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.080
you were thrown away.

766
00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:58.940
That's why

767
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.840
you were thrown away.

768
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:31.700
Omona...

769
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.420
The violent teacher's mother is here.

770
00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.880
Make an appointment if
you want to say something.

771
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.450
Don't disturb my business.

772
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:46.110
Look here!

773
00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:47.820
Yes, take a good look!

774
00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.490
Your daughter's face is
all over the internet,

775
00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:51.800
so quickly go look it up!

776
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:53.070
Aigoo...

777
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:54.600
She can't understand.
She can't understand. Anyway.

778
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.870
<i>Teacher being violent to a student!?
High school female teacher violence video</i>

779
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.110
You did this?

780
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.770
Your daughter did it.

781
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.490
Isn't this evidence? Evidence!

782
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:16.960
Now, this isn't simply a
matter of her getting fired.

783
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.050
I heard she's just a contract employee.

784
00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.210
She may never be able
to become a teacher

785
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.570
even if she places first in the exam.

786
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.650
My son

787
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.440
My son is going to be haunted forever.

788
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.140
Forever!

789
00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:27.610
He said that when he closes his eyes,

790
00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.140
he sees a foot come and go.

791
00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.140
And it's the foot of your
"great" daughter.

792
00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.680
Why does only my son have to
go through this pain? Why?!

793
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.340
Neighbors, I'm right, aren't I?

794
00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.260
Please say something. Really.

795
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.070
Ah, really...

796
00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:44.160
See you in court!

797
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:01.820
Uh, where are you now?

803
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.870
Hello?

804
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.640
Such an interesting woman.

805
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:53.610
She gave me this when we met.

806

<i>November, 2017.
Rumors about a chaebol family.</i>

807
00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:00.000
Because of you,

808
00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.550
I have to deal with that kind of woman.

809
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.840
I'm sorry.

810
00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.230
Even if it's the same background, you
should act appropriately and modestly.

811
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:13.080
You said since we were
of the same background,

812
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.500
I should be more understanding.

813
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:16.270
You better know where the line is.

814
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:21.130
Know that we stopped
this article for you.

815
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.566
Did you want to use this kind of method
to prove your very existence?

816
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.880
Even if you cannot be
helpful to the family,

817
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.670
at the very least,
you shouldn't be a burden.

818
00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:39.960
You've never thought of
me as a family member.

819
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.280
Who says you're a family member?

820
00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.920
Since you've been
playing a mother lately,

821
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.820
I think you have you
forgotten your own role.

822
00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:59.620
Shall I clear it up for you?

823
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.720
I have never forgotten.

824
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.960
I was born and raised as
an illegitimate child.

825
00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.620
And I'm currently paying my debt
through an arranged marriage.

826
00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:10.700
That I can't even decide to
get a divorce if I want to,

827
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.960
I know that very well.

828
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.950
Yes. It seems you haven't
totally forgotten your place.

829
00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:20.360
Just continue...

830
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.020
to live that way.

831
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:05.960
I think you'll have to let your
ankle be grabbed by your grandfather.

832
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.130
Here.

833
00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:21.360
Even teas from the same plant
can become different tasting teas

834
00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.160
if planted in different soils.

835
00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.960
Even with the same tea,

836
00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.400
depending on how it is handled, it
can further produce differing results.

837
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.700
What I mean is that you are not the
you that you might think you are.

838
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.200
Are you telling me to
follow your intent?

839
00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.160
Will you do that?

840
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.830
What is it that you expect me to do?

841
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.560
[Contract Physical Education Teacher,
Shocking Violence Towards Student]

842
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.807
A video about violence towards a
student has been uploaded online

843
00:58:41.007 --> 00:58:42.430
[Contract Physical Education Teacher,
Shocking Violence Towards Student]

844
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:44.300
and has gone viral.

845
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.625
A contract teacher who
has not even passed

846
00:58:46.825 --> 00:58:49.260
her certification exam
has in the classroom...

847
00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:50.130
Mom.

848
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:56.930
Th-this video.
How did the video get released?

849
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.430
I don't think the school is on
Hee Kyung unni's side either.

850
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:12.860
If Jung Wook's mom sues
me and takes me to court,

851
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.400
I won't be able to be able to take
the certification exam for many years.

852
00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:24.930
I had wanted to get a job
quickly and be of help to Mom.

853
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.760
When do you think my daughter will come?

854
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.310
Your daughter must be happy

855
00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:00.440
that she has you waiting for her.

856
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.530
Unni, what about you?

857
01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.600
Don't you have a mother?

858
01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:01.600
This afternoon, what was that attitude?

859
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.530
Now can't we just be honest?

860
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:06.260
What about you?

861
01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.550
When will you change?

862
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.420
Today, during the interview, I realized.

863
01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.860
We can't hide it any longer.

864
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.220
This won't do any more.

865
01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.220
I know.

866
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.880
I also already know.

867
01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.730
But let me at least become
Superintendent first.

868
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.200
If you become Superintendent of
Education, then will anything change?

869
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.350
Will our Seo Jin come back
to life and return to us?

870
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.630
If we do nothing,

871
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.630
then will something change?

872
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.200
Don't you know the reason that
I'm trying so hard like this?

873
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.330
Now,

874
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.630
let's stop doing it.

875
01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.730
Please don't look at me
with those eyes like that!

876
01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.260
Was I the only one responsible
for Seo Jin's death?

877
01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.500
You agreed as well!

878
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.600
But then the child died,
so then it's all my fault?!

879
01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.230
You totally hate me, don't you?!

880
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:10.600
That's right!

881
01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:14.230
At the airport when he was
crying that he didn't want to go,

882
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.330
that last view of Seo Jin's
face won't leave my head!

883
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:21.730
Whatever I had to do,
I should have stopped it no matter what.

884
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:24.830
That young one,
how hard it must have been for him.

885
01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.327
Really, I said let's see each at court,

886
01:03:15.527 --> 01:03:17.700
so why are you calling me out here
in the middle of the night?

887
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.730
Jung Wook's mother

888
01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.760
Why the polite tone?

889
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.160
What do you have to say to me?

890
01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.300
Please let it go one more time.

891
01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.200
Where did the person who
threatened to countersue me go?

892
01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.430
I was too hasty.

893
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.860
What?

894
01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.700
Now that it has been shown on the news,
are you frightened?

895
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.660
If you can say that he
wasn't actually hit...

896
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.660
And if I did that, then what?

897
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.260
Were you going to get on
your knees and beg again?

898
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.667
Well, I guess if it's for your children,

899
01:03:54.867 --> 01:03:56.734
then being able
to beg on your knees

900
01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:58.800
until they're completely worn away
is your specialty.

901
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.900
Your pride also goes completely away.
That's really great.

902
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.430
Make sure your kids watch and learn.

903
01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.260
Thank you...

904
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.900
for making me come to my senses.

905
01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.200
What?

906
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.760
I was about to get on my knees and beg.

907
01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:31.660
Huh?

908
01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:36.130
If it was for my kids' sake,

909
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.730
pride or heart or whatever,

910
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.630
I was willing to live
without any of that,

911
01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.600
but my thinking was wrong.

912
01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.500
My getting on my knees and begging

913
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:55.000
is the same as my children getting
on their knees and begging.

914
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.530
Because of you I know that now.

915
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:59.630
So what?

916
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:01.830
What are you going to do about it?

917
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.630
Getting on my knees is easy.

918
01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:07.300
I'm no longer going
to take the easy way.

919
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.100
As hard as it is,

920
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.700
for you, for me,

921
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.800
let's go the very hard way.

922
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.900
What are you saying?

923
01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.950
Go where?

924
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:23.000
Well!

925
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.660
Seo Jin.

926
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.700
Your mother is really sorry.

927
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.800
Your mother is really sorry.

928
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.900
<i>[I'm sorry, but tonight
I won't be able to come out. ]</i>

929
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:26.930
<i>[Me, too.. I'm sorry.]</i>

930
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.860
<i>[Something came up unexpectedly. ]</i>

931
01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:50.900
Aigoo, aigoo.

932
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.930
I'll take you home with me.
