She's alive.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.894
Hey! Are you crazy?

9
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.130
Didn't you see?

10
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.998
She moved.

11
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.568
- If she sees a doctor.. - What then?

12
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.338
What about what we did up to now?

13
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.806
What?

14
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.912
This is still wrong.

15
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.923
What happened? Was there an accident?

16
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.725
Yes.

Okay. Thank you.

21

29
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.911
Okay. I got it, thank you.

30
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.483
Min Ho, you have to come out right now.

31
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.494
Sir, please save Min Ho.

32
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.099
I told you, didn't I?

33
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.104
When I saw out the district attorney,

34
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.373
I heard something.

35
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.541
You saw it, didn't you?

36
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.246
Tae Kyoo was making trouble.

37
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.749
Yes.

38
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.990
Why didn't you tell me?

39
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.227
I didn't want it to burden your campaign.

40
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.995
- If I could take care... - So,

41
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.930
did you?

42
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.435
Is that why this happened?

43
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.104
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

44
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.541
I won't let this trouble you.

45
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.043
It's my fault for mismanaging Kingdom.

46
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.313
I made sure that Min Ho...

47
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.748
would never mention it.

48
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.917
So, please...

49
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.495
Sir...

50
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.432
Please...

51
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.668
Please save Min Ho...

52
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.938
just this once.

53
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.286
Forget it.

54
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.928
There's no reason to kneel for such a thing.

55
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.933
Me being upset is another matter.

56
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.870
I know what Min Ho means to you.

57
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.872
He's like...

58
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.042
a nephew to me too.

59
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.979
Sir.

60
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.285
Don't worry.

61
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.855
I'll hire the best lawyer...

62
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.859
so that Min Ho doesn't get a scratch.

63
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.630
He has a bright future ahead of him.

64
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.867
We can't let this ruin his life.

65
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.871
Thank you.

66
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.240
Thank you so much.

67

68
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.555

69
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.558
Granny is here.

70
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.160
It's Granny.

71
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.103
It's cold today.

72
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.607
What are you doing here?

73
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.977
Granny is here, so let's go home.

74
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.580
Come on, now.

75
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.515
Hey.

76
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.018
I said I'm here.

77
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.391
No, no.

78
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.226
You can't go.

79
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.230
You can't go.

80
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.403
Don't go.

81
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.606
You should take me if you want to go.

82
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.244
How can I... How can I live...

83
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.346
without my baby?

84
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.216
How can you leave me alone?

85
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.654
No. Open your eyes.

86
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.222
Open them.

87
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.959
Gosh. Open them.

88
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.229
Ma'am.

89
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.701

If you don't,

91
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.373

93
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.947
I'm begging you.

(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

97
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.499
This is the first report on Kong Soo Ah's case.

98
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.769
According to her chat with Eel and CCTVs,

99
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.372
we tracked down her whereabouts that day.

100
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.976
Around 8pm,

101
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.079
Baek Min Ho started to text Eel.

102
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.315
At 9pm, Kong Soo Ah and Hyun Ji Soo...

103
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.117
were seen going into the hotel.

104
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.120
- Hyun Ji Soo? - Yes.

105
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.389
She's one of the teenagers under Eel.

106
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.724
Then she might be a witness...

107
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.626
or a secondary victim.

108
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.994
Where is she now?

109
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.896
We're tracking her cell phone right now.

110
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.399
We haven't been able to track credit cards...

111
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.100
or internet usages yet.

112
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.468
Then...

113
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.238
the accident happened while having a 2 on 2.

114
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.473
Kong Soo Ah was there to see Baek Min Ho.

115
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.742
Something happened, so he murdered her.

116
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.978
Then he abducted her. Is that the story?

117
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.212
I don't think so.

According to the autopsy, we found DNAs...

of two people from Kong Soo Ah.

123
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.524
We also saw signs of resistance...

124
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.592
often seen with forced intercourses.

(Injuries)

126
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.768
What is that?

127
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.105
It's the first cause of her death.

128
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.741
She was beat many times with something pointy,

129
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.276
causing her to bleed.

130
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.244
The space between the cuts are even,

131
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.247
so it's probably due to a ring or a knuckle...

132
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.983
the beater had on.

133
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.952
What do we do?

134
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.855
How can someone use such a thing?

135
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.090
Exactly.

136
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.858
It must have hurt a lot.

137
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.627
However, the cause of death...

138
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.463
says it's shock.

139
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.631
She was exposed to cold after being abducted.

140
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.734
We think she suffered hypoglycemia.

141
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.102
My goodness.

142
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.571
If someone found her early enough,

143
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.106
she would have survived.

144
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.274
Let's summarize.

145
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.344
Are both men responsible for all crimes?

146
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.013
Or was raping and beating done by himself?

147
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.982
Did the accomplice help with just the abduction?

148
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.952
We need to decipher who the main culprit is.

149
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.087
- Yes. - Yes.

150
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.989
Don't be emotional,

151
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.858
and stay calm until the end...

152
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.526
to find the culprit.

153
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.496

makes him a murderer?

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.862
This statement says that someone witnessed...

176
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.830
you with Kong Soo Ah.

177
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.499
He says there was another man.

178
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.501
Who was it?

179
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.318
Why are you surprised?

180
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.987
You're the one that beat her to death.

181
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.155
- No. - Don't lie!

182
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.957
You're the one that met with Kong Soo Ah.

183
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.159
You also kidnapped her.

184
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.494
Are you saying you didn't kill her?

185
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.396
- It doesn't make sense. - Ms. Ma.

186
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.865
Are you trying to be loyal to your accomplice?

187
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.000
Do as you wish.

188
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.102
As long as we have you,

189
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.503
we'll charge you for raping a minor...

190
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.605
and murdering her. It's over for you.

191
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.741
It wasn't me! I swear!

192
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.846
It was Tae Kyoo.

193
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.382
He's the one that beat her to death.

194
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.251
It wasn't me. It was him.

195
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.859
(Prosecutors' Office)

196
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.334
The 24-year-old son of Hyungjae Group's...

197
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.969
Chairman Ahn Suk Pil...

198
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.238
has been called to the Prosecutor's Office...

199
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.206
as the suspected murderer of an 18-year-old woman...

200
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.709
that was found on a hill in Yeongpa.

201
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.977
According to Prosecution,

202
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.980
on the 13th at 8pm which is the day before...

203
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.983
she disappeared, Kong met Baek...

204
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.651
on a chatting app and had agreed...

205
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.853
to meet at Hyungjae Hotel before disappearing.

206
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.222
Baek had hired Kong for prostitution,

207
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.625
also known as a conditional meeting.

208
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.761
He claimed that Ahn was there with him.

209
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.264
Prosecution revealed that they would...

210
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.765
investigate Baek and Ahn...

211
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.735
as they were the last to see Kong.

212
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.505
They are found to be law school students...

213
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.374
of Hankuk University, causing up a stir.

214
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.143
If their charges are proven at court,

215
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.313
they will get a minimum of 20 years to life...

216
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.705
Is this all?

217
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.509
Did you take pictures of anyone else?

218
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.877
This is all.

219
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.848
You're really bold.

220
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.650
Cho Gap Soo, where are you?

221
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.252
Get out here!

222
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.656
You're dismissed.

223
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.225
Don't let it leak.

224
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.029
Are you in your office?

225
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.997
What's taking you so long?

226
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.112
Are you here?

227
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.086
Didn't you hear what happened to your nephew?

228
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.888
Are you just going to watch?

229
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.359
He's not my child.

230
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.261
He's yours.

231
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.563
Then is Min Ho yours?

232
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.867
I heard everything. You gave him Ms. Heo?

233
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.104
What can I do?

234
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.106
I should look after him.

235
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.508
Gap Soo.

236
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.678
You're not in the place to care for anyone.

237
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.382
What did you just say?

238
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.717
Kingdom. Your secret room.

239
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.855
Should I take a few pictures of it...

240
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.356
and take it to Kim Moon Sung?

241
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.426
I should print the floor plan of the hotel too.

242
00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.363
If Kingdom is found out,

243
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.433
Hyungjae Hotel won't be safe.

244
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.135
Would that be all right?

245
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.703
Hotel isn't the problem!

246
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.505
My future is at stake!

247
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.607
Do you mean that?

248
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.776
Have you seen a parent lie...

249
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.944
while swearing on their child?

250
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.682
Gap Soo.

251
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.951
Think carefully.

252
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.554
You can find yourself another right hand,

253
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.057
but where will you find another sponsor?

254
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.659
Give up on Mr. Baek.

255
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.004
(Kong Soo Ah murder case)

256
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.040
Min Ho called for girls through a chat.

257
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.612
I wasn't into it,

258
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.413
but since he already hired them,

259
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.116
I was tempted to have fun.

260
00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.054
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.623
Keep going.

262
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.831
Maybe we drank for an hour.

263
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.633
I got drunk,

264
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.867
so I went in to sleep.

265
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.603
Once I woke up,

266
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.338
Soo Ah wasn't beside me.

267
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.675
So I looked around for her.

268
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.854
I was so surprised. When I got there,

269
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.157
Soo Ah wasn't moving...

270
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.092
from being beat too much.

271
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.130
I told Min Ho he's crazy.

272
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.165
I asked him why he did that,

273
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.069
and he said he was jealous of what I had.

274
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.371
He wanted...

275
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.840
everything I had.

276
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.877
What are you talking about?

277
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.819
Min Ho...

278
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.155
was always jealous of me.

279
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.857
He always...

280
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.794
wanted what I had.

281
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.301
Kong Soo Ah was my partner.

282
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.137
I think Tae Kyoo used my ID...

283
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.272
to start the chat.

284
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.873
That's how he met her.

285
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.610
So she was your partner to begin with?

286
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.611
Yes.

287
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.213
We drank for about an hour,

288
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.615
then we slept together.

289
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.682
I gave her money before sleeping.

290
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.684
I told her she could go whenever she wanted.

291
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.387
While sleeping, I heard sounds outside.

292
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.923
When I went out to see...

293
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.600
Tae Kyoo had hit her again.

294
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.671
- Again? - Tae Kyoo...

295
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.141
hits girls whenever he drinks.

296
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.579
Why did you go with him to get rid of the body?

297
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.683
Doesn't that mean you were his accomplice?

298
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.585
What could I do? He's my friend.

299
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.888
Min Ho said he'd take full responsibility,

300
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.923
and to just go with him.

301
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.095
I was drunk and lacked judgment, so I went.

302
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.431
So you willingly helped dispose of the body.

303
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.565
I did not.

304
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.601
I slept as soon as I got in the car.

305
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.872
I had no idea he'd dump Soo Ah like that.

306
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.743
When I woke up,

307
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.081
Min Ho removed Soo Ah's limp body from the trunk.

308
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.651
You went because you were drunk and his friend.

309
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.591
Why did you scrap your car?

310
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.161
Did Min Ho make you do that well?

311
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.629
Yes, he did.

312
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.465
Min Ho said it would be best.

313
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.037
I should've stopped him.

314
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.343
I only did what Tae Kyoo told me to.

315
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.547
I tried to call the police when I saw her there.

316
00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.350
But he screamed at me to stop.

317
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.919
So? You did as you were told?

318
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.924
He has a fiery temper, so I was afraid, and...

319
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.760
Your friend scared you, so you helped dumping a body.

320
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.399
But you're the one in the driver's seat.

321
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.869
You drove the body to the woods yourself.

322
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.104
Tae Kyoo...

323
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.072
Look. Baek Min Ho.

324
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.675
Have you no free will?

325
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.677
I did not hit her.

326
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.113
I was dragged there against my will,

327
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.683
and I tried to call 911 when I saw she was alive!

328
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.219
You must be confused.

329
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.421
Dumping it on Ahn Tae Kyoo...

330
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.124
doesn't change the fact that you dumped the body.

331
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.394
That alone will give you three years easily.

332
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.762
Got that?

333
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.938
He was dragged there. He didn't kill her.

334
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.208
He said the same thing for hours upon hours.

335
00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.611
They're both insisting they're accessories.

336
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.281
We need physical evidence to prove who did it.

337
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.352
Ms. Son, have we still not located Hyun Ji Soo?

338
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.588
No. It looks like she's hiding on purpose.

339
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.323
Hello.

340
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.793
Did you find anything at the scene?

341
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.462
We searched the hotel inside and out,

342
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.897
but nothing.

343
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.168
They happened to replace the carpets the day after.

344
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.369
Coincidentally.

345
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.870
What about "K," which Soo Ah mentioned?

346
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.605
I looked into that too,

347
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.109
but there was no building or item by that name.

348
00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.079
This seemed to be the most likely...

349
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.183
- "KPOP"? - Yes.

350
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.653
The day of the incident, this was going on...

351
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.087
by the room.

352
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.759
Maybe this is what Soo Ah was trying to say?

353
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.829
Anyway.

354
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.132
I brought this new piece of evidence.

355
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.901
Ahn Tae Kyoo submitted it.

356
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.138
A USB drive.

357
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.842
I'm sure the company said to bring me everything.

358
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:21.810
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.214
We were instructed not to give it to you.

360
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:26.849
Instructed?

361
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.285
By the chairman?

362
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.029
Min Ho was obsessed with Tae Kyoo.

363
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.533
Clothes, accessories, shoes. He copied it all.

364
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.369
Check Min Ho's social media pages.

365
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.838
He had such a chip on his shoulder.

366
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.442
He had to do everything Tae Kyoo did.

367
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.613
To be honest, whenever he drank,

368
00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.615
he'd lose his temper.

369
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.651
He couldn't stand it if you hurt his pride.

370
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.020
He constantly got into fights while drinking.

371
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.189
They're all testimonies against Baek Min Ho.

372
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.158
Let's check his social media pages to confirm.

373
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.560
Next file.

374
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.361
What's this? This is pretty much conclusive.

375
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.898
Hyungjae submitted it, so we can't believe it all,

376
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.333
but so far, yes.

377
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.303
As of now, Baek Min Ho is the main perpetrator,

378
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.104
and Ahn Tae Kyoo is the accessory.

379
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.973
Right?

380
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.885
Mr. Baek.

381
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.858
What are you doing?

382
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.761
Chairman Ahn submitted the surveillance video.

383
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.164
They edited it to frame Min Ho.

384
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.836
I guess he was pretty scared.

385
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.372
Sir. Please meet with Chairman Ahn.

386
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.909
It looks like they plan to dump it all on Min Ho.

387
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.579
If something happens to Min Ho...

388
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.681
The prosecutors know...

389
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.050
that Tae Kyoo is Hyungjae Group's son.

390
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.454
They wouldn't believe what they submit.

391
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.392
I hear...

392
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.396
Ha is running around looking for evidence...

393
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.198
to help Min Ho.

394
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.634
Don't you worry.

395
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.701
Sang Ho.

396
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.437
What do I do now?

397
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.108
What if I take the fall for everything?

398
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.079
Look. Do you remember anything else?

399
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:45.647
Anything that can be of evidence?

400
00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.382
Evidence?

401
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.387
That's right.

402
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.391
The girl who was with us that day.

403
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.363
There was another girl with Soo Ah.

404
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.832
Tae Kyoo hit her too.

405
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.101
That girl...

406
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.372
may have seen him freak out and ran away.

407
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.840
What's her name?

408
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.377
Her name? Her name.

409
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.779
Hyun...

410
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.849
Hyun Ji Soo.

411
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.351
She said it was Hyun Ji Soo.

412
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.254
She dropped out of Gyungjae Women's College.

413
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.857
Okay. I'll find her first.

414
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.028
Hyun Ji Soo. 19. Gyungjae Women's High drop-out.

415
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.797
It's urgent. Find her. Please, Detective Choi.

416
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.601
Don't worry too much. Mr. Cho Gap Soo...

417
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.837
will help however he can, since it's you.

418
00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.815
Hello, Ms. Ma.

419
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.418
We searched Baek Min Ho's social media pages.

420
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.314
(Matching watches with Tae Kyoo?)

421
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.885
Testimonies that Min Ho copied Tae Kyoo...

422
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.086
seem reliable.

423
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.788
You're right.

424
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.442
I think the disappearance of Ms. Ma's mother...

425
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.611
has something to do with Cho Gap Soo.

426
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.592
What are you doing?

427
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.282
This is it, right?

428
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.153
The sharp item that caused Kong Soo Ah's death.

429
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.122
I wondered what it was,

430
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.558
but it was found near the body.

431
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.528
If we find your DNA in the glove,

432
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.129
it'll prove it was you.

433
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.433
Her blood is probably on this, so you can't hide.

434
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.906
Hey, you. Ahn Tae Kyoo.

435
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.108
Are you even human?

436
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.444
How could you hit someone while wearing this?

437
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.090
Did you laugh?

438
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.663
This isn't mine.

439
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.031
It is yours.

440
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.834
I saw you squirm when you saw it.

441
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.208
Then compare the DNA.

442
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.311
You said you found this at the scene.

443
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.655
Just to let you know,

444
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.591
I always...

445
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.860
put my initials on my things.

446
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.637
Hyun Ji Soo is here.

447
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.414
After what happened,

448
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.383
I hid because I was so scared.

449
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.688
I came when I saw the news.

450
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.192
I've never seen such a psycho...

451
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.795
in my entire life.

452
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.132
She did nothing particularly wrong.

453
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.502
I don't know what he didn't like,

454
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.104
or what upset him,

455
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.175
but he suddenly put on a glove with sharp studs,

456
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.911
and hit her for no reason.

457
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.913
From her head,

458
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.917
her face, and all over.

459
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.554
She was scratched and stabbed,

460
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.055
and was bleeding and hurting.

461
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.426
She cried that it hurt, and begged him to stop,

462
00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.894
but he kept hitting her.

463
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.864
And then...

464
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.571
It looked like she died.

465
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.076
Then...

466
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.046
that demon...

467
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.082
laughed...

468
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.351
in that situation.

469
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.187
So?

470
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.456
Who was it?

471
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.192
Ahn Tae Kyoo?

472
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.798
Ji Soo.

473
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.367
Was it Ahn Tae Kyoo?

474
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:42.604
No.

475
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.007
It was Baek Min Ho.

476
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.742
Baek Min Ho...

477
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.878
beat Soo Ah to death.

478
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.153
Are you sure it was Baek Min Ho?

479
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.356
Yes.

480
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:06.895
Am I done now?

481
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.464
I don't need to come here again, right?

482
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.199
What?

483
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.135
To be honest,

484
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.839
I don't want to talk about what happened again,

485
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:19.541
and I don't want to be involved.

486
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.045
You can't say that.

487
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.713
What do you mean?

488
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.382
That night,

489
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.585
you could've been the one who was killed.

490
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.222
Don't you feel like Soo Ah died in your place?

491
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.639
So what? What?

492
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.275
Should I have died in her place or something?

493
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.281
Why didn't you call it in?

494
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.953
Soo Ah...

495
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.021
shivered in the cold...

496
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.756
and died on a remote path.

497
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.892
If you had called the cops...

498
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.927
when you ran away from the hotel,

499
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.963
you could've saved Soo Ah.

500
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.970
What were you thinking, keeping quiet until now?

501
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.739
Who cares if Soo Ah died for no reason...

502
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.508
since you're alive, is that it?

503
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.144
Didn't you know Soo Ah had a grandma?

504
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.381
Didn't you think about how much she would've...

505
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.682
looked for Soo Ah?

506
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.985
How could you have kept silent...

507
00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.587
all this time after watching a person die?

508
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.675
Did it go well?

509
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.945
I guess not.

510
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.613
There's no such thing as going well.

511
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.316
All the witnesses and evidence point to Min Ho.

512
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:10.885
I see.

513
00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.321
Without new evidence,

514
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.923
let's go forward with Min Ho as the primary,

515
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.990
and Tae Kyoo as the accessory.

516
00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.197
Yeo.

517
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.833
Yes?

518
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.635
What do you keep thinking about?

519
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.604
Didn't you hear me?

520
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.444
I need to step out for a few minutes.

521
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.835
A fire broke out at a hospital.

522
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.171
Please evacuate quickly.

523
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.572
I repeat.

524
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.774
A fire broke out at a hospital.

525
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.177
Please evacuate quickly.

526
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.822
Ms. Soo.

527
00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.025
Ms. Soo, are you okay?

528
00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.561
Water.

529
00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.113
Help! Excuse me!

530
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.316
We're trapped in here.

531
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.985
Help.

532
00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.661
Help.

533
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.797
We're trapped in here.

534
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.800
Help.

535
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:09.003
We're trapped in here.

536
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.043
Help.

537
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.812
We're trapped in here.

538
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:19.981
Help.

539
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.384
We're trapped in here.

540
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:53.548
Thank you.

541
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.143
(Kim Mi Jung)

542
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.180
She's in bad shape.

543
00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.549
She needs to go to another hospital soon.

544
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.321
Where is her family?

545
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.923
Did you contact them?

546
00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.794
She...

547
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.965
has never had...

548
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.566
a single visitor.

549
00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.572
She did say she had a daughter...

550
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.509
in Janghyeon-dong, from what I recall.

551
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.450
I was in the area...

552
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:03.718
and thought of you.

553
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.553
Do you want to grab dinner?

554
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:14.922
Soo Ah asked me to give this to you.

555
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.127
Did you get it?

556
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:55.162
What did you send?

557
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:56.797
The glove...

558
00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.734
that Ahn Tae Kyoo was wearing that day.

559
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.402
What?

560
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:34.468
You said it was Baek Min Ho earlier.

561
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.406
So you lied.

562
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.943
I sent it via messenger, so you should get it now.

563
00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.423
Ms. Son. Did I get a delivery?

564
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.924
No.

565
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.293
Maybe Mr. Yeo received it.

566
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.138
I'm surprised. I assumed you'd be too busy.

567
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.441
Why did you do it?

568
00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.176
What?

569
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.378
Why did you do that to Ms. Ma's mother?

570
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.352
The person you have reached...

571
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:25.553
Where is he?

572
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:32.693
You knew that Kim Mi Jung...

573
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.565
No, Kwak Young Shil, was not a patient.

574
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.801
Jin Wook.

575
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.237
Also why Detective Baek had her admitted too.

576
00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.742
How long did you have her locked up?

577
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.046
I heard Kwak Young Shil begged every single day...

578
00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.782
to find her daughter. How long did you ignore her?

579
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.485
Jin Wook.

580
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.086
How could a person do that?

581
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.123
Didn't you think her family would look for her?

582
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.860
Do you know how badly someone's life was ruined?

583
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.696
Yeo.

584
00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.338
What did you just say?

585
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.640
Ms. Ma.

586
00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.215
You just said...

587
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.584
Detective Baek...

588
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.653
had my mom admitted at a mental hospital,

589
00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.023
and your mother had locked her up...

590
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.526
I misheard you, right?

591
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.930
Jin Wook, I'm going to leave.

592
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.532
Doctor, just a minute.

593
00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.335
Where's my mom? Answer me.

594
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.573
As I told you before, I don't know your mother.

595
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.842
Then what about that Kim Mi Jung lady?

596
00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.644
Who is she?

597
00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.715
- Ms. Ma. - Kim Mi Jung is my mom,

598
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.083
isn't she?

599
00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:05.753
I have no duty to disclose my patient's information.

600
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.021
Doctor!

601
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.625
Why do you keep playing dumb? I just heard you.

602
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.295
You know where my mom is.

603
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.198
What happened to my mom? Tell me.

604
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.567
As I said it before, I have no idea.

605
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.001
Did you really lock her up?

606
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.337
That's why you're saying you don't know!

607
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.340
What did you do to my mom? Tell me!

608
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.442
- What did you do to her? - Stop this.

609
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.177
Let go of me.

610
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.612
- Talk to me. - Doctor!

611
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.814
- Answer me! - Talk with her later.

612
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.983
- Later when? - I know you're angry...

613
00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.118
and shocked.

614
00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.588
But even if you ask now, she can't answer you.

615
00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.224
Why not? I guess she feels guilty?

616
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.293
But that's her problem. I need to know.

617
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.962
I need to know whether my mom...

618
00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.563
- is dead or alive! - I'll tell you.

619
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.134
I'll tell you. I'm sure my mom is shocked too.

620
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.103
- When she calms down... - Are you saying...

621
00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.507
your mom being shocked is more critical than...

622
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.175
whether or not my mom is alive?

623
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.878
You know that's not what I'm saying.

624
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.381
I wanted to find out for sure and let you know.

625
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.951
When?

626
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.021
After my mom dies?

627
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.926
I can't trust you anymore.

628
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.264
Not your mother or you.

629
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.699
I don't need any of you.

630
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.002
I'll find out myself.

631
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.105
If your mother did anything to her,

632
00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.007
I will...

633
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.177
make her pay.

634
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.407
What is that?

635
00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.235
(True Rehabilitation, True Happiness)

636
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.944
Ahn Tae Kyoo, come out.

637
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.887
What happened? Hey.

638
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.755
Why are you getting out?

639
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.861
Defendant Ahn Tae Kyoo...

640
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.863
is released from detention.

641
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.632
Hey!

642
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:10.771
- Is it done? - Not yet.

643
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.340
You have to be on top of the part-timers.

644
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.909
- That's right. - Also...

645
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.862
Meeting someone won't solve the problem.

646
00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.132
Still, I can't do nothing and take it.

647
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:42.636
Min Ho may end up being convicted for murder.

648
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.942
Let's wait a little bit.

649
00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.180
Are you really going to be like this?

650
00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:00.154
Don't you know that Min Ho is more precious...

651
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.722
than my own life?

652
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:06.694
I will never watch anything happen to him.

653
00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.865
I understand how you feel.

654
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.401
But Sang Ho.

655
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:19.173
Let's have Min Ho sacrifice a little bit.

656
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:23.510
He won't serve that much time in prison.

657
00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.413
It's his first offense. If he submits an apology,

658
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.616
and make the prison guards write recommendations,

659
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.454
I'm sure we'll get him out in five years.

660
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.756
- Gap Soo. - What can I do?

661
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.392
Chairman Ahn said we can't touch Tae Kyoo,

662
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.695
that if he goes to jail, he'll spill the beans...

663
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.863
about Kingdom.

664
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.067
Let's say Tae Kyoo goes to jail and not Min Ho.

665
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.503
With Chairman Ahn's nasty temper,

666
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:52.406
do you think he'll let Min Ho live?

667
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.541
Then did you know...

668
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:58.012
that they took the surveillance video...

669
00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.447
and the witnesses?

670
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:05.753
Sang Ho.

671
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.658
I understand.

672
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.427
Okay.

673
00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:15.696
Good thinking.

674
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.333
Then I'll hand over the secret planner...

675
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.202
to the police.

676
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.340
Planner?

677
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.175
I served you for 20 years.

678
00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.277
You ordered me to do many things.

679
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.381
I brought women higher-ups wanted,

680
00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.817
abducted people they wanted gone,

681
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.653
got rid of anyone who got in your way...

682
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.722
even in the slightest. I have that all...

683
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:44.358
recorded in my planner.

684
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.796
What did you just say?

685
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.197
So...

686
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.602
you've been planning to stab me in the back,

687
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:57.571
is that it?

688
00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.606
I wrote in it every day for 20 years,

689
00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.176
and gathered plenty of evidence,

690
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.113
begging this day would never come.

691
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.253
Gap Soo.

692
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.356
Please save Min Ho.

693
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.292
Then...

694
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.427
I'll be a good servant.

695
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.163
Are you threatening me?

696
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.802
This is my first and last request.

697
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.611
Fine.

698
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:40.948
Sang Ho,

699
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.585
I forgot what you mean in my life.

700
00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:58.232
Hello, this is Cho Gap Soo.

701
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.237
I need you to help this old fool.

702
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.773
Yes. Yes. Let's meet in person.

703
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.176
Yes. Yes. I understand.

704
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.211
I'll head there right now.

705
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:13.213
Thank you.

706
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.888
I promise...

707
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.157
to save Min Ho.

708
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:30.197
Relax.

709
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.967
Do you mean it?

710
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.272
Will you really help me this time?

711
00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.759
Hello?

712
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.291
With what do you want to make a deal with me?

713
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:35.963
Conclusive evidence that can clear Baek Min Ho...

714
00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.564
of murder.

715
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.434
You understand...

716
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.002
what the situation is, correct?

717
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.405
Ahn Tae Kyoo weaseled his way out.

718
00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.775
Your brother may be locked up for manslaughter...

719
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:51.211
and criminal disposition of a corpse.

720
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.548
If the Prosecutors' Office wants,

721
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.717
we can send him away for life.

722
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.354
What do you want?

723
00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.421
You know...

724
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:04.024
what I want.

725
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:09.363
My mom Kwak Young Shil.

726
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.002
What happened to her...

727
00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.639
and where is she? Tell me.

728
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.909
If you give me that, I'll clear your brother,

729
00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.879
Baek Min Ho, of murder.

730
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:31.752
(Mr. Cho Gap Soo)

731
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.354
I met with the DA.

732
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.926
We never had this conversation.

733
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:42.963
Why?

734
00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:45.632
Did Cho Gap Soo say he'll get him out?

735
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:50.003
You're more naive than you seem.

736
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.839
Heo Yoon Kyung.

737
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.741
Did you know she withdrew?

738
00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.313
Wasn't she...

739
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:01.548
Hyungjae's ace attorney...

740
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.717
that Cho Gap Soo put on your brother?

741
00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.453
She withdrew from representing Min Ho...

742
00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.388
and is now on Ahn Tae Kyoo's side.

743
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:11.525
Baek Min Ho now has...

744
00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.026
absolutely nobody.

745
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.112
(Heo Yoon Kyung)

746
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:42.756
The person you have reached...

747
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:44.024
(Kim Hyung Soo)

748
00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:46.793
Hello? Kim Hyung Soo speaking.

749
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:48.462
Where's Mr. Choi?

750
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.043
- Here. - Okay.

751
00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:06.680
Have some.

752
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:08.315
Thank you.

753
00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:11.885
Let's toast.

754
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:18.125
Sang Ho.

755
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.763
I couldn't have gotten here if not for you.

756
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.432
Why are you saying something so ridiculous?

757
00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.671
You'll stay by my side...

758
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.173
until I go...

759
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.276
to the Blue House, won't you?

760
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.546
I'll serve you with all my heart.

761
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.467
This is Baek Sang Ho.

762
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.102
Yes, Sang Ho.

763
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.504
Is the discussion going well?

764
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.442
Yes, I'm talking with the district attorney.

765
00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.377
It's going very well.

766
00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:13.447
I'll call you later.

767
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:15.482
Okay.

768
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:19.319
Let's eat.

769
00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.798
Ms. Ma.

770
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.734
Does your offer still stand?

771
00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:43.043
Let me ask one thing.

772
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.213
Ms. Ma's mother.

773
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:49.082
What happened to her?

774
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:51.985
She's alive, right?

775
00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:57.257
I'm sure...

776
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.428
she's dead.

777
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:14.241
(For: Ma Yi Deum)

778
00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.447
Kwak Young Shil...

779
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.254
Okay.

780
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:30.323
Good. Drink, Ms. Heo.

781
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.028
Eat up.

782
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.613
Kwak Young Shil...

783
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:58.451
died.

784
00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:04.791
14 years ago.

785
00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.323
(Witch's Court)

786
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.924
Cho Gap Soo and Baek Sang Ho.

787
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.160
I'll make them both pay for what they did.

788
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.028
The prosecutor manipulating evidence...

789
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.197
and covering up your making a deal...

790
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:45.565
Isn't that wrong?

791
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.701
You'll take it all the way?

792
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.803
I'm being framed! This is a conspiracy!

793
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:51.571
I'm the only person...

794
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:52.906
who can save Min Ho.

795
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.907
Didn't you think...

796
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.543
you could ruin the trial with your actions?

797
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.013
Did you uncover the truth...

798
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.681
as you hoped?
