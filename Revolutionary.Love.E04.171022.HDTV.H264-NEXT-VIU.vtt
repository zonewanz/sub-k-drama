00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.650
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.519
(Byun Hyuk, second son of Gangsu, appeared voluntarily)

3
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.920
Why did you appear voluntarily after hiding away?

4
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620
Do you admit the charges of attacking the co-pilot?

5
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.230
Did you sexually harass the flight attendant?

6
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.060
Did you lobby the prosecution to cover up the incident?

7
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.560
Where were you?

8
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.029
Did you consult this with Gangsu?

9
00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:41.170
Are you here with your lawyer?

10
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.270
He's that young man.

11
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.370
What?

12
00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:50.810
(Byun Hyuk, second son of Gangsu, appeared voluntarily)

13
00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.679
Mr. Byun, please say something.

14
00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:58.749
Everything is...

15
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.889
my fault.

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.019
(Byun Hyuk, second son of Gangsu, appeared voluntarily)

17
00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:10.499
- How do you feel right now? - Where were you?

18
00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.129
- Where is your lawyer? - Does Gangsu approve of this?

19
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.269
Thanks for coming out here.

20
00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.710
Let's have one more session of taking photos.

21
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.969
- What? - A photo session?

22
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.909
- What is he talking about? - A photo session?

23
00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.040
- What? - Is he crazy?

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.180
- Does he think it's a red carpet? - What does he mean?

25
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.249
Is this a photo zone?

26
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.189
That's enough. Thank you.

27
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.620
- How do you feel? - Where were you?

28
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.060
- Does Gangsu know about this? - Do you admit your charges?

29
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.129
- Mr. Byun. - Please say something.

30
00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:45.499
- How do you feel? - Where's your lawyer?

31
00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:46.499
Please look this way.

32
00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.600
Excuse me.

33
00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.010
Byun Hyuk, the second son of Gangsu Group,

34
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.980
admitted himself voluntarily to the prosecution after he went missing.

35
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.650
There was suspicion that the prosecution was trying...

36
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.480
cover up his case, which is being watched with keen interest.

37
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.249
How could he not tell me anything?

38
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160
June.

39
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.829
To tell you the truth...

40
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.690
Last night...

41
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.399
Gangsu Group hasn't issued an official statement...

42
00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.600
when the reporters asked whether this sudden voluntary appearance...

43
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.070
was pre-consulted.

44
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.070
- Mr. Chairman, can I have a word? - You can't go in.

45
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.679
- You can't go in. - Move.

46
00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:32.739
- Please. - They were in the spotlight.

47
00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:35.809
- Gangsu. - From this incident,

48
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.350
- What is going on? - Gangsu has become controversial.

49
00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.179
- Why is Hyuk doing this? - Because of this, people are...

50
00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.089
- interested in the outcome. - Is this your plan?

51
00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:45.420
He has broken away from customs...

52
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.359
of conglomerates covering up controversies and not be punished.

53
00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.459
Do you know how much the stock prices collapsed?

54
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.970
You should have told us before this happened.

55
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.440
Do you want to see our stock prices hit rock bottom?

56
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.209
The shaman said...

57
00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.010
that Hyuk will become a great figure.

58
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.609
He said he will do something great and bring success to our company.

59
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.049
Even if he's destined to do great things,

60
00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.750
he can't do anything without help.

61
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.690
Please give Hyuk a chance.

62
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.660
Even if our child is thickheaded,

63
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.989
it's our duty as parents to help him and give him a chance.

64
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.459
I can't believe this.

65
00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.070
What will you do now?

66
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.170
Gang Su.

67
00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:31.869
Can't you hear us?

68
00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.450
It's me, Gang Su.

69
00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:48.750
You know,

70
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.989
I was going to close the case after the indictment was suspended.

71
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.230
That's what I've already reported to my superior.

72
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.760
How can you stab me in the back like this?

73
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.600
It's been less than an hour. How can you reverse the situation?

74
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.179
Have you decided to make me get blamed?

75
00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.739
No, that's not true.

76
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.950
That idiot did that on his own judgment.

77
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.350
Now I understand, Mr. Byun.

78
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.150
You don't have any internal control.

79
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.520
Do you think you can plan a big enterprise in this way?

80
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.390
Now that it's already like this, investigate and make him punished.

81
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.189
You don't have to make favorable arrangements.

82
00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:30.999
Are you ordering me an investigation now?

83
00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.299
Are you ordering me an investigation now?

84
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.540
I won't have a talk with you again regarding this matter, Mr. Byun.

85
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:06.699
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.439
Hello. Good morning.

87
00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:13.170
How are you?

88
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.670
Are you drinking it all right, sir?

89
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.439
- Thanks. - Thank you.

90
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.910
Have you seen the news?

91
00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.679
- I heard that he appeared. - Yes, that spoiled brat.

92
00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:24.420
Did you see his face? He looks like a lady's man.

93
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.679
- He looks like a pervert. - Look at his face.

94
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.549
To tell you the truth,

95
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.390
Byun Hyuk came to see me last night.

96
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.569
I thought the agreement was settled when you received the money.

97
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.869
I was so careless.

98
00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:48.569
I sincerely apologize.

99
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.710
Hyuk did that?

100
00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.920
He said he had awakened thanks to you.

101
00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.319
He said you were the making of him, June.

102
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.090
Then what will happen to the second son?

103
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.629
What else can happen?

104
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.330
He will go to jail.

105
00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:16.030
- Oh my! - As he had run away before,

106
00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:17.640
he will be sentenced, I suppose.

107
00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:20.439
I feel pity for him. It's getting cold these days.

108
00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.840
He had awakened thanks to me?

109
00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:25.179
Did he turn himself in because of me?

110
00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.150
I can't believe it.

111
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.850
What will happen to Hyuk?

112
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.850
Gosh, why do I have to worry about him?

113
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.989
He's still a third-generation conglomerate.

114
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.660
His dad is a chairman. His dad will do something for him.

115
00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.499
With money and lawyers, he'll be put on probation...

116
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.759
as usual.

117
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.970
That's what will happen.

118
00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.650
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:05.920
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:10.390
You should have controlled this matter, Manger Kwon.

121
00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:14.429
You should have reported to me earlier what Hyuk would do.

122
00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:21.030
I had no idea Hyuk would do such a thing.

123
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.929
I'm really sorry.

124
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.170
The third person who took Hyuk in.

125
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.369
Who is it?

126
00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:31.309
What's going on? You're hiding too many things.

127
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.049
Manager Kwon, by any chance...

128
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.520
are you and Hyuk up to something that I don't know?

129
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.119
Up to something?

130
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.489
What do you mean?

131
00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:45.689
He hasn't appeared by himself before.

132
00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:48.859
And now he's doing it. I'm confused.

133
00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:52.259
Is there something I don't know between you two?

134
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.030
There's a friend...

135
00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:00.270
who just provided room and board to Hyuk...

136
00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:02.710
without knowing who Hyuk is.

137
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:04.780
That person has nothing to do with this case.

138
00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:06.809
I trust you.

139
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.379
You know what I mean, don't you?

140
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.580
Yes, I do.

141
00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:18.460
Do you...

142
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.059
trust me?

143
00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:25.499
Manager Kwon, I found out the IP address that first leaked the video.

144
00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:27.970
I was first mistaken that it was a foreign IP address.

145
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.400
But you know I'm good. I finally got it right.

146
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.000
It was the management support director's office.

147
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.610
(Director Byun Woo Sung)

148
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.020
Of course...

149
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.020
I trust you.

150
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.699
After Hyuk's case is settled all right,

151
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.469
I'll send you to the planning office.

152
00:09:01.429 --> 00:09:03.599
You should not waste your talent anymore.

153
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.199
Don't you think so?

154
00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:07.240
I don't know what you mean...

155
00:09:07.469 --> 00:09:08.939
He committed it himself.

156
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.309
Let him take responsibility.

157
00:09:39.439 --> 00:09:41.339
Prosecutor! Aren't you going to investigate?

158
00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:43.670
You surprised me. Stay quiet!

159
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.240
It's scarier before you get hit than when you get hit.

160
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.010
You're taking too much time.

161
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.979
Who's taking time?

162
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.920
You're talking nonsense.

163
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.849
Do you think a prosecutor's investigation is that simple?

164
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.490
By the way, am I not...

165
00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.819
going to wear handcuffs?

166
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.229
- What? - Do I go to jail right after this?

167
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.900
How big is the cell? I don't want to stay alone.

168
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.299
Can you put me somewhere with many people, if possible?

169
00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:08.929
I can't stand being bored.

170
00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:20.079
My friend!

171
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.620
There's no one here. You can let go of me.

172
00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:39.329
The elder son said to leave him as being wanted.

173
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.099
The younger one suddenly appears and wants to be investigated.

174
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:45.740
Doing this way and that way, are you kidding me now?

175
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.069
I came here because you might be misunderstood.

176
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.010
It's not what you think, so prosecute him.

177
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.040
Gosh. In here, Gangsu scholarship students...

178
00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:57.380
There are so many Gangsu scholarship students here.

179
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.049
If you're not going to arrest all of them, we should work in cahoots.

180
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.559
Hyuk, that punk, is ignoring the chairman's order...

181
00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:07.020
and doing this on his own.

182
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.990
So the company has decided to withdraw from this case.

183
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.260
Are you sure?

184
00:11:12.729 --> 00:11:13.729
Okay.

185
00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:16.299
Since it has come to this, I'll take care of this by the rules.

186
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.199
Don't tell me to return what I've already received.

187
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.059
Je Hoon!

188
00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:52.799
You're the only one who will come for me.

189
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.370
What do you think you're doing?

190
00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:57.740
Did you see it? I looked awesome when I appeared before prosecution.

191
00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.179
What does June say?

192
00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:00.880
How can you say such a thing in this situation?

193
00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:02.750
I don't know.

194
00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:05.679
I don't want to keep hiding as I don't want June to see me like that.

195
00:12:05.849 --> 00:12:07.650
Avoiding responsibility with money,

196
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.719
"All mighty is the dollar", and so on.

197
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.219
It's embarrassing.

198
00:12:11.819 --> 00:12:15.429
A man should take responsibility for himself, that's what I thought.

199
00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:16.429
Do you have any measures?

200
00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:17.599
No, I don't.

201
00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:22.329
What shall I do, my friend?

202
00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:24.900
What else can you do?

203
00:12:25.569 --> 00:12:26.740
You should be investigated.

204
00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:31.209
Let's start now.

205
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.679
Sit down, please.

206
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.380
- Je Hoon, please. - Good luck.

207
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.780
Je Hoon, please.

208
00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:42.689
Don't leave me alone. I'm scared.

209
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.660
You should leave now.

210
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.229
No one is allowed here except for his lawyer.

211
00:12:49.229 --> 00:12:50.260
Did you hear that?

212
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.900
He says I should leave now.

213
00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.630
Je Hoon!

214
00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:04.410
Who are you?

215
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.010
You must be prosecutor Hwang Myoung Soo.

216
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.610
We're lawyers who are in charge of Byun Hyuk's defense.

217
00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:12.380
Lawyers?

218
00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:15.049
Who asked you to defend his case?

219
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.089
Chairman Byun Gang Su called our law firm himself.

220
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.360
My dad did that?

221
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.969
Come on.

222
00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:36.969
You tell me to take care of this by the rules and send five lawyers?

223
00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.049
What's going on here?

224
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.559
Chae Ri caused the tragedy that day.

225
00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:54.760
(Name: Byun Hyuk)

226
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.030
(Occupation: Jobless)

227
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.870
I was in shock because she stood me up.

228
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.770
So I had three glasses of whisky.

229
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.069
You said that earlier.

230
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:08.510
Did I say that I didn't eat anything that day?

231
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.939
It's not important.

232
00:14:09.939 --> 00:14:11.740
Why is it not important?

233
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.250
I'm telling you how dizzy I was that day.

234
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.049
It's important.

235
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.620
Go on.

236
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.150
Anyway, the moment I stood up, the plane hit severe turbulence.

237
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.990
I thought I should grab something to keep my balance while staggering.

238
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.559
And you grabbed the flight attendant's breasts?

239
00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.630
Exactly.

240
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.160
Then why did you hit the co-pilot who was trying to stop you?

241
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.459
That happened unfortunately while I was struggling not to fall down.

242
00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:36.270
That was the worst turbulence I had ever experienced.

243
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.839
It didn't seem like the turbulence was severe in the video clip.

244
00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:41.640
Your sexual harassment seemed very intentional too.

245
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.079
If you judge only by watching the video,

246
00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:46.179
it's very unfair and resentful for me.

247
00:14:46.939 --> 00:14:50.110
Do you have any witness who can testify for you?

248
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.620
I don't have a witness,

249
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.959
but I personally know that flight attendant.

250
00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.860
The flight attendant?

251
00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:01.959
The victim?

252
00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:03.160
She wasn't originally my acquaintance,

253
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.860
but we happened to run into each other again after that incident.

254
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.630
Anyway, after going through trouble,

255
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.370
I sincerely apologized,

256
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.400
and she accepted my apology too.

257
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.040
Are you saying you settled with her?

258
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.939
We did come to some kind of an agreement.

259
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.479
If you left a written agreement, this case might be extenuated.

260
00:15:22.479 --> 00:15:23.979
We did have a written agreement.

261
00:15:23.979 --> 00:15:25.920
But due to a misunderstanding,

262
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.589
she tore it to pieces.

263
00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:28.819
What do you mean, misunderstanding?

264
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.089
I happened to grab her breasts again.

265
00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:34.160
- Goodness. - Gosh!

266
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.390
So you're a habitual offender.

267
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.099
It's not that.

268
00:15:38.099 --> 00:15:39.829
Let me go.

269
00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:42.130
Actually, my dad...

270
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.270
told me to stay in hiding instead of confessing.

271
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.140
- Come on! - Goodness.

272
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.640
- No. - Gosh.

273
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.240
This is ridiculous.

274
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.339
You can't talk so recklessly in front of a prosecutor.

275
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.240
Will you make me press charges against Chairman Byun too?

276
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.010
From this moment on, he'll remain silent.

277
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.420
This will only make me a jerk.

278
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.120
I said I'd explain everything.

279
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.420
He told me not to confess and to hide somewhere.

280
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.189
- Goodness. - He told me to lay low.

281
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:04.689
Please be quiet.

282
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.229
What are you going to do now?

283
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.429
What do you mean?

284
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.170
There are so many people watching.

285
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.670
I have to at least act like I'm investigating this thoroughly.

286
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.339
You better explain things well...

287
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.339
to the chairman.

288
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.990
What did I do so wrong?

289
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.099
This is ridiculous.

290
00:16:46.599 --> 00:16:49.299
Goodness. What...

291
00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:50.640
You'll be questioned as a testifier?

292
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.040
I got a call from the prosecution just a while ago.

293
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.140
They want me to come tomorrow morning.

294
00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.910
What should I do?

295
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.049
I think I'm a bit scared, June.

296
00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:43.820
They want you to come for the investigation.

297
00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.279
What?

298
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.660
Okay.

299
00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:02.999
Yeon Hee.

300
00:19:05.969 --> 00:19:07.070
What brings you here?

301
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.509
I was told to come for a questioning as a testifier.

302
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.380
A testifier?

303
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.709
I'll testify what happened that day honestly.

304
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320
Bye.

305
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.850
Did the investigation on the victim end?

306
00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:52.120
What did she say?

307
00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:54.090
Did Yeon Hee say she'd sue me?

308
00:19:54.449 --> 00:19:55.789
Is this the end?

309
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.090
Do I...

310
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.920
need to be sent to prison now?

311
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:03.759
We'll have to see what Prosecutor Hwang will do,

312
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.699
but things might be solved more easily than we expected.

313
00:20:07.229 --> 00:20:08.300
How?

314
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.039
She testified that it was an accident...

315
00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.969
that happened due to the severe turbulence...

316
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.670
and that the video was filmed wrong.

317
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.209
Yeon Hee did?

318
00:20:18.439 --> 00:20:20.009
Did she really testify that?

319
00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:22.509
It's too soon to be relieved...

320
00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.279
until the airline announces its official position.

321
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.420
But you're free to go for today.

322
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.449
Awesome. Are you sure about this?

323
00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:30.860
Let's go.

324
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.219
The chairman is waiting.

325
00:20:32.219 --> 00:20:33.219
Wait.

326
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.390
Don't tell June...

327
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.900
that we hired five attorneys to defend me.

328
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.969
- What? - Tell her how much I struggled...

329
00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:44.140
to reveal the truth...

330
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.999
and that I participated...

331
00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:48.670
the investigation earnestly...

332
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.209
without fearing any punishment.

333
00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:52.380
Please tell her that.

334
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.810
I'm asking you.

335
00:20:57.979 --> 00:20:59.620
Did you really come here for June?

336
00:20:59.749 --> 00:21:01.650
To win her favor?

337
00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.449
I told you many times already. I did.

338
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.689
The company has become a total chaos because of you,

339
00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:09.360
and you did this reckless thing for a girl?

340
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.999
She isn't just a girl.

341
00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:12.360
She's June.

342
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.029
My life has changed after I met June.

343
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.509
- Did you admit to your charges? - Why are you free?

344
00:21:57.509 --> 00:21:59.779
How much did you talk about this with your father?

345
00:21:59.779 --> 00:22:02.310
- How do you feel now? - Please say a word.

346
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.610
Please say a word.

347
00:22:11.189 --> 00:22:12.189
June.

348
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.830
June.

349
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.429
June.

350
00:22:19.459 --> 00:22:20.469
June.

351
00:22:27.709 --> 00:22:28.709
June.

352
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.850
June. What?

353
00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:42.920
Who are you? Let me go.

354
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.429
Let me go. Let go!

355
00:22:47.429 --> 00:22:49.630
It's the chairman's order. Don't resist and come with us.

356
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:50.959
No, I'll go to June.

357
00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:53.729
June. Yes, you. June!

358
00:22:54.429 --> 00:22:55.429
June.

359
00:22:55.699 --> 00:22:57.170
Don't take photos. June!

360
00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.469
Don't take pictures!

361
00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.969
You saw me, right? June.

362
00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:06.110
June.

363
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.209
June.

364
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:11.880
June.

365
00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:14.550
June.

366
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.160
June.

367
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.759
Stop the car. June.

368
00:23:23.189 --> 00:23:26.660
June... June.

369
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.170
June.

370
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.439
What will happen to him now?

371
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.110
Things went well thanks to you.

372
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.110
If he gets dragged away like that,

373
00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:40.009
won't he get beaten up by his dad again?

374
00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:43.550
That's what he has to bear.

375
00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:46.380
That's the world which he's living in.

376
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.820
You're right.

377
00:23:50.959 --> 00:23:53.759
Hyuk's going back to where he originally belongs.

378
00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:55.759
Are you...

379
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.029
worrying about Hyuk?

380
00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.959
Why would I worry about a third-generation conglomerate?

381
00:23:59.959 --> 00:24:01.229
Then why are you here?

382
00:24:01.229 --> 00:24:02.529
- June! - Hi.

383
00:24:03.199 --> 00:24:04.999
- Let's go now. - Yes, let's go.

384
00:24:09.939 --> 00:24:12.779
Why would I worry about that punk? That's ridiculous.

385
00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:14.050
What? What happened?

386
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.110
It's nothing.

387
00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:17.850
- Was the questioning tiring? - It was terrible.

388
00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.979
Why did someone like you have to appear in my life?

389
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.610
Why did you have to step in my life and ruin everything?

390
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.150
Did I...

391
00:24:53.219 --> 00:24:54.289
ruin your life?

392
00:24:54.489 --> 00:24:55.689
Please,

393
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.920
go back to your world.

394
00:24:59.689 --> 00:25:01.759
Don't make others suffer because of you,

395
00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:03.560
and just get lost!

396
00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:29.620
I want to become a flower to you.

397
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.019
I want to become...

398
00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:35.160
and unforgettable gesture to you.

399
00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:45.100
June!

400
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.209
June! Stop the car! June!

401
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.610
June!

402
00:26:01.449 --> 00:26:04.390
Have a good life, third-generation conglomerate.

403
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.110
So you're saying that the second son of Gangsu Group...

404
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.749
Chairman Byun Gang Su's son, Byun Hyuk...

405
00:26:30.749 --> 00:26:32.679
Is that Byun guy...

406
00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:35.789
who carried bricks and gukbap with us?

407
00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:38.689
Have you gone blind due to shock?

408
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:41.689
You saw his face on the news!

409
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.029
That Byun guy who threw a brick at Chairman Min.

410
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.199
That Byun guy is him.

411
00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:49.170
What did he say about the dandelion seeds?

412
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:51.070
I can't believe it.

413
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.039
June, how could you?

414
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.380
I felt sorry that you work here at such a young age and treated well.

415
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.779
And you think you got us wrapped around your finger and deceive us?

416
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.850
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.249
That's enough. June wouldn't do such a thing with bad intentions.

418
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.719
I guess she had her own reasons.

419
00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:13.959
I think Ms. An didn't say anything wrong.

420
00:27:13.959 --> 00:27:17.259
If we had known that he had a rich dad who can have is back,

421
00:27:17.259 --> 00:27:19.160
we wouldn't have interfered...

422
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.570
even when he was dragged to the police. Don't you think so?

423
00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:23.469
Because we stood up for him,

424
00:27:23.499 --> 00:27:26.800
we got fired. Look at us now. What a state we are in!

425
00:27:28.709 --> 00:27:30.209
Nothing's going to happen if we stay here.

426
00:27:30.209 --> 00:27:32.610
We'd better visit Chairman Byun Gang Su!

427
00:27:35.179 --> 00:27:36.880
- What? - You know,

428
00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:39.350
we ended up like this trying to help his son.

429
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.289
He would compensate us for our damage.

430
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.219
Let's go. June, lead the way.

431
00:27:43.219 --> 00:27:45.489
Ki Seob, let's go and get compensation for damages. Go.

432
00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:47.729
Hurry. Let's go now! Hurry!

433
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.429
What can I do? I don't even know where he lives.

434
00:27:57.539 --> 00:28:01.239
Everyone in Korea knows where Chairman Byun Gang Su lives.

435
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.509
Let's go.

436
00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:07.410
Goodness.

437
00:28:09.709 --> 00:28:11.320
What shall I do?

438
00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:15.420
It hurts! Let me go! Gosh, seriously!

439
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.620
I said it hurts! Let go of me!

440
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:36.469
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:43.209 --> 00:28:44.519
You did a good job.

442
00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.920
- Pardon? - If you want to live that way,

443
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.120
go ahead.

444
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.090
Thank you for sending the lawyers.

445
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:56.830
I didn't do it to save you.

446
00:28:57.499 --> 00:28:59.160
I did it to protect the company.

447
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.100
Sure. The company comes first, Dad.

448
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:05.969
You'll be soon acquitted and not be indicted.

449
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.640
You can now live as you like.

450
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.610
Thank you, Dad.

451
00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:14.209
- You can leave. - Okay, then.

452
00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:23.249
Where are you going?

453
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.429
You told me to leave.

454
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.070
- I told you to go out. - Pardon?

455
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.140
If you have decided to live as you like, of your own will,

456
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:39.969
you should go out.

457
00:29:43.939 --> 00:29:45.539
I don't know what you mean...

458
00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.350
I guess you prepared for your end when you went against me.

459
00:29:49.949 --> 00:29:53.219
From now on, there won't be any support for you.

460
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.850
Let's see how long you can stand...

461
00:29:56.719 --> 00:29:59.160
without being Byun Gang Su's son. You can live as you like!

462
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.830
Dad, you're not kicking me out now, are you?

463
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.630
Yes, I am kicking you out.

464
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:06.830
Dad, still,

465
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.570
don't do this to me. I just came back from the prosecutor's office!

466
00:30:10.939 --> 00:30:12.039
You're right.

467
00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:14.610
I shouldn't kick you out like this.

468
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:18.239
Leave everything I gave you.

469
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.080
The clothes you're wearing, watch, shoes,

470
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.850
everything you have on!

471
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.219
- Everything! - What?

472
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.949
Take off everything from him!

473
00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:28.650
Everything!

474
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.650
- Yes! - Dad!

475
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.090
Let me go. Stop it!

476
00:30:32.189 --> 00:30:34.090
I'm watching you. Mom, help me!

477
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.489
Dad! Dad.

478
00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:36.959
Dad! This is not right.

479
00:30:36.959 --> 00:30:38.300
Dad, Dad!

480
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.199
Get out now!

481
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.580
Dad!

482
00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:58.679
Mom, this is not right.

483
00:30:58.749 --> 00:31:00.120
This is not right.

484
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.989
If anyone gives him even a piece of clothing,

485
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.489
I will kick that person out of my house!

486
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.070
Dad! Mom!

487
00:31:23.439 --> 00:31:24.739
This is not right!

488
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:32.779
This is...

489
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.830
Mom!

490
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.429
Help me, Mom! Help me!

491
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.130
This is a crime!

492
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.199
Master Byun.

493
00:31:52.469 --> 00:31:53.640
Where are you?

494
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.009
Mr. Kwon?

495
00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:01.249
- Master Byun. - Yes.

496
00:32:01.249 --> 00:32:02.749
- You should take this. - Okay.

497
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.390
This is the only thing I can do for you.

498
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:16.630
It's better than nothing. Thank you.

499
00:32:18.429 --> 00:32:19.560
By the way,

500
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.170
how long do I have to wait?

501
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.870
Shall I wait 5 minutes? Or 10 minutes?

502
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.709
Would my dad's anger melt away after that?

503
00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:30.979
- You mean after five minutes? - Yes.

504
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.739
If you don't get lost now,

505
00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:36.979
the chairman will shoot you with a crossbow.

506
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:43.890
Master Byun.

507
00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.789
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

508
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.620
On that day, just like that,

509
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.749
I was thrown out to the world that I didn't know.

510
00:33:17.959 --> 00:33:20.890
I thought it was like a trip I could come back shortly,

511
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.289
but I had no idea then.

512
00:33:24.459 --> 00:33:26.300
Once a matrix is broken,

513
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.400
you can never come back to it.

514
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.370
I cannot go back...

515
00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:35.370
to whom I was before I took the red pill.

516
00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:53.320
Hey.

517
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.390
Oh, my.

518
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.830
He's like a statue.

519
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.510
We've been circling this neighborhood.

520
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:11.639
Is this the right place?

521
00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.110
Wait a minute. This is accurate.

522
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.809
(Byun Hyuk's house)

523
00:34:16.809 --> 00:34:20.050
My vision is blurry these days. I don't know where it is.

524
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.550
That's right. The young person should lead us.

525
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.059
I'll go first.

526
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.599
This place is really nice.

527
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.729
Where does one house start and end?

528
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.099
Mr. Kim.

529
00:35:13.099 --> 00:35:14.139
- What's wrong? - Are you okay?

530
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.670
- Why? - What happened?

531
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.309
- What's wrong. - Hurry, over there.

532
00:35:18.309 --> 00:35:20.579
Hurry. He's there.

533
00:35:20.579 --> 00:35:22.880
You pervert.

534
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.880
That punk.

535
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.619
That pervert.

536
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.119
- Grab him. - He's running away.

537
00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:29.320
That's not what happened.

538
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.590
- Stop. - You jerk.

539
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.119
- Get him. - Stop, you punk.

540
00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:34.360
- Stop right there. - He's running away.

541
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.090
- Stop. - Don't follow me.

542
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.760
Stop.

543
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.159
Don't follow me.

544
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.570
- Don't come. - That's not what happened.

545
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.800
- Wait a minute. - Stop.

546
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.740
Don't come this way.

547
00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:47.639
Hey.

548
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:51.309
You punk.

549
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:52.880
- Stop right there. - Get him.

550
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.650
- You're in big trouble. - Stop.

551
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:55.650
I'm going to get you.

552
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.450
- Don't come here. - Stop.

553
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.849
You pervert.

554
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.990
- Get him. - Hey.

555
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.990
Follow him.

556
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.559
- He's stopping. - Oh, my.

557
00:36:06.559 --> 00:36:08.530
- Oh, my. - Get him.

558
00:36:10.459 --> 00:36:11.459
Gosh.

559
00:36:13.229 --> 00:36:15.970
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

560
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.409
I got you, you pervert.

561
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.880
Mr. Kim.

562
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.689
What?

563
00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.559
Byun?

564
00:36:37.689 --> 00:36:39.760
- Byun? - Byun?

565
00:36:46.784 --> 00:36:50.016
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E04 Revolutionary Love ""</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

566
00:36:57.429 --> 00:37:00.228
Goodness.

567
00:37:00.328 --> 00:37:02.069
Even so,

568
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:05.038
how could he throw you out naked?

569
00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:08.668
Are you adopted?

570
00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:13.308
Or is your dad not your biological parent?

571
00:37:14.009 --> 00:37:16.978
My family doesn't have any secrets regarding birth.

572
00:37:22.148 --> 00:37:23.859
I bought some clothes. Look.

573
00:37:24.389 --> 00:37:25.389
Thank you.

574
00:37:30.328 --> 00:37:31.598
June.

575
00:37:31.998 --> 00:37:33.828
Please try not to look...

576
00:37:35.029 --> 00:37:36.929
at me from the front.

577
00:37:39.398 --> 00:37:41.308
Okay.

578
00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:46.808
Why are you all here?

579
00:37:46.808 --> 00:37:49.609
We're here because of you and the chairman...

580
00:37:50.918 --> 00:37:51.918
Why?

581
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:58.089
We just happened to come here.

582
00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:00.558
It's no use now.

583
00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:05.958
No use?

584
00:38:08.398 --> 00:38:11.668
Let's go buy some clothes first.

585
00:38:11.668 --> 00:38:12.868
Let's do that.

586
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.219
Here.

587
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:29.589
Wear some underwear first.

588
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:30.659
Thank you.

589
00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:32.259
I also bought something for you.

590
00:38:32.259 --> 00:38:34.089
It won't fit me.

591
00:38:34.558 --> 00:38:36.489
- Give it to your mother. - That's useless.

592
00:38:36.489 --> 00:38:37.529
It's over there.

593
00:38:37.529 --> 00:38:39.328
- Pick, they're 5 and 10 dollars. - There is a lot here.

594
00:38:39.328 --> 00:38:42.168
There's one for everyone.

595
00:38:42.168 --> 00:38:43.429
- Pick something. - How about this one?

596
00:38:44.438 --> 00:38:46.199
What about this one?

597
00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:48.708
This pattern doesn't fit my fashion philosophy.

598
00:38:48.708 --> 00:38:51.379
Don't you have anything more intelligent and elegant?

599
00:38:51.379 --> 00:38:52.538
What about this one?

600
00:38:53.379 --> 00:38:56.208
No, I want something trendier with monochromatic check...

601
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:57.879
and a sportier design.

602
00:38:57.879 --> 00:38:59.248
- What is he talking about? - What is he talking about?

603
00:38:59.248 --> 00:39:01.449
You're not in the position to choose.

604
00:39:01.449 --> 00:39:02.848
He's really picky.

605
00:39:02.848 --> 00:39:04.859
If you really want something else, come inside then.

606
00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:06.089
There are a lot of elegant clothes inside.

607
00:39:06.089 --> 00:39:07.429
- Come inside. - Really?

608
00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:10.998
What's wrong with these?

609
00:39:24.478 --> 00:39:27.379
How is it? Isn't this cool?

610
00:39:27.379 --> 00:39:29.578
Is this monochromatic...

611
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.118
and sporty?

612
00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:34.719
Is this the intelligent fashion trend of 2017 for goalkeepers?

613
00:39:34.719 --> 00:39:37.259
As long as you're happy.

614
00:39:37.259 --> 00:39:39.558
This suits my taste perfectly.

615
00:39:46.098 --> 00:39:47.328
Gosh.

616
00:39:50.799 --> 00:39:53.808
June knows fashion.

617
00:39:54.009 --> 00:39:56.409
I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

618
00:39:56.768 --> 00:39:58.609
Do you want to? What should we eat?

619
00:39:58.609 --> 00:40:02.109
Me. I want to eat that.

620
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:03.109
That.

621
00:40:11.058 --> 00:40:13.458
It feels like this sweet and mysterious taste will even warm...

622
00:40:13.859 --> 00:40:15.328
the bottom of my soul.

623
00:40:15.889 --> 00:40:19.598
You're exaggerating about a six dollar gukbap. Just eat.

624
00:40:19.598 --> 00:40:21.398
- Let's eat. - Let's eat.

625
00:40:21.529 --> 00:40:23.969
Wait a minute.

626
00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:25.098
Where were you?

627
00:40:25.098 --> 00:40:26.139
I can't believe this.

628
00:40:28.538 --> 00:40:30.578
Here. Eat this first.

629
00:40:31.978 --> 00:40:33.578
You need to eat this first...

630
00:40:33.578 --> 00:40:35.208
when you come back from places like that.

631
00:40:35.208 --> 00:40:37.478
We're giving this to you to become a new person.

632
00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:38.978
Be careful when you eat this,

633
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:41.018
and never go to places like that.

634
00:40:45.958 --> 00:40:47.288
Why aren't you eating?

635
00:40:52.029 --> 00:40:53.129
I didn't intend to,

636
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:55.469
but I hid my identity...

637
00:40:56.429 --> 00:40:57.799
and caused trouble.

638
00:41:03.879 --> 00:41:04.978
I'm happy.

639
00:41:07.248 --> 00:41:09.578
You're so funny.

640
00:41:09.578 --> 00:41:10.679
Let me feed you.

641
00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:13.918
Here.

642
00:41:36.609 --> 00:41:38.208
I'm here because the chairman summoned me.

643
00:41:39.308 --> 00:41:42.909
- He kicked out Hyuk a minute ago. - What?

644
00:41:42.909 --> 00:41:46.179
Hyuk was kicked out stark naked.

645
00:41:46.648 --> 00:41:48.219
The atmosphere is pretty serious.

646
00:41:48.688 --> 00:41:49.848
So do...

647
00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:52.018
whatever he wants you to do.

648
00:41:52.089 --> 00:41:54.629
Do you understand?

649
00:42:12.978 --> 00:42:16.179
Stop that.

650
00:42:16.679 --> 00:42:18.118
Did the world end?

651
00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:22.089
How could you do this?

652
00:42:22.918 --> 00:42:24.688
Do you want him to starve...

653
00:42:24.688 --> 00:42:27.558
when he doesn't have any money?

654
00:42:28.529 --> 00:42:30.629
You're so ignorant. How could you kick out...

655
00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:33.259
your fully grown son stark naked?

656
00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:35.268
My poor child.

657
00:42:35.969 --> 00:42:38.438
Where did he go?

658
00:42:38.898 --> 00:42:40.469
You wanted me to help him.

659
00:42:44.808 --> 00:42:46.779
What are you talking about?

660
00:42:48.279 --> 00:42:50.418
He'll fly if he has wings.

661
00:42:53.049 --> 00:42:54.788
I don't think he's a phoenix,

662
00:42:55.018 --> 00:42:57.659
but to know whether he's an eaglet or a chick,

663
00:42:58.389 --> 00:42:59.819
we must throw him down first.

664
00:43:00.929 --> 00:43:03.058
Mr. Chairman. You have a visitor.

665
00:43:03.188 --> 00:43:04.328
Don't you agree?

666
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:10.998
Does he have something in mind?

667
00:43:15.339 --> 00:43:18.078
Can you think of any place...

668
00:43:18.879 --> 00:43:20.179
that Hyuk might have headed?

669
00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:23.978
No, I'll find out as soon as I leave you.

670
00:43:24.248 --> 00:43:26.879
Track down his whereabouts and report to me regularly...

671
00:43:27.018 --> 00:43:28.389
from now on.

672
00:43:30.688 --> 00:43:32.259
I don't know what you mean.

673
00:43:32.989 --> 00:43:34.788
Stay near him.

674
00:43:34.788 --> 00:43:37.958
Find out what he's up to and what he thinks about.

675
00:43:38.629 --> 00:43:40.359
Then report to me in detail.

676
00:43:42.199 --> 00:43:44.168
What does he have in mind?

677
00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:47.768
He must want this matter...

678
00:43:48.469 --> 00:43:50.438
to slip as quiet as possible.

679
00:43:50.438 --> 00:43:52.779
If he wanted that,

680
00:43:53.478 --> 00:43:55.348
he would've made Hyuk a scapegoat.

681
00:43:57.248 --> 00:43:59.748
Why did he have to protect Hyuk...

682
00:44:00.379 --> 00:44:02.219
risking the criticism of the public?

683
00:44:02.219 --> 00:44:03.719
Of course, there are critical opinions,

684
00:44:04.558 --> 00:44:06.558
but the victim stepped out to explain the situation.

685
00:44:07.018 --> 00:44:08.828
So I guess the public won't be so critical about this anymore.

686
00:44:14.328 --> 00:44:16.199
People don't want the truth.

687
00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:19.898
They want a bad person to be punished.

688
00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:23.879
So whether he's really bad or not isn't important.

689
00:44:25.078 --> 00:44:26.409
What I want to know is...

690
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:30.779
the reason why he chose to protect Hyuk instead of the company.

691
00:44:31.478 --> 00:44:32.949
What's his plan?

692
00:44:34.949 --> 00:44:37.989
Are you telling me to watch him by any chance?

693
00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:41.589
I just want to know about him.

694
00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:44.529
So report to me directly regarding his issues...

695
00:44:44.728 --> 00:44:46.029
from now on.

696
00:44:50.368 --> 00:44:51.668
You'll report to me first...

697
00:44:52.668 --> 00:44:54.038
before you do to my dad, right?

698
00:44:55.808 --> 00:44:58.509
Don't pass through anyone, and report directly to me.

699
00:45:00.379 --> 00:45:03.248
Let's filter what to report to him.

700
00:45:07.348 --> 00:45:08.648
Yes, sir.

701
00:45:10.719 --> 00:45:12.958
Be careful not to cause any commotion.

702
00:45:15.529 --> 00:45:16.859
Yes, sir.

703
00:45:43.319 --> 00:45:44.389
June.

704
00:45:44.389 --> 00:45:47.929
How was I today? I looked great on TV, right?

705
00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:51.958
"Byun Hyuk stepped confidently in the prosecutors' office..."

706
00:45:52.429 --> 00:45:54.069
"to reveal the truth."

707
00:45:54.199 --> 00:45:55.398
Wasn't I cool?

708
00:45:55.398 --> 00:45:56.929
Did you confess to look cool?

709
00:45:57.498 --> 00:45:58.639
I did.

710
00:45:58.639 --> 00:46:01.409
You went there because you did wrong. It's only natural.

711
00:46:01.409 --> 00:46:04.379
Many people can't do what's natural.

712
00:46:04.639 --> 00:46:05.978
Can't you trust my sincerity?

713
00:46:06.078 --> 00:46:07.879
I'm not the old Byun Hyuk anymore.

714
00:46:07.879 --> 00:46:09.078
I've changed.

715
00:46:09.078 --> 00:46:11.618
So what does it have to do with me?

716
00:46:11.618 --> 00:46:13.148
What do you mean?

717
00:46:13.148 --> 00:46:15.449
Didn't you read my letter?

718
00:46:17.159 --> 00:46:20.989
"I hope that you will speak my name, one right for my color and perfume."

719
00:46:21.228 --> 00:46:22.589
"I long to go to..."

720
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:23.629
That's enough.

721
00:46:24.228 --> 00:46:26.328
I need to go work part-time, so go home alone.

722
00:46:36.208 --> 00:46:37.978
What?

723
00:46:39.478 --> 00:46:41.379
I don't know how you'll take this,

724
00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:49.489
but I don't have a transportation fee.

725
00:47:03.629 --> 00:47:04.639
Here.

726
00:47:11.509 --> 00:47:12.808
It must be hard to work.

727
00:47:16.679 --> 00:47:18.518
Stay low for them when it's windy,

728
00:47:19.248 --> 00:47:20.719
and get rained for them when it's rainy.

729
00:47:22.219 --> 00:47:24.418
In order not to bother those who are up high,

730
00:47:24.819 --> 00:47:26.418
that's the safest.

731
00:47:36.529 --> 00:47:37.998
I picked him up wandering around on a street.

732
00:47:38.368 --> 00:47:40.768
I sent him to your house, so take care of him yourself.

733
00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:47.779
Why this...

734
00:47:50.949 --> 00:47:52.279
I need to go now.

735
00:47:56.489 --> 00:47:57.819
Behave well.

736
00:47:58.389 --> 00:48:01.029
Dad, I'll deal with it myself.

737
00:48:01.458 --> 00:48:02.529
Okay.

738
00:48:49.168 --> 00:48:50.478
I'm back...

739
00:48:50.779 --> 00:48:53.379
to my longing paradise.

740
00:48:55.879 --> 00:48:57.779
When will June come back?

741
00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:05.058
What a peculiar taste of yours.

742
00:49:10.089 --> 00:49:12.699
Where on earth did you buy those clothes?

743
00:49:16.469 --> 00:49:18.268
Where I got them isn't important.

744
00:49:18.969 --> 00:49:20.909
They look expensive on me.

745
00:49:26.409 --> 00:49:27.949
Thank you for what you did earlier.

746
00:49:29.708 --> 00:49:31.449
I didn't do it for you.

747
00:49:31.748 --> 00:49:33.518
I only told the truth.

748
00:49:33.848 --> 00:49:35.489
Right?

749
00:49:35.489 --> 00:49:37.058
There was severe turbulence at that time.

750
00:49:37.058 --> 00:49:40.889
Still, it's a fact that I was sexually harassed.

751
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:43.728
You're right.

752
00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:45.629
That's a fact.

753
00:49:46.958 --> 00:49:48.098
But...

754
00:49:48.469 --> 00:49:52.799
I didn't think it was that horrible for you to be criticized like that.

755
00:49:53.839 --> 00:49:55.668
And June advised me on that too.

756
00:49:58.879 --> 00:50:00.078
June?

757
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:02.348
Did she say something to you?

758
00:50:02.679 --> 00:50:04.319
Whether you choose to testify or not,

759
00:50:04.578 --> 00:50:05.848
it's up to you.

760
00:50:06.848 --> 00:50:09.688
But shouldn't you go say it honestly...

761
00:50:09.918 --> 00:50:12.018
about why it happened that day?

762
00:50:18.299 --> 00:50:19.529
June said that to you?

763
00:50:21.129 --> 00:50:22.368
For me?

764
00:50:23.368 --> 00:50:24.639
For me?

765
00:50:25.398 --> 00:50:27.538
What I was really displeased with was...

766
00:50:27.938 --> 00:50:29.639
your rude attitude.

767
00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:32.779
You tried to settle it with money instead of apologizing sincerely.

768
00:50:33.879 --> 00:50:36.748
What else did she say?

769
00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:39.118
Didn't she have any other worries about me?

770
00:50:39.348 --> 00:50:40.688
Please.

771
00:50:41.049 --> 00:50:43.648
Tell me even the slightest thing...

772
00:50:43.759 --> 00:50:45.558
that you remember.

773
00:50:47.389 --> 00:50:49.188
Are you seriously not a pervert?

774
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:50.629
What?

775
00:51:01.339 --> 00:51:02.909
No, you're mistaken.

776
00:51:03.368 --> 00:51:06.279
I don't know why this keeps happening,

777
00:51:08.078 --> 00:51:10.148
but I'm truly sorry. This is just another misunderstanding.

778
00:51:10.148 --> 00:51:12.618
Please don't tell June about this.

779
00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:15.449
Gosh, why this...

780
00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:20.629
Oh, gosh.

781
00:51:21.389 --> 00:51:22.688
Hello, ma'am.

782
00:51:23.529 --> 00:51:24.598
Ma'am?

783
00:51:30.898 --> 00:51:32.639
Whose mom is she?

784
00:51:32.969 --> 00:51:34.768
Of course, she's June's mom.

785
00:51:34.938 --> 00:51:36.368
I see.

786
00:51:36.938 --> 00:51:38.308
Did she run out of money again?

787
00:51:38.308 --> 00:51:39.339
Money?

788
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:42.409
She snatches money from June whenever she saves some.

789
00:51:42.409 --> 00:51:43.918
Then she comes and snatches again.

790
00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:48.389
I mean, why would she take away money from her child?

791
00:51:48.389 --> 00:51:50.248
Exactly.

792
00:51:53.219 --> 00:51:55.359
Don't tell June that I told this to you.

793
00:51:55.359 --> 00:51:57.299
Let's keep my mistake and yours in secret together.

794
00:51:57.299 --> 00:51:58.699
- Deal. - Deal.

795
00:52:06.168 --> 00:52:07.739
She took away money from June?

796
00:52:21.288 --> 00:52:23.759
(June's Chauffeur Service)

797
00:52:32.598 --> 00:52:33.659
Hey.

798
00:52:34.969 --> 00:52:37.969
Who told you to stick this trash in here?

799
00:52:37.969 --> 00:52:39.538
Gosh, it's so annoying.

800
00:52:39.768 --> 00:52:40.938
I'm sorry.

801
00:52:41.268 --> 00:52:42.409
I'm sorry, sir.

802
00:52:42.509 --> 00:52:44.409
- Move. - I'm sorry.

803
00:52:44.739 --> 00:52:46.909
Don't do things to be sorry about in the first place.

804
00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:13.909
June, your mom's here.

805
00:53:53.609 --> 00:53:55.179
You're late.

806
00:54:00.248 --> 00:54:01.319
(Seasoned bean sprouts)

807
00:54:02.489 --> 00:54:03.889
(Kimchi)

808
00:54:04.058 --> 00:54:06.389
You should've called me if you ran out of side dishes.

809
00:54:06.389 --> 00:54:07.759
Your fridge had nothing...

810
00:54:07.759 --> 00:54:09.159
but instant food.

811
00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:11.259
I told you I can't give you that money.

812
00:54:12.998 --> 00:54:14.668
I didn't come here for money.

813
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:16.368
I came here to see your face.

814
00:54:19.038 --> 00:54:20.808
Why are you doing this to me?

815
00:54:20.969 --> 00:54:22.609
It's not like you left me money.

816
00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:24.909
It's not like I borrowed money from you either.

817
00:54:25.078 --> 00:54:27.279
Why do you visit me and ask for money all the time?

818
00:54:29.148 --> 00:54:31.918
Have dinner. I made your favorite potato soup.

819
00:54:31.978 --> 00:54:35.848
It's driving me crazy whenever you do this.

820
00:54:35.848 --> 00:54:36.848
Do you know that?

821
00:54:37.118 --> 00:54:39.819
I never asked for your help in school.

822
00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:41.359
Even after I graduated high school,

823
00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:43.429
I did everything on my own.

824
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:45.958
What did you do for me that you're being like this?

825
00:54:45.958 --> 00:54:48.898
Why do you always appear shamelessly...

826
00:54:48.898 --> 00:54:50.938
and ask me for money?

827
00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:54.109
I know too well that it's too much for me...

828
00:54:54.139 --> 00:54:56.168
to wish for a parent whom I can rely on.

829
00:54:57.239 --> 00:55:01.308
So please, don't wish for anything from me.

830
00:55:02.909 --> 00:55:05.418
Please stop it now.

831
00:55:07.648 --> 00:55:08.788
Have dinner.

832
00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:12.458
Let's eat first. I'm hungry too.

833
00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:33.239
I'm sorry.

834
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:37.148
It's because I'm incompetent.

835
00:55:43.248 --> 00:55:44.288
I...

836
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:50.699
I don't have 10,000 dollars.

837
00:55:52.529 --> 00:55:54.398
Okay, I get it.

838
00:55:54.668 --> 00:55:56.469
So eat first.

839
00:56:07.671 --> 00:56:08.840
Here.

840
00:56:33.909 --> 00:56:34.909
What are you doing here?

841
00:56:39.698 --> 00:56:40.738
Sit.

842
00:56:43.338 --> 00:56:44.468
Why were you there?

843
00:56:44.608 --> 00:56:46.909
Why do you keep sneaking around in front of June's house?

844
00:56:48.378 --> 00:56:49.639
Please give me a moment.

845
00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:01.689
Je Hoon, do you have 10,000 dollars by any chance?

846
00:57:04.358 --> 00:57:07.459
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

847
00:57:10.823 --> 00:57:12.553
You know... Actually...

848
00:57:14.724 --> 00:57:16.323
June's mom came to see her.

849
00:57:17.693 --> 00:57:20.604
June is crying now.

850
00:57:21.534 --> 00:57:23.733
Not because of a million or 100,000 dollars.

851
00:57:23.733 --> 00:57:25.303
Because of mere 10,000 dollars.

852
00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:28.443
You...

853
00:57:29.303 --> 00:57:30.914
You think you're in position to worry about her...

854
00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:32.374
when you got kicked out of your house empty-handed?

855
00:57:32.374 --> 00:57:35.144
No, it's not time to worry about myself.

856
00:57:35.144 --> 00:57:38.014
I'm sure my mom will persuade my dad in about 2 to 3 days,

857
00:57:38.014 --> 00:57:39.653
and my dad won't be angry anymore.

858
00:57:39.814 --> 00:57:40.883
Then...

859
00:57:41.483 --> 00:57:42.784
I'll naturally return to my house.

860
00:57:42.784 --> 00:57:43.784
No,

861
00:57:44.023 --> 00:57:45.553
that's too short of a time.

862
00:57:47.023 --> 00:57:48.023
Five days?

863
00:57:48.363 --> 00:57:49.664
A week, perhaps?

864
00:57:49.664 --> 00:57:52.093
You can't even support yourself, and you think 10,000 dollars is mere?

865
00:57:52.934 --> 00:57:54.363
Don't make me laugh.

866
00:57:55.233 --> 00:57:57.733
June is crying now.

867
00:57:57.903 --> 00:57:59.133
Can't you do something?

868
00:58:01.573 --> 00:58:04.544
If you're that worried, find out a way yourself.

869
00:58:06.573 --> 00:58:09.814
What a cold-hearted punk.

870
00:58:11.053 --> 00:58:13.483
I mean, June is crying.

871
00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.334
(Savings Account)

872
00:59:12.573 --> 00:59:14.544
(3,150 dollars)

873
01:00:07.193 --> 01:00:10.803
Mom, how can you not have 10,000 dollars?

874
01:00:10.803 --> 01:00:13.403
Come on. I really need that money.

875
01:00:13.604 --> 01:00:15.204
I need it right now.

876
01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:18.573
It's your dad's order not to give you even a penny.

877
01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.443
Mom.

878
01:00:21.644 --> 01:00:23.414
You think he closed only your account?

879
01:00:23.414 --> 01:00:25.983
My account is closed too for the time being.

880
01:00:26.084 --> 01:00:28.253
He changed the passwords of his vaults.

881
01:00:28.253 --> 01:00:31.593
He said he'll check every single detail of my credit card usage.

882
01:00:32.294 --> 01:00:35.093
If you don't want me to get divorced,

883
01:00:35.624 --> 01:00:36.994
hang up.

884
01:00:37.894 --> 01:00:39.164
Goodness.

885
01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:54.314
Se Na, it's me. Can you send me 10,000 dollars?

886
01:00:55.244 --> 01:00:57.044
You heard everything from Mom just now.

887
01:00:57.213 --> 01:00:58.854
Can't you realize the situation?

888
01:00:58.954 --> 01:01:00.483
Dad said he'll kick me out too...

889
01:01:00.483 --> 01:01:02.653
if I give you at least a penny.

890
01:01:02.983 --> 01:01:05.653
If you don't want to see Mom get divorced and me get kicked out,

891
01:01:05.653 --> 01:01:07.823
come to your senses, please.

892
01:01:16.564 --> 01:01:18.403
Is this real?

893
01:01:19.273 --> 01:01:20.273
Well?

894
01:01:23.503 --> 01:01:24.914
What's so great about mere 10,000 dollars...

895
01:01:25.613 --> 01:01:27.584
that you're all being like this?

896
01:01:28.843 --> 01:01:31.014
It may be mere 10,000 dollars for you,

897
01:01:31.383 --> 01:01:35.053
but for some people, it takes longer than a year to save that much.

898
01:01:37.523 --> 01:01:38.954
Do you really not have 10,000 dollars?

899
01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:44.794
I barely managed to get your phone.

900
01:01:45.233 --> 01:01:46.863
Consider yourself lucky.

901
01:01:57.573 --> 01:01:59.443
He's so cold-hearted.

902
01:02:02.244 --> 01:02:03.284
(Hong Chae Ri)

903
01:02:03.713 --> 01:02:07.753
Hyuk, I saw the news. You're so photogenic.

904
01:02:07.954 --> 01:02:09.854
Why is she bothering me again?

905
01:02:23.633 --> 01:02:26.233
Hyuk.

906
01:02:27.003 --> 01:02:28.803
Hyuk, it's me.

907
01:02:30.974 --> 01:02:34.383
Why is your face so drawn?

908
01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:37.613
Do you know how worried I was when I lost contact with you?

909
01:02:38.113 --> 01:02:39.284
Yes.

910
01:02:41.184 --> 01:02:43.784
Let's make this short. Can I ask you a favor?

911
01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:45.423
Tell me.

912
01:02:45.523 --> 01:02:46.894
Can you lend me 10,000 dollars?

913
01:02:51.133 --> 01:02:54.633
I need it urgently. Lend me 10,000 dollars.

914
01:02:55.164 --> 01:02:57.773
I know you're mad at me,

915
01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.303
but that day was a misunderstanding.

916
01:02:59.303 --> 01:03:00.644
I forgot about that day.

917
01:03:00.773 --> 01:03:03.704
I don't have anything to be mad at you. Just lend me 10,000 dollars.

918
01:03:04.744 --> 01:03:06.073
Wait a minute.

919
01:03:06.673 --> 01:03:08.613
Even if you're mad at me,

920
01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:11.213
how could you ask me to break up with you this dirtily?

921
01:03:11.213 --> 01:03:12.613
What are you talking about?

922
01:03:13.014 --> 01:03:14.854
We already broke up.

923
01:03:14.854 --> 01:03:17.153
When? When did we break up?

924
01:03:17.153 --> 01:03:19.053
I never broke up with you.

925
01:03:20.394 --> 01:03:21.463
Chae Ri.

926
01:03:21.963 --> 01:03:23.093
Chae Ri!

927
01:03:23.093 --> 01:03:26.334
Even if this situation happened, you can't behave like this.

928
01:03:26.593 --> 01:03:28.264
I'm friends with Sung Kyu.

929
01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:32.374
Does he know that you're behaving like this?

930
01:03:33.104 --> 01:03:35.803
Nothing happened between us.

931
01:03:35.803 --> 01:03:37.943
What happened that day was a misunderstanding.

932
01:03:38.974 --> 01:03:41.883
Didn't I buy you that bag?

933
01:03:43.784 --> 01:03:45.814
I remember that being over 10,000 dollars.

934
01:03:46.084 --> 01:03:48.883
If you don't want to lend me money, just give that bag back to me.

935
01:03:56.394 --> 01:03:57.693
You're crazy.

936
01:03:58.894 --> 01:04:01.704
You're not in a good condition right now.

937
01:04:01.863 --> 01:04:03.564
Call me when you're not mad at me anymore.

938
01:04:03.564 --> 01:04:05.573
You can't behave like this just because you're mad at me.

939
01:04:16.584 --> 01:04:17.854
I was so close.

940
01:04:47.644 --> 01:04:48.744
Did I do a good job?

941
01:04:54.253 --> 01:04:55.553
(Monthly payment of 150 dollars)

942
01:04:55.553 --> 01:04:57.693
Do you want to cancel when it will mature next month?

943
01:04:57.923 --> 01:05:01.124
If you cancel, you'll receive low interest and it will be a loss.

944
01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:03.934
It's not a lot of money anyway.

945
01:05:04.733 --> 01:05:06.264
- Just cancel it for me. - Okay.

946
01:05:19.014 --> 01:05:20.044
Woo Sung.

947
01:05:25.483 --> 01:05:26.483
Hyuk.

948
01:05:28.153 --> 01:05:30.523
- Are you okay? - It's not that bad.

949
01:05:31.253 --> 01:05:33.253
I had an appointment for lunch,

950
01:05:33.894 --> 01:05:35.264
but I'll cancel. Let's have lunch.

951
01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.923
It's okay. You don't have to buy me lunch.

952
01:05:37.093 --> 01:05:39.894
I actually have a favor to ask.

953
01:05:44.303 --> 01:05:45.803
Can you give me 10,000 dollars?

954
01:05:52.273 --> 01:05:54.584
I only have 3 dollars. Can you give me 10?

955
01:05:55.314 --> 01:05:56.744
I'm going to give it to my mom.

956
01:05:57.514 --> 01:05:59.854
- Okay. - Thank you.

957
01:06:00.113 --> 01:06:01.584
- Here. - Here's the money.

958
01:06:01.854 --> 01:06:04.354
- Thanks. I hope the best for you. - Visit us again.

959
01:06:09.064 --> 01:06:11.994
Actually, I started having feelings for a girl.

960
01:06:13.193 --> 01:06:14.664
I'm back.

961
01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:21.643
That girl is crying because of 10,000 dollars. It's not even a lot.

962
01:06:21.973 --> 01:06:23.304
That's not even a lot of money.

963
01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.714
The only thing I can do for her,

964
01:06:25.813 --> 01:06:27.313
is give her money.

965
01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:30.313
I don't want to see her cry.

966
01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:32.454
Can you give me that money?

967
01:06:36.624 --> 01:06:38.323
Make sure you eat well.

968
01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:41.964
I received the money safely from the guy who lives downstairs.

969
01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.094
Thank you, I'll use it well.

970
01:06:54.704 --> 01:06:55.744
(Mom)

971
01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:05.153
Pick it up.

972
01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:07.424
Mom, pick it up.

973
01:07:13.624 --> 01:07:15.223
(My Daughter)

974
01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:17.393
Please pick it up.

975
01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:20.393
Just pick it up.

976
01:07:20.393 --> 01:07:21.563
The receiver cannot pick up your call.

977
01:07:41.653 --> 01:07:42.754
What's wrong?

978
01:07:44.954 --> 01:07:47.193
June. Why are you here?

979
01:07:55.763 --> 01:07:57.903
June, what's wrong?

980
01:07:58.473 --> 01:07:59.874
Do you think I'm a joke?

981
01:08:00.504 --> 01:08:02.244
Won't you take me seriously?

982
01:08:04.273 --> 01:08:05.943
You want to become a new person?

983
01:08:06.143 --> 01:08:07.744
You want me to trust you since you changed?

984
01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:09.214
That's ridiculous.

985
01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:10.853
You didn't change at all.

986
01:08:10.954 --> 01:08:12.784
You're just an annoying and frustrating...

987
01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:14.723
third-generation conglomerate to the bone.

988
01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:22.823
She's crying.

989
01:08:24.363 --> 01:08:26.494
I don't want to see her cry anymore.

990
01:08:27.933 --> 01:08:30.403
I just want to see her smile.

991
01:08:32.204 --> 01:08:33.804
What went wrong?

992
01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:37.214
Don't you ever appear...

993
01:08:37.914 --> 01:08:39.414
in front of me again.

994
01:08:46.584 --> 01:08:49.084
What should I do now?

995
01:09:14.613 --> 01:09:18.183
(Revolutionary Love)

996
01:09:18.284 --> 01:09:20.384
How is Hyuk these days?

997
01:09:20.384 --> 01:09:22.323
You all saw me getting kicked out stark naked.

998
01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:24.594
I need money. I need to earn money.

999
01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:25.794
- I approve. - I also approve.

1000
01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:28.223
- Me too. - What? Hyuk's at the company?

1001
01:09:28.223 --> 01:09:30.094
- This isn't right. - He likes you.

1002
01:09:30.094 --> 01:09:31.233
What do you mean?

1003
01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.634
Do you even clean now?

1004
01:09:32.634 --> 01:09:34.863
Why are you choosing to do hard work?

1005
01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:37.233
How will I repay all that money?

1006
01:09:37.233 --> 01:09:39.004
I want to buy this. How can I do that?

1007
01:09:39.004 --> 01:09:41.103
He's going after a girl. He hasn't come back to his senses yet.

1008
01:09:41.103 --> 01:09:42.204
Is he dating someone knew?

1009
01:09:42.204 --> 01:09:44.113
You punk, what are you doing here?

1010
01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.513
Get him!
