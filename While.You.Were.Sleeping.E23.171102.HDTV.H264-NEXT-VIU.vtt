00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.745
(Episode 23)

2
00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:11.245
The dead brain patient will barely survive a week and die soon.

3
00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.775
Then proceed with the autopsy and deal with it afterwards.

4
00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:15.245
Sir.

5
00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:16.945
Can I proceed with the organ transplant...

6
00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:18.415
and autopsy at the same time?

7
00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:20.455
Unbelievable.

8
00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.195
Unbelievable. Prosecutor Jung's brain-dead patient...

9
00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:28.394
will proceed with both organ transplant and autopsy together.

10
00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.825
It's too reckless.

11
00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.864
It's literally a rare case.

12
00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.965
That rare case is very similar to this case.

13
00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:39.075
All the victims from this case are injured at the brain area, not organs.

14
00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:41.175
According to the result, we found blood near the neck.

15
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.715
Without autopsy on the organs, we can conduct it on the neck and brain...

16
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:46.474
to unveil the cause of death.

17
00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.084
(So what did he say?)

18
00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.444
He said he'll reveal the truth by all means.

19
00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:50.985
What's wrong with Prosecutor Jung?

20
00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.754
How can he be so confident?

21
00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:55.825
He has nobody to back up.

22
00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:57.325
What?

23
00:00:57.455 --> 00:00:59.394
Don't you know Prosecutor Jung?

24
00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.325
His role model is a mayfly.

25
00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:05.965
His style is to start on something without thinking of the next move.

26
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.235
But it's too much this time.

27
00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:10.164
I'm sure...

28
00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:13.735
he must be somewhere pulling his hair regretting his words.

29
00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:21.045
My darn mouth! My mouth is making my body go through pains.

30
00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:23.584
This mouth!

31
00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.054
Why did I say such things when I don't even have plans?

32
00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.254
I didn't win the lottery this time. What do I do now?

33
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.725
Who must be calling me now? I'm not in the mood for talking.

34
00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:35.964
(Little Pup)

35
00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:40.705
Hello? What's going on?

36
00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:43.304
I'm curious about your choice.

37
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:45.934
I made the same choice as yours.

38
00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.205
That was a touch choice. Are you sure about that?

39
00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.644
Of course! That's why I made up my mind on that.

40
00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:52.814
I can't believe it.

41
00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:57.084
Aren't you somewhere alone pulling your hair?

42
00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:03.485
You saw this in your dream, right?

43
00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:11.394
No, I followed your phone ringing.

44
00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:12.564
Hong Joo.

45
00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:15.005
Rat! There's a rat!

46
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.705
Goodness! Where?

47
00:02:20.904 --> 00:02:22.945
I mean, I have a cramp in my leg.

48
00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.274
Oh, you mean that.

49
00:02:35.584 --> 00:02:37.755
- You're not confident in this? - No.

50
00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:40.665
It's feels like I just learned to walk, but now I need to run.

51
00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:43.564
And it's like a slow turtle has to catch two fast rabbits.

52
00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:46.665
Goodness.

53
00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.035
Don't worry.

54
00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:54.374
You'll suffer because you're slow.

55
00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:55.904
But you'll catch both nonetheless.

56
00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:57.445
What?

57
00:02:57.874 --> 00:02:58.915
I dreamed about this.

58
00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:00.945
The organ transplant will be done well.

59
00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:03.885
You will win in the trial, making the convict to go to jail.

60
00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:05.654
- Really? - Of course.

61
00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:08.024
After catching the two rabbits,

62
00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:09.955
we'll go see the sea.

63
00:03:10.084 --> 00:03:11.524
That sea near that bus stop.

64
00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:14.094
What a relief.

65
00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:16.964
Why are you telling me about the dream now?

66
00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:19.165
I didn't want you to be careless.

67
00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:21.934
Don't worry, I won't be.

68
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:24.535
Go to work now.

69
00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:26.475
Okay.

70
00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:34.445
I forgot something.

71
00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.114
Goodness.

72
00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:41.684
Thanks for telling me about the dream.

73
00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:48.494
(Entrance for petitioners)

74
00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.634
You can't even detect a lie.

75
00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:18.694
Ms. Kim, I think you should go back to the hospital.

76
00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:21.525
Why?

77
00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:25.595
Prosecutor Jung got an approval on the organ transplant.

78
00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:30.134
What?

79
00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:35.944
Give me the scissors.

80
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:51.124
Prosecutor Jung.

81
00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:56.165
When I sent Hwan Hee to the operation room...

82
00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:58.434
I left something in his fist.

83
00:05:00.194 --> 00:05:01.835
I gave him this when he was six.

84
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.535
For his birthday, I think.

85
00:05:07.204 --> 00:05:09.905
When he got that from me, he made up his mind.

86
00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:14.444
To be a writer.

87
00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:19.585
I can't...

88
00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:24.194
forgive the person who...

89
00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:27.124
went after my son's dream.

90
00:05:35.704 --> 00:05:37.004
Don't worry, sir.

91
00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:40.874
I'll make him guilty in the trial.

92
00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:56.184
I'll work on the main artery now.

93
00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:58.155
Okay.

94
00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:19.845
The time of death is June 2, 5:17pm.

95
00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:22.545
Start on the organ transfer now.

96
00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:40.194
We'll start the dissection.

97
00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:41.634
Hold it here.

98
00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:43.434
Middle holder.

99
00:07:39.554 --> 00:07:42.795
(Episode 23: Knocking on heaven's door)

100
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.994
(There's only one title in the other world. It's the sea.)

101
00:07:58.444 --> 00:07:59.444
Nam Hong Joo.

102
00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:01.344
Hey, Woo Tak.

103
00:08:01.944 --> 00:08:03.484
- Are you on your way to work? - Yes.

104
00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:05.554
Get in the car. I'll drop you on the way.

105
00:08:06.084 --> 00:08:07.625
No, it's okay. It'll only take a few minutes by bus.

106
00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:11.925
Get in. I'll get you there faster.

107
00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:13.454
I just said those out of manners.

108
00:08:13.454 --> 00:08:14.824
I was hoping you wouldn't leave.

109
00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:20.265
Can I charge my power bank? Do you have the connector?

110
00:08:20.665 --> 00:08:21.665
Yes, here.

111
00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:25.334
Woo Tak, didn't you dream about the trial this time?

112
00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:26.375
I didn't.

113
00:08:27.505 --> 00:08:29.844
But you said you dreamt that Jae Chan won the case.

114
00:08:30.714 --> 00:08:32.844
I didn't dream about it. It was a lie.

115
00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:34.385
What?

116
00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.145
Why would you lie about such a thing?

117
00:08:36.145 --> 00:08:39.255
Jae Chan was too pressured about it.

118
00:08:39.814 --> 00:08:41.454
I just wanted to cheer Jae Chan up.

119
00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.495
I shouldn't have lied.

120
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.724
He'll be mad if he finds out.

121
00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:49.064
I told you.

122
00:08:49.265 --> 00:08:50.995
If you can cover up until the end, it's not a lie.

123
00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.505
I can't be a murderer like this.

124
00:08:56.765 --> 00:08:58.734
I'll tell the police about all your secrets.

125
00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:08.684
Have you lied like that before, Woo Tak?

126
00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:10.854
A lie that can be covered up.

127
00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:12.554
No, never.

128
00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:20.594
You don't have to wear that tomorrow for the trial.

129
00:09:20.824 --> 00:09:21.925
I told the detention center.

130
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:23.795
Oh, it's a relief.

131
00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:28.505
Lee Hwan Hee that lunatic.

132
00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:30.905
How could you say that as the representative writer of Korea?

133
00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:32.474
Because of that jerk,

134
00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:36.545
I'm being accused as a murderer.

135
00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:39.714
But...

136
00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:42.385
don't you think you deserve to be called as a murderer?

137
00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:46.255
You strangled the assistant first.

138
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.084
He then lost consciousness.

139
00:09:49.684 --> 00:09:52.324
You pushed him in the elevator.

140
00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:54.564
You had the intention to kill him.

141
00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:58.734
(Charged for murder)

142
00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:00.295
That's why you're charged for murder.

143
00:10:01.464 --> 00:10:03.135
And you are a murderer.

144
00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:09.444
You said you'll make me innocent.

145
00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:11.775
I'll do that.

146
00:10:13.474 --> 00:10:16.615
But don't forget about what you actually have done.

147
00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:20.554
So it'll be worth the costly fee of hiring me.

148
00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:26.224
Is it even possible to make me innocent?

149
00:10:26.295 --> 00:10:29.625
It could have been hard if you were charged for homicide.

150
00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:32.995
But thanks to the prosecutor, he charged you for murder.

151
00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:36.234
It's easier to set you free when you're charged with murder.

152
00:10:36.934 --> 00:10:39.734
If you charge him with murder, he can get out of it.

153
00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:42.704
He killed a person, so I charged him for murder. What else?

154
00:10:43.304 --> 00:10:45.545
Sir, you agreed too.

155
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.214
It's very tough to prove a murder charge in a trial.

156
00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:51.184
And this isn't enough of preparation.

157
00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:52.885
If he's not found guilty, it'll become a big problem.

158
00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:55.925
So maybe it's safer to change the charge from the beginning.

159
00:10:56.184 --> 00:10:58.125
Charge him for injury or assault.

160
00:10:58.194 --> 00:11:00.454
We can't. It's clearly a murder.

161
00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:01.865
Why are you so reckless?

162
00:11:01.964 --> 00:11:03.395
You have something to back that up?

163
00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:04.665
Yes, I do.

164
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.934
I hope Jae Chan doesn't go reckless relying on my dream.

165
00:11:09.464 --> 00:11:11.934
He can't just be bold unreasonably.

166
00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:14.275
He won't be reckless.

167
00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:18.015
Are you looking for something?

168
00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:19.675
I can't find my power bank.

169
00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:21.714
Maybe it dropped under the seat.

170
00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:23.684
Wait a second. I'll get it for you.

171
00:11:25.214 --> 00:11:27.954
Never mind. I have an extra. Give it to me later when you find it.

172
00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:29.385
It's red and about this size.

173
00:11:29.724 --> 00:11:31.125
- Okay. - I'll go now.

174
00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:32.995
Hong Joo.

175
00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:35.594
Don't worry about Jae Chan.

176
00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:37.334
I went through his investigation before.

177
00:11:37.694 --> 00:11:40.334
He's very trust-worthy and careful at all times.

178
00:11:40.604 --> 00:11:42.765
I know he's careful.

179
00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.304
Jae Chan, you're too careless.

180
00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:50.814
It's like you're on the express way without wearing a seat belt.

181
00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:52.645
Wear a seat belt first.

182
00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:56.444
Charge him with a murder, but put assault as preliminary charge.

183
00:11:56.444 --> 00:11:58.115
That's too pathetic.

184
00:11:58.255 --> 00:12:01.054
Preliminary charges are known as a charge that the prosecutor...

185
00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.425
confessing to the judge that he's not confident with the case.

186
00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:08.795
I will charge him for murder no matter what.

187
00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:13.464
Prosecutor Jung will definitely charge you for murder.

188
00:12:14.064 --> 00:12:18.005
How is a murder charge easier to set me free?

189
00:12:18.035 --> 00:12:20.375
The difference between a murder and homicide is simple.

190
00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:23.844
It's a murder if you pushed him thinking that the person would die.

191
00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.045
"He wouldn't die."

192
00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:28.145
If this thought occurred, then it's not a murder.

193
00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:31.684
It's much harder to prove a murder charge than homicide.

194
00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:34.184
If he can't prove the murder, you get to be free.

195
00:12:34.724 --> 00:12:37.895
Let's see if Prosecutor Jung can prove your murder.

196
00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:39.824
I'm eager to find out too.

197
00:12:44.594 --> 00:12:48.704
Moon Tae Min, the accused, is a professor at Myungwon University.

198
00:12:48.804 --> 00:12:52.035
The victim, Lee Hwan, worked as Moon's assistant.

199
00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:54.074
The accused made his assistants, including the victim,

200
00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:55.875
do his personal work, such as...

201
00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:57.375
tutoring his children, washing his car,

202
00:12:57.375 --> 00:12:58.844
or helping him on his moving day.

203
00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.444
Mr. Moon made Mr. Lee run his personal errands.

204
00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:02.814
He even assaulted his assistants...

205
00:13:02.984 --> 00:13:04.655
because he didn't like their attitudes.

206
00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:08.454
At 4:00pm of May 30, Mr. Moon...

207
00:13:08.724 --> 00:13:10.554
assaulted the assistant at his publication event...

208
00:13:10.584 --> 00:13:12.795
because he was holding a grudge against the assistant...

209
00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:14.694
who reported Mr. Moon for assault and exploitation of labor.

210
00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:17.125
Mr. Moon called MR. Lee separately and assaulted him.

211
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.405
The victim, Lee Hwan, revealed Mr. Moon's picture...

212
00:13:22.405 --> 00:13:24.704
without his permission on that day.

213
00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:28.675
The accused claims that his assault...

214
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.314
is a justifiable act.

215
00:13:31.574 --> 00:13:33.275
In the process of assaulting...

216
00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:34.745
the accused strangled the victim...

217
00:13:34.745 --> 00:13:36.214
and made him pass out.

218
00:13:36.584 --> 00:13:39.314
This fact led the accused to murder the victim, thinking...

219
00:13:39.314 --> 00:13:41.684
when people found out about what happened...

220
00:13:41.785 --> 00:13:43.655
he would lose everything.

221
00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:46.554
I concede that there was minor bickering and physical fights.

222
00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:49.224
However, the victim Lee Hwan, was too drunk...

223
00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:51.694
to have a proper conversation on that day.

224
00:13:51.795 --> 00:13:54.905
And that is why the accused left the scene right after.

225
00:13:56.064 --> 00:13:58.505
The accused pushed the victim who lost consciousness...

226
00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.974
through the gap on the bottom of elevator,

227
00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.974
so the victim fell from about 20m height.

228
00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:06.615
On June 2, 2016, 3 days after the incident...

229
00:14:06.615 --> 00:14:09.515
at 5:17pm, the accused eventually led the victim to die.

230
00:14:09.545 --> 00:14:12.854
When the accused left the scene, Lee Hwan, the victim,

231
00:14:12.854 --> 00:14:15.625
couldn't hold his anger and kicked the elevator door and made a scene.

232
00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:21.165
This made him to fall between the elevator door by himself.

233
00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:26.094
I hereby charge him with a murder...

234
00:14:26.694 --> 00:14:28.865
according to the Criminal Law Article 250 of section 1.

235
00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:33.944
The accused doesn't have any motive to kill the victim.

236
00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:36.405
There is no direct proof to prove that the accused killed the victim.

237
00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:40.175
I hereby deny the charge.

238
00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:52.194
The defense lawyer, please go through all the evidence.

239
00:14:54.165 --> 00:14:56.895
Evidence number 34, disagree.

240
00:14:58.535 --> 00:15:00.934
Evidence number 43, disagree.

241
00:15:01.064 --> 00:15:03.405
Evidence number 43 is a testimony by a witness.

242
00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:04.704
You disagree to this?

243
00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:06.275
Yes, I disagree to it.

244
00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:10.915
He's the only witness to this case, but he's 4 years and 9 months old.

245
00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:16.285
It's very doubtful that this little boy could testify logically.

246
00:15:16.484 --> 00:15:19.684
There is a need for us to hear from the witness ourselves.

247
00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:34.940
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E23 While You Were Sleeping "Knocking on Heaven's Door"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

248
00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:44.775
Ms. Son, aren't you going home?

249
00:15:44.775 --> 00:15:47.444
No, sir. You should go first.

250
00:15:47.444 --> 00:15:50.584
I have to look through some things.

251
00:15:51.054 --> 00:15:53.054
Okay. I'll have to leave first.

252
00:15:53.214 --> 00:15:54.224
Yes, sir.

253
00:16:03.824 --> 00:16:07.194
Can a five-year-old testify in a trial?

254
00:16:07.564 --> 00:16:10.905
That's my point. He'll be scared to talk in front of all those men.

255
00:16:11.204 --> 00:16:12.834
That boy is easily frightened.

256
00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:15.944
When I rescued him, he cried and peed in his pants.

257
00:16:16.005 --> 00:16:17.844
But that boy is the only witness, isn't he?

258
00:16:18.074 --> 00:16:19.775
If there is no testimonial from the witness, won't the accused be free?

259
00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:22.184
I have to get his testimony in whatever way possible.

260
00:16:23.344 --> 00:16:26.115
You said you heard from the boy at the patrol yourself, right?

261
00:16:26.115 --> 00:16:27.684
Yes, I did.

262
00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:28.784
How did you do that?

263
00:16:29.284 --> 00:16:31.494
Wasn't the boy frightened at the patrol too?

264
00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:33.895
I tried to meet his eye-level, talking to him in children language,

265
00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:36.325
communing with his emotions.

266
00:16:36.565 --> 00:16:37.934
Then he slowly testified.

267
00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:39.994
Communing with emotions...

268
00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:43.034
How do you do that? Will you teach me how?

269
00:16:48.444 --> 00:16:52.444
Why were you scared of that guy?

270
00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:55.214
If you tell me, I'll kick him for you.

271
00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.315
Goodness.

272
00:16:58.754 --> 00:17:00.055
Oh, talking in children's way.

273
00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:03.625
But can you ask the witness in that way at the court?

274
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:04.754
Why should I ask myself?

275
00:17:04.754 --> 00:17:06.954
I'll call up his guardians or some children's psychologists.

276
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.194
Mother, where should I put these?

277
00:17:10.194 --> 00:17:12.534
Mother? just call me like you called me before.

278
00:17:13.234 --> 00:17:15.434
Stop it, and off to work! All of you!

279
00:17:17.534 --> 00:17:18.675
- Yes, ma'am. - Thank you for the food.

280
00:17:18.675 --> 00:17:20.234
Thank you for the food.

281
00:17:20.234 --> 00:17:22.845
You all go first. I'll sew a button on my shirt and go.

282
00:17:30.444 --> 00:17:32.555
Mom, did you see the sewing basket?

283
00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:44.895
Why is it...

284
00:17:46.534 --> 00:17:49.305
Hong Joo, Prosecutor Jung left his cellphone here.

285
00:17:51.974 --> 00:17:54.105
Mom, why is it here?

286
00:17:58.115 --> 00:18:00.915
Did you hide it from me on purpose?

287
00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.014
Yes.

288
00:18:04.355 --> 00:18:06.014
I don't understand. Why?

289
00:18:07.885 --> 00:18:11.494
You know, the boy really likes Santa Claus.

290
00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:14.625
He testified well when I told him that I'm Santa's friend.

291
00:18:14.925 --> 00:18:15.964
Santa Claus?

292
00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:18.194
No, not Santa Claus, but Santa Grandpa.

293
00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:21.835
I'm more like an anchor style.

294
00:18:21.964 --> 00:18:23.764
I can't make sounds like that, shortening my tongue.

295
00:18:23.764 --> 00:18:25.175
Why can't you?

296
00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:28.004
Oh, my Woo Bin, you pooped. Was it nice?

297
00:18:28.004 --> 00:18:30.645
Oh, I can shorten my tongue. Have you eaten?

298
00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:32.645
Was it delicious? It hurts.

299
00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:35.044
You're good too, Seung Won. Can't you do it?

300
00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:36.184
No, I can't.

301
00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.125
- Where is my cellphone? - Maybe you left it inside.

302
00:18:43.184 --> 00:18:44.254
What a hectic.

303
00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:49.925
My brother can definitely shorten his tongue.

304
00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:52.865
- Really? - Perfectly.

305
00:18:54.204 --> 00:18:57.105
Tell me. Why are you mean to Jae Chan these days?

306
00:18:57.504 --> 00:19:00.075
What did he do so wrong that you're so cold to him?

307
00:19:00.675 --> 00:19:04.444
You said you met him at the funeral 13 years ago.

308
00:19:04.974 --> 00:19:06.774
You're okay when you see him?

309
00:19:06.774 --> 00:19:08.085
I'm not okay.

310
00:19:08.544 --> 00:19:10.514
I'm still trying to forget about your dad.

311
00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:13.214
When I see Jae Chan, he just reminds me of your dad's accident.

312
00:19:13.454 --> 00:19:14.984
Are you okay about it? I'm not.

313
00:19:16.184 --> 00:19:18.294
I'm okay.

314
00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:20.055
No, you're not okay.

315
00:19:20.595 --> 00:19:22.865
What did you say when Jae Chan passed out last time?

316
00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:25.835
You said you couldn't change anything in the dream like...

317
00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:28.004
you couldn't with your dad's accident. You were so worried.

318
00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:30.905
You cried so much, and you were out of your mind then.

319
00:19:43.544 --> 00:19:46.555
I don't know about others. But I, as your mom, know it.

320
00:19:46.954 --> 00:19:49.425
I can see what you're thinking. I can read your mind.

321
00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:52.425
Dad's passing away, Jae Chan's accident and all that.

322
00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:54.724
You're blaming yourself, and you're suffering from it.

323
00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.964
You keep blaming yourself, and you're hurt inside.

324
00:19:58.534 --> 00:20:01.105
And you'll keep doing that.

325
00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:06.075
- Mom. - When you see Jae Chan,

326
00:20:06.504 --> 00:20:08.204
it scares me that it will hurt you.

327
00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:09.944
And it worries me so much.

328
00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.544
So...

329
00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:15.885
Mom.

330
00:20:18.155 --> 00:20:19.684
I'm really okay.

331
00:20:22.425 --> 00:20:24.194
I have good times because of him.

332
00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:26.494
It really makes me happy.

333
00:20:28.464 --> 00:20:29.825
So don't be cold to him.

334
00:20:31.835 --> 00:20:34.034
Please like him like I do, will you?

335
00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:37.105
Can you be nice to him?

336
00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:50.915
Hong Joo, have you seen my phone?

337
00:20:55.325 --> 00:20:56.454
Oh, it's here.

338
00:20:57.825 --> 00:21:00.355
You must be going through a lot that you forgot this.

339
00:21:23.585 --> 00:21:25.754
13 years ago, you were...

340
00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:28.125
a scar and...

341
00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:30.385
wound to me.

342
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.494
I thought it'd be okay if I just let it go.

343
00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:38.565
But it hurts me so much.

344
00:21:39.595 --> 00:21:40.704
It's not okay.

345
00:21:48.044 --> 00:21:49.974
Goodness. the sea has a pretty view.

346
00:21:50.274 --> 00:21:51.974
Will it look the same on my camera?

347
00:21:57.415 --> 00:22:00.284
What's wrong? Are you worried about today's trial?

348
00:22:01.585 --> 00:22:05.024
No, I have a witness and autopsy results on my hand.

349
00:22:05.095 --> 00:22:06.895
The witness is a five-year-old.

350
00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:09.464
The autopsy result isn't clear because of organ transplant.

351
00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:12.895
Yes, but I have your dream that I can rely on.

352
00:22:14.764 --> 00:22:17.135
But don't lower your guard.

353
00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:18.805
Don't worry, I won't.

354
00:22:18.974 --> 00:22:20.004
Yes, you shouldn't.

355
00:22:20.474 --> 00:22:21.504
If you do,

356
00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:25.815
I'll kick you myself.

357
00:22:40.925 --> 00:22:41.964
(Trial in process)

358
00:22:43.524 --> 00:22:44.865
Now, we'll ask the witness.

359
00:22:51.034 --> 00:22:53.905
Hello, Lim Se Young. Can you hear me?

360
00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:55.605
Yes, sir.

361
00:22:55.675 --> 00:22:57.714
A policeman rescued you before, right?

362
00:22:58.145 --> 00:23:01.744
Can you say what you told him to all the people here?

363
00:23:04.415 --> 00:23:05.415
No, I can't.

364
00:23:06.155 --> 00:23:08.254
The witness is too young.

365
00:23:08.284 --> 00:23:10.484
How can the little boy testify?

366
00:23:10.484 --> 00:23:13.494
Lim Se Young, you must tell us what you told the policeman.

367
00:23:13.855 --> 00:23:15.224
Mommy.

368
00:23:19.635 --> 00:23:21.805
I think it'd be hard to get his testimony.

369
00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:24.274
Let's try again when he calms down.

370
00:23:24.774 --> 00:23:27.544
We'll get back to the defense lawyer for the cross-examination.

371
00:23:27.744 --> 00:23:31.375
No, I think I can question now because it's not about the accident.

372
00:23:32.075 --> 00:23:33.075
Is that so?

373
00:23:33.214 --> 00:23:35.385
Can the defense lawyer start the cross-examination now?

374
00:23:37.754 --> 00:23:38.754
Yes, Your Honor.

375
00:23:54.264 --> 00:23:55.534
It's too scary here, right?

376
00:23:56.065 --> 00:23:57.165
You want to go home, right?

377
00:23:58.004 --> 00:23:59.034
Yes.

378
00:23:59.135 --> 00:24:01.145
How did you come here today?

379
00:24:02.105 --> 00:24:03.375
By bus.

380
00:24:03.605 --> 00:24:04.645
Which bus?

381
00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:07.145
I don't remember.

382
00:24:07.415 --> 00:24:10.085
If you tell me which bus you got on today,

383
00:24:10.315 --> 00:24:11.615
you can go home now.

384
00:24:12.115 --> 00:24:13.115
You really don't remember?

385
00:24:14.024 --> 00:24:16.724
I remember. I think it was bus number six.

386
00:24:17.494 --> 00:24:19.254
Se Young's mother, could you please confirm it?

387
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.665
Did you get here by bus number six?

388
00:24:22.325 --> 00:24:25.264
No, we got on bus number 434.

389
00:24:27.605 --> 00:24:30.675
Did you tell us a lie, Se Young?

390
00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:32.204
I don't know.

391
00:24:33.474 --> 00:24:35.474
The boy is only five years old.

392
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:38.014
- That is all for me. - How can he testify?

393
00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:48.925
He made the boy a liar in a second.

394
00:24:49.425 --> 00:24:50.794
He's our only witness.

395
00:24:50.794 --> 00:24:53.524
It's over if we impeach the testimony like that.

396
00:24:55.425 --> 00:24:58.694
Prosecutor, will you do additional interrogation?

397
00:24:58.835 --> 00:24:59.835
Yes, Your Honor.

398
00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:07.944
Your Honor, for communing with the witness with his emotions,

399
00:25:07.944 --> 00:25:11.044
I'll have to ask him without using any law terms.

400
00:25:11.075 --> 00:25:12.474
Okay. Go ahead.

401
00:25:31.934 --> 00:25:33.734
Lim Se Young!

402
00:25:34.464 --> 00:25:36.934
I'm a friend of Santa Claus!

403
00:25:37.204 --> 00:25:39.135
You know Santa Claus, right?

404
00:25:41.504 --> 00:25:44.544
Yes, are you really a friend of him?

405
00:25:44.774 --> 00:25:47.484
This is a uniform for Santa's friends.

406
00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:51.885
I can fly wearing this on Christmas!

407
00:25:53.214 --> 00:25:54.254
What is that?

408
00:25:54.954 --> 00:25:56.984
Oh, my gosh.

409
00:26:00.895 --> 00:26:04.464
You would never lie to Santa Claus, right?

410
00:26:04.964 --> 00:26:05.964
Yes.

411
00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:10.305
So you would never lie to me too because I'm his friend, right?

412
00:26:12.034 --> 00:26:13.075
Yes.

413
00:26:13.175 --> 00:26:16.345
You drew this picture for the policeman before, right?

414
00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:20.415
- Yes. - That is a very nice drawing.

415
00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:23.984
Do you remember what this man said to the other guy that day?

416
00:26:24.555 --> 00:26:26.184
Yes, I remember.

417
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.385
Before I interrogate, let's us all hear from evidence number 67,

418
00:26:29.484 --> 00:26:31.355
which was recorded on the victim's cellphone...

419
00:26:31.355 --> 00:26:33.224
and compare it to the testimony.

420
00:26:33.694 --> 00:26:36.425
Your Honor. If we hear the evidence now,

421
00:26:36.425 --> 00:26:38.294
the child might repeat it.

422
00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:41.135
No. Maybe he heard it already.

423
00:26:41.135 --> 00:26:44.375
We'll listen to the child testifying and then listen to the evidence.

424
00:26:44.504 --> 00:26:47.544
And this recorded file was found during the prosecutor's investigation.

425
00:26:47.544 --> 00:26:50.145
This will be Lim Se Young's first time to hear this.

426
00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:52.915
Continue with interrogation.

427
00:26:54.645 --> 00:26:56.184
Se Young.

428
00:26:56.885 --> 00:26:59.954
What did this man say to this man?

429
00:27:01.684 --> 00:27:04.355
He pushed him and asked him if he's drunk.

430
00:27:04.494 --> 00:27:06.994
He said something about being drunk.

431
00:27:10.264 --> 00:27:11.694
Are you drunk?

432
00:27:11.835 --> 00:27:13.635
Your drunk action is something that can't be forgiven.

433
00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:18.504
So what did the right man say to the man on the left?

434
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:21.704
He said he doesn't need something.

435
00:27:23.204 --> 00:27:26.115
And he said he learned how to clean his shoes.

436
00:27:27.484 --> 00:27:28.885
I don't need to debut as a writer.

437
00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:31.484
I learned nothing but cleaning your shoes and cars.

438
00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:32.514
What's the point of becoming a writer?

439
00:27:33.415 --> 00:27:34.754
The testimony is similar to the recording.

440
00:27:35.125 --> 00:27:37.895
Now we have the witness' testimonial credibility.

441
00:27:37.895 --> 00:27:38.994
Now the evidence on murder.

442
00:27:40.294 --> 00:27:42.994
Se Young, it's almost finished.

443
00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:45.595
What happened to these two after that?

444
00:27:47.305 --> 00:27:51.734
The man in grey shirt strangled the man on the right and pushed him.

445
00:27:52.635 --> 00:27:55.704
He pushed him so hard with a loud bang.

446
00:27:57.915 --> 00:27:59.675
So how was the guy in the white shirt?

447
00:28:00.514 --> 00:28:02.984
He suddenly fell asleep.

448
00:28:03.444 --> 00:28:04.684
He fell asleep?

449
00:28:04.984 --> 00:28:08.754
So what did the grey shirt guy do to the white guy who fell asleep?

450
00:28:10.024 --> 00:28:14.294
He pushed him down the elevator door.

451
00:28:15.724 --> 00:28:18.895
This means he pushed with a purpose. He did it.

452
00:28:21.135 --> 00:28:22.135
That is all, Your Honor.

453
00:28:24.375 --> 00:28:25.474
Goodness.

454
00:28:26.835 --> 00:28:28.345
Hey, Santa Claus' friend!

455
00:28:30.474 --> 00:28:31.575
How embarrassing.

456
00:28:34.484 --> 00:28:37.784
Walk slowly. You might actually fly.

457
00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:40.115
What? What is it?

458
00:28:41.655 --> 00:28:44.625
How did you pull that off in front of so many people?

459
00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:47.395
You're trying so hard.

460
00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:51.135
Of course I have to.

461
00:28:51.895 --> 00:28:54.305
The accused is trying to get his way right in front of me.

462
00:28:54.565 --> 00:28:55.805
I can do more than being Santa's friend.

463
00:28:56.464 --> 00:28:57.635
I can do something worse.

464
00:28:57.734 --> 00:28:58.734
Worse?

465
00:28:59.274 --> 00:29:00.534
Can I see that next time?

466
00:29:00.845 --> 00:29:01.875
Of course.

467
00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:05.575
It's rare to have an autopsy and organ transplant at the same time.

468
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.075
It's not actually rare.

469
00:29:07.175 --> 00:29:08.214
Did you look into every case?

470
00:29:08.284 --> 00:29:09.284
I actually did.

471
00:29:09.484 --> 00:29:11.454
- I'll look forward to it. - Please do.

472
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:31.250
(Episode 24 will air shortly.)
