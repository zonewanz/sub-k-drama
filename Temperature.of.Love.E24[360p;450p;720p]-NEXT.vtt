00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:07.540
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:08.700
Mr. Park is in, right?

3
00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:12.490
Chef On is here too. 
Were you supposed to meet together?

4
00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:13.610
What?

5
00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.850
- Did he leave? - Yes.

6
00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:29.060
Why was he here?

7
00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.430
He scared me to death.

8
00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:34.830
Hello. Is Mr. Park in his office?

9
00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:38.500
Could you please wait a minute?

10
00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:39.840
Why?

11
00:00:40.657 --> 00:00:42.040
I'm on time for my appointment.

12
00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:47.640
I'm a close friend of Mr. Park, 
and I came without an appointment.

13
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:50.550
I just need to give him these. 
Please wait just a second.

14
00:00:53.537 --> 00:00:55.450
Your feelings are showing on your face.

15
00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.220
You're like me.

16
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:00.220
Still, I'm older than you.

17
00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:02.460
I told you I was Mr. Park's friend.

18
00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:04.580
Even so, I don't think it's right...

19
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:07.560
to waste someone else's time like this.

20
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.300
That's why I asked for your understanding.

21
00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:11.970
How do you know Mr. Park?

22
00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:13.740
She's a contract writer.

23
00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:16.040
Are you a writer?

24
00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:18.410
Yes, I am.

25
00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.480
My son's girlfriend is a writer too.

26
00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:23.650
She wrote a mini-series.

27
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:25.250
See you later.

28
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.100
Who is she?

29
00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:31.920
She's Chef On's mother.

30
00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.260
Chef On Jung Sun?

31
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.480
I brought these for you because...

32
00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:41.560
you're nice to Jung Sun and me.

33
00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:43.100
Thank you.

34
00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:46.050
Since I didn't have an appointment, 
I'll leave right away.

35
00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:47.240
I know you're busy.

36
00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:48.740
Okay.

37
00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:50.340
Take care.

38
00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.400
Saying that you're okay doesn't 
always mean you're okay.

39
00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:02.550
A happy ending doesn't mean 
that everyone is happy.

40
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.990
Jung Woo and I wanted to work on 
this because it was a sad ending.

41
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.270
You're so out of touch with reality.

42
00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.890
Do you know how people my age love?

43
00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.410
Through dramas.

44
00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:15.450
It's hard to make a living.

45
00:02:15.452 --> 00:02:16.980
Relationships are tiring.

46
00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:19.270
They don't want to have 
serious relationships.

47
00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:21.190
A drama with a sad ending...

48
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:23.910
will discourage them from having a relationship.

49
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:26.060
Aren't you in a relationship?

50
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.940
That's none of your business.

51
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.680
Then...

52
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.350
go with a happy ending.

53
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:36.080
Go with it?

54
00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:37.840
Just like that?

55
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:39.290
Like Kyung said,

56
00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:42.920
a drama should encourage people to love. Right?

57
00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:49.510
Your argument is too emotional.

58
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.120
Can you persuade Mr. Park?

59
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:53.840
Director and writer want to do it. He has no choice.

60
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.270
By the way,

61
00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.320
why do you want to do this?

62
00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:00.060
I like coming here.

63
00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:02.280
You want to direct it because you like coming here?

64
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.880
Gosh, should I work with a guy like him?

65
00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.650
I think...

66
00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:08.870
he likes coming here...

67
00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:11.800
because he can talk about "Kind Soup".

68
00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:12.850
- Yes. - Wait.

69
00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:17.730
Isn't it because of Kyung's ramyeon?

70
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.590
- No. - No.

71
00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.600
- Jinx! - Jinx!

72
00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:24.770
You guys are acting a bit weird.

73
00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:26.270
- What's weird? - What's weird?

74
00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:32.810
I met with Mr. Yoo.

75
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.810
He'll give a slot to Director Kim Joon Ha.

76
00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.810
Please help me work with Director Kim.

77
00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.650
Joon Ha is working with Hyun Soo.

78
00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:44.590
Teams go bust all the time.

79
00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:46.190
They're still working together.

80
00:03:46.343 --> 00:03:47.860
I can't snatch him for you.

81
00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:50.530
Then how will you make my drama?

82
00:03:50.947 --> 00:03:53.600
My plan is to have you work with...

83
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.060
Director Min Yi Bok.

84
00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.870
Are you trying to ruin my career?

85
00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:01.690
He not only rewrites scripts.

86
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.390
but he changes things...

87
00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:05.440
right on the shoot all the time.

88
00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.030
You want me to work with him?

89
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.780
He won't do that this time.

90
00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:09.980
Because he failed last time.

91
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.650
And I know you won't put up with him.

92
00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:14.730
I think you two will make a good team.

93
00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:16.150
A good team?

94
00:04:16.206 --> 00:04:18.990
No plot, fast speed. Those are your strengths.

95
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.720
There's no time for the viewers to complain.

96
00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:23.090
It's like reading a comic book.

97
00:04:23.546 --> 00:04:25.310
I hate that his previous work failed.

98
00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:27.930
He wouldn't have been available if he hadn't failed.

99
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:42.840
What are you doing?

100
00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:45.580
I miss you.

101
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:53.390
You look like a boy sitting there like that.

102
00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:56.730
Come and sit here quickly like a girl.

103
00:04:58.248 --> 00:04:59.290
Quickly.

104
00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:03.470
Long time no see.

105
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.800
Long time no see.

106
00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:10.840
It feels like it's been a week, but it's only been three days.

107
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.880
How was your day?

108
00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:16.440
Was it hard?

109
00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:19.850
It was hard.

110
00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:22.520
Mine too.

111
00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:24.690
I'm glad we have that in common.

112
00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:27.220
What was so hard about it?

113
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:31.390
No big troubles. Just little ones.

114
00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.300
We decided on how the drama will end.

115
00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:37.700
How will it end?

116
00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:39.700
It'll be a happy ending.

117
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:43.770
What was hard about your day?

118
00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:46.780
There was an incident.

119
00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:48.280
What incident?

120
00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:49.810
I don't want to talk about it.

121
00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.850
I don't have to tell you, right?

122
00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:53.880
Okay.

123
00:05:57.474 --> 00:05:58.690
Now push me.

124
00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:01.490
I can do that.

125
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.230
All right.

126
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.110
- Okay. - That's too high.

127
00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.200
Here we go.

128
00:06:08.752 --> 00:06:10.500
- Go. - Oh, my.

129
00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.260
Wait. Push lightly.

130
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.260
- Okay. - Gently.

131
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:19.340
Okay.

132
00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:21.390
- Are you pushing lightly? - Yes.

133
00:06:21.398 --> 00:06:23.060
- But it's swinging so much. - I'm not pushing.

134
00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:24.610
- Really? I think you are. - No.

135
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.020
Hyun Soo.

136
00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.800
I can't do it.

137
00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.360
Kyung, don't stop. You have to keep moving.

138
00:06:52.362 --> 00:06:53.910
Like this. Do this.

139
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.360
Hyun Soo, I can't.

140
00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:58.780
You have to get in shape before we start working.

141
00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:00.480
We have an interview today.

142
00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:03.650
Okay? You can do it.

143
00:07:04.107 --> 00:07:05.490
If you can do it, I can do it too!

144
00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:08.410
- Okay. - Let's go.

145
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:09.840
- 1, 2. - Let's go.

146
00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.960
- Go. - You aren't walking, right?

147
00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:13.280
- No. - Kyung.

148
00:07:13.283 --> 00:07:14.560
- What? - Run!

149
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.080
- Gosh. - You aren't running properly.

150
00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:18.870
- Gosh. - You can do it.

151
00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:53.870
- Is this the new dish? - Yes. Try it.

152
00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.570
I guess the meeting went well.

153
00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:59.310
No. But I should concentrate on my work more...

154
00:07:59.362 --> 00:08:01.290
when there are troubles.

155
00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:03.310
Right. Cooking is what's important.

156
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.750
What did Mr. Park say?

157
00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:06.980
He talked about restructuring.

158
00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:09.600
- Hey. - Stop.

159
00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:10.720
Hello.

160
00:08:10.807 --> 00:08:12.220
- Hi. - What's this?

161
00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:14.060
It's a new dish for our menu.

162
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:15.690
Try it.

163
00:08:15.812 --> 00:08:16.880
Give me a bite.

164
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.130
Hello.

165
00:08:18.515 --> 00:08:19.890
Try it.

166
00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:21.050
What's this?

167
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.180
- Mackerel. - It's really good.

168
00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:24.270
- Is it? - It's a bass.

169
00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:28.840
All he does is wash dishes. He doesn't know anything.

170
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.520
- It's a bass. - A bass.

171
00:08:31.528 --> 00:08:32.570
Bass?

172
00:08:32.662 --> 00:08:34.090
Mackerel and bass are different?

173
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.540
Where does bass live?

174
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.110
Jung Woo, won't you take a break?

175
00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:41.350
All you seem to do is work.

176
00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:42.820
Do you have lunch plans?

177
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.750
No.

178
00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:48.770
I haven't had a proper meal lately.

179
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.460
(Dear Mr. Park, Happy birthday. Management Firefly.)

180
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.090
Is it your birthday today?

181
00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:56.630
Not today, it's tomorrow.

182
00:08:59.088 --> 00:09:02.240
Okay. I'll celebrate it with you.

183
00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:04.660
With you? No, thanks.

184
00:09:04.661 --> 00:09:05.710
That's upsetting.

185
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:06.870
What will you do then?

186
00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:10.330
What do you think? I'll just stay home.

187
00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.310
Come on, you'd be too lonely.

188
00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:15.380
What's the point of having it all? I feel bad for you.

189
00:09:16.072 --> 00:09:18.390
I don't think you're in a place to pity anyone.

190
00:09:19.108 --> 00:09:20.320
Why did you want to see me?

191
00:09:20.743 --> 00:09:22.320
Because of "Kind Soup".

192
00:09:22.512 --> 00:09:24.030
I had a meeting with Hyun Soo.

193
00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:26.660
We decided to go with a happy ending.

194
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.730
Arrange another meeting.

195
00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:32.030
I have a right to produce what I want to watch.

196
00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:36.000
It's Hong Ah.

197
00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:37.870
Why is she calling me?

198
00:09:38.094 --> 00:09:40.810
She sure is persistent. I like that.

199
00:09:41.898 --> 00:09:43.280
She'll want to meet with you.

200
00:09:49.272 --> 00:09:52.020
I hear you're preparing for a new drama.

201
00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:53.790
It hasn't been decided yet.

202
00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:57.680
Who are you working with?

203
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.460
Don't you know? I'm working with Hyun Soo.

204
00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:04.950
Will you be able to get it aired...

205
00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:06.500
working with Hyun Soo?

206
00:10:06.823 --> 00:10:08.090
It didn't go well last time.

207
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:09.600
If I want to work with her, I'll work with her.

208
00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:14.440
Your previous drama didn't do well though.

209
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:16.010
It should be a hit this time.

210
00:10:16.466 --> 00:10:18.510
I gained a lot of fans last time.

211
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:21.220
My fans call me Joon Ha Jjing.

212
00:10:23.573 --> 00:10:25.220
How about working with me?

213
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:26.840
This is so delicious.

214
00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:29.990
Thanks for buying lunch. This place is expensive.

215
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.900
Enjoy.

216
00:10:36.586 --> 00:10:38.500
I thought about the consultation.

217
00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:42.540
I've decided. I'll go to your office after work.

218
00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:43.810
Okay.

219
00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:51.610
What brings you here?

220
00:10:52.135 --> 00:10:54.850
I came here for lunch, and I'm having a bad day.

221
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:57.170
Won Joon is still busy in the kitchen.

222
00:10:57.173 --> 00:10:59.590
You seem to have time since you're the owner chef.

223
00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:02.090
You have a good personality in a way.

224
00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:03.910
I see people when I want to.

225
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.390
And if I don't want to, I don't.

226
00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.730
We've been friends for years.

227
00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:10.730
I can't stop seeing you just like that.

228
00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:13.330
I'm sorry, but I have to go downstairs.

229
00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:15.700
I saw your mom.

230
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.210
She isn't like you at all. I was shocked.

231
00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:19.370
Where did you see her?

232
00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:21.010
At Mr. Park's office.

233
00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:23.180
It must be hard for Hyun Soo.

234
00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.660
For the first time,

235
00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:27.480
I felt happy that I wasn't your love interest.

236
00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:44.570
Hi, Jung Sun.

237
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:47.030
Did you see Jung Woo the other day?

238
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:49.970
How did you know?

239
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.690
Why did you go to his office?

240
00:11:52.695 --> 00:11:54.740
You can meet him at my restaurant if you need to.

241
00:11:55.364 --> 00:11:59.080
I just dropped by to give him flowers...

242
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.820
because he's been...

243
00:12:00.903 --> 00:12:02.620
so nice to you.

244
00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.320
You aren't doing anything weird, right?

245
00:12:05.775 --> 00:12:07.120
Anything weird?

246
00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:09.620
Why don't you trust me?

247
00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:13.190
How long are you going to hold the mistake I made over my head?

248
00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.330
Don't ever bother Jung Woo.

249
00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:18.000
What did I do?

250
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:27.090
What does a sous chef do?

251
00:12:27.096 --> 00:12:29.560
A sous chef actually manages the restaurant...

252
00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:30.780
and assists the chef.

253
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.260
Are you skilled enough...

254
00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.720
to take over the chef's job when he isn't present?

255
00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:36.350
I still have a long way to go.

256
00:12:36.539 --> 00:12:39.650
Because Jung Sun is amazing. He's almost perfect.

257
00:12:42.278 --> 00:12:44.030
Why are you coming down from there?

258
00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.990
I had a talk with Jung Sun.

259
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.700
I thought I'd say hi to a friend since I'm here.

260
00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:53.840
Since you don't seem to like seeing me.

261
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.450
Since when did you respect my opinion?

262
00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:58.340
You're acting cold these days.

263
00:12:58.561 --> 00:12:59.910
So I'm walking on eggshells.

264
00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.810
I don't just act blindly.

265
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.780
Are you doing an interview here?

266
00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:08.950
Yes. Who did you have lunch with?

267
00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:10.450
With Director Kim Joon Ha.

268
00:13:10.673 --> 00:13:12.250
I heard you're working with him.

269
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.710
That doesn't mean we'll make the drama together.

270
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.070
The station has to say yes.

271
00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:18.130
Anyway you're working with him now.

272
00:13:18.648 --> 00:13:21.410
If you had told me you were working with him,

273
00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:22.610
I wouldn't have met with him today.

274
00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:24.570
Were you planning on working with him?

275
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:26.820
You badmouthed him for being a bad director.

276
00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:28.370
You badmouthed him too.

277
00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:31.540
But now he's working with you.

278
00:13:31.661 --> 00:13:33.140
Because it has to air.

279
00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.350
Would you like more tea?

280
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.580
No, it's okay.

281
00:13:42.004 --> 00:13:44.350
Thank you for being so accommodating.

282
00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:52.590
I don't like her.

283
00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:56.500
Why is that?

284
00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:32.030
I thought you had to work. Are you finished?

285
00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:33.320
Not yet.

286
00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:35.940
I came to interview Chef On now.

287
00:14:36.092 --> 00:14:37.170
About what?

288
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.510
What are you doing? What do chefs do during downtime?

289
00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:43.040
I was looking at a book. I have to make new menus.

290
00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.680
My food will be the only thing that survives.

291
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.020
I think you have a really gentle personality.

292
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.390
When I first met you,

293
00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:56.420
I thought you were a troublemaker because of your tattoo and scars.

294
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.630
I wouldn't fight anyone.

295
00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:01.030
That's one of the reasons why my parents divorced.

296
00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:06.900
I see.

297
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.040
That's why I hate violence.

298
00:15:14.864 --> 00:15:15.940
This too?

299
00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:18.150
- I'm sorry. - It doesn't hurt.

300
00:15:19.402 --> 00:15:22.220
You're so good at acting. You surprised me.

301
00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:23.950
(Won Joon)

302
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.450
I better go downstairs. I have to prepare for dinner time.

303
00:15:26.876 --> 00:15:28.720
Okay. Good luck.

304
00:15:30.813 --> 00:15:31.860
Let's go.

305
00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:33.860
Already?

306
00:15:54.637 --> 00:15:57.300
Hey, Director Kim called...

307
00:15:57.306 --> 00:15:58.470
saying we should meet for another meeting.

308
00:15:58.474 --> 00:16:00.790
It seems like things didn't go well with Mr. Park.

309
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.660
Is he coming tomorrow?

310
00:16:02.912 --> 00:16:04.860
No, he wants to go somewhere else.

311
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:06.840
What?

312
00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:08.400
("High Society")

313
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.650
You're drinking.

314
00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:33.350
Have a drink.

315
00:16:38.848 --> 00:16:40.290
(Dear Mr. Park, Happy birthday. Management Firefly.)

316
00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:50.640
I'll tell you why I'm here.

317
00:16:51.794 --> 00:16:55.040
I can't lower the unit cost or cut down on my staff.

318
00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:58.110
Instead, I won't get paid.

319
00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:00.680
How is it that you always act...

320
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.780
according to my prediction?

321
00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:05.920
If you know me so well, why did you make such a suggestion?

322
00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.660
To shake you up.

323
00:17:08.477 --> 00:17:09.590
I told you.

324
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.790
It won't go as you planned.

325
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:14.500
I'll go now.

326
00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:18.130
How long can you last...

327
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:20.070
without getting paid?

328
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.070
Even if I can't last, I will.

329
00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:39.990
Just call me your brother.

330
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:42.960
I won't suggest such a thing just to anyone.

331
00:17:43.412 --> 00:17:46.730
I don't know when it will be, but if I open a restaurant...

332
00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:51.070
I'll open it with you.

333
00:17:51.353 --> 00:17:53.050
If something goes wrong between us...

334
00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:55.270
Why would you think about that? Things are good right now.

335
00:17:55.758 --> 00:17:56.870
Jung Woo.

336
00:17:57.193 --> 00:17:59.110
I don't think we'll ever fall apart.

337
00:18:00.796 --> 00:18:02.940
This is how it's like when you fight for blind love.

338
00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:04.650
Can you handle this?

339
00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:07.920
It takes 2 to love, not 1.

340
00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:11.140
No matter how much we fight, the outcome isn't about winning.

341
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.390
Why do we have to have this fight?

342
00:18:13.075 --> 00:18:14.260
Are you exhausted already?

343
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:15.920
This is only the beginning.

344
00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:17.890
You can give up right now if you want to.

345
00:18:18.614 --> 00:18:20.760
Then I'll stop swaying you...

346
00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:22.500
to get Hyun Soo.

347
00:18:55.184 --> 00:18:57.200
(Joon Ha)

348
00:18:58.854 --> 00:19:01.000
Jung Woo, we're here to have a meeting.

349
00:19:13.602 --> 00:19:15.150
It's so beautiful.

350
00:19:15.771 --> 00:19:17.050
Where are we?

351
00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:19.340
Isn't it nice?

352
00:19:19.341 --> 00:19:22.120
- It's really nice. - What a view.

353
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.660
Jung Woo!

354
00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:38.170
What is this?

355
00:19:39.862 --> 00:19:40.980
It's Jung Woo's secret place.

356
00:19:41.664 --> 00:19:44.180
It was his childhood home. He bought it back when he grew up.

357
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:46.850
They must have been rich.

358
00:19:47.536 --> 00:19:48.720
Why did we come here anyway?

359
00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:51.020
It'd be good to have him join the meeting.

360
00:19:51.307 --> 00:19:53.920
Then why didn't you say so? Why did you bring us like this?

361
00:19:54.143 --> 00:19:55.690
You might not have come if I told you.

362
00:19:56.045 --> 00:19:58.080
So you brought me anyway knowing I wouldn't come.

363
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.460
- Yes. - Director Kim.

364
00:20:00.883 --> 00:20:03.080
You're really clueless.

365
00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:04.200
What?

366
00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:08.200
Jung Woo.

367
00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:25.590
Can't you leave the kitchen on your day off?

368
00:20:25.874 --> 00:20:26.950
Why are you here?

369
00:20:29.211 --> 00:20:31.790
I thought about it, and something is strange.

370
00:20:32.681 --> 00:20:34.400
Is there a problem between you and Mr. Park?

371
00:20:35.384 --> 00:20:36.930
It's none of your business.

372
00:20:37.186 --> 00:20:38.270
It is my business.

373
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.150
He's the only one that's helpful...

374
00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.300
out of all of your acquaintances.

375
00:20:44.226 --> 00:20:46.440
Tell me what happened,

376
00:20:46.562 --> 00:20:47.760
and I'll help you.

377
00:20:47.763 --> 00:20:50.880
It's difficult as it is without you getting involved.

378
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.520
- What's so difficult? - I'll take care of it.

379
00:20:55.204 --> 00:20:56.720
Of course you will.

380
00:20:57.573 --> 00:21:00.350
I was never a helpful mother to you, I know.

381
00:21:00.643 --> 00:21:01.960
But I can't watch you suffer.

382
00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:04.660
I can't do anything about being a troublesome mother,

383
00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:07.560
but I don't want others to give you trouble.

384
00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:12.200
It's nothing, so go on and live your life.

385
00:21:27.603 --> 00:21:28.720
How nice is this?

386
00:21:29.305 --> 00:21:30.950
This is how one should live.

387
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.720
It was such a great idea.

388
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.290
I thought you wanted to have a meeting. Was it a lie?

389
00:21:36.178 --> 00:21:37.490
It's not a lie, but it was a lie.

390
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.090
What meeting?

391
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:42.230
Let's just socialize and settle on a happy ending.

392
00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:45.100
You're really careless.

393
00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:48.870
What?

394
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.270
What's wrong with her?

395
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:54.380
Kyung hates liars.

396
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:17.400
Why did you follow me out?

397
00:22:17.853 --> 00:22:20.300
- Don't you know why? - No.

398
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.300
I thought you hated liars. You're the one lying.

399
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.770
What did I lie about?

400
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.980
You know that I like you.

401
00:22:30.399 --> 00:22:31.510
Why do you act like you don't know?

402
00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:35.080
How can I act like I do?

403
00:22:36.138 --> 00:22:37.350
Why can't you?

404
00:22:37.706 --> 00:22:40.220
If I do, then we'd have to date.

405
00:22:41.276 --> 00:22:42.420
Can't we date?

406
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.990
No.

407
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:48.400
I won't date until I become a writer.

408
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.770
In my opinion, you'll never get to date.

409
00:22:55.657 --> 00:22:56.770
Director Kim!

410
00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:01.380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kyung.

411
00:23:01.563 --> 00:23:03.340
Wait. Kyung!

412
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.150
Wine isn't doing it for me today.

413
00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:18.060
(On Jung Sun)

414
00:23:19.081 --> 00:23:20.130
What are you doing?

415
00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:22.310
I'm at a meeting.

416
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:23.860
(I'm at a meeting.)

417
00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.620
Should we meet later?

418
00:23:31.627 --> 00:23:32.890
(I don't know when this will be over.)

419
00:23:32.895 --> 00:23:36.210
I don't know when this will be over. I'll call you later.

420
00:23:44.907 --> 00:23:46.120
Hyun Soo, let's go home.

421
00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:48.990
Mr. Park, we won't have a meeting today, right?

422
00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:50.320
Okay.

423
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:53.260
Not you too. Do you know what day it is?

424
00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:54.430
Forget it.

425
00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:57.130
Drive Ms. Hwangbo home.

426
00:23:57.753 --> 00:23:58.980
I'll go with them.

427
00:23:58.987 --> 00:24:01.770
I'll take you home, Hyun Soo.

428
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:03.500
I have to talk to you.

429
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.610
What about Hyun Soo?

430
00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:12.480
Hello.

431
00:24:22.077 --> 00:24:24.220
I was texting Jung Sun earlier.

432
00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:29.800
No wonder you agreed to stay behind.

433
00:24:31.954 --> 00:24:34.870
If that's your opening line to reject me, forget it.

434
00:24:36.325 --> 00:24:38.110
I've been rejected enough.

435
00:24:39.461 --> 00:24:41.070
If you keep this up, it's obsession.

436
00:24:44.199 --> 00:24:46.550
Another word for obsession is passion.

437
00:24:46.768 --> 00:24:50.020
If you say passion, it sounds so much more positive.

438
00:24:50.506 --> 00:24:53.550
What do you like about a woman who gave her heart to another man?

439
00:24:54.643 --> 00:24:56.320
I love even that heart of hers.

440
00:25:04.786 --> 00:25:06.780
"Out of sight, out of mind."

441
00:25:06.788 --> 00:25:07.870
It's the case for most people.

442
00:25:09.024 --> 00:25:10.340
However, that wasn't the case for you.

443
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.270
I want that heart to come to me.

444
00:25:14.997 --> 00:25:16.480
I can't change my heart.

445
00:25:16.698 --> 00:25:18.680
You turned away from him because of work before.

446
00:25:19.801 --> 00:25:21.010
But you changed.

447
00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:25.150
I want you to be happy.

448
00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:29.790
A woman whose heart belongs to another...

449
00:25:32.548 --> 00:25:33.760
It's wrong.

450
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.980
From the beginning, there were always three of us.

451
00:25:36.985 --> 00:25:38.230
It's nothing new.

452
00:25:39.755 --> 00:25:41.370
If I give up on you,

453
00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:44.840
that can't be a reason for me.

454
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.860
I'm not sure if it's right to keep working with you.

455
00:26:08.817 --> 00:26:10.800
Get up. I'll drive you home.

456
00:27:21.857 --> 00:27:23.170
Are you just going to go in?

457
00:27:24.026 --> 00:27:25.440
I want to get some air.

458
00:27:32.434 --> 00:27:33.480
Jung Woo.

459
00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:38.320
Jung Sun.

460
00:27:46.148 --> 00:27:47.660
When did you get here?

461
00:27:48.617 --> 00:27:49.730
A while ago.

462
00:27:51.453 --> 00:27:52.900
You must be cold.

463
00:27:57.225 --> 00:27:58.510
Should we go inside?

464
00:27:58.627 --> 00:28:01.580
No, you go ahead first.

465
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.240
I have to talk to Jung Woo.

466
00:28:05.834 --> 00:28:07.350
You must be upset.

467
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.480
Well, I'm not happy.

468
00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:16.420
Okay. I'll wait inside.

469
00:28:16.678 --> 00:28:17.920
Yes, go in.

470
00:28:19.181 --> 00:28:20.290
Mr. Park.

471
00:28:21.483 --> 00:28:22.830
I'll be going in now.

472
00:28:41.069 --> 00:28:42.180
I have to talk to you.

473
00:28:42.904 --> 00:28:43.950
Do you want to talk here?

474
00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:45.320
No.

475
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.270
What is it? Go ahead.

476
00:29:07.229 --> 00:29:08.380
Stop it.

477
00:29:09.264 --> 00:29:11.710
Stop pushing yourself on a woman that doesn't want you.

478
00:29:12.701 --> 00:29:14.580
She hasn't told me she didn't want me yet.

479
00:29:16.238 --> 00:29:18.120
She told me it wasn't love.

480
00:29:19.941 --> 00:29:21.450
As you already know,

481
00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:24.290
love can change.

482
00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:26.690
- Not us. - Yes.

483
00:29:26.948 --> 00:29:28.200
You'll be the one that changes.

484
00:29:29.885 --> 00:29:30.930
What?

485
00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:34.970
When you two first met in front of Good Soup,

486
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:38.240
do you know why I wasn't threatened by you?

487
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:42.180
How can it be you?

488
00:29:43.265 --> 00:29:44.710
You're still lost.

489
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.780
You're young too.

490
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:01.130
What can you do for Hyun Soo?

491
00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:03.160
I can do everything she wants.

492
00:30:03.185 --> 00:30:04.210
You only care about your feelings,

493
00:30:04.219 --> 00:30:05.800
so you don't care about her future.

494
00:30:07.489 --> 00:30:08.870
You have no ambition.

495
00:30:11.126 --> 00:30:13.270
You should get mad when you're mad.

496
00:30:13.662 --> 00:30:16.380
I'm telling you I'll steal your woman.

497
00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:19.510
I lived my life to prove that I'm different from my father.

498
00:30:20.836 --> 00:30:22.000
If you have your hand in a fist,

499
00:30:22.003 --> 00:30:23.670
- you should hit me. What's wrong? - Ironically,

500
00:30:23.672 --> 00:30:25.820
I became free that day.

501
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.250
(Temperature of Love)

502
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:56.870
You should work with writer Ji Hong Ah.

503
00:30:56.872 --> 00:30:58.400
You got stabbed in the back.

504
00:30:58.406 --> 00:31:00.840
Director Kim Joon Ha will be working with me.

505
00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:03.920
Shouldn't you move out if the restaurant is this slow?

506
00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:05.960
Our friendship is on trial.

507
00:31:06.047 --> 00:31:07.540
Mr. Park seemed to be a good guy.

508
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:09.550
Tell me the truth. Did you borrow money from Jung Woo?

509
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:10.750
Are you close with Mr. Park?

510
00:31:10.752 --> 00:31:13.630
Did you break Jung Sun and Mr. Park apart?

511
00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:15.720
The chef will come up with a few recipes.

512
00:31:15.724 --> 00:31:17.220
How dare you touch my food?

513
00:31:17.225 --> 00:31:18.760
You need to make compromises.

514
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.470
I'll give you back your share,

515
00:31:20.729 --> 00:31:22.110
so don't get involved in my business.
