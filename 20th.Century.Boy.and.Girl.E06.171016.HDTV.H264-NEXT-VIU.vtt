00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:09.810
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.980
What are you doing?

3
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.150
Oh, right.

4
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.521
What is it? Is something there?

5
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:19.981
I don't know.

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.990
Jin Jin.

7
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:24.161
Yes?

8
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:29.961
What are these?

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.431
I found them on my way home.

10
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.120
Excuse me.

11
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.190
Hello.

12
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.330
Why would you ask the lady at the restaurant for her hometown?

13
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.171
Did you have to ask to figure that out?

14
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:12.541
Her dialect was so obvious that she's from Yanji.

15
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.611
Do you want to play house with her at Yanji or something?

16
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:18.180
My goodness.

17
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.011
I knew it when you got all dressed up to go out.

18
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.121
What kind of an idiot would give 10 dollars for a tip...

19
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:29.720
after eating a bowl of noodles for five dollars?

20
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:32.061
My gosh.

21
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:34.830
Try digging up the ground. You won't find a penny there.

22
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.531
There are people in here.

23
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.671
I'm glad you mentioned them.

24
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:46.300
Excuse me, the actress lady from the 14th floor. Look at him.

25
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:49.970
Men are all like this.

26
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.781
Don't give a guy your heart for a few roses.

27
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:56.751
They can do anything and everything when they hit on women.

28
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:58.680
Even dogs can do that.

29
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.891
Dogs and men, they're all the same.

30
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:02.820
So don't ever get married.

31
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.761
I hope you would live alone, okay?

32
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.030
For whose benefit would any women get married?

33
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:14.930
Why did you want to know where she's from?

34
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.740
- Will you stop it already? - My goodness.

35
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:30.550
Anyway,

36
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.150
why aren't you married...

37
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.721
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.131
- Yes. - Ji Won!

39
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.101
- Ji Won, don't you miss me? - Of course I do.

40
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.671
I'll be there soon.

41
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:58.740
No, I was going to call you.

42
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.511
Fine, I'm sorry.

43
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:14.391
So when will you come home?

44
00:03:14.391 --> 00:03:16.361
In a few days.

45
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.930
Our eldest brother always says that, but he never comes.

46
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.171
Anyway, my life is ruined all because of you.

47
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:24.171
Why?

48
00:03:24.541 --> 00:03:28.541
Mom's only been cooking pork cutlet saying you could be home any minute.

49
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.310
I got really fat from eating all those.

50
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.611
So can you pay for my double-eyelid surgery?

51
00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:35.710
Double-eyelid surgery?

52
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.080
Making a double eyelid on my eyes.

53
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.721
Okay.

54
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:40.721
Really?

55
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.650
Once you get to college. You're still in middle school.

56
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.120
- Ji Won! - What?

57
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.691
I'm a junior in high school.

58
00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.111
How dare he try to hit on me?

59
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.471
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:33.640
I'm the one who's sorry. There's nothing I can do.

61
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:39.180
All I need is you.

62
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:41.481
Let's run away...

63
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.981
to a place where no one can find us.

64
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:48.490
Let's leave everything behind to find our happiness.

65
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.531
Hey! What do you think you two are doing?

66
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.740
Do you know how happy we were? We were so much in love.

67
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:07.771
How dare you touch my husband?

68
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:10.310
Fine, I'll kill you today and kill myself too.

69
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:12.781
Sa Jin Jin has been on the headlines...

70
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:14.151
for getting involved with a married man.

71
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:17.950
She has also been charged for housebreaking by the man's wife.

72
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.890
- Will she show up today, and... - She's right there! She's here!

73
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.320
will she say anything...

74
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:25.120
Is the man of the affair your first boyfriend?

75
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.560
Jin Jin, is this all true?

76
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.490
Why did you decide to get involved in an affair?

77
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.341
("Yesterday, Never Dated, Today, a Woman in an Affair")

78
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:45.481
("Will She Go Down Like This?", "Sa Jin Jin Has an Affair")

79
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.260
(My brother)

80
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.461
When can you be free?

81
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.831
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

82
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:07.430
Who is it?

83
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:09.000
A friend.

84
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.940
A woman, right?

85
00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:16.041
She's a friend who's a woman.

86
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.411
You're rather suspicious.

87
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.880
I'm not suspicious. What are you up to?

88
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:27.450
I'm with a friend who's a woman.

89
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.661
Goodness, you are rather suspicious.

90
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.560
Give that to me. You should eat.

91
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.000
It's your turn to eat today.

92
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.171
Those who take care of the sick need to keep up the energy.

93
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.671
I heard you were at the hospital.

94
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.711
Your mother is more talkative than I thought.

95
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:54.411
I heard you gave her an envelope with some money.

96
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.481
You aren't a rich man either.

97
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.050
Gosh, you have a knack for making me feel sad.

98
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:03.151
Can't I do that much for you?

99
00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:04.421
It's not the time for you to worry about me.

100
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:07.021
Do you know how much you lost for getting involved in a fraud...

101
00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:09.630
- by being concerned about others? - All right, all right. Eat it.

102
00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:14.930
Don't worry about me. It's me, Anthony.

103
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.601
How can I not be worried? I'm your manager.

104
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:19.940
I'm sorry, my friend.

105
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.740
Oh, right. "Infinite Challenge" called me again.

106
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.680
A third episode of "Saturday Saturday is a Singer".

107
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.320
They want to do a comeback show...

108
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.151
for the 20th anniversary of Boys Be Ambitious.

109
00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:36.221
Sechs Kies made their comeback through "Infinite Challenge" too.

110
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.421
Let's give it a go.

111
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:40.591
We just have to convince Terius.

112
00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:43.961
Goodness, he's way too far from us right now.

113
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.240
I recently saw him at the broadcasting station.

114
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.671
I was very sure his eyes met with mine,

115
00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:58.310
but he ignored me and walked right by me.

116
00:07:58.981 --> 00:08:01.111
I was his manager for at least 10 years, right?

117
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.851
Goodness, he has no loyalty at all.

118
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.820
Oh, she's really loyal though.

119
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.851
- Who? - Sa Jin Jin.

120
00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:11.021
I saw her on a talk show,

121
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:13.060
and it looked like she's a huge fan of yours.

122
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.831
She's been your fan for 20 years. Did you watch it?

123
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.461
- No. - Make sure you do.

124
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:22.101
(MBC Broadcasting Station)

125
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.750
- Hello. - Excuse me.

126
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.951
Could you get cleared for entrance first?

127
00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:49.030
(Visitor Request)

128
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.530
(Name: Anthony)

129
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.581
(Name: Lee Chul Min)

130
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.221
Thank you. Please return this when you leave the place.

131
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.030
- Hey. - Yes?

132
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.941
Gosh, Anthony!

133
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.071
Darn it, I messed up.

134
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.941
My gosh.

135
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.370
You haven't changed, Terius.

136
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.910
That's such an old nickname.

137
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.111
It's Jung Chang Hoon now.

138
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.181
- Why are you here? - Oh, right.

139
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.920
I was here to see a director...

140
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.851
and noticed your name on the door.

141
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.760
Well done, well done.

142
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:52.721
No!

143
00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:55.331
Why did that have to happen?

144
00:09:55.331 --> 00:09:56.760
I read an article about your slump.

145
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.801
Cheer up. Let's have a drink one day.

146
00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:02.071
What a rotten hand.

147
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.640
Okay, okay. What did you say?

148
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.910
Never mind. Take care.

149
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:11.510
Bye.

150
00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.240
Oh, wait.

151
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:16.280
Have you heard from "Infinite Challenge"?

152
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:19.351
They're talking about a reunion.

153
00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:21.351
They're calling me nonstop.

154
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.061
Are they?

155
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:26.691
Something about a 20th anniversary.

156
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:32.260
Why would we return as Boys Be Ambitious now?

157
00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:38.740
A legend should remain as a legend. Don't you think?

158
00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:45.910
I just want you to find a job you can regularly work...

159
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.211
and that pays you on time.

160
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:49.851
I don't want to expect much.

161
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:51.681
You expect way too much.

162
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.821
Mom, you really don't have to worry today.

163
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.290
I promise I'll get in.

164
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.990
- Don't be so cheeky. - I mean it.

165
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.160
Now you can sleep well at night...

166
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.961
and get ready to go traveling with my money.

167
00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:06.061
Okay, Mom?

168
00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:07.971
You fool. Get going.

169
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.630
See you.

170
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:22.051
How do you...

171
00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:24.721
plan to promote yourself in this interview?

172
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.290
I came here determined to...

173
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.620
show you how well-mannered and diligent I am.

174
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.431
Next, Sa Min Ho.

175
00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:40.030
I came here believing that the first clients...

176
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.471
I will meet are you, my interviewers.

177
00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:44.740
I have worked many part-time jobs...

178
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.941
and learned first-hand that everyone has...

179
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:48.510
a different personality and taste.

180
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.870
When dealing with a client,

181
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.540
I think it's important to figure out what they really want.

182
00:11:53.811 --> 00:11:55.481
If I were to join the company,

183
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:58.020
I would pinpoint the client's needs quickly and accurately,

184
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.390
and I'd create the appropriate strategy as a marketer.

185
00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:07.831
Candidates number 218 and 220, come in.

186
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:09.591
Did you do okay?

187
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.361
I don't remember a thing.

188
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But I think I did okay.

189
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.500
Well done.

190
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.400
Just get an average score.

191
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.370
The interview's just a formality.

192
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.811
Okay. Thank you.

193
00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:23.510
I'll call you within three days.

194
00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:26.240
Have the greatest time of your life today, okay?

195
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.280
The good times are over once you start working.

196
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.451
- You'll enter a fire pit. - Okay.

197
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.331
- Drink some of this. - I'm really late today.

198
00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:46.801
It's not that late.

199
00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:48.731
- I have to go. - Hey, hey.

200
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:51.270
- No, no, no. - Is the work hard?

201
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.701
- How's your boss? - Oh, no.

202
00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:54.170
Oh, no, no, no.

203
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:02.380
I heard you're a very famous lawyer.

204
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.691
I came to ask for your help. Please help me out, sir.

205
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.160
I'll tell you again.

206
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.900
You must tell me everything honestly and not leave anything out.

207
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.301
Even if it's incriminating.

208
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.941
If something I don't know comes up in court,

209
00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:28.040
- I can't defend you. - My memory's...

210
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.941
Try hard to remember.

211
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.051
I am really, really sorry.

212
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.321
Excuse me. I think you should find another lawyer.

213
00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:51.660
They deserve to be carried off by tigers.

214
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.931
They borrow my money and never pay me back.

215
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.201
Shall I be honest? Shall I?

216
00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:01.571
I demanded a tiny amount of interest. Just 5,000 percent.

217
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:03.540
Others charge 6,000 to 7,000 percent,

218
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.910
but not me. I have a conscience.

219
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.780
I was going to crush their skulls,

220
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.681
but I called them instead. And they threw a fit.

221
00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:13.150
They want to sue me for blackmailing.

222
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.191
Mr. Lawyer?

223
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.920
If you make this go away,

224
00:14:19.321 --> 00:14:22.390
I'll pay you enough for you to have mojito in Maldives.

225
00:14:24.861 --> 00:14:26.561
Dear respected Mr. Lawyer.

226
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:30.000
I left the money I'd saved up with a neighbor...

227
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.571
I've known for many, many years.

228
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.611
That neighbor channeled the energy of outer space...

229
00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:37.540
and moved to Germany.

230
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:41.280
I did not save the money to give it to her.

231
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.311
I am overwhelmed with shame.

232
00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:47.551
I'm really sorry, but I can't take your case.

233
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:51.461
You have a license to practice law.

234
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.260
Is it that hard to defend people?

235
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.681
Hello.

236
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:20.280
Hello.

237
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.461
What did you have for lunch today?

238
00:15:25.961 --> 00:15:27.461
I had kimchi stew.

239
00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.530
- Why? - Because you are...

240
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.231
so much more handsome than yesterday.

241
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.170
Do you want to drink coffee?

242
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.201
You are the most generous man.

243
00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:51.280
- Can you make her a cup of coffee? - Sure.

244
00:15:53.321 --> 00:15:54.721
Hello? This is Lawyer Kang.

245
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:59.821
- Are you new here? - Yes.

246
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.591
I'd like it better if a pretty lady gave me a cup of coffee.

247
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.301
Make it delicious, please.

248
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.301
I have lived for almost 60 years

249
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:13.170
If you try to leave me now

250
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.770
I will tell you I am still young

251
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:37.601
(Norwegian Wood)

252
00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:52.681
- What are you doing? - I'm having ramyeon.

253
00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:54.111
Let's go to an internet cafe.

254
00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:55.811
You'll start working soon.

255
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.221
I'll call you within three days.

256
00:17:00.821 --> 00:17:02.750
Have the greatest time of your life today, okay?

257
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.821
The good times are over once you start working.

258
00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:07.291
You'll enter a fire pit.

259
00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:11.261
Just a moment.

260
00:17:20.101 --> 00:17:22.970
- Is he busy? - The call cannot be...

261
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.351
Thank you.

262
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.331
Han grabs the ball and throws it back.

263
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.601
Choi is a great...

264
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.440
What should we do?

265
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.771
I think my heart's about to explode.

266
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.011
Move, move.

267
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.980
Get on the elevator.

268
00:17:58.341 --> 00:17:59.910
It's not a life-threatening...

269
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.491
Dongdaemun in the middle of the night?

270
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.720
My sick leave is almost up.

271
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.091
I'm going clothes shopping with some colleagues.

272
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.031
I'm going to meet the co-pilot,

273
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:18.861
but I have nothing to wear.

274
00:18:18.861 --> 00:18:21.170
You have lots of clothes. Your room's full of...

275
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.470
Stop, stop, that's enough.

276
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.541
I can barely stand my mom's nagging.

277
00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:30.170
"Love Letter" is in theater again.

278
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.640
Jin Jin would love that.

279
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.251
She loves that movie.

280
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:38.980
She's such a show-off.

281
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.091
She wants to pretend like she's the innocent one.

282
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.261
My bus is here. I have to go.

283

The remastered version is in cinemas now.

The current temperature is 23℃, and the humidity is 59 percent.

Right now...

296
00:20:44.511 --> 00:20:46.781
Dating alone isn't that hard.

297
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.511
It's tough to start.

298
00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:51.920
And the beginning is the most exciting time.

299
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.660
Jin Jin, what signals...

300
00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.521
the beginning of love?

301
00:20:59.521 --> 00:21:02.130

- with a movie. - A movie?

305
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.021
You feel everything when you watch a movie together for the first time.

306
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.430
How the person sitting next to you moves,

307
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.031
how he breathes.

308
00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:40.700
You can even smell his scent.

309
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.301
You can't focus at all on the movie, and you feel those instead.

310
00:21:47.571 --> 00:21:51.680
That you'll end up liking that person. Or loving him.

311
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.910
You said love for you starts with a movie.

312

Can you think of a movie right now?

Are you angry? But I'm glad to see you again after so long.

320

327

We have just one condition. A partnership.
