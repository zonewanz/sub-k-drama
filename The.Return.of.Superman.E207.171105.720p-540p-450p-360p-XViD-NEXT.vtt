1
00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:04.006
(Parental guidance advised for viewers under the age of 12.)

2
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:07.036
(Gimpo International
Airport)

3
00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:08.237
(International Terminal)

4
00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.746
We've arrived. Hurrah.

5
00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.077
Which family is
at the airport today?

6
00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:16.277
(Who are they?)

7
00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:17.816
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah.

8
00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:19.747
(Horsing around)

9
00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:21.587
It's none other than
the Choo family..

10
00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.186
It's been a while
Sa Rang.

11
00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.256
She sure has
grown a lot.

12
00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.056
Because we were
invited back...

13
00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:29.997
for the third anniversary,

14
00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:32.497
Sa Rang was able to
make great memories.

15
00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:35.367
I also wanted to help
celebrate the fourth.

16
00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.236
So, we're back.

17
00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:39.337
I'm going to get ahead.

18
00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:44.376
(Sa Rang sure is lovely.)

19
00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:49.447
But why are they
at the airport today?

20
00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.316
She'll be out soon.
Come over here.

21
00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:53.687
Hold this up
when she arrives.

22
00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.517
- Like daddy.
- You do it, Daddy.

23
00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:59.056
(She's very excited.)

24
00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.397
(He's even prepared
welcome drinks.)

25
00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:04.727
Daddy, not yet.

26
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.496
Hurry, hurry.

27
00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:09.766
She's here.

28
00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:12.436
She's here.

29
00:01:13.337 --> 00:01:16.977
(Who is this person
they've been waiting for?)

30
00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.977
They're here.

31
00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:22.377
It's Sa Rang's older
cousin, Yume.

32
00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:23.746
(Yume)

33
00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:26.386
Okay, let's go.

34
00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.916
Whenever they meet,

35
00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:30.016
Sa Rang would fly
with excitement.

36
00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:32.026
(They're always excited
when they're together.)

37
00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:33.727
(That's dangerous.)

38
00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:37.757
And Yume would look
after Sa Rang.

39
00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:40.966
(Yume, Sa Rang's
dependable cousin)

40
00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:44.397
(This dreamy duo
are like sisters.)

41
00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:47.966
To Sa Rang, an only child,
Yume is like her sister.

42
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:51.007
We're here working
around a fixed schedule.

43
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:55.347
Sa Rang suggested
inviting Yume as well.

44
00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:58.447
Yume agreed that she
wanted to come to Korea.

45
00:01:58.546 --> 00:01:59.947
That's how we
came to invite her.

46
00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:03.216
(Welcome to
Republic of Korea)

47
00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:04.416
Good job.

48
00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:08.156
Let's drink
the welcome drink.

49
00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:09.257
It's juice.

50
00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:10.927
Cheers.

51
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.166
Onward.

52
00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.467
(The carbonation
is strong.)

53
00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:18.967
Okay, it's time for this.

54
00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:21.777
(This is Sa Rang's
welcome present.)

55
00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:26.076
They're matching outfits
for us to wear.

56
00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:28.317
Just wear it now.

57
00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.217
(Are they out?)

58
00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:37.456
(The fighter smiles
widely for his daughter.)

59
00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.657
(They're adorable.)

60
00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:45.697
It's so cute.

61
00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:46.997
It's nice.

62
00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.336
(The fathers melt over the
adorable transformation.)

63
00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.166
You're so cute, Sa Rang.

64
00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:54.437
You're so cute.

65
00:02:55.377 --> 00:02:57.537
You're totally cute.

66
00:02:57.537 --> 00:02:59.106
Yume, you're so cute too.

67
00:02:59.576 --> 00:03:01.277
(Feeling shy)

68
00:03:02.347 --> 00:03:04.146
Okay, let's go.

69
00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:08.856
Now we're going to visit
a bunny cafe.

70
00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:10.856
I've never been.

71
00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:12.287
Let's go.

72
00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:15.127
Let's go. Okay.

73
00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:17.057
(We're going to
a bunny cafe.)

74
00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:21.597
Sa Rang's tour
with Yume...

75
00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:22.967
begins now.

76
00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:31.277
(Sa Rang fixes
the camera's angle.)

77
00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:34.106
We've departing now.

78
00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:37.146
Yes, to the bunny cafe!

79
00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:40.687
(Sa Rang's
Korean classroom)

80
00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:44.416
How do you say
"delicious" in Korean?

81
00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:45.557
"Delicious".

82
00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:48.627
- Delicious?
- That's right.

83
00:03:48.757 --> 00:03:50.497
Then, what's "cute"
in Korean?

84
00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:51.597
Cute.

85
00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:52.967
Cute.

86
00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:54.326
Cute.

87
00:03:54.426 --> 00:03:55.636
Cute.

88
00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.037
Say "awesome" in Korean.

89
00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:59.106
"Awesome".

90
00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:00.136
Amazing.

91
00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:03.407
(Put the two
words together.)

92
00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:05.847
(Then, you get, "That's
amazingly delicious".)

93
00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:08.817
- Delicious.
- It's very delicious.

94
00:04:09.277 --> 00:04:10.916
What's the opposite
of awesome?

95
00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:12.947
Gosh.

96
00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:14.416
Gosh?

97
00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:15.416
Goodness.

98
00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:16.616
(Following along)

99
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:18.826
(The intensive Korean
class comes to an end.)

100
00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:19.926
All right. Let's go.

101
00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.927
(It's the international
"Zero Game".)

102
00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.096
One and two, zero.

103
00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:30.036
I win.

104
00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:35.836
Sa Rang, we're
at Hongdae now.

105
00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:38.177
(They've arrived
at the bunny cafe.)

106
00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.677
- Sa Rang.
- Hello.

107
00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:42.646
The first stop of the tour
is the bunny cafe.

108
00:04:42.646 --> 00:04:44.677
It's a place where
you can feed...

109
00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:47.247
and have a great time
with bunnies.

110
00:04:47.247 --> 00:04:49.617
Look over here.
They're siblings.

111
00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:52.226
(The bunny brothers
welcome the lovely duo.)

112
00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:54.526
Please put on the apron.

113
00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.057
Here.

114
00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:57.596
Us too?

115
00:04:59.927 --> 00:05:00.966
Okay.

116
00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:05.636
(The fighter's cuteness
factor goes up.)

117
00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:07.737
Due to his
muscular frame...

118
00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:08.976
(The apron hardly
goes around him.)

119
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.747
Please apply
the hand sanitizers.

120
00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:13.276
Do it like this, Yume.

121
00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.747
Rub it like this.

122
00:05:14.817 --> 00:05:15.877
Like this.

123
00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:17.677
(She translates for her.)

124
00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:20.317
- He's so cute.
- This is a Holland Lop.

125
00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:22.117
His ears come down
to his sides.

126
00:05:22.117 --> 00:05:29.197
This bunny's ears
come down to the side.

127
00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:30.896
It's so cute.

128
00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:32.197
It's so cute.

129
00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.336
It's so plump.

130
00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:36.797
It's so plump.

131
00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:38.367
Sa Rang, you
have to choose.

132
00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:41.036
- You have to choose one.
- We have to choose...

133
00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:43.536
one to pet now.

134
00:05:44.237 --> 00:05:47.547
(She chooses a bunny.)

135
00:05:48.177 --> 00:05:50.146
Which one do you like?

136
00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:51.786
Let's pick this one.

137
00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:54.917
Then, I'll pick the
droopy ears.

138
00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:57.016
Then, I'll follow you.

139
00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:00.357
Now that we think
about it, Sa Rang...

140
00:06:00.357 --> 00:06:01.497
(She always...)

141
00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:03.997
(wanted to copy her.)

142
00:06:06.026 --> 00:06:08.997
She always
looked up to Yume.

143
00:06:08.997 --> 00:06:11.167
(She always watched
for Yume's choices.)

144
00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.737
I like the same one
as Yume.

145
00:06:15.677 --> 00:06:18.146
(Sa Rang always
looked up to her.)

146
00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:19.307
It's the same.

147
00:06:19.877 --> 00:06:21.576
This one and that one.

148
00:06:21.576 --> 00:06:24.276
Then, please go
sit over there.

149
00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:25.687
- I'll bring them to you.
- Over there?

150
00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:29.357
She said that she'll
bring them to us.

151
00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:30.357
Let's go.

152
00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:32.286
Over here.

153
00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.656
Everyone, over here.

154
00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:35.497
Here's a hairband.

155
00:06:35.497 --> 00:06:36.656
(Bunny-ear hairband)

156
00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:38.927
(Pink aprons
and bunny ears)

157
00:06:38.927 --> 00:06:40.896
Give me one too.

158
00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:44.836
This has to be a lie.

159
00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:47.136
(They excitedly
transform into bunnies.)

160
00:06:49.237 --> 00:06:51.237
Look at him.
That's so funny.

161
00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:56.776
(They display
their cuteness.)

162
00:06:57.947 --> 00:07:00.447
(A bunny enters.)

163
00:07:02.386 --> 00:07:04.456
(It's totally her
type of thing.)

164
00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:05.757
Pet it.

165
00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:07.726
- It's over here.
- It's just so cute.

166
00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:09.497
(She mixes up
2 languages.)

167
00:07:09.497 --> 00:07:10.526
Bunny.

168
00:07:10.526 --> 00:07:13.127
It doesn't bite, right.
It is calm.

169
00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:18.807
(The duo has fallen
for the bunny's charms.)

170
00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:21.307
It's so cute.

171
00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:27.706
You want a carrot,
don't you.

172
00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:29.346
(Are you copying
my speech?)

173
00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:31.747
How is it, Sa Rang?
Isn't it cute?

174
00:07:31.747 --> 00:07:33.516
It's so cute.

175
00:07:34.117 --> 00:07:35.617
Is it cute, Yume?

176
00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:37.386
It's amazingly cute.

177
00:07:37.386 --> 00:07:39.257
(She uses the Korean
she learned earlier.)

178
00:07:39.427 --> 00:07:41.357
Take a seat, Sa Rang.

179
00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:42.997
Take a seat too, Yume.

180
00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:44.596
He's telling you to sit.

181
00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.627
There is money
inside these.

182
00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:50.997
Think about what you want
and go shopping.

183
00:07:50.997 --> 00:07:52.406
You can buy what you want.

184
00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:53.766
Lucky.

185
00:07:57.237 --> 00:08:00.377
- Thank you.
- Sa Rang.

186
00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:02.677
Let's meet at
the bathhouse later.

187
00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:03.716
Okay.

188
00:08:04.677 --> 00:08:07.586
The lovely duo is out
to shop at Hongdae.

189
00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:09.057
(There is a lot
to see here.)

190
00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:14.026
(They're forever excited.)

191
00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.427
Where do you want to go?

192
00:08:17.557 --> 00:08:18.896
This is cute.

193
00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:22.536
(They visit
an accessory shop.)

194
00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:25.036
They choose to visit
an accessory shop.

195
00:08:25.437 --> 00:08:27.266
Is this an earring?

196
00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:29.776
Can you make
us earrings...

197
00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:33.677
for non-pierced ears?

198
00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:35.917
Then, you have to
select from these.

199
00:08:35.917 --> 00:08:37.547
They're for
non-pierced ears.

200
00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:40.887
Which one
should we choose?

201
00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:44.586
(I've chosen you.)

202
00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:47.787
Let's go.

203
00:08:48.197 --> 00:08:49.557
Come inside.

204
00:08:49.557 --> 00:08:51.927
Let's go inside.

205
00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:54.767
I'll change these for you.

206
00:08:55.866 --> 00:08:57.137
You can have some.

207
00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:58.307
(It's on the house.)

208
00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:01.506
It's good.

209
00:09:01.506 --> 00:09:02.637
Is it good?

210
00:09:02.637 --> 00:09:03.937
Then, you can have it all.

211
00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:06.346
She said we can
have it all.

212
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.917
Sa Rang, try these on.

213
00:09:12.047 --> 00:09:13.116
It looks good.

214
00:09:13.216 --> 00:09:16.887
You just open this up
and put it on your ear.

215
00:09:17.187 --> 00:09:18.887
It becomes like this.
It doesn't hurt, right?

216
00:09:18.887 --> 00:09:19.956
Yes.

217
00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:22.726
It's done. Take a look
in the mirror.

218
00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:24.397
(Her loveliness
increases.)

219
00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.797
All done.

220
00:09:28.797 --> 00:09:30.197
(She's pleased.)

221
00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:31.736
It's pretty.

222
00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:38.777
(The duo is happy.)

223
00:09:39.307 --> 00:09:41.246
Have a great day.

224
00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:43.417
Have a great day.

225
00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:45.687
(Feeling embarrassed)

226
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.246
See you again.

227
00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:49.157
The second stop
is a makeup store.

228
00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.657
Something to tap on
would be nice.

229
00:09:54.657 --> 00:09:57.427
(You're already going to
put on makeup?)

230
00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:01.197
Let's surprise them.

231
00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:03.966
I think a lipstick might
be better, no?

232
00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:07.466
Something to look good
on our moms.

233
00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:11.576
(The two kind daughters
shop for their mothers.)

234
00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:18.447
(Heave-ho)

235
00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:22.756
(Color test)

236
00:10:23.716 --> 00:10:26.086
(Applying carefully)

237
00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:30.256
(Sa Rang just
pastes it on.)

238
00:10:32.697 --> 00:10:35.736
(They laugh looking
at themselves.)

239
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.407
It became blood.

240
00:10:39.537 --> 00:10:41.937
Look, I have
blood here too.

241
00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.846
(They're having fun...)

242
00:10:44.846 --> 00:10:46.576
(instead of shopping
for their mothers.)

243
00:10:46.576 --> 00:10:48.876
I mixed these
two together.

244
00:10:50.876 --> 00:10:52.116
What are you doing?

245
00:10:54.116 --> 00:10:57.216
(Forever happy)

246
00:10:57.456 --> 00:11:01.726
Should we try calling
your mom, Yume?

247
00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:03.057
Sounds good.

248
00:11:04.157 --> 00:11:05.397
Mom.

249
00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.397
- Yume.
- Mom, I'm buying this.

250
00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:12.307
What are you doing?
Are you prettying up?

251
00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:16.177
No, this is for you.

252
00:11:16.606 --> 00:11:18.346
Is it for me?

253
00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:21.716
Thank you.
How kind of you.

254
00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:23.846
Are you wearing
matching outfits?

255
00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:25.817
Are you idol stars?

256
00:11:25.817 --> 00:11:26.986
No, we're not.

257
00:11:29.157 --> 00:11:31.927
(Showing off her earrings)

258
00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:37.557
(She gets to the point
and hangs up.)

259
00:11:37.657 --> 00:11:40.267
Please get us one each.

260
00:11:45.067 --> 00:11:46.506
One more, please.

261
00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:47.907
(Paying is a
piece of cake now.)

262
00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.277
Shopping is so much fun,
Sa Rang.

263
00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.106
Hold on, please.

264
00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:58.047
(They almost left
their items behind.)

265
00:11:58.716 --> 00:12:01.986
The bathhouse is the
final part of their tour.

266
00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:05.387
What is this?

267
00:12:06.557 --> 00:12:09.096
- A bathhouse.
- A bathhouse?

268
00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:16.437
How did she know how
to put on the key?

269
00:12:20.336 --> 00:12:24.006
(She always loved
the bathhouse.)

270
00:12:24.137 --> 00:12:28.346
Sa Rang used to visit
since she was young.

271
00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:30.346
How cute.

272
00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:31.986
(Now, she's a pro.)

273
00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:34.447
You can even eat here.

274
00:12:34.917 --> 00:12:35.986
Great.

275
00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:39.027
(First, is the moderate
heat steam room.)

276
00:12:39.027 --> 00:12:40.787
How refreshing.

277
00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:46.126
This feels great.

278
00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:50.437
(It's a new world.)

279
00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:53.336
(They escape after
30 seconds.)

280
00:12:55.037 --> 00:12:58.547
(They head to the
cold room after.)

281
00:12:59.647 --> 00:13:00.907
It's the South Pole.

282
00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:06.287
(Fidgeting around)

283
00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:11.826
(Please save us.)

284
00:13:15.096 --> 00:13:16.856
Sikhye, please.

285
00:13:17.527 --> 00:13:19.297
Thank you.

286
00:13:19.897 --> 00:13:21.096
Let's eat this.

287
00:13:22.037 --> 00:13:24.736
Sa Rang, is this rice?

288
00:13:27.637 --> 00:13:29.277
(Knocking)

289
00:13:30.706 --> 00:13:33.547
(Surprise)

290
00:13:33.606 --> 00:13:34.976
Here's a present.

291
00:13:37.346 --> 00:13:38.486
What did you buy?

292
00:13:38.846 --> 00:13:41.246
We bought two
earrings each.

293
00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:44.756
- What else?
- Mom's makeup.

294
00:13:45.287 --> 00:13:46.986
(Feeling proud)

295
00:13:46.986 --> 00:13:48.897
What is this, Sa Rang?

296
00:13:48.897 --> 00:13:50.856
(What is this item
he doesn't recognize?)

297
00:13:51.567 --> 00:13:53.826
(Front bang roller)

298
00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.637
Let's try this on Shogo.

299
00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:59.067
This is for you, Shogo.

300
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.236
(We wish you great skin.)

301
00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:04.746
Okay.

302
00:14:05.576 --> 00:14:07.947
(He rubs the essence
on his skin.)

303
00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.716
I've never done
something like this.

304
00:14:13.017 --> 00:14:15.157
- You have to wait.
- You look great.

305
00:14:19.086 --> 00:14:22.197
(A lip mask
becomes a nose mask.)

306
00:14:24.657 --> 00:14:28.697
(He looks like
he drank too much.)

307
00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:32.907
(Now, it's Sung Hoon's
makeover time.)

308
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.807
(Being careful)

309
00:14:35.807 --> 00:14:36.836
How is it?

310
00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:38.746
How is it?

311
00:14:40.307 --> 00:14:41.547
It's a little weird.

312
00:14:41.677 --> 00:14:43.447
- What?
- It's a little weird.

313
00:14:45.447 --> 00:14:48.017
Are you sure you're
Sung Hoon the fighter?

314
00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:50.387
We're going to go
to a theme park tomorrow.

315
00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:54.427
(A theme park?
What's the occasion?)

316
00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:57.596
In just a moment...

317
00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:58.626
What's going on?

318
00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:01.027
(They head to where...)

319
00:15:01.027 --> 00:15:02.096
(the whole Superman
family awaits.)

320
00:15:02.096 --> 00:15:03.096
Sa Rang.

321
00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:06.006
Yano Shiho is here.

322
00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:07.907
Yano Shiho.

323
00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.736
(Seung Jae is
feeling friendly.)

324
00:15:10.907 --> 00:15:12.746
Yano Shiho.

325
00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:16.716
The whole gang is here for
the fourth anniversary.

326
00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:17.817
Hello.

327
00:15:17.817 --> 00:15:20.047
- Say "Hello".
- Hello.

328
00:15:21.346 --> 00:15:22.616
(William is cute.)

329
00:15:22.616 --> 00:15:24.456
Handshake.

330
00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:25.826
Isn't he cute?

331
00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:28.427
The Return of Superman,
4th anniversary special.

332
00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:30.657
"Love Is the
Warmest Temperature".

333
00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:34.767
What is this box sitting
in Lo Hee's living room?

334
00:15:35.137 --> 00:15:36.437
Guess what this is.

335
00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:38.537
(What is that?)

336
00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:39.706
What do you think this is?

337
00:15:40.267 --> 00:15:42.206
- Let's see.
- Shall we?

338
00:15:43.836 --> 00:15:45.047
It's empty.

339
00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:47.506
We're going to place
items in here.

340
00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.876
Things you don't use.
No, not you.

341
00:15:50.947 --> 00:15:54.017
No, not you. You're mine.

342
00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.017
Lo Hee.

343
00:15:56.017 --> 00:15:58.287
(She expresses herself
with her whole body.)

344
00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:02.557
(Daddy isn't easy
to get around.)

345
00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:06.826
(While Lo Hee and her dad
is playing around...)

346
00:16:06.826 --> 00:16:10.067
I've prepared this.

347
00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:14.307
Let's collect some items
to give to some children.

348
00:16:14.437 --> 00:16:16.807
For the show's fourth
anniversary,

349
00:16:17.037 --> 00:16:18.777
we're going to do
a share drive.

350
00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:22.547
We're compiling items
we don't use anymore...

351
00:16:22.846 --> 00:16:25.547
and selling them
at a good price.

352
00:16:25.716 --> 00:16:28.856
The profits will be used
to help children in need.

353
00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:32.927
I'm going to give this
away. It's okay, right?

354
00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:35.057
No, you can't.

355
00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:38.667
(It helped supervise
my first steps.)

356
00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:40.767
This precious cat doll...

357
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:43.067
watched over her
first steps.

358
00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:48.236
Honey, look at these.

359
00:16:49.777 --> 00:16:51.846
And even a fond rattler.

360
00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:53.746
Gosh. It wasn't
all that long ago.

361
00:16:55.677 --> 00:16:57.216
But this is mine.

362
00:16:58.486 --> 00:17:01.917
Since you don't
play with that,

363
00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.817
I plan on gifting them
to some children.

364
00:17:03.817 --> 00:17:06.086
- You can't.
- Do you remember this?

365
00:17:06.086 --> 00:17:09.427
You wore this
for your birthday.

366
00:17:10.226 --> 00:17:12.397
- That doesn't fit now?
- Yes, they all came over.

367
00:17:12.496 --> 00:17:13.867
- She's sure grown.
- Come here, Lo Hee.

368
00:17:14.697 --> 00:17:16.637
Kids, come here.

369
00:17:16.637 --> 00:17:21.006
(Lo Hee wore this
for a birthday party.)

370
00:17:22.137 --> 00:17:24.276
Let's see how much
you've grown.

371
00:17:24.907 --> 00:17:26.046
That's a top?

372
00:17:27.607 --> 00:17:29.516
It's like a T-shirt now.

373
00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:31.887
This used to be
a dress on you.

374
00:17:33.316 --> 00:17:35.417
It used to go down
to her knees.

375
00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:38.327
Lee Hee, now your
diaper is visible.

376
00:17:38.927 --> 00:17:42.256
Let's sell this so others
can look cute too.

377
00:17:42.857 --> 00:17:44.456
Sell them well, okay?

378
00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:46.197
(The box is filled with
precious items.)

379
00:17:46.897 --> 00:17:48.296
Let's pour them in.

380
00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:51.867
You're giving them
all away? Really?

381
00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:54.976
I'm giving the
baby dinosaur away.

382
00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:56.577
- All of them, though?
- Yes.

383
00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:58.347
What else, Seung Jae?

384
00:17:59.577 --> 00:18:00.776
This one.

385
00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:04.016
I'm going to give
all of these away.

386
00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:08.657
(Meanwhile,
he's a bit worried.)

387
00:18:08.657 --> 00:18:10.617
Don't look for them
later, okay?

388
00:18:10.617 --> 00:18:12.256
Okay. Daddy.

389
00:18:12.256 --> 00:18:14.286
(Now, what else?)

390
00:18:15.056 --> 00:18:17.397
- This one too.
- That one too?

391
00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:23.796
(He shared many
moments with these toys.)

392
00:18:25.966 --> 00:18:27.736
(He adds a huge
fork crane toy.)

393
00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:29.276
The octopus too.

394
00:18:29.306 --> 00:18:30.306
Octopus?

395
00:18:30.306 --> 00:18:32.546
The police car too.

396
00:18:32.607 --> 00:18:35.147
And the robot.

397
00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.377
You're giving
the robot away?

398
00:18:36.677 --> 00:18:38.887
Seung Jae is
a generous angel.

399
00:18:39.917 --> 00:18:42.417
The car too.

400
00:18:42.617 --> 00:18:44.087
And the car?

401
00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:46.956
(This little angel
enjoys giving.)

402
00:18:46.956 --> 00:18:48.026
Are you happy?

403
00:18:48.157 --> 00:18:50.796
This one too to sleep on.

404
00:18:50.857 --> 00:18:54.296
No, not this one.
It's your pillow.

405
00:18:55.097 --> 00:18:57.097
You can't. You only
have one pillow.

406
00:18:57.466 --> 00:18:59.907
Should we give away
your baby books too?

407
00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:03.276
Just one book.
I'll give away one.

408
00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:06.806
They'll like
my gifts, right?

409
00:19:07.206 --> 00:19:08.917
Yes, they'll be
extremely happy.

410
00:19:08.917 --> 00:19:12.746
William is not prepared
to part with his stuff.

411
00:19:12.746 --> 00:19:14.546
We have to live
doing good deeds.

412
00:19:15.256 --> 00:19:17.617
We'll send good things
and lead a good life.

413
00:19:18.327 --> 00:19:19.327
(In the
five siblings' box)

414
00:19:20.357 --> 00:19:22.357
Surprise.

415
00:19:24.657 --> 00:19:27.266
The siblings manage
to fill their box too.

416
00:19:29.066 --> 00:19:31.097
- Let's sell this too.
- What?

417
00:19:31.966 --> 00:19:33.506
(Gosh)

418
00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.706
That's precious.

419
00:19:34.877 --> 00:19:37.077
They even bring
Hwi Jae's stuff.

420
00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:40.206
(He tests it out.)

421
00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:46.016
You look like Flashman.
Go get them.

422
00:19:48.316 --> 00:19:51.316
(21st century Flashman)

423
00:19:51.726 --> 00:19:54.857
Hence, preparations for
the drive is complete.

424
00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.127
It's a good day today.

425
00:19:56.256 --> 00:19:58.996
It won't be just about
our items.

426
00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:02.466
We'll be taking items
from our acquaintances.

427
00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:05.137
We'll be distributing
the profits...

428
00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:08.706
to children in need.

429
00:20:09.506 --> 00:20:12.377
She has the same name
as I do.

430
00:20:12.476 --> 00:20:14.206
She's So Yu Jin.

431
00:20:14.407 --> 00:20:16.476
So Yu Jin.

432
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:18.617
Lo Hee, that's for sale.

433
00:20:19.147 --> 00:20:20.316
Or you can buy it.

434
00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:23.187
How much will do?

435
00:20:23.187 --> 00:20:24.827
"How much will do?"

436
00:20:26.456 --> 00:20:28.996
You guys are heavy now.

437
00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:30.956
Kids. Look at me.

438
00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.496
Am I smaller or bigger?

439
00:20:33.026 --> 00:20:34.837
- You're smaller.
- Right?

440
00:20:35.736 --> 00:20:36.966
(Si An, the little
grim reaper)

441
00:20:36.966 --> 00:20:39.566
This man awaits
the five siblings.

442
00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:40.607
(They meet Grim Reaper.)

443
00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.536
It's Lee Dong Wook.

444
00:20:43.536 --> 00:20:44.706
(The trio's uncle,
Lee Dong Wook)

445
00:20:45.407 --> 00:20:47.506
- Let me whisper to you.
- Whisper to me? Why?

446
00:20:50.077 --> 00:20:51.647
It doesn't feel good
to whisper, does it?

447
00:20:54.147 --> 00:20:56.587
Si An, shall we be
on the same side today...

448
00:20:56.887 --> 00:20:58.286
and have our revenge
on your dad?

449
00:20:58.687 --> 00:21:00.526
What? Revenge?

450
00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:01.857
(Si An becomes
charismatic.)

451
00:21:04.627 --> 00:21:06.327
It starts now.

452
00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:10.296
Hello, everyone.

453
00:21:10.296 --> 00:21:12.036
It's nice to meet you.

454
00:21:13.536 --> 00:21:15.736
My friend is here.
Greet him well.

455
00:21:15.736 --> 00:21:18.407
(Who visited the twins
in the morning?)

456
00:21:20.177 --> 00:21:22.447
- Say, "Hello."
- Hello.

457
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:24.546
Hwi Jae. Hello.

458
00:21:24.647 --> 00:21:26.516
Saeng Min.

459
00:21:26.516 --> 00:21:27.687
Hwi Jae.

460
00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.756
It's Kim Saeng Min,
who is a celebrity...

461
00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.627
at the height
of his popularity.

462
00:21:33.157 --> 00:21:34.657
(He is the fairy
of bankbook.)

463
00:21:34.657 --> 00:21:36.397
He was
with his girlfriend.

464
00:21:37.127 --> 00:21:38.327
It's sneaky and great.

465
00:21:39.526 --> 00:21:41.367
- Hello.
- Hello.

466
00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:43.667
We could have had coffee
outside.

467
00:21:44.296 --> 00:21:45.907
Hwi Jae, it's the best
to be at home.

468
00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:48.437
- I would have paid.
- That's not necessary.

469
00:21:48.837 --> 00:21:50.306
Instant coffee is fine.

470
00:21:50.306 --> 00:21:51.706
- Instant coffee?
- Yes.

471
00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:53.607
- No Americano?
- No.

472
00:21:53.607 --> 00:21:55.177
We could have met outside.

473
00:21:55.546 --> 00:21:58.246
Hwi Jae, I wanted
to come here.

474
00:21:58.887 --> 00:22:00.447
You drive me crazy.

475
00:22:00.447 --> 00:22:02.486
- Do you want more water?
- This is good.

476
00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:04.456
- Do you work out?
- Yes, I do.

477
00:22:04.986 --> 00:22:08.456
I am one-year junior
to your dad.

478
00:22:08.456 --> 00:22:10.197
- One-year junior.
- One-year junior.

479
00:22:10.197 --> 00:22:12.167
Do you know
what "Junior" means?

480
00:22:12.167 --> 00:22:13.566
We went to the university
together.

481
00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:15.637
Do you know
what "University" means?

482
00:22:15.837 --> 00:22:17.197
(It's a piece of cake.)

483
00:22:17.197 --> 00:22:18.367
We went to the university
together.

484
00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:21.036
Your dad made
a lot of money back then.

485
00:22:21.036 --> 00:22:22.736
He bought us tasty food.

486
00:22:23.236 --> 00:22:26.607
In 1994,
he bought me,

487
00:22:27.177 --> 00:22:31.546
Chung Sung Hwa,
and Shim Tae Yoon...

488
00:22:33.187 --> 00:22:34.316
a lot of tasty food.

489
00:22:34.316 --> 00:22:35.986
That happened years ago.

490
00:22:36.687 --> 00:22:38.827
He continues to share
stories of Hwi Jae.

491
00:22:39.887 --> 00:22:41.597
(What is this smell?)

492
00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:44.556
You farted, right?

493
00:22:46.827 --> 00:22:47.996
(Running away)

494
00:22:47.996 --> 00:22:49.536
- He farted.
- My goodness.

495
00:22:50.097 --> 00:22:51.736
Uncle must be surprised.

496
00:22:51.736 --> 00:22:52.736
I want to pee.

497
00:22:52.736 --> 00:22:54.206
You want to pee?
Go and pee.

498
00:22:55.177 --> 00:22:56.976
Don't pee right there.

499
00:22:57.107 --> 00:22:58.506
Come on.

500
00:23:00.077 --> 00:23:02.117
He takes after you.

501
00:23:02.947 --> 00:23:05.746
I can't believe how much
he takes after you.

502
00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:06.786
(My goodness.)

503
00:23:08.056 --> 00:23:10.456
Meanwhile, Seo Jun
is playing with tops.

504
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.127
Seo Eon and Seo Jun,
what are these?

505
00:23:13.127 --> 00:23:14.927
- Tops.
- These are tops.

506
00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:16.796
1, 2, 3, 4 rows.

507
00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:18.667
You have over 25 tops.

508
00:23:18.927 --> 00:23:22.437
We have 29 tops.

509
00:23:23.036 --> 00:23:24.397
Do you need all of them?

510
00:23:25.107 --> 00:23:28.577
How are these two
different?

511
00:23:29.506 --> 00:23:30.706
All of them are different.

512
00:23:31.006 --> 00:23:32.877
Is there a top you want?

513
00:23:33.806 --> 00:23:34.947
Wyvern.

514
00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:37.177
- Wyvern?
- Wyvern.

515
00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:38.546
Wyvern?

516
00:23:38.546 --> 00:23:40.617
Do you have tops at home?

517
00:23:40.617 --> 00:23:42.516
We have one of these
at home.

518
00:23:42.516 --> 00:23:43.657
(It belongs
to his 7-year-old son.)

519
00:23:44.286 --> 00:23:45.286
We have a lot of tops.

520
00:23:45.286 --> 00:23:46.687
- One?
- Yes.

521
00:23:47.157 --> 00:23:49.627
(Unbelievable)

522
00:23:49.627 --> 00:23:51.397
- You have one at home.
- Yes.

523
00:23:52.026 --> 00:23:53.296
I stopped at here.

524
00:23:53.296 --> 00:23:54.597
- I stopped at here.
- Where?

525
00:23:54.597 --> 00:23:55.937
- At here.
- Tell me.

526
00:23:56.337 --> 00:23:57.766
- I stopped at two tops.
- I see.

527
00:23:57.766 --> 00:23:58.966
I stopped at two tops.

528
00:23:58.966 --> 00:24:00.367
I stopped at two tops.

529
00:24:00.536 --> 00:24:02.137
I buy them tops...

530
00:24:02.137 --> 00:24:03.976
when they play soccer
diligently.

531
00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:05.276
It's great
that you love your sons.

532
00:24:05.276 --> 00:24:07.006
I will be your client.

533
00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:08.147
- Hello?
- Hello?

534
00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:09.847
For playing soccer well,

535
00:24:09.847 --> 00:24:12.087
I have bought my children
one top a week.

536
00:24:12.087 --> 00:24:15.256
Now, there are 29 tops
at home.

537
00:24:15.256 --> 00:24:17.316
- I see.
- They want more tops.

538
00:24:17.486 --> 00:24:19.157
Buy them more tops...

539
00:24:19.687 --> 00:24:21.526
when they join
the national team.

540
00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:23.526
(They should join
the national team first.)

541
00:24:25.266 --> 00:24:26.966
Had I received a picture
of these tops,

542
00:24:27.167 --> 00:24:29.296
I would have said that
it's super stupid.

543
00:24:29.496 --> 00:24:31.736
This needs to be stopped.

544
00:24:32.107 --> 00:24:34.706
There are too many.
You spent too much money.

545
00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:38.706
I think you should use
a toy rental shop.

546
00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:40.046
Seo Eon and Seo Jun,
listen.

547
00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:42.216
There is a toy shop.

548
00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:45.216
You give two tops
to the owner.

549
00:24:46.347 --> 00:24:49.187
Then the owner lends you
the two tops...

550
00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:50.357
of your liking.

551
00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:52.927
How would you feel
about that?

552
00:24:53.286 --> 00:24:55.197
What do you think?
Do you want to try it?

553
00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.056
Really?

554
00:24:58.066 --> 00:24:59.127
Really?

555
00:24:59.296 --> 00:25:00.966
Great! Good job.

556
00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:03.637
What will Saeng Min
donate?

557
00:25:04.397 --> 00:25:05.867
Will you donate a coat?

558
00:25:05.867 --> 00:25:08.407
Add it to the items
for donation.

559
00:25:08.407 --> 00:25:10.006
I know you don't have
a lot of clothes.

560
00:25:10.006 --> 00:25:11.677
- There is a funny story.
- What is it?

561
00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.917
I don't think
it has been 20 years.

562
00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:18.786
Back then, reporters
visited the celebrities...

563
00:25:18.786 --> 00:25:20.687
- without permission.
- That's right.

564
00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:22.456
It went to a shoot
for a commercial...

565
00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:25.556
to meet Jung Woo Sung
and Ko So Young.

566
00:25:25.556 --> 00:25:26.956
However, I couldn't get
an interview...

567
00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:28.357
because I hadn't gotten
a permission in advance.

568
00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:31.496
I must have waited
more than three hours.

569
00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:32.927
I couldn't get
an interview.

570
00:25:32.927 --> 00:25:35.466
I should have gotten
a permission.

571
00:25:36.137 --> 00:25:38.066
Later on, I got a call...

572
00:25:38.966 --> 00:25:41.377
from Jung Woo Sung's
manager.

573
00:25:41.377 --> 00:25:45.276
Since I struggled
with work that day,

574
00:25:45.276 --> 00:25:46.677
he gave me this coat...

575
00:25:47.206 --> 00:25:48.546
as a thank you.

576
00:25:48.546 --> 00:25:52.387
It's a coat
from Jung Woo Sung.

577
00:25:53.347 --> 00:25:54.417
It's a funny story, right?

578
00:25:54.417 --> 00:25:57.417
My friend works
at Customs Service.

579
00:25:57.456 --> 00:25:58.556
Detection dog
training center.

580
00:25:58.556 --> 00:25:59.657
(A stuffed animal
from his friend)

581
00:26:00.056 --> 00:26:01.427
This is
from the Olympics.

582
00:26:01.597 --> 00:26:02.897
Pyeongchang?

583
00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:04.556
No, London.

584
00:26:04.556 --> 00:26:05.927
My children grew up
with it.

585
00:26:06.496 --> 00:26:07.597
London?

586
00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:11.066
This is my son's favorite,
"Aesop's Fables".

587
00:26:11.066 --> 00:26:12.736
Do you have
a lot of books at home?

588
00:26:12.736 --> 00:26:13.966
We received books.

589
00:26:13.966 --> 00:26:15.437
- We received books.
- You received books?

590
00:26:15.437 --> 00:26:17.306
We tend to buy used books.

591
00:26:18.546 --> 00:26:20.546
Saeng Min is super great.

592
00:26:21.077 --> 00:26:22.847
Saeng Min has to go now.

593
00:26:23.177 --> 00:26:26.847
He is at the height
of his popularity.

594
00:26:26.847 --> 00:26:28.786
That's why you need
energy from him.

595
00:26:28.786 --> 00:26:30.016
Cheer up.

596
00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:31.387
Thank you.

597
00:26:32.056 --> 00:26:33.756
The twins go somewhere...

598
00:26:33.756 --> 00:26:35.327
after receiving energy
from Saeng Min.

599
00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.796
(The twins are outside.)

600
00:26:36.796 --> 00:26:38.127
Seo Eon and Seo Jun,
come here.

601
00:26:38.127 --> 00:26:40.526
My friend is waiting
inside the school.

602
00:26:40.526 --> 00:26:41.937
I have a hint.

603
00:26:42.766 --> 00:26:43.966
He is very tall.

604
00:26:44.197 --> 00:26:45.367
He is my friend.

605
00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:48.337
(They leave to find
Dad's friend.)

606
00:26:49.536 --> 00:26:52.447
(A shoot is taking place.)

607
00:26:52.947 --> 00:26:54.607
(A man in a red outfit
stands out.)

608
00:26:54.607 --> 00:26:57.716
Do you think the man
in a red outfit is tall?

609
00:26:57.716 --> 00:26:59.417
- No.
- No?

610
00:27:00.216 --> 00:27:01.816
You don't think
he is tall.

611
00:27:02.756 --> 00:27:04.187
He is Heo Kyung Hwan.

612
00:27:04.187 --> 00:27:05.526
You can tell even though
he is sitting down.

613
00:27:07.157 --> 00:27:09.296
(Looking around)

614
00:27:13.397 --> 00:27:14.697
- I found him.
- Did you find him?

615
00:27:14.697 --> 00:27:16.996
- Where is he?
- He is sitting down.

616
00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:19.206
Can you tell even though
he is sitting down?

617
00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:21.736
Who could be
the tall uncle...

618
00:27:21.736 --> 00:27:23.236
they found
with their keen eyes?

619
00:27:25.147 --> 00:27:28.847
(Could he be
the tall uncle?)

620
00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:30.677
Hello.

621
00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:32.786
Hello.

622
00:27:33.647 --> 00:27:35.716
Are you
Lee Hwi Jae's friend?

623
00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:39.687
I am Lee Hwi Jae's friend.

624
00:27:40.187 --> 00:27:44.657
- Stand up.
- Shall I stand up?

625
00:27:44.657 --> 00:27:47.496
(Standing up)

626
00:27:48.937 --> 00:27:50.066
He is tall.

627
00:27:50.437 --> 00:27:52.137
Come here. Hello.
Let's shake hands.

628
00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:55.736
- Let's shake hands.
- Say, "Hello."

629
00:27:55.877 --> 00:27:57.077
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

630
00:27:57.077 --> 00:27:58.546
- Introduce yourself.
- That's not necessary.

631
00:27:58.546 --> 00:27:59.947
I know who you are.

632
00:27:59.947 --> 00:28:01.647
- What's his name?
- You are Seo Eon.

633
00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:03.617
You are Seo Jun.

634
00:28:03.947 --> 00:28:06.087
He is Seo Jang Hoon.

635
00:28:06.187 --> 00:28:09.587
Perhaps Seo Jang Hoon
would be too hard.

636
00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:12.056
Call me Uncle Dinosaur.

637
00:28:12.056 --> 00:28:14.657
- Uncle Dinosaur.
- He is taller than me.

638
00:28:14.657 --> 00:28:17.296
It will be easier
to remember.

639
00:28:17.296 --> 00:28:18.897
He is much taller than me.

640
00:28:19.226 --> 00:28:20.427
I look cute
next to him, right?

641
00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:23.197
- I am...
- Dad, are you younger?

642
00:28:23.197 --> 00:28:25.506
No, I am younger.

643
00:28:25.706 --> 00:28:26.806
Come here.

644
00:28:26.806 --> 00:28:29.177
What do you think
he did for a living?

645
00:28:29.536 --> 00:28:30.577
Baseball.

646
00:28:31.036 --> 00:28:32.506
There is another sport.

647
00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:34.306
- What could it be?
- Tennis.

648
00:28:35.877 --> 00:28:38.117
- Basketball.
- Correct.

649
00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:41.246
That's right. I used to be
a basketball player.

650
00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:44.456
My goodness,
they are heavy.

651
00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:46.187
They are heavy now.

652
00:28:46.187 --> 00:28:47.857
Look at me.

653
00:28:47.857 --> 00:28:49.197
Am I short or tall?

654
00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:51.427
- Short.
- I am short, right?

655
00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:53.127
Uncle is too tall.

656
00:28:54.026 --> 00:28:56.837
I heard that
the twins are here.

657
00:28:57.367 --> 00:28:59.036
- I have a funny story.
- What?

658
00:28:59.036 --> 00:29:00.306
- I have a funny story.
- A funny story?

659
00:29:00.306 --> 00:29:03.407
I told them to look
for my tall friend.

660
00:29:03.407 --> 00:29:05.377
"How about that man
in a red outfit?"

661
00:29:05.377 --> 00:29:06.447
"No."

662
00:29:07.377 --> 00:29:09.917
- You were sitting down.
- He is short.

663
00:29:09.917 --> 00:29:11.046
(Sad)

664
00:29:11.276 --> 00:29:13.917
I used to think that
Seo Eon and Seo Jun...

665
00:29:13.917 --> 00:29:16.087
have different faces.

666
00:29:16.716 --> 00:29:19.056
As they grow older,
they become similar.

667
00:29:19.986 --> 00:29:22.897
As babies, they had
individual looks.

668
00:29:22.897 --> 00:29:24.697
(Seo Eon and Seo Jun
looked different.)

669
00:29:24.697 --> 00:29:26.427
Spending time together,
they picked up...

670
00:29:26.427 --> 00:29:28.597
each other's
smiles and behaviors.

671
00:29:29.197 --> 00:29:32.506
Now, anyone can tell
that they are twins.

672
00:29:32.736 --> 00:29:34.776
- They become similar.
- They're similar.

673
00:29:35.276 --> 00:29:36.736
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

674
00:29:37.806 --> 00:29:39.877
- A volleyball player.
- A volleyball player.

675
00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:42.447
You need to be tall
to be a volleyball player.

676
00:29:43.046 --> 00:29:45.187
What do I need to do
to become tall?

677
00:29:45.187 --> 00:29:46.786
To be tall,

678
00:29:46.786 --> 00:29:48.716
you have to listen
to your parents.

679
00:29:48.716 --> 00:29:49.917
I listened
to my parents.

680
00:29:49.917 --> 00:29:52.157
- Enjoy your food.
- I enjoyed my food.

681
00:29:53.056 --> 00:29:54.996
You should have tried
harder.

682
00:29:54.996 --> 00:29:56.496
Enjoy your food...

683
00:29:56.857 --> 00:29:58.496
and eat a lot.

684
00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:00.327
Do you listen to your dad?

685
00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:03.236
- Not really.
- Not really.

686
00:30:03.236 --> 00:30:05.367
Seo Jun is honest.

687
00:30:05.367 --> 00:30:07.006
Put your hand
against mine.

688
00:30:07.006 --> 00:30:08.476
Seo Jun, put your hand
against mine.

689
00:30:08.476 --> 00:30:11.706
Let's see the difference.

690
00:30:11.706 --> 00:30:14.577
Are you taller
than a giant?

691
00:30:14.577 --> 00:30:16.177
- Who?
- A giant.

692
00:30:16.177 --> 00:30:17.447
A giant.

693
00:30:17.947 --> 00:30:20.046
- The thing is,
- He is a giant.

694
00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:22.887
I need to know
what qualifies as a giant.

695
00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:25.327
How tall does a giant
have to be?

696
00:30:25.327 --> 00:30:27.187
Seo Jun and Seo Eon,

697
00:30:27.187 --> 00:30:29.857
would you rather be
tall or short?

698
00:30:30.226 --> 00:30:31.427
(I want to be tall.)

699
00:30:31.427 --> 00:30:33.667
Would you rather be
as tall as me...

700
00:30:33.667 --> 00:30:34.996
or him?

701
00:30:34.996 --> 00:30:36.197
- Your answer is me, no?
- Stand up.

702
00:30:36.197 --> 00:30:38.137
- Stand up.
- All right.

703
00:30:38.466 --> 00:30:39.937
Would you rather be
incredibly tall...

704
00:30:39.937 --> 00:30:41.437
- or live...
- Seo Eon.

705
00:30:41.437 --> 00:30:42.907
- Seo Jun.
- with an average height?

706
00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:45.847
Would you rather be
as tall as me or him?

707
00:30:45.847 --> 00:30:47.447
- Seo Jun.
- An average height?

708
00:30:47.447 --> 00:30:50.417
(What will be
the twins' choice?)

709
00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:53.216
You want to be
as tall as me, right?

710
00:30:53.216 --> 00:30:55.216
(Jang Hoon is happy
and Kyung Hwan is sad.)

711
00:30:55.216 --> 00:30:56.516
- That's right.
- In that case...

712
00:30:56.516 --> 00:30:57.617
Isn't he too tall?

713
00:30:57.617 --> 00:30:58.857
- No.
- Isn't he too tall?

714
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.427
Children want to be tall.

715
00:31:00.427 --> 00:31:03.127
Why did you come here
today?

716
00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:04.296
To receive gifts.

717
00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:06.367
To receive gifts.
Which gifts?

718
00:31:06.367 --> 00:31:08.966
- It's for the bazaar.
- Gifts for the bazaar.

719
00:31:09.266 --> 00:31:12.766
I will sign
this basketball.

720
00:31:13.536 --> 00:31:14.877
Sell this basketball...

721
00:31:15.776 --> 00:31:17.677
at the bazaar.

722
00:31:17.677 --> 00:31:20.776
I have more.

723
00:31:20.907 --> 00:31:23.447
I have sunglasses.

724
00:31:23.476 --> 00:31:24.476
Put them on.

725
00:31:24.476 --> 00:31:26.516
- How nice!
- Look at me.

726
00:31:26.516 --> 00:31:28.056
They are super great.

727
00:31:28.056 --> 00:31:29.687
Seo Jun, put these on.

728
00:31:29.857 --> 00:31:30.986
How cute!

729
00:31:30.986 --> 00:31:32.956
- Uncle prepared a lot.
- They are soft, right?

730
00:31:33.187 --> 00:31:35.526
Sell these items
at the bazaar, okay?

731
00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:38.127
Uncle Dinosaur, thank you.

732
00:31:38.127 --> 00:31:39.726
- All right.
- We will sell them well.

733
00:31:39.726 --> 00:31:41.466
We will sell them well.

734
00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:47.837
Lo Hee, Mom's friend...

735
00:31:47.837 --> 00:31:50.437
will give us items
for the bazaar.

736
00:31:50.437 --> 00:31:52.546
We are going
to receive them.

737
00:31:52.546 --> 00:31:55.117
Which friend of mine
will it be?

738
00:31:55.516 --> 00:31:57.447
Let's go down the stairs.

739
00:31:57.447 --> 00:31:58.447
One.

740
00:31:58.887 --> 00:32:01.516
- 2, 3, 4.
- 2, 3, 4.

741
00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:04.827
(They arrive
at the hair salon.)

742
00:32:06.226 --> 00:32:08.427
Who will it be?

743
00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:09.526
Yu Jin!

744
00:32:09.526 --> 00:32:11.197
Hello. Hello.

745
00:32:11.197 --> 00:32:12.266
Yu Jin!

746
00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:15.036
- Hello. Hello.
- Lo Hee! Hello.

747
00:32:15.036 --> 00:32:16.536
- Say hello to her.
- Hello.

748
00:32:16.536 --> 00:32:17.667
Hello.

749
00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:19.907
- You became prettier.
- Lo Hee.

750
00:32:19.907 --> 00:32:22.937
Her name is similar
to mine.

751
00:32:22.937 --> 00:32:24.847
- What is her name?
- Kim Yu Jin.

752
00:32:24.847 --> 00:32:26.647
(Kim Yu Jin)

753
00:32:26.647 --> 00:32:28.516
- Yu Jin is right.
- Kim is my last name.

754
00:32:28.516 --> 00:32:30.417
She is So Yu Jin.

755
00:32:30.417 --> 00:32:33.087
- So Yu Jin.
- That's right.

756
00:32:33.087 --> 00:32:34.647
How old is she?

757
00:32:34.647 --> 00:32:36.587
- She is 30 months old.
- 30 months old.

758
00:32:36.617 --> 00:32:38.627
I am hungry.

759
00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:40.127
Dad, I am hungry.

760
00:32:40.127 --> 00:32:42.296
- She can speak very well.
- Are you hungry?

761
00:32:42.296 --> 00:32:44.357
I am hungry. I am hungry.

762
00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:47.197
- Where did you get that?
- You have a baby.

763
00:32:47.526 --> 00:32:48.837
I know.

764
00:32:48.837 --> 00:32:51.766
Congratulations on having
many children.

765
00:32:51.766 --> 00:32:53.137
Is it a boy or a girl?

766
00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.706
Which one do you prefer?

767
00:32:55.177 --> 00:32:58.407
I heard somewhere that
your husband wants a son.

768
00:32:58.407 --> 00:32:59.677
My husband?

769
00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:00.847
Yes.

770
00:33:00.847 --> 00:33:03.276
At first, he did.

771
00:33:03.276 --> 00:33:04.617
Now, he fell
for his daughter.

772
00:33:04.617 --> 00:33:07.117
He dotes on
his daughter.

773
00:33:07.347 --> 00:33:08.956
He wants
another daughter.

774
00:33:10.887 --> 00:33:14.127
(She laughs
when his dad cooks.)

775
00:33:14.127 --> 00:33:16.097
It's funny to see
black pasta, right?

776
00:33:17.427 --> 00:33:19.026
Is it fun to see it
get cooked?

777
00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:23.266
(The father and daughter
are loving.)

778
00:33:23.437 --> 00:33:25.206
I hope you have
a daughter.

779
00:33:25.206 --> 00:33:26.607
My husband is hoping
for a daughter.

780
00:33:26.607 --> 00:33:29.377
- Let's hope for one.
- Men want daughters.

781
00:33:29.677 --> 00:33:31.907
I brought gifts.

782
00:33:31.907 --> 00:33:32.907
What are these?

783
00:33:32.907 --> 00:33:36.246
You always give me gifts.

784
00:33:36.246 --> 00:33:39.917
Ever since I was single,
Yu Jin gave me gifts.

785
00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.417
She made the skirt
Lo Hee is wearing.

786
00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:43.417
We are busy.

787
00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:44.927
- It suits her well.
- It's so pretty.

788
00:33:44.927 --> 00:33:46.786
- The skirt is so pretty.
- Thank goodness.

789
00:33:46.927 --> 00:33:49.157
- Are these the items?
- Yes.

790
00:33:49.157 --> 00:33:51.296
The size is all different.

791
00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:53.327
- They are for the bazaar.
- Yes.

792
00:33:53.327 --> 00:33:55.697
- Look at this.
- It's so pretty.

793
00:33:55.796 --> 00:33:59.107
These clothes are
too small for Yong Hee.

794
00:33:59.107 --> 00:34:00.407
How cute!

795
00:34:00.437 --> 00:34:02.706
Children only wear them
once or twice...

796
00:34:02.706 --> 00:34:04.506
- because they grow up.
- That's right.

797
00:34:05.006 --> 00:34:07.776
Clothes for a son
look different.

798
00:34:07.776 --> 00:34:09.117
- They do, right?
- Yes.

799
00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:12.147
Organizing them made...

800
00:34:12.147 --> 00:34:14.316
- my heart melt.
- It brings back memories.

801
00:34:14.316 --> 00:34:15.686
- When my son was a baby,
- This one is cute.

802
00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.756
he wore these clothes.

803
00:34:17.756 --> 00:34:20.256
- They are so cute.
- How pretty!

804
00:34:20.256 --> 00:34:23.427
It's something
Yong Hee wore as a baby.

805
00:34:24.356 --> 00:34:27.197
What is that?
What is that?

806
00:34:27.566 --> 00:34:29.537
Yong Hee used this a lot.

807
00:34:29.537 --> 00:34:31.197
Now, he is too tall.
It only comes up to here.

808
00:34:31.197 --> 00:34:32.867
- It comes up to here.
- Babies use this...

809
00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:35.407
to carry
their belongings...

810
00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:37.376
- at picnics.
- It's pretty.

811
00:34:37.376 --> 00:34:38.707
It's pretty.

812
00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:39.947
How cute!

813
00:34:39.947 --> 00:34:41.876
I want to carry it.

814
00:34:41.876 --> 00:34:43.776
(I want to carry it.)

815
00:34:43.776 --> 00:34:45.146
You can carry it.

816
00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:46.847
I think it might be
too small for you.

817
00:34:47.287 --> 00:34:50.457
- It's her size.
- She can still carry it.

818
00:34:50.486 --> 00:34:52.256
Mom, look at this.

819
00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.586
How cute!

820
00:34:53.686 --> 00:34:56.057
Lo Hee,
we need to sell it.

821
00:34:56.396 --> 00:34:58.767
- You can buy it.
- We need to sell it.

822
00:34:58.767 --> 00:35:00.126
She can't buy it.

823
00:35:00.126 --> 00:35:02.396
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

824
00:35:02.396 --> 00:35:05.066
Ask Aunt Yu Jin
how much it is.

825
00:35:05.537 --> 00:35:06.767
How much do you need?

826
00:35:06.767 --> 00:35:08.106
"How much do you need?"

827
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:09.776
(Hold on.)

828
00:35:09.776 --> 00:35:11.106
How much do you need?

829
00:35:11.106 --> 00:35:13.907
(It's a famous line
by Won Bin.)

830
00:35:13.907 --> 00:35:15.316
How much do you need?

831
00:35:15.977 --> 00:35:17.316
(How much do you need?)

832
00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:18.816
"How much do you need?"

833
00:35:19.387 --> 00:35:20.546
Kiss me 100 times.

834
00:35:21.617 --> 00:35:24.617
(You are hilarious.)

835
00:35:24.617 --> 00:35:28.157
Seo Hyun used it
when she was a baby.

836
00:35:28.197 --> 00:35:29.427
Isn't it cute?

837
00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.427
Children love
this cat character.

838
00:35:31.427 --> 00:35:32.827
(Seo Hyun's backpack
is pink.)

839
00:35:33.026 --> 00:35:34.666
Lo Hee would like
that one better.

840
00:35:34.796 --> 00:35:36.396
- Lo Hee.
- Yes?

841
00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:38.236
There is a backpack
with a cat.

842
00:35:38.506 --> 00:35:40.767
It's not a cat.
It's Hello Kitty.

843
00:35:40.767 --> 00:35:42.907
- That's right.
- Kitty.

844
00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:43.936
Kitty.

845
00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:46.146
- Lo Hee, which one...
- It's not Kitty.

846
00:35:46.146 --> 00:35:47.606
- It's Hello Kitty.
- All right.

847
00:35:47.606 --> 00:35:49.646
Which one
do you like better?

848
00:35:50.017 --> 00:35:51.247
Tiger.

849
00:35:51.247 --> 00:35:52.947
You like tiger better.

850
00:35:52.947 --> 00:35:53.986
(I knew it.)

851
00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:56.686
Seo Hyun loves
pink, yellow,

852
00:35:56.686 --> 00:35:58.457
- and princesses.
- She is feminine.

853
00:35:58.457 --> 00:36:01.997
She dressed up
and does this...

854
00:36:01.997 --> 00:36:03.997
- in front of the mirror.
- How cute!

855
00:36:03.997 --> 00:36:06.097
She doesn't do that.

856
00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.867
- Really?
- She doesn't do that.

857
00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:09.466
- How fascinating!
- I hope...

858
00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:11.066
I didn't raise her
like a boy.

859
00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:12.907
Dad, come here.

860
00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:15.376
Come here, Dad.

861
00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:17.836
What are you doing?

862
00:36:18.447 --> 00:36:20.677
(She is testing
the tiger suitcase.)

863
00:36:20.677 --> 00:36:22.617
Where are you going,
Lo Hee?

864
00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:23.776
Are you going on a trip?

865
00:36:23.916 --> 00:36:25.646
Yes, I am going on a trip.

866
00:36:26.816 --> 00:36:28.856
(Cute and cheerful)

867
00:36:30.057 --> 00:36:32.086
She is going somewhere
with the tiger suitcase.

868
00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:33.957
It became Lo Hee's.

869
00:36:33.957 --> 00:36:35.856
(I will go on a walk.)

870
00:36:36.197 --> 00:36:38.026
Don't you get
morning sickness?

871
00:36:38.026 --> 00:36:39.097
Morning sickness?

872
00:36:39.367 --> 00:36:41.796
I don't like
the smell of fish.

873
00:36:41.796 --> 00:36:43.566
I am envious.

874
00:36:43.697 --> 00:36:46.867
- You want a second child.
- Yes, I do.

875
00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:48.606
It would be nice to have
another second child.

876
00:36:48.907 --> 00:36:51.207
2 children are better
than 1 child.

877
00:36:51.207 --> 00:36:53.677
- They play together.
- You need siblings.

878
00:36:53.807 --> 00:36:56.177
That's right.
I have four children.

879
00:36:56.177 --> 00:36:58.387
They play well together.

880
00:36:58.387 --> 00:37:00.716
(Yong Hee plays well
with his sister.)

881
00:37:04.486 --> 00:37:07.686
Since Lo Hee is
by herself,

882
00:37:07.686 --> 00:37:10.097
I wonder how she will be
if she has a sibling.

883
00:37:10.097 --> 00:37:11.157
That's right.

884
00:37:11.157 --> 00:37:13.896
Do you want
a boy or a girl?

885
00:37:13.896 --> 00:37:15.966
- You want 2 daughters.
- I want 2 daughters.

886
00:37:15.966 --> 00:37:18.207
My parents had
two daughters.

887
00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:20.106
It's nice to have
a sister.

888
00:37:20.106 --> 00:37:22.236
Whether it's a boy
or a girl doesn't matter.

889
00:37:22.236 --> 00:37:23.876
You should work out.

890
00:37:23.876 --> 00:37:27.977
I had three children
when I wasn't working out.

891
00:37:28.716 --> 00:37:29.916
You need to work out.

892
00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:31.216
I am worried.

893
00:37:31.216 --> 00:37:32.947
You must work out.

894
00:37:32.947 --> 00:37:35.157
I feel like I will give
birth when I cough.

895
00:37:35.157 --> 00:37:37.287
- Really?
- Say, "I am back."

896
00:37:37.287 --> 00:37:39.387
(She tests the suitcase
and comes back.)

897
00:37:40.026 --> 00:37:42.057
- Thank you.
- You brought many items.

898
00:37:42.057 --> 00:37:43.856
- No, I didn't.
- How pretty!

899
00:37:43.856 --> 00:37:45.396
You brought many items.

900
00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.867
- Are they okay?
- Thank you so much.

901
00:37:46.867 --> 00:37:48.336
I am glad
these are enough.

902
00:37:48.336 --> 00:37:50.966
- We will sell them well.
- It's for a good cause.

903
00:37:50.966 --> 00:37:52.566
I hope these items help.

904
00:37:53.236 --> 00:37:55.407
(At that moment)

905
00:37:56.637 --> 00:37:59.407
- Hello.
- Hello.

906
00:37:59.907 --> 00:38:03.617
(Girls say hello to them.)

907
00:38:03.617 --> 00:38:05.287
Hello.

908
00:38:05.586 --> 00:38:08.756
(They run into GFriend.)

909
00:38:08.756 --> 00:38:10.586
- Lo Hee.
- Hello, we are GFriend.

910
00:38:10.586 --> 00:38:12.486
- Hello.
- Hello.

911
00:38:12.486 --> 00:38:13.986
Lo Hee. Lo Hee.

912
00:38:13.986 --> 00:38:16.796
It's hard to meet
these girls.

913
00:38:16.796 --> 00:38:18.697
It's harder to meet
Lo Hee.

914
00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:20.767
Hello.

915
00:38:21.367 --> 00:38:22.637
Hello.

916
00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:24.396
Hello.

917
00:38:24.396 --> 00:38:27.267
We often watch
"The Return of Superman".

918
00:38:27.736 --> 00:38:30.776
- That's right.
- Hello, Lo Hee.

919
00:38:30.776 --> 00:38:33.207
Lo Hee, these girls...

920
00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:35.816
sing and dance prettily.

921
00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:37.347
Do you know our songs?

922
00:38:37.347 --> 00:38:39.146
She has no idea.

923
00:38:39.146 --> 00:38:41.517
We can sing her a song.

924
00:38:41.716 --> 00:38:43.856
We will sing you a song,
Lo Hee.

925
00:38:44.086 --> 00:38:45.287
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

926
00:38:45.827 --> 00:38:48.657
(They have a live concert
in a hair salon.)

927
00:38:52.126 --> 00:38:54.966
(Flustered)

928
00:38:55.367 --> 00:38:57.497
- From today on
- From today on

929
00:38:57.637 --> 00:38:59.836
- It's a good song, right?
- How cute!

930
00:38:59.836 --> 00:39:01.836
She liked it.

931
00:39:02.037 --> 00:39:04.137
- I like your songs.
- Really?

932
00:39:04.137 --> 00:39:05.977
- Thank you.
- She loves them.

933
00:39:06.146 --> 00:39:07.606
- I am serious.
- Thank you.

934
00:39:07.776 --> 00:39:12.387
When I was young,
I was in "Truth Game"...

935
00:39:12.387 --> 00:39:15.186
as the little S.E.S.

936
00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.216
You mean the TV program,
"Truth Game".

937
00:39:17.216 --> 00:39:18.227
Yes.

938
00:39:18.227 --> 00:39:19.427
(They share a connection.)

939
00:39:20.727 --> 00:39:23.057
(She wanted to be
the next S.E.S.)

940
00:39:23.057 --> 00:39:26.227
Shin B, who wanted to be
the next S.E.S...

941
00:39:26.227 --> 00:39:28.066
met with Eugene,
the original fairy.

942
00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:29.267
(Shin B realized
her dream.)

943
00:39:31.066 --> 00:39:34.207
I really wanted
to meet you.

944
00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:37.307
I danced
to "I'm Your Girl".

945
00:39:37.707 --> 00:39:39.077
Thank you.

946
00:39:39.077 --> 00:39:40.646
(It's a heartwarming
meeting.)

947
00:39:40.646 --> 00:39:42.447
I see.

948
00:39:43.477 --> 00:39:46.216
We have snacks in the car.
Would you like some?

949
00:39:46.486 --> 00:39:48.157
Would you like some?

950
00:39:48.657 --> 00:39:52.486
It's as big as
a double-decker bus.

951
00:39:52.686 --> 00:39:54.287
It's big.

952
00:39:55.957 --> 00:39:57.126
(They bring out
a bundle of snacks.)

953
00:39:57.126 --> 00:39:59.727
She carries a lot of
snacks.

954
00:39:59.966 --> 00:40:02.736
- Lo Hee.
- Where is jelly?

955
00:40:02.736 --> 00:40:03.796
Do you like this?

956
00:40:03.796 --> 00:40:04.836
Do you like jelly?

957
00:40:04.836 --> 00:40:07.066
There is grape jelly.

958
00:40:07.066 --> 00:40:08.776
I want to eat this.

959
00:40:08.776 --> 00:40:10.276
- Do you want to eat this?
- Yes.

960
00:40:10.276 --> 00:40:11.807
Please open it.

961
00:40:11.807 --> 00:40:13.276
- Shall I open it?
- How cute!

962
00:40:13.776 --> 00:40:15.117
Please open it.

963
00:40:15.276 --> 00:40:16.577
Do you want it now?

964
00:40:16.577 --> 00:40:18.916
Yes. I want to eat two.

965
00:40:19.287 --> 00:40:20.447
Here.

966
00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:22.756
Put it in your bag.

967
00:40:22.756 --> 00:40:24.287
- There are other jellies.
- How about this one?

968
00:40:24.287 --> 00:40:26.126
It's very delicious.

969
00:40:26.126 --> 00:40:28.227
It's grape jelly.

970
00:40:28.227 --> 00:40:30.497
- Good job.
- There is another one.

971
00:40:30.526 --> 00:40:31.997
- Do you want that too?
- It's grape jelly.

972
00:40:31.997 --> 00:40:33.227
Here you go.

973
00:40:33.466 --> 00:40:35.396
She is taking her share.

974
00:40:35.396 --> 00:40:37.796
You have enough, right?

975
00:40:37.836 --> 00:40:40.236
Let's go now.
This is mine.

976
00:40:40.566 --> 00:40:42.407
Lo Hee, say, "Thank you."

977
00:40:42.407 --> 00:40:44.876
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

978
00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.807
I love you.

979
00:40:47.807 --> 00:40:49.776
- We love you.
- Lo Hee, say,

980
00:40:49.776 --> 00:40:52.847
- "Let's go, GFriend!"
- Would you do that?

981
00:40:53.387 --> 00:40:55.416
Let's go, GFriend.

982
00:40:55.557 --> 00:40:57.416
Let's go, GFriend.

983
00:40:57.416 --> 00:40:59.626
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

984
00:40:59.626 --> 00:41:00.986
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Let's go.

985
00:41:00.986 --> 00:41:02.896
- Let's go.
- High five.

986
00:41:03.727 --> 00:41:05.767
- Lo Hee,
- My goodness.

987
00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:08.697
I will show you
when they are on TV.

988
00:41:08.697 --> 00:41:10.637
- Bye, Lo Hee.
- Bye.

989
00:41:11.466 --> 00:41:12.666
Thank you.

990
00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:15.436
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

991
00:41:15.436 --> 00:41:17.106
I will cheer for you.

992
00:41:17.137 --> 00:41:19.006
- Bye.
- Bye.

993
00:41:19.347 --> 00:41:21.106
- My goodness.
- Baby!

994
00:41:21.106 --> 00:41:23.376
She is prettier
than she is on TV.

995
00:41:24.077 --> 00:41:26.416
Let's show this to Dad.

996
00:41:26.416 --> 00:41:27.546
All right.

997
00:41:28.287 --> 00:41:30.916
Lo Hee, you got
a lot of jellies.

998
00:41:31.557 --> 00:41:33.686
- Snacks.
- Snacks.

999
00:41:34.686 --> 00:41:36.657
- Let's run.
- Are you happy?

1000
00:41:36.657 --> 00:41:38.597
Yes, I am happy.

1001
00:41:41.026 --> 00:41:42.597
What is Seung Jae up to?

1002
00:41:42.597 --> 00:41:44.236
(He is waiting
for someone.)

1003
00:41:44.807 --> 00:41:45.966
(When will she come?)

1004
00:41:45.966 --> 00:41:48.537
Seung Jae,
a pretty girl will come.

1005
00:41:48.537 --> 00:41:49.677
Who do you think
she will be?

1006
00:41:49.736 --> 00:41:51.477
A girl with long hair.

1007
00:41:51.847 --> 00:41:53.307
A pretty girl
with long hair?

1008
00:41:53.347 --> 00:41:56.077
Will it be someone
Seung Jae wants?

1009
00:41:57.876 --> 00:42:01.247
(She is hiding
behind a dinosaur toy.)

1010
00:42:05.787 --> 00:42:08.057
(Peeking)

1011
00:42:08.057 --> 00:42:11.427
(Who is she?)

1012
00:42:12.597 --> 00:42:14.597
Hello, Seung Jae.

1013
00:42:14.796 --> 00:42:17.097
- Hello.
- Hello.

1014
00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:18.666
(The charming girl
is here.)

1015
00:42:20.407 --> 00:42:21.776
(She has
different charms.)

1016
00:42:21.776 --> 00:42:25.447
It's Sun Mi who is back
with a charismatic song.

1017
00:42:25.447 --> 00:42:26.646
(The beautiful girl crush,
Sun Mi)

1018
00:42:27.447 --> 00:42:28.716
Seung Jae.

1019
00:42:30.416 --> 00:42:32.387
- Did you enjoy France?
- Yes, I did.

1020
00:42:32.387 --> 00:42:35.216
- You were at Paris.
- This is Tyrannosaurus.

1021
00:42:35.457 --> 00:42:37.756
Seung Jae. Seung Jae.

1022
00:42:37.986 --> 00:42:41.497
(How will Seung Jae
react?)

1023
00:42:42.756 --> 00:42:43.896
Seung Jae. Seung Jae.

1024
00:42:43.896 --> 00:42:45.966
(It's a dinosaur.)

1025
00:42:46.327 --> 00:42:48.597
This is Tyrannosaurus.

1026
00:42:48.597 --> 00:42:50.267
He is like this
about dinosaurs.

1027
00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:53.307
I heard that he likes
dinosaurs.

1028
00:42:53.367 --> 00:42:55.637
That's why I bought it.

1029
00:42:56.606 --> 00:42:58.577
It's so big!

1030
00:42:58.977 --> 00:43:01.677
I have another gift.

1031
00:43:01.847 --> 00:43:03.517
What is it?

1032
00:43:03.577 --> 00:43:06.486
These are sneakers
you wanted.

1033
00:43:06.486 --> 00:43:08.287
Thank you.

1034
00:43:10.186 --> 00:43:11.427
How pretty!

1035
00:43:12.126 --> 00:43:13.227
Do you like them?

1036
00:43:13.227 --> 00:43:14.856
(They are cool, Dad.)

1037
00:43:14.856 --> 00:43:16.427
Let's put them on.

1038
00:43:16.896 --> 00:43:18.697
Seung Jae, are they cool?

1039
00:43:18.697 --> 00:43:20.197
- Yes.
- Light came on.

1040
00:43:20.796 --> 00:43:23.697
- Why won't it change?
- Let's see.

1041
00:43:23.836 --> 00:43:24.836
(Children love
sneakers with light.)

1042
00:43:24.836 --> 00:43:26.137
The color needs to change.

1043
00:43:27.367 --> 00:43:29.006
It's green.

1044
00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.977
Which color do you want
for your right foot?

1045
00:43:31.106 --> 00:43:33.407
- Blue.
- Blue?

1046
00:43:34.006 --> 00:43:36.177
- Aren't they cool?
- They are cool.

1047
00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:39.247
(He becomes absorbed
in the sneakers.)

1048
00:43:39.247 --> 00:43:41.117
(Bang!)

1049
00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.387
Sun Mi.

1050
00:43:45.057 --> 00:43:46.057
Give me a kiss.

1051
00:43:46.586 --> 00:43:48.396
(Thank you, pretty girl.)

1052
00:43:48.396 --> 00:43:50.657
How cute! My goodness.

1053
00:43:50.657 --> 00:43:52.097
(Ji Yong can't believe
he kissed so readily.)

1054
00:43:52.097 --> 00:43:53.227
Seung Jae,

1055
00:43:53.566 --> 00:43:55.267
- is Aunt pretty?
- Seung Jae.

1056
00:43:55.267 --> 00:43:56.367
Is Aunt pretty?

1057
00:43:56.697 --> 00:43:58.267
Am I pretty?

1058
00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:02.506
(Should I say it or not?)

1059
00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.637
Are you pondering?

1060
00:44:03.677 --> 00:44:06.276
(What is his conclusion?)

1061
00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:08.276
- She is pretty.
- I see.

1062
00:44:08.947 --> 00:44:11.216
- She is pretty.
- I see.

1063
00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:14.086
She is the prettiest.

1064
00:44:14.086 --> 00:44:16.057
- My goodness.
- She is this pretty.

1065
00:44:16.057 --> 00:44:17.316
- She is this pretty.
- This pretty?

1066
00:44:17.686 --> 00:44:19.486
Who is prettier,
Mom or Sun Mi?

1067
00:44:19.686 --> 00:44:21.597
(Who is prettier,
Mom or Sun Mi?)

1068
00:44:21.927 --> 00:44:24.927
(The time has come.)

1069
00:44:25.227 --> 00:44:26.466
Sun Mi.

1070
00:44:27.296 --> 00:44:28.436
Sun Mi.

1071
00:44:29.966 --> 00:44:31.807
- Mom will be very sad.
- If you say that,

1072
00:44:31.966 --> 00:44:33.436
you will get scolded
by your mom.

1073
00:44:34.207 --> 00:44:36.207
You will get scolded
by your mom.

1074
00:44:36.207 --> 00:44:38.506
Who is prettier,
Mom or Sun Mi?

1075
00:44:38.807 --> 00:44:39.977
Sun Mi.

1076
00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.106
Is Sun Mi prettier?

1077
00:44:41.106 --> 00:44:42.376
(Sun Mi)

1078
00:44:42.376 --> 00:44:44.716
- Am I pretty?
- What is her profession?

1079
00:44:46.146 --> 00:44:48.756
(Let's see.)

1080
00:44:49.157 --> 00:44:51.686
(Curious and expectant)

1081
00:44:53.427 --> 00:44:55.557
What takes you so long?
What is her profession?

1082
00:44:55.727 --> 00:44:57.097
An angel.

1083
00:44:57.457 --> 00:44:59.896
- An angel.
- Is she an angel?

1084
00:45:01.097 --> 00:45:03.867
Seung Jae, my goodness.

1085
00:45:04.497 --> 00:45:07.466
Thank you.
You are the handsomest.

1086
00:45:07.867 --> 00:45:10.177
You are so handsome,
Seung Jae.

1087
00:45:10.177 --> 00:45:11.876
(Her compliments
make him blush.)

1088
00:45:12.247 --> 00:45:14.577
Would you give me
a bite of ice cream?

1089
00:45:16.316 --> 00:45:18.387
(He shares
without hesitation.)

1090
00:45:18.546 --> 00:45:19.947
It's so tasty.

1091
00:45:22.017 --> 00:45:24.017
- It's so tasty.
- You give readily to her.

1092
00:45:24.017 --> 00:45:25.356
You never give me food.

1093
00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:27.287
- Give your dad a bite.
- Give me a bite.

1094
00:45:28.197 --> 00:45:30.227
(He shakes his head.)

1095
00:45:30.756 --> 00:45:33.396
- I don't want it.
- Give me another bite.

1096
00:45:37.666 --> 00:45:39.236
(I can't believe you,
Seung Jae.)

1097
00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.137
I can't believe you,
Seung Jae.

1098
00:45:41.207 --> 00:45:42.606
Seung Jae.

1099
00:45:42.977 --> 00:45:45.247
I am a singer.

1100
00:45:45.307 --> 00:45:48.117
You have listened
to her song...

1101
00:45:48.117 --> 00:45:49.276
in the car.

1102
00:45:49.276 --> 00:45:51.747
(Have I listened
to her song?)

1103
00:45:52.517 --> 00:45:54.586
- I can do the Gun Dance.
- What is that?

1104
00:45:54.617 --> 00:45:55.657
Do you want me
to show you?

1105
00:45:55.787 --> 00:45:56.887
Watch carefully.

1106
00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.626
(Gun Dance from "Gashina")

1107
00:45:58.626 --> 00:45:59.657
It goes like this.

1108
00:46:01.427 --> 00:46:04.227
(He copies it similarly.)

1109
00:46:04.497 --> 00:46:07.727
(Aim, shoot.)

1110
00:46:08.497 --> 00:46:10.497
(It's the cameraman's
lucky day.)

1111
00:46:10.497 --> 00:46:12.307
Did you see Uncle fall?

1112
00:46:13.066 --> 00:46:16.477
(Shooting)

1113
00:46:20.776 --> 00:46:23.477
(Ji Yong is excluded.)

1114
00:46:24.046 --> 00:46:27.387
(The singer of the past
copies the dance.)

1115
00:46:29.957 --> 00:46:31.186
That's right.

1116
00:46:31.657 --> 00:46:33.957
(The idol of the past
tries his best.)

1117
00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:34.997
That's right.

1118
00:46:35.427 --> 00:46:36.427
This is awkward.

1119
00:46:36.697 --> 00:46:38.367
That's how you do it.

1120
00:46:39.526 --> 00:46:42.137
- What is this?
- Guess what it is.

1121
00:46:42.197 --> 00:46:43.497
What is this?

1122
00:46:43.497 --> 00:46:47.336
I heard the bazaar
is for a good cause.

1123
00:46:47.336 --> 00:46:48.836
- What is this?
- It's a purse...

1124
00:46:49.236 --> 00:46:51.477
- I used to carry.
- Is this makeup?

1125
00:46:51.477 --> 00:46:54.816
It's like a clutch.
These are sunglasses.

1126
00:46:54.876 --> 00:46:56.716
Put them on.

1127
00:46:56.716 --> 00:46:57.977
Shall I do that?

1128
00:47:00.916 --> 00:47:02.686
- How do I look?
- Does she look pretty?

1129
00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:04.416
(She has swag.)

1130
00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:05.827
- How does she look?
- How do I look?

1131
00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:06.957
She is pretty.

1132
00:47:07.526 --> 00:47:09.427
You like her a lot.

1133
00:47:09.427 --> 00:47:11.997
- What is this?
- It contains earrings.

1134
00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:14.197
- Thank you.
- Please use them...

1135
00:47:14.197 --> 00:47:17.436
- for a good cause.
- Thank you very much.

1136
00:47:17.836 --> 00:47:20.606
We will sell
the items well.

1137
00:47:20.606 --> 00:47:23.936
Okay. Sell them well,
Seung Jae.

1138
00:47:23.936 --> 00:47:26.307
I will get going now.
See you again.

1139
00:47:26.546 --> 00:47:27.876
How cute!

1140
00:47:27.876 --> 00:47:30.347
When we meet again,
I will love you.

1141
00:47:30.577 --> 00:47:31.787
- What?
- I will love you.

1142
00:47:31.787 --> 00:47:33.186
- Will you love me?
- Yes.

1143
00:47:37.816 --> 00:47:40.686
William and Sam
are still asleep.

1144
00:47:50.296 --> 00:47:51.807
(Kicking)

1145
00:47:52.367 --> 00:47:53.807
Hey, stop.

1146
00:47:57.707 --> 00:48:01.077
(He thrashes
out of boredom.)

1147
00:48:03.376 --> 00:48:05.017
(Sighing)

1148
00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:08.287
Sam looks uncomfortable.

1149
00:48:08.316 --> 00:48:11.256
(What happened to Sam?)

1150
00:48:12.486 --> 00:48:16.097
Sam is recovering from
a gallbladder removal.

1151
00:48:17.896 --> 00:48:20.867
(Is Dad sick?)

1152
00:48:21.166 --> 00:48:22.296
Let's go.

1153
00:48:23.666 --> 00:48:27.106
(He climbs down the bed.)

1154
00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:32.577
(Screaming)

1155
00:48:33.006 --> 00:48:34.646
(William explores
the living room.)

1156
00:48:34.646 --> 00:48:37.247
Something catches
William's attention.

1157
00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:38.316
(He spots the target.)

1158
00:48:38.617 --> 00:48:42.117
They are potatoes
Yoo Mi prepared for Sam.

1159
00:48:43.157 --> 00:48:46.827
(Does Dad like potatoes?)

1160
00:48:49.327 --> 00:48:50.756
Dad.

1161
00:48:51.026 --> 00:48:52.327
Dad.

1162
00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:54.526
Dad.

1163
00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:59.137
(Eat this.)

1164
00:48:59.907 --> 00:49:02.677
What is that?
Is it for me?

1165
00:49:03.677 --> 00:49:04.847
Give it to me.

1166
00:49:04.847 --> 00:49:05.847
(Eating)

1167
00:49:06.307 --> 00:49:08.216
(Let me taste it first.)

1168
00:49:08.216 --> 00:49:09.276
Hey.

1169
00:49:10.276 --> 00:49:12.887
Isn't that what
Mom made for me?

1170
00:49:12.887 --> 00:49:13.947
(You are right.)

1171
00:49:13.947 --> 00:49:15.186
Are you going to eat
all of it?

1172
00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.517
Give it to me.

1173
00:49:18.657 --> 00:49:20.686
Thank you. William.

1174
00:49:21.396 --> 00:49:24.026
I don't have
a gallbladder.

1175
00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:26.526
You are not interested,
are you?

1176
00:49:30.236 --> 00:49:32.407
Do you want some?
It's tasty.

1177
00:49:34.666 --> 00:49:37.307
(He shouts in joy.)

1178
00:49:38.847 --> 00:49:39.977
Is it tasty?

1179
00:49:40.807 --> 00:49:42.347
(Munching)

1180
00:49:42.347 --> 00:49:43.376
Is it tasty?

1181
00:49:43.477 --> 00:49:46.387
I like it.
I like it a lot.

1182
00:49:47.546 --> 00:49:49.716
(Screaming)

1183
00:49:50.617 --> 00:49:52.387
What is going on?

1184
00:49:53.887 --> 00:49:56.256
- Dad.
- What?

1185
00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:59.227
Hurry up.

1186
00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:00.466
What?

1187
00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:01.936
Did you say
I am the best?

1188
00:50:03.296 --> 00:50:05.867
- Dad.
- Yes?

1189
00:50:06.166 --> 00:50:07.166
What is it?

1190
00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.207
(William picks up
a diaper.)

1191
00:50:11.207 --> 00:50:12.606
Do you need
your diaper changed?

1192
00:50:13.876 --> 00:50:16.316
(He brings
his own diaper.)

1193
00:50:16.316 --> 00:50:18.686
Good job.
Let's change your diaper.

1194
00:50:18.686 --> 00:50:21.347
(Leave the task to Dad.)

1195
00:50:23.287 --> 00:50:24.986
You peed a lot.

1196
00:50:27.927 --> 00:50:28.927
Put your pants on.

1197
00:50:31.026 --> 00:50:34.666
(Where are my clothes?)

1198
00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:39.307
He brings his own outfit.

1199
00:50:39.307 --> 00:50:40.606
(His mom prepared
his outfit in advance.)

1200
00:50:40.606 --> 00:50:42.307
What a nice boy.

1201
00:50:42.907 --> 00:50:44.077
Do you want to wear that?

1202
00:50:44.776 --> 00:50:46.146
Look at you.

1203
00:50:46.646 --> 00:50:47.847
Do you want to wear this?

1204
00:50:47.847 --> 00:50:49.247
(Hurry. I want
to wear it now.)

1205
00:50:49.247 --> 00:50:50.347
Hey.

1206
00:50:51.517 --> 00:50:53.947
William, don't you think
you're too cute?

1207
00:50:54.146 --> 00:50:55.856
Yes, William!

1208
00:50:55.856 --> 00:50:58.157
He's the most
adorable baby.

1209
00:50:58.157 --> 00:50:59.356
Here comes William.

1210
00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:02.457
You're making my heart
race as always.

1211
00:51:04.057 --> 00:51:06.296
(It's the white
bottom of a duck.)

1212
00:51:07.066 --> 00:51:09.066
(He flaps as if
he wants to fly.)

1213
00:51:10.497 --> 00:51:12.037
(Let us...)

1214
00:51:12.037 --> 00:51:14.137
(scream!)

1215
00:51:14.836 --> 00:51:17.207
William, don't you think
you're too cute?

1216
00:51:18.407 --> 00:51:19.546
William.

1217
00:51:19.947 --> 00:51:22.316
(He imitates a duck.)

1218
00:51:23.117 --> 00:51:24.546
(Imitating a motorcycle)

1219
00:51:24.546 --> 00:51:26.816
(He demonstrates
his best, special skill.)

1220
00:51:26.816 --> 00:51:30.256
William, don't you
like my beard?

1221
00:51:30.617 --> 00:51:31.657
Yes.

1222
00:51:33.927 --> 00:51:35.597
Here comes my beard.

1223
00:51:35.597 --> 00:51:37.597
(Shouting in joy)

1224
00:51:37.597 --> 00:51:39.367
(He cheers whenever
he touches the beard.)

1225
00:51:40.296 --> 00:51:42.796
(William can't get enough
of his dad's beard.)

1226
00:51:43.436 --> 00:51:46.807
But I'm going
to shave my beard today.

1227
00:51:46.807 --> 00:51:49.736
I must since your sibling
will be born soon.

1228
00:51:49.907 --> 00:51:51.577
Before I shave it off,

1229
00:51:51.577 --> 00:51:54.247
I really wanted
to try this, William.

1230
00:51:56.347 --> 00:51:58.586
Tell me what you think
about it.

1231
00:51:59.787 --> 00:52:00.887
Aren't these pretty?

1232
00:52:00.887 --> 00:52:01.957
(Flowers?)

1233
00:52:01.957 --> 00:52:04.316
These days,
when hipsters...

1234
00:52:04.316 --> 00:52:06.756
grow their beard out,
they put them in here.

1235
00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:08.097
(Hipsters are youngsters
with unique fashion.)

1236
00:52:08.997 --> 00:52:11.026
This is the flowery beard
that is getting popular...

1237
00:52:11.026 --> 00:52:12.227
among fashion enthusiasts.

1238
00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.666
Sam is going to try this?

1239
00:52:17.066 --> 00:52:19.336
(He's arranging
flowers in his beard.)

1240
00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:21.677
(He wants to go out with
a bang before the shave.)

1241
00:52:21.677 --> 00:52:23.236
William, put them
in for me.

1242
00:52:25.307 --> 00:52:26.606
No, not in my mouth.

1243
00:52:30.017 --> 00:52:31.387
Where? Here?

1244
00:52:32.117 --> 00:52:33.916
Beard and mouth are
two different things.

1245
00:52:33.916 --> 00:52:35.716
(Biting)

1246
00:52:36.957 --> 00:52:39.427
(Gosh, you're
hurting my hand.)

1247
00:52:40.186 --> 00:52:41.827
Stop putting them
in my mouth.

1248
00:52:42.657 --> 00:52:45.666
(How does Sam look
with flowers?)

1249
00:52:46.697 --> 00:52:48.796
Sam's flowery beard
is finished.

1250
00:52:49.436 --> 00:52:52.736
This looks a bit odd,
but it looks pretty.

1251
00:52:53.606 --> 00:52:56.307
(Oh, my! My dad
looks interesting.)

1252
00:52:57.177 --> 00:52:59.807
Don't you like it?
Don't you like my beard?

1253
00:53:00.276 --> 00:53:02.177
Why are you taking
them out?

1254
00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:04.816
I took it out.

1255
00:53:07.847 --> 00:53:09.916
1, 2, 3.
Clicking. Clicking.

1256
00:53:11.626 --> 00:53:13.657
(He took a selfie
to record this moment.)

1257
00:53:14.727 --> 00:53:16.827
It's time to say goodbye
to his beard.

1258
00:53:17.256 --> 00:53:19.396
How will Sam
look afterward?

1259
00:53:21.227 --> 00:53:22.236
Bye.

1260
00:53:22.236 --> 00:53:23.597
(Bye, my beard.)

1261
00:53:24.097 --> 00:53:25.336
What a shame.

1262
00:53:25.336 --> 00:53:26.707
(He's sad to let it go.)

1263
00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:33.646
(William, the duck,
is swimming.)

1264
00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.416
(Shouting)

1265
00:53:42.416 --> 00:53:44.887
(Is he trying
to do planks?)

1266
00:53:44.986 --> 00:53:47.256
William is looking
at things upside down.

1267
00:53:48.327 --> 00:53:50.097
At that age,
babies enjoy...

1268
00:53:50.097 --> 00:53:52.327
looking at things
upside down.

1269
00:53:52.327 --> 00:53:54.126
Seo Jun. Look at you.

1270
00:53:54.126 --> 00:53:55.936
(He puts his head down on
the floor like William.)

1271
00:53:57.497 --> 00:54:01.707
(He starts to look
the world upside down.)

1272
00:54:03.836 --> 00:54:05.747
(William is
full of curiosity.)

1273
00:54:05.747 --> 00:54:08.447
William, is it fun to see
things upside down?

1274
00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:14.416
(The world upside down
is fun and intriguing.)

1275
00:54:15.486 --> 00:54:17.256
(The doghouse seems...)

1276
00:54:17.256 --> 00:54:20.626
(pretty nice upside down.)

1277
00:54:21.796 --> 00:54:22.827
Hey, William.

1278
00:54:23.497 --> 00:54:25.697
(No!)

1279
00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.097
William.

1280
00:54:29.197 --> 00:54:30.267
Come.

1281
00:54:30.966 --> 00:54:34.506
Come here. Something
has changed about me.

1282
00:54:34.876 --> 00:54:37.477
William, aren't you
curious of the change?

1283
00:54:37.477 --> 00:54:38.947
(How did his look change?)

1284
00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:42.847
(Pulling)

1285
00:54:43.646 --> 00:54:45.847
(Giggling)

1286
00:54:47.416 --> 00:54:49.256
(Ta-da)

1287
00:54:49.256 --> 00:54:51.856
(Sam looks neat,
but slightly empty.)

1288
00:54:51.856 --> 00:54:54.157
The beard you like
is gone, isn't it?

1289
00:54:54.827 --> 00:54:57.626
Sam, you look much
younger than before!

1290
00:54:58.827 --> 00:55:01.097
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.

1291
00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:04.566
(He feels awkward and
unfamiliar with his face.)

1292
00:55:05.106 --> 00:55:07.666
(William, please
give me a kiss.)

1293
00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:10.336
(Punching)

1294
00:55:12.347 --> 00:55:13.347
What was that?

1295
00:55:13.347 --> 00:55:14.816
(He slaps
Sam's empty chin.)

1296
00:55:15.876 --> 00:55:19.716
(He keeps on playing
with Sam.)

1297
00:55:20.347 --> 00:55:21.957
Stop hitting me.

1298
00:55:23.117 --> 00:55:25.856
(Grinning)

1299
00:55:26.186 --> 00:55:28.197
My gosh. Give me a kiss.

1300
00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.327
(William got used
to Sam's new look.)

1301
00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:34.197
William, shall we go out?

1302
00:55:34.836 --> 00:55:36.166
- Let's go.
- Do you want to go?

1303
00:55:36.537 --> 00:55:37.697
Okay. Let's go.

1304
00:55:38.236 --> 00:55:40.267
Let's get going.

1305
00:55:40.736 --> 00:55:42.376
Can you knock? Knock.

1306
00:55:42.376 --> 00:55:43.707
(Where are they going
with the box?)

1307
00:55:44.907 --> 00:55:47.247
Knock, knock, knock.
Hello?

1308
00:55:47.376 --> 00:55:49.416
- Who is this?
- Are you Donald Duck?

1309
00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:53.847
- Hello.
- Hi.

1310
00:55:53.847 --> 00:55:55.356
(They are hip hop
artist couple.)

1311
00:55:55.356 --> 00:55:57.416
- Hi.
- Thanks for inviting me.

1312
00:55:57.416 --> 00:55:59.256
- Who is that? Hello.
- This is...

1313
00:55:59.557 --> 00:56:00.727
William.

1314
00:56:01.427 --> 00:56:03.896
- Oh, my goodness!
- Hello.

1315
00:56:05.566 --> 00:56:08.097
Two of most famous hip
hop artists got married.

1316
00:56:08.097 --> 00:56:10.966
Their marriage garnered
a lot of attention.

1317
00:56:11.436 --> 00:56:13.936
They are parents
of Jordan.

1318
00:56:13.936 --> 00:56:16.037
(It's a hip hop family
with a 10-year-old kid.)

1319
00:56:17.736 --> 00:56:19.407
- He's so handsome.
- Hi.

1320
00:56:20.407 --> 00:56:22.276
Hello, come here, please.

1321
00:56:22.276 --> 00:56:23.477
Give me a hand.

1322
00:56:23.477 --> 00:56:24.577
Hello.

1323
00:56:24.577 --> 00:56:26.247
- You'll keep saying hi?
- Hi.

1324
00:56:26.517 --> 00:56:27.686
- My gosh.
- Hi.

1325
00:56:27.816 --> 00:56:29.856
- Thank you for your help.
- Don't mention it.

1326
00:56:29.856 --> 00:56:32.557
For the fourth anniversary
special,

1327
00:56:32.557 --> 00:56:34.427
we're holding a bazaar.

1328
00:56:34.427 --> 00:56:36.526
- I see.
- We're having a bazaar.

1329
00:56:37.057 --> 00:56:38.566
I heard you were
willing to donate.

1330
00:56:38.566 --> 00:56:39.827
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

1331
00:56:40.227 --> 00:56:42.066
We didn't get
to prepare a lot.

1332
00:56:42.066 --> 00:56:44.236
I heard you regularly make
donations like saints.

1333
00:56:44.236 --> 00:56:45.666
No, we are not saints.

1334
00:56:46.037 --> 00:56:48.776
Good deeds are
second nature to them.

1335
00:56:48.776 --> 00:56:50.807
Thank you
for your participation.

1336
00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:55.017
Mi Rae usually takes
initiates about that.

1337
00:56:55.017 --> 00:56:57.876
And I just
follow her lead.

1338
00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:01.387
Hello.

1339
00:57:01.787 --> 00:57:03.316
Where are you going?

1340
00:57:03.316 --> 00:57:05.557
- Come here.
- Come to this spot.

1341
00:57:05.827 --> 00:57:07.686
- My gosh.
- Hi.

1342
00:57:11.256 --> 00:57:12.827
He's so cute.

1343
00:57:13.267 --> 00:57:14.367
I guess he's comfortable.

1344
00:57:14.367 --> 00:57:15.796
(He made himself at home.)

1345
00:57:15.796 --> 00:57:17.267
- Hey, you.
- Studio.

1346
00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:20.166
- William, no. It's dirty.
- What's that?

1347
00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:21.677
- That's dirty.
- Jump.

1348
00:57:22.137 --> 00:57:23.506
- Come here.
- Jump.

1349
00:57:23.836 --> 00:57:26.646
(Mi Rae goes along
with his dance.)

1350
00:57:26.646 --> 00:57:29.117
Tell her that
you love her.

1351
00:57:29.376 --> 00:57:31.316
- He got excited.
- What's up with him?

1352
00:57:32.546 --> 00:57:33.617
Let's shake hands.

1353
00:57:35.856 --> 00:57:36.916
Let's shake hands.

1354
00:57:39.787 --> 00:57:41.026
Thank you.

1355
00:57:41.026 --> 00:57:42.097
(That wasn't much.)

1356
00:57:42.097 --> 00:57:44.256
William, shake her hands.

1357
00:57:45.396 --> 00:57:46.526
Shake her hands.

1358
00:57:46.727 --> 00:57:47.966
(He turns into a softie.)

1359
00:57:47.966 --> 00:57:49.066
You don't like it?

1360
00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:52.566
- Hello.
- Who is he?

1361
00:57:52.707 --> 00:57:54.367
- Let's see.
- Come this way.

1362
00:57:54.436 --> 00:57:55.637
Where are you going?

1363
00:57:55.836 --> 00:57:57.577
He runs around
as if it's his home.

1364
00:57:57.577 --> 00:57:58.947
(William starts
playing hide and seek.)

1365
00:58:00.606 --> 00:58:01.716
William.

1366
00:58:02.017 --> 00:58:04.216
(Chuckling)

1367
00:58:04.216 --> 00:58:06.347
- Stop it.
- His mother...

1368
00:58:06.447 --> 00:58:07.747
William, come here.

1369
00:58:07.947 --> 00:58:09.686
- I'm his fan.
- Really?

1370
00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:12.227
Our whole family was
excited about his visit.

1371
00:58:12.227 --> 00:58:13.827
- I came to see William.
- Seriously?

1372
00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:17.256
All right. Wait a second.

1373
00:58:18.066 --> 00:58:19.197
Hey, you.

1374
00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:22.367
Hang on a second. William.

1375
00:58:23.396 --> 00:58:25.267
William, come back.

1376
00:58:25.537 --> 00:58:26.936
I have something
to show you.

1377
00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:28.637
Hey, what's this?

1378
00:58:28.637 --> 00:58:29.836
(Provoking his curiosity)

1379
00:58:30.376 --> 00:58:32.247
What is this?
What is this?

1380
00:58:32.247 --> 00:58:33.947
(What? What is it?)

1381
00:58:35.146 --> 00:58:36.477
- It's William!
- There.

1382
00:58:37.517 --> 00:58:38.887
(He goes into the box.)

1383
00:58:38.887 --> 00:58:40.247
William is the present!

1384
00:58:40.247 --> 00:58:41.986
- I should buy William.
- Yes!

1385
00:58:42.816 --> 00:58:44.287
All right. William.

1386
00:58:45.157 --> 00:58:46.486
(Revving)

1387
00:58:46.486 --> 00:58:48.827
I'm donating William?

1388
00:58:48.827 --> 00:58:51.566
Wait. I can't
give him away.

1389
00:58:51.566 --> 00:58:53.126
- Can't I keep him?
- Sorry?

1390
00:58:55.097 --> 00:58:56.197
(That's a good idea.)

1391
00:58:56.197 --> 00:58:57.336
Do you want
to play together?

1392
00:58:58.566 --> 00:59:00.066
(They take out
what they prepared.)

1393
00:59:00.066 --> 00:59:01.577
We wanted to give
Mi Rae's hats away.

1394
00:59:02.236 --> 00:59:04.537
You can take ones
with pictures kids like.

1395
00:59:05.747 --> 00:59:09.077
(It's a toy dinosaur
Jordan used to play with.)

1396
00:59:09.077 --> 00:59:11.146
- What is this?
- A dinosaur!

1397
00:59:12.287 --> 00:59:13.316
William.

1398
00:59:14.387 --> 00:59:17.416
William, are you scared?
Are you scared?

1399
00:59:17.416 --> 00:59:19.287
(No, there's no way.)

1400
00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:25.227
(Flinching)

1401
00:59:25.966 --> 00:59:27.867
(He says hello
swallowing his fear.)

1402
00:59:27.867 --> 00:59:29.936
Are you scared?
Is it scary? Okay.

1403
00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:31.936
- Thank you.
- This.

1404
00:59:32.336 --> 00:59:33.907
- William, let's...
- Good job.

1405
00:59:33.907 --> 00:59:35.106
Let's take this too.

1406
00:59:37.376 --> 00:59:38.847
(Super Market)

1407
00:59:38.847 --> 00:59:41.177
I will sell
all of these and...

1408
00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:42.617
- use it for a good cause.
- Thank you.

1409
00:59:42.617 --> 00:59:44.447
- Thanks for the chance.
- Don't mention it.

1410
00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:46.747
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1411
00:59:46.747 --> 00:59:48.186
- Now...
- He's not going, is it?

1412
00:59:48.186 --> 00:59:50.416
William should
get going. I'm sorry.

1413
00:59:50.416 --> 00:59:52.927
- Do you not want to go?
- If you invite us,

1414
00:59:53.557 --> 00:59:55.256
- we'll come back.
- He can't go.

1415
00:59:55.256 --> 00:59:57.756
- Please come by often.
- Visit us often.

1416
00:59:57.856 --> 00:59:59.896
- I love you, William.
- Say, "Love you too."

1417
01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.396
Give her a kiss.

1418
01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:04.267
(Kissing)

1419
01:00:07.736 --> 01:00:09.336
(On an average day...)

1420
01:00:09.336 --> 01:00:10.407
Let's go.

1421
01:00:11.336 --> 01:00:12.947
Hold my hands.

1422
01:00:12.947 --> 01:00:14.546
(These people showed
up out of the blue.)

1423
01:00:14.546 --> 01:00:16.747
He resembles someone
we are familiar with.

1424
01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:20.416
It's Lee Dong Wook, uncle
of the three siblings.

1425
01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.416
Doesn't the outfit
resemble Grim Reaper's?

1426
01:00:22.856 --> 01:00:25.557
(I don't remember
my previous life.)

1427
01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:29.697
(Si An
with sorrowful eyes.)

1428
01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:33.597
(I feel awkward
in this outfit.)

1429
01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:37.396
(Mr. Grim Reaper,
Dong Gook, not Dong Wook)

1430
01:00:38.106 --> 01:00:40.736
(Come out Goblin,
I'll be your bride.)

1431
01:00:40.867 --> 01:00:44.876
(Goblin bride,
Seol Eun Tak)

1432
01:00:45.407 --> 01:00:46.577
How is the weather today?

1433
01:00:47.546 --> 01:00:48.977
"Because it was
a good day..."

1434
01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.787
"Because it wasn't
a good day..."

1435
01:00:52.046 --> 01:00:54.517
We're here to see
the goblin.

1436
01:00:54.957 --> 01:00:57.887
Si An. You look
really sharp today.

1437
01:00:58.057 --> 01:00:59.356
- Over there.
- What is that?

1438
01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.856
- Is that the list?
- No.

1439
01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:02.526
- It's the death list.
- No.

1440
01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.327
My name's not on there,
is it?

1441
01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:05.666
Whose name is on it?

1442
01:01:07.896 --> 01:01:09.637
It's here.
I think we're here.

1443
01:01:09.896 --> 01:01:12.506
We should go in
before he does.

1444
01:01:13.267 --> 01:01:15.137
I'm so embarrassed
right now.

1445
01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.506
However, someone's
already waiting inside...

1446
01:01:19.577 --> 01:01:21.347
for the kids to come.

1447
01:01:24.216 --> 01:01:26.387
It's Grim Reaper,
Lee Dong Wook.

1448
01:01:26.387 --> 01:01:27.716
(Their forever uncle,
actor Lee Dong Wook)

1449
01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:30.117
Will they remember me?

1450
01:01:31.526 --> 01:01:34.427
I can't tell
every time I see them.

1451
01:01:35.296 --> 01:01:36.997
- I'll go in.
- Okay.

1452
01:01:36.997 --> 01:01:38.427
(Are they here?)

1453
01:01:40.126 --> 01:01:43.537
(He's getting nervous.)

1454
01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.867
- Is it here?
- Call for him.

1455
01:01:45.867 --> 01:01:47.666
- See where he is.
- Uncle.

1456
01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:49.707
He's right here!

1457
01:01:50.477 --> 01:01:52.876
(Laughing)

1458
01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:54.307
Yes, I'm here.

1459
01:01:56.347 --> 01:01:57.617
(They had an exciting
first meeting.)

1460
01:01:57.617 --> 01:01:59.747
The first meeting gave
them butterflies.

1461
01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.457
(What's wrong
with you guys?)

1462
01:02:02.856 --> 01:02:04.887
I'm Lee Dong Wook.
Our names are similar.

1463
01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:05.887
- Yes.
- Yes.

1464
01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:07.256
Lee Dong Gook?

1465
01:02:10.057 --> 01:02:14.296
(Sometimes,
Dong Wook had it tough.)

1466
01:02:15.097 --> 01:02:18.407
(He loves the children.)

1467
01:02:19.037 --> 01:02:21.776
(He came back
like a present.)

1468
01:02:23.376 --> 01:02:25.947
(They're always happy
to see this uncle.)

1469
01:02:25.947 --> 01:02:27.807
- Si An.
- Hello.

1470
01:02:27.807 --> 01:02:29.517
- It's been a while.
- Hello.

1471
01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:30.617
What's with the hat?

1472
01:02:30.617 --> 01:02:33.416
We dressed up as you
since we're meeting.

1473
01:02:33.847 --> 01:02:36.387
Hey, Si An.

1474
01:02:36.856 --> 01:02:38.756
Why are you wearing this?

1475
01:02:39.227 --> 01:02:40.486
- Finger flicks.
- Finger flicks?

1476
01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:42.957
- Why?
- You have to say...

1477
01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:44.896
- his name right.
- Is that so?

1478
01:02:44.896 --> 01:02:46.697
Should I call him
Si An from now?

1479
01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:48.236
He knows his name well.

1480
01:02:48.836 --> 01:02:51.936
- Uncle.
- How do we look?

1481
01:02:53.267 --> 01:02:55.436
What do you think?
It's embarrassing.

1482
01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.807
I was really embarrassed.

1483
01:02:58.477 --> 01:02:59.646
Wow, Si An.

1484
01:02:59.646 --> 01:03:02.077
- You look cool.
- Uncle Dong Wook...

1485
01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:05.787
You were in a gift box.

1486
01:03:05.787 --> 01:03:08.057
- Yes, I was.
- Yes.

1487
01:03:08.057 --> 01:03:11.526
- Do you remember?
- When Soo A fell,

1488
01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:14.927
- you held her.
- That's right.

1489
01:03:14.927 --> 01:03:17.097
- Do you remember that?
- Yes.

1490
01:03:17.296 --> 01:03:19.197
Do you remember any
happy moments with me?

1491
01:03:22.597 --> 01:03:24.267
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1492
01:03:24.807 --> 01:03:26.807
(Are you serious?)

1493
01:03:26.807 --> 01:03:29.376
What about you?
What was memorable?

1494
01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:31.477
I don't know either.

1495
01:03:31.847 --> 01:03:33.447
(I thought
we were happy...)

1496
01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.517
(That's why you should be
nicer to us.)

1497
01:03:38.017 --> 01:03:40.916
Should we get Dong Wook
to try this?

1498
01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:44.256
He'll ruin his hair
if he puts it on.

1499
01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:49.197
- I'll do it for you.
- My gosh.

1500
01:03:49.197 --> 01:03:50.957
- It looks different.
- Right?

1501
01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:52.927
(Grim Reaper is back.)

1502
01:03:54.227 --> 01:03:56.097
(She's smiling so much.)

1503
01:03:57.066 --> 01:04:01.166
Hey, Seol A. Your eyes
have hearts coming out.

1504
01:04:01.936 --> 01:04:04.707
What's wrong with you?

1505
01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:07.347
You're not like this
when you're with me.

1506
01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:10.046
Seol A and Soo A
look more like...

1507
01:04:10.117 --> 01:04:11.986
your wife now.

1508
01:04:12.646 --> 01:04:14.287
- Really?
- They're getting pretty.

1509
01:04:15.316 --> 01:04:18.017
They're bigger now.
How long has it been?

1510
01:04:18.017 --> 01:04:20.256
I went to visit after
the drama finished.

1511
01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:23.126
- Maybe 6 to 7 months ago.
- We moved.

1512
01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:24.697
Yes,
I heard from your wife.

1513
01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:28.966
Thanks to the show,
they got close.

1514
01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:30.836
It's so nice to see.

1515
01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.066
(Si An saw something.)

1516
01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:35.807
- Take this out.
- Take it out?

1517
01:04:36.407 --> 01:04:37.876
- What is it?
- You can't look.

1518
01:04:37.876 --> 01:04:39.207
Do you want me
to take it out for you?

1519
01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:41.947
- Take it out.
- Take it out for me.

1520
01:04:41.947 --> 01:04:43.077
How do you use it?

1521
01:04:43.077 --> 01:04:44.447
(Nervous)

1522
01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:47.847
(Ta-da!)

1523
01:04:48.157 --> 01:04:49.256
How do you use it?

1524
01:04:51.057 --> 01:04:52.856
Soo A drew it.

1525
01:04:53.327 --> 01:04:55.457
Can I show everyone?

1526
01:04:55.457 --> 01:04:56.997
Can I show it
to the camera?

1527
01:04:57.256 --> 01:04:58.267
Is it okay?

1528
01:04:59.367 --> 01:05:00.497
What is this?

1529
01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:03.396
(It's more abstract
than a Picasso.)

1530
01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.907
- It's a heart.
- It's a heart.

1531
01:05:05.907 --> 01:05:08.407
Is it a heart? Like this?
It's a heart.

1532
01:05:08.407 --> 01:05:09.606
It's a heart.

1533
01:05:10.077 --> 01:05:12.876
- Is it a heart?
- There are three hearts.

1534
01:05:13.347 --> 01:05:16.546
- Soo A drew it.
- Soo A drew it?

1535
01:05:16.617 --> 01:05:18.247
(Thank you, Soo A.)

1536
01:05:19.847 --> 01:05:21.617
- Thank you.
- What about mine?

1537
01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:22.617
I don't have it.

1538
01:05:24.316 --> 01:05:27.086
- There is only one.
- Just one?

1539
01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.856
Then you should
give it to me.

1540
01:05:29.227 --> 01:05:32.526
(I don't know.)

1541
01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:34.497
What is this?

1542
01:05:35.166 --> 01:05:36.166
- What is that?
- I don't have it.

1543
01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.166
You don't?

1544
01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:40.006
Si An, you're so good
at talking now.

1545
01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.407
He can speak English too.

1546
01:05:41.477 --> 01:05:42.477
Can you speak in English?

1547
01:05:43.537 --> 01:05:45.407
- What's your name?
- My name is Si An.

1548
01:05:46.747 --> 01:05:48.876
(My name is Si An.)

1549
01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.787
How old are you?

1550
01:05:53.086 --> 01:05:55.686
I'm four.

1551
01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:59.026
See? You can take him
to Paris now.

1552
01:05:59.486 --> 01:06:00.787
He's better than me.

1553
01:06:00.986 --> 01:06:03.896
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

1554
01:06:04.796 --> 01:06:06.767
11, 12,

1555
01:06:07.367 --> 01:06:09.396
13...

1556
01:06:09.396 --> 01:06:10.666
- What?
- What?

1557
01:06:11.907 --> 01:06:13.207
He's unsure.

1558
01:06:13.707 --> 01:06:15.936
You got it right.
Good job.

1559
01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:18.207
- Great job. Si An.
- Good job.

1560
01:06:18.546 --> 01:06:19.747
When did you learn that?

1561
01:06:19.747 --> 01:06:21.776
How do you say white
in English?

1562
01:06:23.077 --> 01:06:24.747
- Isn't it?
- White.

1563
01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:25.816
White?

1564
01:06:26.046 --> 01:06:27.046
That's wrong.

1565
01:06:27.046 --> 01:06:29.287
- We have to be natural.
- Uncle Dong Gook.

1566
01:06:29.287 --> 01:06:31.657
(He's counting
in Chinese now.)

1567
01:06:31.657 --> 01:06:35.126
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1568
01:06:35.396 --> 01:06:37.856
He should go to China.

1569
01:06:38.966 --> 01:06:41.466
- His pronunciation.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...

1570
01:06:41.466 --> 01:06:42.736
It's here.

1571
01:06:44.736 --> 01:06:47.336
Look at that.
It's Si An's favorite.

1572
01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.707
(There are various meats
and seafood.)

1573
01:06:50.037 --> 01:06:51.137
Can you use
chopsticks well?

1574
01:06:51.977 --> 01:06:53.006
Can you use them well now?

1575
01:06:53.606 --> 01:06:55.677
Yes. Look at this.

1576
01:06:55.977 --> 01:06:58.186
- I only need one.
- Really?

1577
01:06:58.186 --> 01:06:59.986
Si An, can you use it too?

1578
01:07:00.247 --> 01:07:01.686
- Yes.
- You can get flicked.

1579
01:07:01.686 --> 01:07:05.086
Tofu. Try picking it up
with your chopsticks.

1580
01:07:05.157 --> 01:07:07.057
The tofu. Tofu.

1581
01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:09.057
- Pick up the tofu.
- Yes.

1582
01:07:09.057 --> 01:07:10.927
(It's not easy
even for an adult.)

1583
01:07:12.966 --> 01:07:15.466
You'll get a finger flick
if you can't get it.

1584
01:07:15.767 --> 01:07:17.896
You have 10 seconds.

1585
01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:21.707
- 1, 2, 3...
- No.

1586
01:07:21.836 --> 01:07:23.707
(It's finally starting.)

1587
01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:26.177
Dad, don't do that!

1588
01:07:26.177 --> 01:07:28.876
- Stop!
- Don't do that!

1589
01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:30.847
(Surprised)

1590
01:07:31.816 --> 01:07:34.517
Si An, does your dad
always bully you?

1591
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:36.657
- Does he?
- Yes.

1592
01:07:36.657 --> 01:07:39.227
Do you want me to be
on your team today?

1593
01:07:39.287 --> 01:07:40.787
Shall we take
our revenge on him?

1594
01:07:41.256 --> 01:07:42.827
(Let me talk into
your ear.)

1595
01:07:42.827 --> 01:07:44.497
Si An.

1596
01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:46.896
- Whisper.
- Whisper? Why?

1597
01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:49.867
(Are they sharing
a secret?)

1598
01:07:51.666 --> 01:07:53.006
(Peeved)

1599
01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.907
(What's going on?)

1600
01:07:58.046 --> 01:07:59.077
Guys.

1601
01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:01.416
It doesn't feel good
when they whisper, right?

1602
01:08:02.046 --> 01:08:03.247
- Right?
- You don't know?

1603
01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:06.117
It's not good for men
to whisper.

1604
01:08:07.046 --> 01:08:08.517
(What are they
talking about?)

1605
01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.117
- Sausage?
- Sausage.

1606
01:08:11.686 --> 01:08:14.827
He whispered "sausage"
in my ear.

1607
01:08:14.827 --> 01:08:15.957
What is that?

1608
01:08:15.957 --> 01:08:21.396
Dad stole and ate
my sausage.

1609
01:08:21.396 --> 01:08:24.867
I stole his sausage once.
He still remembers?

1610
01:08:25.537 --> 01:08:28.106
(They're so sweet.)

1611
01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:29.577
- Sausage.
- I don't want it.

1612
01:08:29.577 --> 01:08:32.047
- Sausage. Sausage.
- You don't want this?

1613
01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:35.346
(I want to whisper
to Dong Wook too.)

1614
01:08:35.776 --> 01:08:37.747
Si An, what should I
give to Dong Wook?

1615
01:08:37.976 --> 01:08:40.146
- My teacher.
- Your teacher?

1616
01:08:40.146 --> 01:08:43.957
- Beef?
- Beef? Thank you.

1617
01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.056
- It's hot.
- What else?

1618
01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:47.026
What else should I eat?

1619
01:08:47.757 --> 01:08:49.096
- Shrimp.
- Shrimp?

1620
01:08:49.096 --> 01:08:50.896
Wow. It's hard to peel.

1621
01:08:52.026 --> 01:08:54.026
- Chicken.
- Chicken too?

1622
01:08:54.026 --> 01:08:55.566
Chicken too.

1623
01:08:56.337 --> 01:08:57.467
Thank you.

1624
01:08:57.467 --> 01:08:59.467
- Next.
- What about Dad?

1625
01:08:59.467 --> 01:09:01.306
- What should I eat?
- What should he eat?

1626
01:09:01.377 --> 01:09:02.736
(This looks good.)

1627
01:09:02.736 --> 01:09:04.106
- Dad.
- One?

1628
01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:06.846
Do you want Dad
to eat this?

1629
01:09:06.947 --> 01:09:07.947
Yes.

1630
01:09:08.646 --> 01:09:09.776
What should he eat?

1631
01:09:09.776 --> 01:09:11.686
(It's a piece of
bell pepper.)

1632
01:09:12.617 --> 01:09:14.346
Soo A, what should I eat?

1633
01:09:14.346 --> 01:09:15.917
- Kimchi.
- Kimchi?

1634
01:09:16.686 --> 01:09:20.426
But you like
eating kimchi.

1635
01:09:20.426 --> 01:09:22.896
- What about meat?
- Okay.

1636
01:09:22.896 --> 01:09:24.627
You gave Dong Wook
so much.

1637
01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:25.697
Should we give Dad
some chicken?

1638
01:09:25.697 --> 01:09:28.096
- Yes.
- He should have some.

1639
01:09:28.736 --> 01:09:30.367
- I'll eat too.
- Okay.

1640
01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:32.066
- Thank you for the food.
- Okay.

1641
01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:36.077
(Have some of this.)

1642
01:09:36.436 --> 01:09:40.547
(The twins are busy
caring for Dong Wook.)

1643
01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.047
Is that for me?

1644
01:09:43.276 --> 01:09:45.117
Isn't the chili spicy?

1645
01:09:46.386 --> 01:09:48.217
(Here's another one.)

1646
01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:51.087
- Again?
- You should have more.

1647
01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:54.657
(He's getting
too many wraps.)

1648
01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:57.757
Uncle.

1649
01:09:57.757 --> 01:09:59.627
(Have one of mine too.)

1650
01:10:00.667 --> 01:10:01.736
This is a chicken wing.

1651
01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:05.566
(Seol A invented
a new kind of wrap.)

1652
01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:08.736
(Dong Wook is
still eating it all.)

1653
01:10:09.176 --> 01:10:10.276
(Proud)

1654
01:10:12.407 --> 01:10:14.007
(Si An is picking up
a lettuce.)

1655
01:10:14.007 --> 01:10:15.276
He's an expert
at making wraps.

1656
01:10:15.476 --> 01:10:17.217
- Do it like this.
- Make me one.

1657
01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:21.047
- Spider. Spider.
- Do you like this?

1658
01:10:21.047 --> 01:10:23.056
- Yes, I like it.
- Where did the spider go?

1659
01:10:23.056 --> 01:10:25.127
But we don't put in
the whole thing at once.

1660
01:10:25.726 --> 01:10:28.726
(He's putting a chili
on the lettuce.)

1661
01:10:28.726 --> 01:10:32.726
(Finished)

1662
01:10:33.327 --> 01:10:34.327
Is that it?

1663
01:10:35.236 --> 01:10:36.736
What about meat?
Do I get any?

1664
01:10:37.396 --> 01:10:38.407
You don't...

1665
01:10:39.066 --> 01:10:40.537
like meat.

1666
01:10:41.106 --> 01:10:43.007
(Since when?)

1667
01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.806
You should
dip it in a sauce.

1668
01:10:44.976 --> 01:10:46.676
Salt and soy sauce?

1669
01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:47.747
Ssamjang?

1670
01:10:49.016 --> 01:10:50.016
Should I eat it?

1671
01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:51.816
- Here.
- You'll drop it.

1672
01:10:52.117 --> 01:10:53.686
(Eating)

1673
01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:55.287
I think it'll be spicy.

1674
01:10:59.226 --> 01:11:00.226
Is it spicy?

1675
01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:02.056
(He's acting like
it's not spicy.)

1676
01:11:02.056 --> 01:11:03.056
Si An.

1677
01:11:03.896 --> 01:11:07.066
Si An, you should
give him meat too.

1678
01:11:07.127 --> 01:11:08.936
- Here's water.
- It's spicy.

1679
01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:11.136
Give him a wrap.

1680
01:11:11.837 --> 01:11:12.837
It's okay.

1681
01:11:15.577 --> 01:11:16.577
It's okay.

1682
01:11:20.146 --> 01:11:22.077
(Dong Gook is jealous
regardless.)

1683
01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:23.516
You never make it for me.

1684
01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.087
What is that?
What is that?

1685
01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.016
What is that face?

1686
01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:32.257
Move,
I have to watch the news.

1687
01:11:33.257 --> 01:11:35.757
(Quivering)

1688
01:11:37.457 --> 01:11:39.896
(His charisma made
Lee Soon Jae turn away.)

1689
01:11:41.026 --> 01:11:42.896
They look
exactly the same.

1690
01:11:43.337 --> 01:11:44.537
Make a wrap for me.

1691
01:11:44.537 --> 01:11:46.367
(I'm no longer
the gentle Si An.)

1692
01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:48.007
Give it to Dad,
so he can be healthy.

1693
01:11:48.106 --> 01:11:51.306
I never ate garlic
or chili in my life.

1694
01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:55.747
I sang the gulping song
yesterday.

1695
01:11:55.747 --> 01:11:57.077
Do you remember?

1696
01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.617
Yes, the gulping song?

1697
01:11:59.117 --> 01:12:01.486
("Gulping Song"
by Lee Si An)

1698
01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:02.617
Okay.

1699
01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:06.787
(Gulp and gulp)

1700
01:12:06.787 --> 01:12:12.127
(It's a song dedicated
to picky eaters.)

1701
01:12:12.467 --> 01:12:14.526
(Now, eat it.)

1702
01:12:15.797 --> 01:12:18.066
(He's so persistent.)

1703
01:12:18.507 --> 01:12:19.967
(While Si An is
preoccupied...)

1704
01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:21.377
(He's acting like
he ate it.)

1705
01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:25.676
(Hiding)

1706
01:12:26.377 --> 01:12:28.247
Thank you, Si An.
I ate it.

1707
01:12:29.947 --> 01:12:31.117
Open up.

1708
01:12:34.047 --> 01:12:35.417
He didn't eat it.
It's in his hand.

1709
01:12:36.157 --> 01:12:38.787
(Guilty)

1710
01:12:40.426 --> 01:12:42.426
- Hurry up and eat it.
- I'm sorry.

1711
01:12:42.426 --> 01:12:43.497
Let me apologize.

1712
01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:46.627
I'm sorry
I always make fun of you.

1713
01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:49.997
Don't give me this
with innocent eyes.

1714
01:12:50.396 --> 01:12:52.967
It's scary.
Is it because of the hat?

1715
01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:55.276
It's because of the hat.

1716
01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:57.236
Hurry up and eat it.

1717
01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.776
Let me dip it
in something.

1718
01:12:59.877 --> 01:13:01.247
- This one?
- Yes.

1719
01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.386
(He's eating the chili.)

1720
01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:09.356
Something else?
Another one?

1721
01:13:10.087 --> 01:13:11.787
Do you like chili?

1722
01:13:13.186 --> 01:13:16.297
(You can't have
leftovers.)

1723
01:13:19.797 --> 01:13:21.497
(My goodness...)

1724
01:13:21.766 --> 01:13:23.997
This chili is so spicy.

1725
01:13:23.997 --> 01:13:25.167
(He can feel
the spiciness.)

1726
01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.167
It's super spicy.

1727
01:13:26.167 --> 01:13:28.407
(Si An got his revenge
against his dad.)

1728
01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:33.146
Don't make fun of
Si An anymore.

1729
01:13:33.306 --> 01:13:36.117
Don't make fun of
Si An anymore.

1730
01:13:36.247 --> 01:13:38.047
Okay, I won't make fun.
I'll just joke.

1731
01:13:39.087 --> 01:13:40.087
No.

1732
01:13:40.247 --> 01:13:42.016
- No.
- No.

1733
01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:45.186
Si An,
you got your revenge.

1734
01:13:45.356 --> 01:13:46.356
Give me five.

1735
01:13:47.226 --> 01:13:49.157
Did you two plan this
while whispering?

1736
01:13:49.157 --> 01:13:50.697
No, no. Yes.

1737
01:13:51.096 --> 01:13:53.127
Uncle Dong Wook
went on a trip...

1738
01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:57.167
to Paris.
And his pictures are...

1739
01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:58.707
such a hit.

1740
01:13:59.507 --> 01:14:03.407
He won the hearts of
Parisians too.

1741
01:14:05.646 --> 01:14:08.417
I think we should
learn poses from him.

1742
01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:12.486
Right?
Ask him to teach you.

1743
01:14:12.947 --> 01:14:15.186
- Pose.
- How should you pose?

1744
01:14:15.186 --> 01:14:17.157
- Like this.
- Good.

1745
01:14:17.157 --> 01:14:19.186
Great. I like
the look in your eyes.

1746
01:14:19.986 --> 01:14:22.556
That's good.
That's the right look.

1747
01:14:23.056 --> 01:14:26.327
Yes. That's it.
Keep going.

1748
01:14:27.867 --> 01:14:29.096
What is that?

1749
01:14:30.037 --> 01:14:31.337
Why are you so mad?

1750
01:14:31.766 --> 01:14:33.066
Look to the front.

1751
01:14:33.266 --> 01:14:35.636
Imagine a red carpet
in front of you.

1752
01:14:35.936 --> 01:14:37.976
There are many cameras...

1753
01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:40.276
and a lot of people.

1754
01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.646
You can smile, right?

1755
01:14:43.077 --> 01:14:44.247
Smile.

1756
01:14:44.717 --> 01:14:46.846
Great. Smile like that...

1757
01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:49.056
then put up
your right hand.

1758
01:14:49.056 --> 01:14:50.917
Then you wave like this.

1759
01:14:51.287 --> 01:14:52.526
You have to wave.

1760
01:14:53.127 --> 01:14:56.056
The important part is,
you have to turn.

1761
01:14:56.056 --> 01:14:58.467
Look this way too.
This way.

1762
01:14:58.766 --> 01:15:02.997
Look to the front.
Look this way. Great.

1763
01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:05.736
Yes.
You have to keep smiling.

1764
01:15:05.736 --> 01:15:07.636
Keep that smile on.

1765
01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:15.146
(Hello everyone,
what a great day.)

1766
01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:18.547
Si An, don't you have
to go pee?

1767
01:15:19.917 --> 01:15:21.516
- Should we go?
- Yes, go ahead.

1768
01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:23.056
Let's go.
I have to go too.

1769
01:15:24.257 --> 01:15:25.257
Can you get down?

1770
01:15:26.127 --> 01:15:27.856
Jump. Jump!

1771
01:15:27.986 --> 01:15:29.457
Let's take this off first.

1772
01:15:30.127 --> 01:15:31.226
Let's take it off first.

1773
01:15:31.697 --> 01:15:35.096
Do you remember
when I changed you?

1774
01:15:35.167 --> 01:15:37.066
- Yes.
- You remember that?

1775
01:15:37.436 --> 01:15:40.136
Do you remember peeing
right after I changed you?

1776
01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:41.707
Yes.

1777
01:15:43.007 --> 01:15:45.447
See? He peed.

1778
01:15:46.947 --> 01:15:50.877
Inexperienced Dong Wook
and Si An's first meeting.

1779
01:15:52.787 --> 01:15:53.917
All done.

1780
01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.516
(It's his sisters'
pink diaper.)

1781
01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:58.957
(Farting)

1782
01:16:00.627 --> 01:16:02.026
(Farting)

1783
01:16:03.096 --> 01:16:04.426
Si An, are you pooping?

1784
01:16:06.026 --> 01:16:08.297
Si An grew up so much.

1785
01:16:09.467 --> 01:16:13.306
- I don't wear a diaper.
- You don't?

1786
01:16:13.367 --> 01:16:14.877
- No.
- Let's pee.

1787
01:16:14.976 --> 01:16:17.007
Can you pee?

1788
01:16:18.047 --> 01:16:21.047
What do I do?
How do we do this?

1789
01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:25.417
Here, go ahead. Go on.

1790
01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:28.417
(Dong Wook can't
help but laugh.)

1791
01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.016
- Good job.
- Finished.

1792
01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:32.386
Are you done?

1793
01:16:32.526 --> 01:16:34.426
(Giggling)

1794
01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:35.827
Why are you laughing?

1795
01:16:36.596 --> 01:16:37.697
Why are you laughing?

1796
01:16:38.197 --> 01:16:41.167
All done.
Try flushing it yourself.

1797
01:16:41.167 --> 01:16:42.266
Okay.

1798
01:16:43.337 --> 01:16:45.266
Good job. High-five.

1799
01:16:46.467 --> 01:16:48.676
High-five. Good job.

1800
01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:50.577
(They spent
a friendly time.)

1801
01:16:53.747 --> 01:16:55.846
- Do you feel good?
- Yes.

1802
01:16:57.016 --> 01:16:58.217
You don't wear
a diaper anymore.

1803
01:16:58.386 --> 01:17:01.457
I'm an adult now, right?

1804
01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:02.856
Are you an adult?

1805
01:17:03.157 --> 01:17:05.356
Hold me.
I got really heavy.

1806
01:17:05.356 --> 01:17:07.127
Are you heavy?

1807
01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.526
Should you be the one
to say that?

1808
01:17:10.356 --> 01:17:11.667
Yes, you're heavy.

1809
01:17:11.797 --> 01:17:13.566
- I'm proud of you.
- Get up.

1810
01:17:13.566 --> 01:17:14.566
Do you want me
to get up?

1811
01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:17.096
You can pee by yourself.
I'm proud of you.

1812
01:17:17.596 --> 01:17:18.667
You're a big boy now.

1813
01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:20.207
- Dad.
- Give me a kiss.

1814
01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:21.936
(Kissing)

1815
01:17:21.936 --> 01:17:23.436
Thank you.

1816
01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:27.846
We're holding a bazaar
for our fourth year.

1817
01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:31.217
I prepared for that
in advance.

1818
01:17:31.217 --> 01:17:33.917
- He'll give us something.
- Yes.

1819
01:17:35.787 --> 01:17:38.957
These are the clothes
I've worn before.

1820
01:17:38.957 --> 01:17:40.356
(Jackets and coats
he wore)

1821
01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:43.127
I prepared jackets.

1822
01:17:43.127 --> 01:17:47.226
Since it's winter,
this is a coat.

1823
01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:50.967
- It's from the drama.
- It changes.

1824
01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:53.167
Yes, it changes like this.

1825
01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:56.407
- That's so cool.
- It's the soundtrack CD.

1826
01:17:56.976 --> 01:17:59.007
The other actors are busy,
so it's just my autograph.

1827
01:18:00.077 --> 01:18:02.547
- How do I look?
- It's great.

1828
01:18:03.047 --> 01:18:04.217
(Dong Gook is
being greedy.)

1829
01:18:04.217 --> 01:18:06.087
Dad looks cool.

1830
01:18:06.447 --> 01:18:08.486
It looks good on him.
He should buy it.

1831
01:18:08.486 --> 01:18:11.117
How do you do it again?
Look once.

1832
01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:13.257
- Look once. This way?
- Look once,

1833
01:18:13.257 --> 01:18:15.056
- then bend your knees.
- My knees?

1834
01:18:15.327 --> 01:18:16.827
- Bend your knees.
- My knees?

1835
01:18:17.497 --> 01:18:18.827
Why do my knees
have a gap?

1836
01:18:19.497 --> 01:18:23.367
Whoever buys these
will be very happy.

1837
01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:25.566
- Thank you, Dong Wook.
- It's nothing.

1838
01:18:25.806 --> 01:18:27.007
Give me a kiss.

1839
01:18:27.007 --> 01:18:28.776
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

1840
01:18:28.776 --> 01:18:30.877
- Thank you, thank you.
- Si An, you too.

1841
01:18:31.077 --> 01:18:33.077
- Thank you.
- Say thank you.

1842
01:18:33.077 --> 01:18:34.346
Thank you.

1843
01:18:36.516 --> 01:18:37.717
(4th anniversary bazaar)

1844
01:18:37.717 --> 01:18:41.587
Our families and friends
donated goods.

1845
01:18:43.257 --> 01:18:44.726
After collecting them
one by one,

1846
01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:48.056
it's finally the day of
the bazaar.

1847
01:18:49.457 --> 01:18:53.997
(It's a clear autumn day.)

1848
01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:58.837
(Lo Hee's family is
here first.)

1849
01:18:59.766 --> 01:19:01.407
People are riding it.

1850
01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.436
Wow, there are people
riding it.

1851
01:19:03.436 --> 01:19:04.436
(Lifts are going across
the skies.)

1852
01:19:04.577 --> 01:19:06.247
It must be a ride.

1853
01:19:06.247 --> 01:19:08.877
- Yes. Do you want to try?
- Yes.

1854
01:19:09.117 --> 01:19:10.547
I'll let you ride it
later.

1855
01:19:11.077 --> 01:19:12.646
I want to ride it now.

1856
01:19:12.646 --> 01:19:15.386
We can't. It's too far.

1857
01:19:15.486 --> 01:19:17.117
Let's ride it later.

1858
01:19:17.287 --> 01:19:19.127
I want to ride it now...

1859
01:19:19.587 --> 01:19:20.657
Do you want to go now?

1860
01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:22.157
Let's go.

1861
01:19:22.697 --> 01:19:25.467
You're going to leave
without seeing flowers?

1862
01:19:26.827 --> 01:19:29.167
I don't want to see.
Let's go.

1863
01:19:29.497 --> 01:19:30.566
Do you want to leave?

1864
01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:32.136
(I'm not going to look.)

1865
01:19:33.407 --> 01:19:34.407
What is that?

1866
01:19:35.106 --> 01:19:36.507
Should we take a picture?

1867
01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:38.377
- No.
- Why not?

1868
01:19:38.947 --> 01:19:40.747
Then will you
take my picture?

1869
01:19:40.806 --> 01:19:42.077
- Yes.
- Okay.

1870
01:19:42.947 --> 01:19:45.346
- Dad, get up.
- Get up?

1871
01:19:46.617 --> 01:19:49.056
(The photographer is
in the photo zone.)

1872
01:19:49.056 --> 01:19:51.087
(Snapping)

1873
01:19:54.226 --> 01:19:56.827
(She doesn't care
about her subject.)

1874
01:19:56.827 --> 01:20:00.096
Lo Hee,
you have to lift it.

1875
01:20:02.467 --> 01:20:05.566
Lo Hee puts her subject
outside of the frame.

1876
01:20:05.766 --> 01:20:07.167
It's fantastic.

1877
01:20:07.507 --> 01:20:09.207
We must be first.

1878
01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:11.407
No one is here.

1879
01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:15.016
- Why isn't anyone here?
- I don't know.

1880
01:20:16.476 --> 01:20:18.146
No one's here...

1881
01:20:18.646 --> 01:20:21.186
Why aren't they here?

1882
01:20:21.486 --> 01:20:24.056
Who do you miss?
Who do you want to see?

1883
01:20:24.257 --> 01:20:26.157
Si An!

1884
01:20:26.556 --> 01:20:28.257
Do you want to see
Si An first?

1885
01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:30.157
(He doesn't care.)

1886
01:20:30.697 --> 01:20:31.766
Si An.

1887
01:20:31.867 --> 01:20:33.697
Say,
"Love will come back."

1888
01:20:34.127 --> 01:20:35.797
"Love will come back."

1889
01:20:36.236 --> 01:20:37.236
Great.

1890
01:20:37.367 --> 01:20:40.236
Seo Jun! Seo Eon!

1891
01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:43.907
You're making a lady
wait too long!

1892
01:20:45.976 --> 01:20:46.976
Who is that?

1893
01:20:48.316 --> 01:20:50.646
(It's William.)

1894
01:20:52.217 --> 01:20:54.217
Give this to Lo Hee.

1895
01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:55.816
Go give it to her.

1896
01:20:56.816 --> 01:20:58.657
- Give it to Lo Hee.
- Hello, William.

1897
01:20:59.457 --> 01:21:01.426
Take it. Take it.

1898
01:21:01.426 --> 01:21:02.426
Thank you.

1899
01:21:02.426 --> 01:21:04.096
(You didn't have to...)

1900
01:21:04.096 --> 01:21:05.896
Say hello, William.

1901
01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:09.636
Where are you going?

1902
01:21:09.636 --> 01:21:10.997
(He's leaving
after handing the flower.)

1903
01:21:10.997 --> 01:21:12.266
Hey, you.

1904
01:21:13.136 --> 01:21:15.736
Hey. How can you leave
after saying hello...

1905
01:21:16.236 --> 01:21:17.806
and just giving her
the present?

1906
01:21:18.676 --> 01:21:20.606
She'll think
you're the mailman.

1907
01:21:22.316 --> 01:21:24.417
My name is Kim Lo Hee.

1908
01:21:24.816 --> 01:21:25.846
Nice to meet you.

1909
01:21:26.547 --> 01:21:27.886
Nice to meet you.

1910
01:21:28.356 --> 01:21:30.617
William, did you hear her?

1911
01:21:31.117 --> 01:21:32.127
What is your name?

1912
01:21:33.386 --> 01:21:34.457
Dad.

1913
01:21:35.297 --> 01:21:37.827
(I hear sounds.)

1914
01:21:37.997 --> 01:21:39.367
(The crow's cries are
ringing.)

1915
01:21:39.367 --> 01:21:41.226
What is that sound?

1916
01:21:42.736 --> 01:21:47.967
(Crowing)

1917
01:21:49.007 --> 01:21:51.476
(William is off again.)

1918
01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:53.877
William, who is that?

1919
01:21:53.877 --> 01:21:56.016
(Who is this?)

1920
01:21:56.247 --> 01:21:57.577
You have to say hello
to Uncle Hwi Jae.

1921
01:21:57.577 --> 01:21:59.587
- Hello.
- They're here.

1922
01:21:59.587 --> 01:22:02.617
- Hello.
- Hello.

1923
01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:04.516
- Are you a zombie?
- Hello, Seo Eon.

1924
01:22:05.426 --> 01:22:07.087
Hi, William.

1925
01:22:07.087 --> 01:22:09.257
- William, say hello.
- It's been a while.

1926
01:22:09.497 --> 01:22:10.556
Hello, William.

1927
01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:12.226
- Hello.
- Lo Hee.

1928
01:22:12.967 --> 01:22:15.537
- High-five.
- Is everything well?

1929
01:22:16.697 --> 01:22:17.766
Are you sick anywhere?

1930
01:22:18.507 --> 01:22:19.507
Okay.

1931
01:22:20.207 --> 01:22:23.337
William, show uncle
how you do it.

1932
01:22:23.337 --> 01:22:24.507
Do what?

1933
01:22:24.507 --> 01:22:27.806
Hulk. Show him Hulk.
Hulk. How do you do it?

1934
01:22:27.806 --> 01:22:29.146
(Ripping)

1935
01:22:31.217 --> 01:22:33.587
(Let's go, power!)

1936
01:22:34.117 --> 01:22:35.117
Is that Hulk?

1937
01:22:36.016 --> 01:22:37.556
Lo Hee,
do you know his name?

1938
01:22:38.226 --> 01:22:40.056
- Who is that?
- Seo Eon.

1939
01:22:40.386 --> 01:22:41.697
(Embarrassed)

1940
01:22:42.726 --> 01:22:43.896
Seung Jae is here.

1941
01:22:44.056 --> 01:22:46.896
Seung Jae! Be careful!

1942
01:22:48.026 --> 01:22:49.167
Seo Jun.

1943
01:22:49.167 --> 01:22:51.096
(I missed you.)

1944
01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:52.106
Hello.

1945
01:22:52.106 --> 01:22:53.936
(I missed you,
Seo Eon.)

1946
01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:56.606
(Come into my arms!)

1947
01:22:58.007 --> 01:22:59.947
(Surprised)

1948
01:23:00.547 --> 01:23:03.176
(You can't watch
without being moved.)

1949
01:23:03.316 --> 01:23:05.386
- Hello.
- Hello.

1950
01:23:05.386 --> 01:23:07.547
(Familiar faces are
gathering.)

1951
01:23:08.157 --> 01:23:10.486
- Hello.
- Seung Jae.

1952
01:23:10.587 --> 01:23:12.686
- Have you been well?
- Who did you wait for?

1953
01:23:14.226 --> 01:23:16.226
I was waiting for Seo Eon.

1954
01:23:16.226 --> 01:23:17.226
Were you waiting for
Seo Eon?

1955
01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:19.797
I was waiting for Seo Jun
to visit my house.

1956
01:23:19.797 --> 01:23:21.697
You were waiting for him
at home?

1957
01:23:21.697 --> 01:23:23.566
I'm going to run and play.

1958
01:23:23.867 --> 01:23:25.136
Okay, go play.

1959
01:23:25.736 --> 01:23:27.136
(Flapping)

1960
01:23:28.606 --> 01:23:30.707
(Let's play together!)

1961
01:23:30.707 --> 01:23:32.106
I'm the first place.

1962
01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:35.676
I'm the first place.
I think you're...

1963
01:23:36.547 --> 01:23:37.717
the second between us.

1964
01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:40.547
Racing game...

1965
01:23:40.787 --> 01:23:43.087
- Let's go.
- Be careful!

1966
01:23:47.287 --> 01:23:49.396
You have to watch out.
Are you okay?

1967
01:23:50.127 --> 01:23:51.697
Okay?
Are you okay?

1968
01:23:52.566 --> 01:23:54.226
(Seung Jae,
are you all right?)

1969
01:23:54.837 --> 01:23:56.867
Do you see my cut?

1970
01:23:56.867 --> 01:23:59.167
(Look at my injury.)

1971
01:24:00.266 --> 01:24:01.636
You'll get better
in no time.

1972
01:24:02.106 --> 01:24:04.507
I'm going
to put on a bandage.

1973
01:24:04.577 --> 01:24:06.176
You're so brave.

1974
01:24:06.547 --> 01:24:07.676
Thank you.

1975
01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:08.747
(Giggling)

1976
01:24:08.747 --> 01:24:09.877
- Seung Jae...
- Give me your hand.

1977
01:24:09.877 --> 01:24:11.846
got a cut on his hand.

1978
01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:15.617
Why do you get so happy
when you talk to girls?

1979
01:24:16.486 --> 01:24:17.486
There.

1980
01:24:19.787 --> 01:24:23.056
(Seo Jun found something
in the bush.)

1981
01:24:23.657 --> 01:24:24.797
Dad!

1982
01:24:24.797 --> 01:24:25.926
(It's a small apple.)

1983
01:24:25.926 --> 01:24:28.026
Dad, look at this.

1984
01:24:28.436 --> 01:24:30.396
William, do you know
what this is?

1985
01:24:31.297 --> 01:24:32.306
What is it?

1986
01:24:33.106 --> 01:24:36.007
- Apple...
- You like apples.

1987
01:24:36.736 --> 01:24:38.447
(Of course!)

1988
01:24:38.447 --> 01:24:41.106
- He loves it.
- Are you Harry Potter?

1989
01:24:41.106 --> 01:24:42.247
(He's holding a stick.)

1990
01:24:42.476 --> 01:24:45.287
- Show us.
- Are you a wizard?

1991
01:24:46.617 --> 01:24:47.617
William.

1992
01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.157
He's into "Star Wars"
these days.

1993
01:24:53.486 --> 01:24:54.997
- What?
- He likes "Star Wars".

1994
01:24:54.997 --> 01:24:55.997
- Already?
- Yes.

1995
01:24:57.627 --> 01:25:00.566
(Automatic bounces)

1996
01:25:02.566 --> 01:25:05.037
(What's wrong with him?)

1997
01:25:05.766 --> 01:25:08.537
(William Bader is
going around the field.)

1998
01:25:12.106 --> 01:25:15.577
(I'm your baby.)

1999
01:25:16.976 --> 01:25:20.247
- Dad.
- Are we missing someone?

2000
01:25:20.287 --> 01:25:21.287
Who?

2001
01:25:22.587 --> 01:25:23.657
Si An.

2002
01:25:23.657 --> 01:25:25.287
Si An, Seol A, and Soo A?

2003
01:25:26.457 --> 01:25:28.726
At the same time,
the three of them are...

2004
01:25:28.726 --> 01:25:31.056
waiting for
another family.

2005
01:25:31.056 --> 01:25:32.197
(Si An!)

2006
01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:36.497
I'm Si An.

2007
01:25:38.306 --> 01:25:41.306
Who is this man
in a peculiar outfit?

2008
01:25:41.676 --> 01:25:44.436
(It's none other
than Choo Sung Hoon.)

2009
01:25:45.077 --> 01:25:48.447
It's Sung Hoon
and Sa Rang.

2010
01:25:48.447 --> 01:25:50.077
(Sa Rang is
a young lady now.)

2011
01:25:50.077 --> 01:25:52.087
He's full of charisma
as always.

2012
01:25:52.087 --> 01:25:54.287
(They're back.)

2013
01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.516
- Hello.
- Hello.

2014
01:25:57.516 --> 01:25:58.587
Hello, Si An.

2015
01:25:58.957 --> 01:26:01.257
- Gosh. Hello.
- Hello.

2016
01:26:01.257 --> 01:26:04.827
Hello. Have you been well?

2017
01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:05.827
(It's been a year
since they last met.)

2018
01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.127
Sa Rang,
do you remember them?

2019
01:26:07.867 --> 01:26:09.337
Do you? Who are they?

2020
01:26:09.566 --> 01:26:11.337
- Si An.
- You remember them.

2021
01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:13.367
Do you remember us,
Si An?

2022
01:26:13.367 --> 01:26:15.537
- I'm Si An.
- What?

2023
01:26:16.136 --> 01:26:17.907
- He's Si An.
- Si An?

2024
01:26:18.577 --> 01:26:20.377
Is he Si An?

2025
01:26:21.447 --> 01:26:22.617
Where's your dad?

2026
01:26:22.846 --> 01:26:24.577
- Dad...
- He went for soccer.

2027
01:26:24.577 --> 01:26:26.486
Did he go for soccer?
When is he coming?

2028
01:26:26.486 --> 01:26:27.646
Just my dad.

2029
01:26:28.117 --> 01:26:30.217
Let's hold hands, Sa Rang.

2030
01:26:33.686 --> 01:26:36.896
(I want
to hold her hand too.)

2031
01:26:37.396 --> 01:26:38.896
Okay, let's go.

2032
01:26:38.896 --> 01:26:39.926
(Scratching)

2033
01:26:40.297 --> 01:26:41.367
Here.

2034
01:26:41.367 --> 01:26:43.066
(The girls are
walking side by side.)

2035
01:26:43.467 --> 01:26:46.207
- I'm tired.
- Already?

2036
01:26:46.207 --> 01:26:48.337
Do you want me
to hold you?

2037
01:26:48.407 --> 01:26:49.407
Walk a little bit.

2038
01:26:50.476 --> 01:26:51.476
Should I hold you?

2039
01:26:52.846 --> 01:26:53.846
Here.

2040
01:26:53.846 --> 01:26:57.117
Is he going
to carry Si An like that?

2041
01:26:57.117 --> 01:26:59.486
A fighter is
sure different.

2042
01:27:00.717 --> 01:27:02.486
(Si An is so lucky.)

2043
01:27:03.757 --> 01:27:06.257
(Si An is light
like a clutch.)

2044
01:27:10.327 --> 01:27:12.967
(There is a man
holding Si An.)

2045
01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:15.266
- What is it?
- Who is that?

2046
01:27:15.266 --> 01:27:16.396
- Go say hello.
- Who is it?

2047
01:27:16.867 --> 01:27:18.236
- Who is that?
- What's going on?

2048
01:27:18.837 --> 01:27:22.907
(The twins, Si An,
and Sa Rang are here.)

2049
01:27:23.736 --> 01:27:25.877
What is this? Sa Rang!

2050
01:27:25.877 --> 01:27:27.407
(They're confused
at Sa Rang's appearance.)

2051
01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:30.047
Yano Shiho is here.

2052
01:27:30.717 --> 01:27:31.787
Hello, Yano Shiho.

2053
01:27:32.486 --> 01:27:33.516
Yano Shiho.

2054
01:27:34.146 --> 01:27:35.587
Nice to meet you.

2055
01:27:36.157 --> 01:27:38.757
- Sa Rang!
- It's Si An.

2056
01:27:39.486 --> 01:27:41.127
Show me Si An.

2057
01:27:41.127 --> 01:27:42.657
Let's go see him. Come on.

2058
01:27:42.997 --> 01:27:43.997
Let's go see Si An.

2059
01:27:44.297 --> 01:27:46.566
(Lo Hee, I'm here!)

2060
01:27:47.697 --> 01:27:48.697
Yano Shiho.

2061
01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:50.766
(Who are
all these people?)

2062
01:27:52.337 --> 01:27:53.636
- Hello.
- Yano Shiho!

2063
01:27:53.636 --> 01:27:55.776
- Sa Rang!
- Yano Shiho!

2064
01:27:55.776 --> 01:27:57.106
Yano Shiho!

2065
01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.447
(They're having fun.)

2066
01:27:59.447 --> 01:28:00.447
Mom!

2067
01:28:00.547 --> 01:28:02.547
You look
just like your mom.

2068
01:28:02.547 --> 01:28:03.846
Yano Shiho.

2069
01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:07.047
(It's been long
since they last met.)

2070
01:28:07.047 --> 01:28:08.287
Is it your first time
meeting him?

2071
01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:09.856
- Yes.
- Have you been well?

2072
01:28:09.856 --> 01:28:10.957
That's Ko Ji Yong.

2073
01:28:10.957 --> 01:28:12.356
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2074
01:28:12.827 --> 01:28:14.556
- Have you met?
- Yes.

2075
01:28:14.556 --> 01:28:15.926
- You did, right?
- Yes.

2076
01:28:15.926 --> 01:28:17.297
- What about Sam?
- It's our first time.

2077
01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:18.596
Is it your first time?

2078
01:28:18.596 --> 01:28:19.627
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

2079
01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:20.766
He's an original member.

2080
01:28:22.136 --> 01:28:23.837
- Hello.
- Good.

2081
01:28:23.837 --> 01:28:25.537
- I'm Seung Jae.
- Okay.

2082
01:28:25.736 --> 01:28:27.037
Nice to meet you.

2083
01:28:27.066 --> 01:28:28.377
- Lo Hee, let's go.
- Hello.

2084
01:28:28.377 --> 01:28:29.837
- Say hello.
- Hello.

2085
01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:30.877
Hello.

2086
01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:33.106
- Okay, let's sit.
- Sit down.

2087
01:28:33.106 --> 01:28:34.346
Let's all sit down.

2088
01:28:34.846 --> 01:28:36.577
Seol A, Soo A, you too.

2089
01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:38.016
Si An, sit down.

2090
01:28:38.816 --> 01:28:39.986
Isn't he cute?

2091
01:28:40.186 --> 01:28:41.917
- Shake hands.
- Shake on it.

2092
01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:43.356
Isn't he cute?

2093
01:28:43.587 --> 01:28:46.526
- Sit down. Seol A, Soo A.
- Sit here.

2094
01:28:47.026 --> 01:28:49.056
Who knows
what day it is today?

2095
01:28:49.056 --> 01:28:50.056
Me!

2096
01:28:51.056 --> 01:28:52.596
- Seo Eon.
- Sunday.

2097
01:28:52.766 --> 01:28:53.997
Sunday? Sit down.

2098
01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:56.297
Sit down.

2099
01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:57.997
(It's not wrong...)

2100
01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:01.577
(It's funny the more
he thinks about it.)

2101
01:29:02.236 --> 01:29:04.136
- Here!
- What day is it?

2102
01:29:04.136 --> 01:29:06.676
- Yes, Sa Rang.
- Fourth anniversary.

2103
01:29:06.676 --> 01:29:07.747
Fourth anniversary.

2104
01:29:08.217 --> 01:29:10.247
Today, we're celebrating
the fourth anniversary.

2105
01:29:10.247 --> 01:29:12.417
- Let's clap.
- Clap.

2106
01:29:12.417 --> 01:29:13.816
(Congratulations
on the fourth year.)

2107
01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:17.016
- William, clap.
- The fourth birthday.

2108
01:29:17.016 --> 01:29:18.886
- Clap.
- Clap.

2109
01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.886
(Congratulations)

2110
01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:24.026
Next week,
our bazaar will open.

2111
01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:26.467
(Super market will open!)

2112
01:29:27.766 --> 01:29:30.096
The clothes show
how much the kids grew.

2113
01:29:30.367 --> 01:29:33.236
There are precious toys
for sale too.

2114
01:29:34.566 --> 01:29:37.736
(This is the same one
at my house.)

2115
01:29:38.146 --> 01:29:41.007
(Si An is here.)

2116
01:29:41.007 --> 01:29:43.776
(The kids are excited
to see their toys.)

2117
01:29:44.117 --> 01:29:45.486
Let's sell a lot today.

2118
01:29:45.787 --> 01:29:47.846
(The market is open!)

2119
01:29:48.787 --> 01:29:51.287
(Their first customer is
here.)

2120
01:29:52.426 --> 01:29:55.396
(I'm trying to sell
something. Come here.)

2121
01:29:56.056 --> 01:29:58.566
(Is it possible
to try this on?)

2122
01:29:58.566 --> 01:30:00.766
(Surprised)

2123
01:30:00.766 --> 01:30:02.236
(No...)

2124
01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:05.407
Who is
this suspicious customer?

2125
01:30:06.136 --> 01:30:07.967
(This is 50 cents.)

2126
01:30:07.967 --> 01:30:09.707
- That's 50 cents?
- Yes.

2127
01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:12.077
(I think that's
too expensive.)

2128
01:30:12.207 --> 01:30:14.476
(Selling products is
hard work.)

2129
01:30:14.606 --> 01:30:17.117
(This time,
It's a foreign person.)

2130
01:30:18.816 --> 01:30:20.016
It only gets worse.

2131
01:30:20.087 --> 01:30:21.386
Now they have a customer
who is a foreigner.

2132
01:30:22.457 --> 01:30:25.257
(I can only say one thing
in English.)

2133
01:30:26.157 --> 01:30:28.526
(However, they must
continue to sell.)

2134
01:30:28.526 --> 01:30:30.157
(Up, up!)

2135
01:30:30.596 --> 01:30:32.127
Will they finish
the bazaar...

2136
01:30:32.197 --> 01:30:33.697
without a problem?
