(Episode 38)

2
00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:57.302
Let's suture the blood vessels and finish up.

3
00:00:58.103 --> 00:00:59.902
This is an amazing person...

4
00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:04.243
who gladly donated a part of her body to save a life.

5
00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:07.952
Please do your best with me so she can have...

6
00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:10.652
a normal life again without any aftereffects.

7
00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:17.152
5-0 Prolene, please.

8
00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:19.523
(Prolene: a medical suture often used for skin closure)

9
00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:12.212
- Nurse Kim, I need to make a call. - Okay.

10
00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:19.323
How did it go?

11
00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:21.522
You just arrived?

12
00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:23.593
Send it up as fast as you can.

13
00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:28.163
What's going on? Do you think there's a problem?

14
00:03:06.932 --> 00:03:08.202
You should sit down.

15
00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.612
Take it to Doctor Song now. She's waiting.

16
00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:24.883
What's going on? Did something happen?

17
00:03:25.253 --> 00:03:27.892
Things happen all the time in the operating room.

18
00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:31.693
But Doctor Song surely can handle it.

19
00:03:49.873 --> 00:03:51.482
The blood vessels have different shapes.

20
00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:54.082
It happens a lot in transplant surgeries,

21
00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:57.253
so I asked Seoul Daehan Hospital for frozen blood vessels beforehand,

22
00:03:57.552 --> 00:03:59.153
and they just arrived.

23
00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:02.353
Now, I need to do an angioplasty first.

24
00:04:02.823 --> 00:04:04.593
I guess it will take some time.

25
00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:06.022
Yes.

26
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:09.862
Luckily,

27
00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:13.563
the patient's lungs and heart look quite good.

28
00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:16.703
She's so reliable.

29
00:05:18.732 --> 00:05:21.473
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

30
00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:41.593
Gosh, here you go.

31
00:05:43.692 --> 00:05:44.922
You're up.

32
00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:52.502
Why am I here, Mom?

33
00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:54.473
Don't you remember?

34
00:05:55.773 --> 00:05:57.742
You felt dizzy and fainted.

35
00:05:57.742 --> 00:06:01.473
The internal medicine doctor at the hospital ship moved you here.

36
00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:05.982
You had a high fever all night after that.

37
00:06:08.382 --> 00:06:09.513
Are you feeling okay?

38
00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:12.283
Oh, dear.

39
00:06:13.783 --> 00:06:15.393
You're not okay yet.

40
00:06:15.922 --> 00:06:17.793
You're still burning with fever.

41
00:06:18.793 --> 00:06:19.862
How is Han Sol?

42
00:06:22.793 --> 00:06:23.793
I don't know.

43
00:06:24.732 --> 00:06:25.763
Mom.

44
00:06:25.763 --> 00:06:28.973
I was busy taking care of my sick daughter. I don't know about yours.

45
00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.502
I asked you so many times to go to a post-partum care center,

46
00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:35.143
but you refused to go.

47
00:06:35.913 --> 00:06:38.043
What if even you end up...

48
00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:40.413
What do you mean?

49
00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:44.922
How is my baby?

50
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.752
How is she?

51
00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:51.793
It doesn't look good.

52
00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:57.562
I'd never seen the place in such a flurry of action.

53
00:06:57.663 --> 00:07:00.132
Why didn't you wake me up?

54
00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:01.872
What if I did?

55
00:07:03.002 --> 00:07:05.572
What could you have done?

56
00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:10.882
Come back. Have you lost your mind?

57
00:07:10.882 --> 00:07:13.583
In Kyung. In Kyung.

58
00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:14.752
Wait.

59
00:07:14.752 --> 00:07:18.523
Stop. In Kyung. In Kyung.

60
00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:19.653
In Kyung.

61
00:07:19.653 --> 00:07:22.122
Come on, In Kyung.

62
00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:26.263
In Kyung.

63
00:07:50.353 --> 00:07:51.523
What...

64
00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:53.783
is he doing?

65
00:07:54.093 --> 00:07:55.793
It's called kangaroo care.

66
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.763
The baby relaxes...

67
00:07:57.763 --> 00:08:00.593
when they make skin-to-skin contact.

68
00:08:03.293 --> 00:08:06.132
But why...

69
00:08:07.432 --> 00:08:09.632
There was nothing else we could do.

70
00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:11.872
Was my baby...

71
00:08:13.172 --> 00:08:16.513
- that sick? - Yes.

72
00:08:18.413 --> 00:08:19.913
Without me?

73
00:08:22.112 --> 00:08:24.182
But last night,

74
00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:26.822
Han Sol fought very well and bravely...

75
00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:29.523
with Doctor Kwak.

76
00:08:32.722 --> 00:08:34.062
That thing.

77
00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:38.802
Can I do that? I want to do it, doctor.

78
00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:40.832
When your cold goes away.

79
00:08:41.472 --> 00:08:43.373
A cold virus can be deadly...

80
00:08:43.373 --> 00:08:45.842
to a baby with a weak immune system.

81
00:08:48.442 --> 00:08:50.043
What now?

82
00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:54.153
I'm supposed to be the mom.

83
00:08:56.082 --> 00:08:58.682
How can there be nothing...

84
00:08:59.322 --> 00:09:02.592
I can do for my own baby?

85
00:09:05.493 --> 00:09:07.562
You have Doctor Kwak.

86
00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:10.393
He wants to save your baby...

87
00:09:10.393 --> 00:09:12.462
just as much as you do.

88
00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:14.672
He's a really good doctor.

89
00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:23.812
Doctor Kwak said something last night.

90
00:09:24.883 --> 00:09:27.452
If we did everything we can do with science,

91
00:09:28.552 --> 00:09:31.082
it's time to do something a person can do.

92
00:09:33.222 --> 00:09:34.822
With a praying heart.

93
00:09:37.422 --> 00:09:38.722
With a prayer?

94
00:09:39.722 --> 00:09:41.133
What's encouraging is that...

95
00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:43.763
the prayer seemed to work pretty well.

96
00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:47.062
It was stronger than epinephrine.

97
00:09:47.533 --> 00:09:49.233
Do you see those numbers?

98
00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:53.802
The heart rate was down to 60 last night.

99
00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:55.442
It's 90 now.

100
00:09:56.773 --> 00:10:00.413
It's as if an unknown energy is recharging...

101
00:10:01.753 --> 00:10:03.653
Han Sol's heart.

102
00:10:07.322 --> 00:10:08.822
Does that mean...

103
00:10:09.493 --> 00:10:13.592
my grandchild can live?

104
00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:20.832
As long as she keeps getting better.

105
00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:23.903
My goodness.

106
00:10:24.543 --> 00:10:27.543
Oh dear... Finally...

107
00:11:06.483 --> 00:11:09.883
(NICU)

108
00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:23.192
Your baby's fine.

109
00:11:25.832 --> 00:11:29.633
Will you please put on your shoes?

110
00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:32.903
If you walk bare foot...

111
00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:35.113
soon after you give birth,

112
00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:37.243
it'll delay your recovery.

113
00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:41.613
Go on.

114
00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:44.082
Mom.

115
00:11:45.983 --> 00:11:48.352
You think the world of your child.

116
00:11:49.722 --> 00:11:50.922
I also...

117
00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:54.233
think the world of mine.

118
00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.672
Come on.

119
00:12:00.672 --> 00:12:04.403
Wear your shoes, In Kyung.

120
00:12:24.092 --> 00:12:26.592
Doctor, how did it go?

121
00:12:28.192 --> 00:12:29.962
The surgery went well.

122
00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:34.533
Now, it's up to her to recover.

123
00:12:35.533 --> 00:12:36.733
Doctor Song.

124
00:12:38.672 --> 00:12:41.413
You must be Dong Hoon and Dong Min.

125
00:12:41.543 --> 00:12:43.643
You know our names?

126
00:12:43.983 --> 00:12:45.082
Of course.

127
00:12:45.543 --> 00:12:48.812
Your dad shows me your photos and brags every day.

128
00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:51.222
Really?

129
00:12:52.322 --> 00:12:53.783
Do you think she'd lie?

130
00:12:56.322 --> 00:13:00.023
You have to cheer your mom on.

131
00:13:00.663 --> 00:13:04.163
That's the best medicine she can ever have.

132
00:13:05.663 --> 00:13:06.832
Can you do that?

(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

134
00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:27.123
What are you doing? We're at a hospital.

135
00:13:27.322 --> 00:13:29.352
Doctor Kwak, let go.

136
00:13:38.062 --> 00:13:41.033
What did I just see?

137
00:13:41.033 --> 00:13:43.102
You saw Doctors Kwak and Song.

138
00:13:43.102 --> 00:13:46.442
Why was he dragging her out like this?

139
00:13:46.972 --> 00:13:49.043
You're making me feel embarrassed.

140
00:13:50.472 --> 00:13:52.013
Are they dating?

141
00:13:52.283 --> 00:13:53.842
You didn't know?

142
00:13:58.352 --> 00:14:00.893
Doctor Kwak, we should talk.

143
00:14:01.352 --> 00:14:03.153
What happened last night?

144
00:14:03.623 --> 00:14:05.623
What is this about?

145
00:14:17.302 --> 00:14:18.773
It's a good morning.

146
00:14:20.243 --> 00:14:22.842
A really good morning that probably comes...

147
00:14:23.873 --> 00:14:25.413
only once in a lifetime.

148
00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:30.212
Han Sol's getting better.

149
00:14:30.952 --> 00:14:32.653
All through the night,

150
00:14:34.322 --> 00:14:35.993
she lay on my chest,

151
00:14:36.192 --> 00:14:38.192
and her heart pumped hard.

152
00:14:39.523 --> 00:14:41.133
She fought so well.

153
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:43.033
Did she really?

154
00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:45.763
Really.

155
00:14:57.883 --> 00:15:01.452
Then that little baby must know.

156
00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:04.722
That my man...

157
00:15:05.283 --> 00:15:08.352
has the warmest heart in the whole world.

Yes, speaking.

00:16:34.013 --> 00:16:36.113
Why won't either of you say anything?

174
00:16:37.043 --> 00:16:39.613
You operated without the guardian's consent.

175
00:16:39.883 --> 00:16:42.383
No. That is not true.

176
00:16:42.552 --> 00:16:44.052
How dare you lie?

177
00:16:50.692 --> 00:16:51.893
That can't be.

178
00:16:54.192 --> 00:16:56.192
Why are you dropping the charges?

179
00:16:56.363 --> 00:16:58.863
Didn't you say surgeon Song Eun Jae...

180
00:16:58.863 --> 00:17:01.003
operated without your consent?

181
00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:02.533
That was...

182
00:17:02.533 --> 00:17:04.273
(Mother Consented to Surgery)

183
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:07.673
All a big lie that I told.

184
00:17:08.072 --> 00:17:09.513
What? How dare she...

185
00:17:09.943 --> 00:17:12.082
Did you summon an inquiry committee...

186
00:17:12.713 --> 00:17:14.612
before getting your facts straight?

187
00:17:15.352 --> 00:17:16.882
Do you have money to waste?

188
00:17:17.652 --> 00:17:19.082
What a mess.

189
00:17:19.223 --> 00:17:21.193
No, that's not what happened.

190
00:17:22.122 --> 00:17:24.193
Listen. Come back.

191
00:17:33.862 --> 00:17:35.673
Why did you lie?

192
00:17:36.433 --> 00:17:38.072
A lawyer came and said...

193
00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:40.773
he'd give us money.

194
00:17:41.572 --> 00:17:45.183
I asked how I could believe him,

195
00:17:45.543 --> 00:17:49.013
and the lawyer said Doosung sorts things out.

196
00:17:49.013 --> 00:17:51.852
- Did you just say Doosung? - Do you mean Doosung Group?

197
00:17:51.852 --> 00:17:53.283
The Doosung Group we all know?

198
00:18:34.293 --> 00:18:35.293
It's him.

199
00:18:37.132 --> 00:18:39.003
Can you make a comment?

200
00:18:42.703 --> 00:18:45.703
- Do you have anything to say? - One comment.

201
00:18:46.342 --> 00:18:49.473
I'm going to hospital as soon as I get to Seoul.

202
00:18:50.243 --> 00:18:52.082
Deny everything.

203
00:18:53.213 --> 00:18:56.312
Tell the media that Lawyer Jo did everything on his own.

204
00:18:56.713 --> 00:18:57.783
Yes, sir.

205
00:19:00.892 --> 00:19:02.822
It seems that Doosung Group...

206
00:19:02.822 --> 00:19:04.523
wanted to pass a law allowing...

207
00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:06.562
remote medical service to sell their hardware...

208
00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:08.632
and software worth tens of thousands of dollars...

209
00:19:08.632 --> 00:19:11.463
through a newly established network.

210
00:19:11.703 --> 00:19:13.233
Chairman Jang Tae Joon...

211
00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:17.243
fled his Geoje accommodation during the night as if on the run.

212
00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:18.973
It turned out he bribed...

213
00:19:18.973 --> 00:19:21.713
patients, family members, and even many public servants.

214
00:19:21.713 --> 00:19:23.743
This won't do.

215
00:19:24.743 --> 00:19:26.243
Call the hospital ship's captain.

216
00:19:26.683 --> 00:19:29.812
We should get them back to work before people get us all wrong.

217
00:19:30.082 --> 00:19:33.622
Are you sure this is all a misunderstanding?

218
00:19:33.993 --> 00:19:35.993
What? Do you think I'm like you?

219
00:19:37.662 --> 00:19:39.463
Don't blame me.

220
00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:42.033
I just did as you told me to.

221
00:19:42.162 --> 00:19:44.733
So keep on doing as I tell you,

222
00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:46.963
and get the hospital ship's captain.

223
00:19:47.703 --> 00:19:49.033
Captain.

224
00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:53.342
I told you already that I don't see why I should see him.

225
00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:56.443
You waited here all night just so...

226
00:19:56.443 --> 00:19:58.513
you could meet him.

227
00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:02.582
I don't think he'll have time to see me.

228
00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:06.622
He'll have to see them first.

229
00:20:15.662 --> 00:20:16.933
What? Bribery?

230
00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:18.933
I took nothing.

231
00:20:19.562 --> 00:20:24.043
I served the public all my life. I'm an honest man.

232
00:20:30.043 --> 00:20:31.683
Let go of me.

233
00:20:52.102 --> 00:20:53.332
All done.

234
00:21:11.923 --> 00:21:13.152
Are you awake?

235
00:21:23.463 --> 00:21:24.703
The hospital ship.

236
00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:27.733
What happened?

237
00:21:29.632 --> 00:21:31.342
You should come with me.

238
00:21:32.473 --> 00:21:33.602
Where to?

239
00:21:33.743 --> 00:21:35.513
To save our ship.

240
00:21:36.612 --> 00:21:38.382
I can't go anywhere.

241
00:21:40.582 --> 00:21:42.412
I have to stay here.

242
00:21:42.812 --> 00:21:44.183
No, you don't.

243
00:21:44.822 --> 00:21:48.923
You have a huge liver. You should recover in a day.

244
00:21:50.193 --> 00:21:51.263
What?

245
00:21:52.793 --> 00:21:53.822
Oh dear.

246
00:22:02.372 --> 00:22:03.533
I was kidding.

247
00:22:05.043 --> 00:22:06.402
It all worked out.

248
00:22:07.203 --> 00:22:09.673
I just got a call from the office.

249
00:22:10.582 --> 00:22:13.842
They want us back at work tomorrow if possible.

250
00:22:15.052 --> 00:22:16.382
That's great.

251
00:22:17.483 --> 00:22:21.453
What did you do to make that happen?

252
00:22:22.923 --> 00:22:24.892
What did you do...

253
00:22:25.463 --> 00:22:27.332
to save our ship?

254
00:22:29.892 --> 00:22:31.402
Nothing, right?

255
00:22:33.062 --> 00:22:36.473
I was busy looking after my wife.

256
00:22:38.802 --> 00:22:42.142
Our hospital ship will soon be back on the sea.

257
00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:47.142
The others tried really hard.

258
00:22:51.122 --> 00:22:52.753
It looks like...

259
00:22:55.523 --> 00:22:58.923
you can get back together with your wife.

260
00:23:06.062 --> 00:23:11.602
Our ship's staff now all know what to do.

261
00:23:13.443 --> 00:23:15.173
You can stop...

262
00:23:16.142 --> 00:23:18.342
looking after them and the ship,

263
00:23:20.082 --> 00:23:24.152
and look after your sons and wife.

264
00:23:31.523 --> 00:23:32.523
Nurse Pyo.

265
00:23:56.013 --> 00:23:57.783
The hospital ship's here.

266
00:23:58.082 --> 00:23:59.483
It's been so long.

267
00:23:59.783 --> 00:24:01.953
- The hospital ship's here. - Really?

268
00:24:01.953 --> 00:24:04.892
The hospital ship's coming. It's about time, isn't it?

269
00:24:04.892 --> 00:24:07.332
It's been so long.

270
00:24:12.203 --> 00:24:14.503
- Ms. Seo Soon Ae. - Yes.

271
00:24:14.933 --> 00:24:17.743
Mr. Park Soo Bong, you can go in now.

272
00:24:19.703 --> 00:24:21.773
- Did you have lunch? - Yes.

273
00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:24.943
- Ms. Kim Jung Boon. - Yes?

274
00:24:24.943 --> 00:24:27.912
Let's take a chest x-ray. Come with me.

275
00:24:29.852 --> 00:24:35.092
Ma'am, hug this screen tightly as if you're hugging a baby.

276
00:24:35.193 --> 00:24:36.793
When I tell you to,

277
00:24:38.423 --> 00:24:39.793
hold your breath.

278
00:24:40.733 --> 00:24:42.263
Hold your breath.

279
00:24:44.802 --> 00:24:46.233
- Let's go. - Hurry up.

280
00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:52.173
Look at all those people. They're flocking over.

281
00:24:52.473 --> 00:24:54.243
We haven't been here in a while,

282
00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.812
so people from other islands came over.

283
00:24:56.213 --> 00:24:57.342
I see that.

284
00:24:57.513 --> 00:24:59.642
Come in, hospital ship.

285
00:25:00.243 --> 00:25:01.513
It's me.

286
00:25:01.513 --> 00:25:03.783
A climber fell from Mount Daegeum.

287
00:25:04.122 --> 00:25:05.783
- What? - It's an emergency.

288
00:25:05.783 --> 00:25:06.822
Okay.

289
00:25:07.183 --> 00:25:09.193
Give me that. Volume up.

290
00:25:09.552 --> 00:25:15.062
We have an emergency. We have an emergency.

291
00:25:15.062 --> 00:25:16.493
Someone on holiday...

292
00:25:16.493 --> 00:25:18.503
tripped and fell, and she is unconscious.

293
00:25:18.862 --> 00:25:20.033
Yoo Jung.

294
00:25:20.233 --> 00:25:22.233
Wake up, Yoo Jung.

295
00:25:36.513 --> 00:25:39.082
Doctor, are you hurt? Are you okay?

296
00:25:39.082 --> 00:25:40.152
I'm fine.

297
00:25:44.223 --> 00:25:46.423
- Over there. - Open your eyes.

298
00:25:54.802 --> 00:25:57.872
Yoo Jung, wake up. Wake up.

299
00:25:58.543 --> 00:26:00.243
Move over. Let's have a look.

300
00:26:09.382 --> 00:26:11.753
Ma'am, wake up.

301
00:26:11.822 --> 00:26:12.852
Ma'am.

302
00:26:13.622 --> 00:26:15.622
- BP. - 75 over 50.

303
00:26:15.622 --> 00:26:17.763
It's tension pneumothorax. 16 gauge needle.

304
00:26:17.763 --> 00:26:18.822
Okay.

305
00:26:18.822 --> 00:26:21.963
(Pressure building in the chest cavity)

306
00:27:19.552 --> 00:27:22.122
What's wrong with her leg? Why is it swollen?

307
00:27:22.322 --> 00:27:23.923
Is it broken?

308
00:27:25.862 --> 00:27:27.733
Ma'am. Ma'am?

309
00:27:28.862 --> 00:27:30.233
Do you feel this?

310
00:27:34.003 --> 00:27:36.503
What's wrong?

311
00:27:37.203 --> 00:27:38.342
She's paralyzed.

312
00:27:38.842 --> 00:27:40.003
Paralyzed?

313
00:27:40.612 --> 00:27:42.543
Can she move it again?

314
00:27:42.773 --> 00:27:44.312
I think it's temporary.

315
00:27:44.683 --> 00:27:46.783
What's wrong with it?

316
00:27:46.783 --> 00:27:48.382
It's acute compartment syndrome.

317
00:27:48.852 --> 00:27:51.253
She hit her leg hard when she fell.

318
00:27:51.622 --> 00:27:53.052
Blood stopped flowing in the muscles.

319
00:27:55.693 --> 00:27:57.523
We must transfer her to the hospital ship.

320
00:27:58.062 --> 00:27:59.092
Okay.

321
00:28:03.793 --> 00:28:05.802
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

322
00:28:49.642 --> 00:28:51.082
(Hospital Ship)

323
00:28:52.142 --> 00:28:54.253
The cancer that grows in my body...

324
00:28:55.513 --> 00:28:56.753
is virulent.

325
00:28:56.882 --> 00:28:59.523
Did you apply to an emergency hospital in England?

326
00:28:59.652 --> 00:29:00.723
I'm disappointed.

327
00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:02.793
Why didn't you discuss with me before?

328
00:29:03.052 --> 00:29:06.062
Unless I'm healthy and beautiful,

329
00:29:06.162 --> 00:29:07.763
I don't want to be with him.

330
00:29:07.763 --> 00:29:09.832
You pretend to be really strong,

331
00:29:10.033 --> 00:29:11.433
but you cry a lot.

332
00:29:11.703 --> 00:29:13.703
Please leave. Leave now!

333
00:29:13.703 --> 00:29:15.132
Please open the door.
