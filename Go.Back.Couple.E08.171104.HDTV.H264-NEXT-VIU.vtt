3
00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:08.238
Yes, exactly.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:09.369
(The Year 2017)

5
00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:10.908
The president during our freshman year.

6
00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.379
He used to bully us a lot.

7
00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:15.379
Why would he come to see you?

8
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:17.578
Does he want you to sign up for an insurance?

9
00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:19.749
No, I don't think so.

10
00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.888
He always said he wanted to be an architect.

11
00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.019
He must work in that field.

12
00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:28.258
Hey, I'm almost here.

13
00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.559
I'll call you later.

14
00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:45.909
Hey.

15
00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:48.778
Hi.

16
00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:56.689
What did I tell you?

17
00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.259
If someone calls you out of the blue,

18
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.159
it's always about insurance or a pyramid scheme.

19
00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:05.298
I didn't think he'd turn out like that.

20
00:01:05.358 --> 00:01:06.729
Didn't he used to make a huge fuss...

21
00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.099
saying he was going to be an architect?

22
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:10.938
Yes, he was a show off.

23
00:01:10.998 --> 00:01:12.869
Hey, everyone is the same.

24
00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:14.638
We were like that too.

25
00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:16.608
We told everyone we'd become movie directors.

26
00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:18.209
Don't you remember?

27
00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:22.248
Gosh.

28
00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.449
I begged them to let you work as staff.

29
00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:27.089
Don't make any mistakes.

30
00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:28.489
- We won't! - We won't!

31
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:30.158
- I'll do my best. - I'll work hard.

32
00:01:30.888 --> 00:01:32.319
I'll work until I drop dead.

33
00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.128
- Thank you. - Thank you.

34
00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.328
Hello. Here's water.

35
00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.459
Sir. Take a water.

36
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:39.668
Have some cold water.

37
00:01:39.968 --> 00:01:41.328
Put it over there.

38
00:01:41.328 --> 00:01:43.438
Hey, the sun is setting. Put this away!

39
00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:44.899
Yes, sir. I'll do it!

40
00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.309
- Take it over there. - Yes, sir.

41
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.709
There was a time,

42
00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.578
a time when I had nothing to lose since I had nothing.

43
00:01:56.108 --> 00:01:58.649
Twinkling eyes and earnest dreams were...

44
00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.949
the only powerful weapons we had against the world.

45
00:02:03.888 --> 00:02:05.459
- Cheer up, dude. - Gosh.

46
00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:14.598
Gosh.

47
00:02:14.728 --> 00:02:16.899
I wish 100,000 dollars would drop from the sky.

48
00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.899
You can't do anything with 100,000 dollars.

49
00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:22.938
There was a time when I couldn't estimate...

50
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:25.038
how hard the world was.

51
00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:34.218
(Episode 8: Your Weapon Against the World)

52
00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:38.559
How will Park Hyun Seok come to school?

53
00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.559
He tried to toy with a girl and got humiliated big time.

54
00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.299
She was a May Queen candidate, right?

55
00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:44.658
History major, Ma Jin Joo.

56
00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.698
Anyway, Hyun Seok won't leave her alone now.

57
00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.269
He was furious when he left.

58
00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:53.239
- What if he does something? - No way.

59
00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:17.098
Did she go home all right?

60
00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:36.919
Why isn't he picking up?

61
00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.948
What?

62
00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:44.619
Who is she talking to this late at night?

63
00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:58.098
Hello?

64
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.339
Where are you?

65
00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:07.878
You're out of your mind, aren't you?

66
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.818
No. I'm out of my mind.

67
00:04:13.848 --> 00:04:15.119
What are you doing?

68
00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.018
Get away before I scream.

69
00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:19.489
Scream all you want.

70
00:04:21.688 --> 00:04:23.099
I said scream!

71
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.398
You ruined everything.

72
00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:33.409
Do you know how hard it was to date...

73
00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.109
that ugly Kim Ye Rim?

74
00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:36.609
I don't know that,

75
00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:40.049
but I know that you're pathetic.

76
00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:43.878
I told you...

77
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:47.289
I hit women.

78
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:49.448
I'll beat you up...

79
00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:50.989
and go to jail.

80
00:04:51.388 --> 00:04:52.659
I'll go to jail.

81
00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.838
No need to go to jail.

82
00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:07.039
I'll just send you to the underworld.

83
00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.349
What?

84
00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:17.818
Where did she go?

85
00:05:24.518 --> 00:05:25.619
My goodness.

86
00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:35.898
Hi.

87
00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:42.068
Did you really run away?

88
00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:44.609
You're crazy.

89
00:05:48.878 --> 00:05:49.919
Gosh.

90
00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:55.989
Why weren't you answering your phone?

91
00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.489
Who are you?

92
00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:01.559
How dare you...

93
00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.299
If you want to die, keep coming at me.

94
00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.438
Stop.

95
00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:17.638
Stop it now.

96
00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:20.508
That's enough. He's somebody's precious son.

97
00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:22.279
What's the use of hitting him?

98
00:06:22.609 --> 00:06:25.219
Why are you doing this to me?

99
00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.888
It's because we pity you.

100
00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:28.349
It's because you're pitiful.

101
00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.518
You're acting and lying because of a girl...

102
00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:31.989
you don't even like.

103
00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.289
You're wasting your life, and it's pitiful.

104
00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.059
You should be thankful that he came.

105
00:06:39.328 --> 00:06:40.998
Otherwise I would've killed you.

106
00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.669
Where did you learn to be mean like that?

107
00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:47.669
Let's go.

108
00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:53.448
And...

109
00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:55.008
you shouldn't live like that.

110
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.078
Don't bully powerless salesman.

111
00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.279
What?

112
00:07:03.018 --> 00:07:04.659
I'm afraid my kid might end up like that.

113
00:07:08.188 --> 00:07:09.929
What are you doing? Let's go.

114
00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.299
What?

115
00:07:13.828 --> 00:07:14.929
Okay.

116
00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:29.109
Gosh, that was so scary.

117
00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.878
How can he be so terrifying?

118
00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:35.388
Without you I would've been in big trouble.

119
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.359
What?

120
00:07:38.388 --> 00:07:39.758
You acted all tough.

121
00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:43.929
You have to show them you aren't weak,

122
00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:45.029
so they wouldn't come at you again.

123
00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:51.669
Anyway, thank you.

124
00:07:55.568 --> 00:07:56.979
But why are you here?

125
00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:58.378
This is my neighborhood.

126
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:03.049
I'm taking a walk.

127
00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:04.349
Because the air's fresh.

128
00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:06.489
Taking a walk? In this neighborhood?

129
00:08:06.648 --> 00:08:07.688
All the way here?

130
00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:09.888
Yes. This neighborhood is perfect for taking a walk.

131
00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:11.888
Why?

132
00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:17.859
Well...

133
00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:20.128
Just to be sure, I want to ask you.

134
00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.268
Do you like me for real?

135
00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:27.039
I think I heard that question before.

136
00:08:27.938 --> 00:08:29.039
I told you.

137
00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:31.179
I think I like you.

138
00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.049
Since when?

139
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.318
You said you didn't like me when you asked me out.

140
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:40.218
I didn't like you then.

141
00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.118
It was after that.

142
00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.559
That's after I came here.

143
00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:48.828
So you like older women.

144
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:52.999
Men in their 20's like women who are older than them.

145
00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:54.828
I said I like you.

146
00:08:55.728 --> 00:08:57.068
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:57.999 --> 00:08:59.068
You don't have to know.

148
00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:02.238
By the way,

149
00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.708
you're probably better off not liking me.

150
00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:06.608
Why is that?

151
00:09:07.409 --> 00:09:11.218
Of course I look young and pretty now,

152
00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:15.188
but there might be a mom inside me.

153
00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:16.588
What are you saying?

154
00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:23.999
Are you...

155
00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:28.029
possessed?

156
00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:30.039
By a mom ghost?

157
00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.499
Come on.

158
00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:36.838
Instead of...

159
00:09:37.909 --> 00:09:39.309
liking me,

160
00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.179
how about achieving your dream?

161
00:09:43.078 --> 00:09:45.879
The best history tutor in Korea.

162
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.919
How do you know my dream?

163
00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:50.889
What?

164
00:09:55.188 --> 00:09:56.228
Physiognomy.

165
00:09:57.228 --> 00:09:59.029
You look like a star tutor.

166
00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:02.777
You look like you can earn about 60 million dollars.

167
00:10:03.453 --> 00:10:05.084
Don't pretend not to know me.

168
00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:06.868
Okay?

169
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:08.108
What are you saying?

170
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.809
You should go home.

171
00:10:10.078 --> 00:10:11.838
Thanks. I'll get going. Bye.

172
00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:13.448
- What are you saying? - I'm going.

173
00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:15.379
How did you know?

174
00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:16.818
Hey. Hey.

175
00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.549
How did she know?

176
00:10:32.228 --> 00:10:33.728
Even if you're young,

177
00:10:33.728 --> 00:10:35.499
you're hopeless.

178
00:10:35.499 --> 00:10:36.568
Why?

179
00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:38.238
You told me to run away from home...

180
00:10:38.238 --> 00:10:40.309
as if I'm gone with the wind.

181
00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:41.409
I...

182
00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:46.179
You shouldn't take a joke that seriously.

183
00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:48.208
It was a joke. A gag.

184
00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:52.379
This is why I can't even drink cold water in front of kids.

185
00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:03.499
Hey, you should get it. They'd be worried.

186
00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:04.999
They don't worry about me at home.

187
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.598
They'll just shout at me.

188
00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:12.368
You should talk to them.

189
00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:13.909
Tell them that you're all grown up.

190
00:11:13.909 --> 00:11:16.539
That you want to decide whether or not you want to enter a contest.

191
00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:17.938
Okay?

192
00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:20.208
If it had worked,

193
00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:21.649
do you think I'd have run away?

194
00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:23.718
But you can't just run away from home like this without a plan.

195
00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:25.649
Where are you going to go today?

196
00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:29.218
Do you think I'd have nowhere to go?

197
00:11:29.218 --> 00:11:31.389
Gosh.

198
00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.728
Gosh.

199
00:11:37.499 --> 00:11:38.858
(Motel)

200
00:11:40.169 --> 00:11:42.468
(Motel You and I)

201
00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.499
I don't want to!

202
00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.468
How can you even think of...

203
00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:48.139
overnight with a man?

204
00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:49.909
You don't know how scary the world is.

205
00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:52.909
If I don't do this,

206
00:11:52.909 --> 00:11:55.448
I have to live like my parent's doll for the rest of my life.

207
00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.348
There's no doll that is disobedient like you.

208
00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:00.049
- What? - This is not how you do it.

209
00:12:00.348 --> 00:12:02.149
You should get a permission to run away from home.

210
00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:04.019
How would you get a permission to run away from home?

211
00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:05.159
I don't want to.

212
00:12:05.218 --> 00:12:07.059
Gosh. Hey.

213
00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:10.698
I didn't know this, but you're so stubborn.

214
00:12:10.698 --> 00:12:11.759
Hey!

215
00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.899
There are no parents that don't worry about their children.

216
00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:14.899
Min Seo Young!

217
00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:23.879
Hey, you!

218
00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:26.078
Dad.

219
00:12:34.448 --> 00:12:35.448
I...

220
00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:36.858
Nice to meet...

221
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:43.629
you.

222
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:50.769
Did you eat?

223
00:12:52.968 --> 00:12:55.409
We just had dinner.

224
00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:56.639
It wasn't much, but...

225
00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:05.019
Follow me.

226
00:13:07.188 --> 00:13:08.848
I don't want to. I don't want to go home.

227
00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.919
Gosh.

228
00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:17.328
There are times that I want to go on stage,

229
00:13:18.358 --> 00:13:20.468
but sometimes, I don't even want to look at it.

230
00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:22.899
Why don't you even ask me how I feel?

231
00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:33.078
All right. Let's go.

232
00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:35.909
Let's go inside and talk.

233
00:14:23.929 --> 00:14:27.269
Gosh, they're still a problem when they're that old.

234
00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:31.169
How old is he?

235
00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:33.708
He doesn't look much older than me.

236
00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:45.519
My goodness.

237
00:14:52.118 --> 00:14:54.259
Boyfriend?

238
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:55.688
You?

239
00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:00.169
Who said you can?

240
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:02.328
Stop it.

241
00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.769
What are you doing?

242
00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:05.269
He's getting scared.

243
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:06.738
I'm all right.

244
00:15:06.738 --> 00:15:07.838
You're...

245
00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:10.438
getting angry at us?

246
00:15:10.438 --> 00:15:12.779
- Just because of a man? - Gosh.

247
00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.448
It's no use...

248
00:15:14.448 --> 00:15:15.948
raising a sister so preciously.

249
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:25.358
What are you doing?

250
00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:26.759
You can have some.

251
00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:27.929
What?

252
00:15:28.688 --> 00:15:30.159
You can have it.

253
00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.698
Thank... Thank you.

254
00:15:35.228 --> 00:15:37.098
Why did you all come here?

255
00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:38.539
Well...

256
00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:41.139
we couldn't reach you.

257
00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:43.009
We told you that we're going on a family trip, but you didn't answer.

258
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:44.379
You could live at home.

259
00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:45.608
Why did you go to the dormitory?

260
00:15:45.909 --> 00:15:47.448
Don't you really know the reason why?

261
00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:58.559
Bo Reum, don't forget to eat.

262
00:15:59.218 --> 00:16:00.228
- Jae Woo. - Yes?

263
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:02.129
See you again.

264
00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.399
You're not going to see him again.

265
00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:05.259
Don't contact him.

266
00:16:06.468 --> 00:16:07.468
- All right. - Go.

267
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.639
- Go. - We're going.

268
00:16:10.999 --> 00:16:12.068
Bye.

269
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:14.068
Goodbye.

270
00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:19.848
You have four brothers.

271
00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:23.118
That's a lot.

272
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:31.889
What?

273
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:33.958
Press zero.

274
00:16:37.358 --> 00:16:39.458
(Crybaby Jae Woo)

275
00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:42.169
Numbers don't start from one.

276
00:16:42.529 --> 00:16:43.669
It starts with zero.

277
00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:45.198
You're my number zero.

278
00:16:45.368 --> 00:16:46.868
I like you so much...

279
00:16:46.868 --> 00:16:48.539
that you're not even in the rank.

280
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.238
Number zero.

281
00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:53.409
Number zero.

282
00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:56.009
That's a good thing, right?

283
00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:02.448
But why?

284
00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:04.989
Is it because I'm too easy?

285
00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:07.658
Yes, it's because you're easy.

286
00:17:09.259 --> 00:17:12.529
I'm not... I'm not an easy man like that.

287
00:17:12.529 --> 00:17:14.168
I like people who are easy.

288
00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:15.769
Your face shows your emotions...

289
00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:17.469
when you're annoyed, angry or happy.

290
00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:20.368
I can imagine what you'll be doing 24 hours a day.

291
00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:21.939
I like people like that.

292
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:23.209
Someone like you.

293
00:17:29.509 --> 00:17:32.118
Is that so? Gosh.

294
00:17:32.378 --> 00:17:34.118
It's not because it's easy...

295
00:17:34.118 --> 00:17:36.259
to touch me or to kiss me, right?

296
00:17:36.418 --> 00:17:39.189
It's hard for me to kiss you.

297
00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.959
It's only because we do it so often.

298
00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:42.759
I think about 10 times before I do it.

299
00:17:43.098 --> 00:17:44.259
10... 10 times?

300
00:17:58.739 --> 00:18:00.009
How dare you?

301
00:18:05.648 --> 00:18:06.648
I'm sorry.

302
00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.358
I only thought about it five times.

303
00:18:17.928 --> 00:18:19.029
I thought about it...

304
00:18:20.128 --> 00:18:21.128
10 times for you.

305
00:18:33.949 --> 00:18:35.049
Aren't you going to school?

306
00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:51.699
Mom, what's wrong?

307
00:18:52.459 --> 00:18:53.598
She's...

308
00:18:53.928 --> 00:18:55.568
a little strange nowadays.

309
00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:57.269
She was always strange.

310
00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:58.739
You're her sister.

311
00:18:58.739 --> 00:19:00.608
You should pay more attention to her.

312
00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:06.979
What's wrong with you?

313
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.178
Is something bothering you?

314
00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:09.348
What?

315
00:19:10.878 --> 00:19:12.549
Well, that is...

316
00:19:14.318 --> 00:19:15.318
It's nothing.

317
00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:17.289
What is it?

318
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.529
What do you think about...

319
00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:23.199
Jin Joo getting married to someone from a rich family?

320
00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:27.098
For instance, someone whose father owns a university.

321
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:32.239
I should earn more money.

322
00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:33.739
Her mother-in-law will bully her...

323
00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:36.809
about how she doesn't have enough money.

324
00:19:37.108 --> 00:19:40.449
You're thinking about something unnecessary again.

325
00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.318
And do you think only mother-in-laws from rich families will bully her?

326
00:19:43.318 --> 00:19:45.918
Father-in-laws from poor families are worse.

327
00:19:58.999 --> 00:20:02.199
Why do you turn the water on so high?

328
00:20:02.398 --> 00:20:05.368
If you do that, you'll end up splashing more water than you use.

329
00:20:05.368 --> 00:20:07.709
This is all our money.

330
00:20:07.709 --> 00:20:11.039
You're throwing our money into the drain.

331
00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:12.838
You need to conserve water.

332
00:20:12.838 --> 00:20:15.648
That's how we can make a living.

333
00:20:15.648 --> 00:20:16.818
My goodness.

334
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.618
How can we make a living by me conserving water?

335
00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:21.989
You old, cheapskate!

336
00:20:22.618 --> 00:20:24.559
What? Cheap...

337
00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:26.759
- Cheapskate? - Yes, you cheapskate!

338
00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:29.029
Cheap... My goodness.

339
00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:30.828
My neck is getting stiff.

340
00:20:32.328 --> 00:20:33.428
Mom.

341
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:35.598
That was too much.

342
00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:36.699
Don't call him a cheapskate.

343
00:20:36.699 --> 00:20:37.799
Right?

344
00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.709
Don't you think that was a bit too harsh?

345
00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:42.039
How can you call the head of the household...

346
00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:43.908
who makes a living for us a cheapskate?

347
00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:48.249
How dare you call the head of the household a cheapskate?

348
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:50.878
It's not like he doesn't want to make much money.

349
00:20:51.078 --> 00:20:52.989
He doesn't want to be cheap either.

350
00:20:53.249 --> 00:20:55.289
Yes, what?

351
00:20:55.289 --> 00:20:58.059
I know he only makes enough to buy a stick of gum,

352
00:20:58.318 --> 00:21:00.059
you can't say that to him.

353
00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:02.628
Do you know how hard he tries to make that little?

354
00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:03.898
Right?

355
00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:05.259
Don't be like that, Mom.

356
00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:07.098
It breaks my heart. Bye.

357
00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:08.328
Goodness.

358
00:21:09.328 --> 00:21:10.398
You idiot.

359
00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:12.638
What? I only make enough to buy a stick of gum?

360
00:21:12.868 --> 00:21:15.769
You must be happy that your dad only makes that little, you idiot.

361
00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:18.939
Why don't you try going out and make that much, then?

362
00:21:19.078 --> 00:21:21.449
Dad, I was trying to help.

363
00:21:21.449 --> 00:21:22.918
- How dare you? - What's with you?

364
00:21:22.918 --> 00:21:24.618
Stop right there. You!

365
00:21:26.449 --> 00:21:27.588
Be honest.

366
00:21:27.949 --> 00:21:30.618
I can tell something has been going on with you.

367
00:21:30.818 --> 00:21:31.989
What?

368
00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:33.588
Nothing's going on.

369
00:21:33.628 --> 00:21:34.989
Stop lying.

370
00:21:35.358 --> 00:21:36.559
You can fool a ghost, but not me.

371
00:21:39.459 --> 00:21:40.729
Who's Seo Jin?

372
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.338
How did you know...

373
00:21:46.509 --> 00:21:48.469
Who is this Seo Jin...

374
00:21:48.469 --> 00:21:50.479
that makes you cry every single night?

375
00:21:55.309 --> 00:21:56.549
Seo Jin...

376
00:22:00.088 --> 00:22:01.118
Seo Jin...

377
00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:03.759
Seo Jin...

378
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:12.098
I figured a guy you like dumped you, so I was going to let it go.

379
00:22:12.459 --> 00:22:13.769
But it's been days now.

380
00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:16.338
Who is this Seo Jin?

381
00:22:18.598 --> 00:22:20.338
See? Look at you.

382
00:22:21.509 --> 00:22:23.779
How much did you like him?

383
00:22:27.908 --> 00:22:29.309
- Goodness. - Mom.

384
00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:30.918
Yes, tell me.

385
00:22:34.418 --> 00:22:35.549
Let's go to a public bath.

386
00:22:36.489 --> 00:22:37.588
I'll scrub your back.

387
00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:39.928
What?

388
00:22:42.858 --> 00:22:43.858
Let's go.

389
00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:55.769
She told me not to tell you,

390
00:22:56.739 --> 00:22:58.709
but I thought you should know.

391
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:02.918
She applied for a leave?

392
00:23:04.178 --> 00:23:06.489
Yes, she didn't say anything much.

393
00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:08.418
She just said it was a family affair.

394
00:23:16.158 --> 00:23:17.658
What is this, Sul?

395
00:23:18.158 --> 00:23:19.398
I can't even reach you.

396
00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:22.029
What happened?

397
00:23:22.628 --> 00:23:24.769
After this competition,

398
00:23:25.499 --> 00:23:26.809
I can rest for a while.

399
00:23:29.709 --> 00:23:30.739
I'm glad.

400
00:23:30.739 --> 00:23:32.709
See? You have to tell them to let them know.

401
00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:34.578
How would they know it was that hard for you?

402
00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:36.449
This is the first time they had a kid too.

403
00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:41.019
You definitely seem like an old man.

404
00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:43.259
Come on, I'm not old.

405
00:23:44.158 --> 00:23:46.328
Look at this face and body.

406
00:23:46.489 --> 00:23:48.189
What's old about these?

407
00:23:48.888 --> 00:23:50.098
The way you act like this.

408
00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:51.428
Like this?

409
00:23:53.668 --> 00:23:55.529
Goodness, but I'm very relieved.

410
00:23:55.928 --> 00:23:57.469
I was worried...

411
00:23:57.469 --> 00:24:00.338
that I came back just to ruin your life.

412
00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:02.509
Have you been somewhere else?

413
00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:06.348
No, I'm saying that I was a bit worried.

414
00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:07.908
You.

415
00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:10.618
You don't like me, do you?

416
00:24:11.479 --> 00:24:12.618
What?

417
00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:15.719
Why do you suddenly say that?

418
00:24:16.418 --> 00:24:18.418
I always thought you liked me,

419
00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:21.828
but I felt something weird yesterday.

420
00:24:22.888 --> 00:24:27.068
I was sitting across from my dad and talking to him for a while,

421
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:29.868
then I saw you in the way he looks at me.

422
00:24:32.969 --> 00:24:35.239
What are you talking about?

423
00:24:36.638 --> 00:24:38.279
Usually, when someone likes someone else,

424
00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:40.578
their eyes tend to give away their hearts.

425
00:24:41.378 --> 00:24:42.549
But you have...

426
00:24:43.118 --> 00:24:45.049
the same eyes as my dad.

427
00:24:46.749 --> 00:24:48.749
And you talk like him too.

428
00:24:52.118 --> 00:24:53.289
Well, that's because...

429
00:24:53.689 --> 00:24:55.289
you make me worried.

430
00:24:55.328 --> 00:24:56.428
Anyway.

431
00:24:57.428 --> 00:25:00.199
If you really like me,

432
00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:03.299
you probably regretted sending me home yesterday.

433
00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:06.868
You're still out of it.

434
00:25:19.418 --> 00:25:20.648
That's so cool.

435
00:25:21.719 --> 00:25:22.719
Hey.

436
00:25:22.719 --> 00:25:24.759
Napoleon once said this.

437
00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:27.529
"If I achieve my dream, I become someone else's dream."

438
00:25:27.628 --> 00:25:29.598
A dream isn't something to hold onto.

439
00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:31.459
It's something for you to achieve.

440
00:25:33.628 --> 00:25:35.098
May I see that again?

441
00:25:35.199 --> 00:25:37.199
- What's this? - This? A pool.

442
00:25:38.769 --> 00:25:41.769
- Hey, what's going on? - I got perfect marks with this.

443
00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:43.479
That's the president.

444
00:25:43.578 --> 00:25:45.408
He's showing off his model house.

445
00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:46.678
Write it down.

446
00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:49.348
He should've gone to architecture, not civil construction.

447
00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:51.779
We didn't get into this major because we wanted to.

448
00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:52.918
We took up whatever we were accepted with.

449
00:25:58.118 --> 00:25:59.158
Hey.

450
00:25:59.318 --> 00:26:01.459
Did you do something to his brains? What's with him?

451
00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:02.628
I have no idea.

452
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:04.459
He said Bo Reum is a brat yesterday,

453
00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:06.328
but he can't live without his phone today.

454
00:26:06.328 --> 00:26:07.868
Darn it. My gosh.

455
00:26:08.128 --> 00:26:09.969
I don't have anything more I can say to you.

456
00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:13.368
Don't fall too deeply in love.

457
00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:16.378
I'll give back the report you wrote...

458
00:26:16.378 --> 00:26:18.378
about your life 20 years from now at the beginning of the semester.

459
00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:22.749
Keep it well, and make sure you read it in 20 years.

460
00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:24.918
Let's see, why don't we have a few read theirs out loud?

461
00:26:25.249 --> 00:26:27.019
20 years from now,

462
00:26:27.189 --> 00:26:29.289
I will be an architect, which has always been a dream of mine.

463
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.818
I believe I will be involved in eco-friendly construction,

464
00:26:31.818 --> 00:26:34.428
which has never been done in Korea.

465
00:26:37.699 --> 00:26:40.229
Wow, you already sound like an architect.

466
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:41.969
I will achieve my dream.

467
00:26:47.709 --> 00:26:49.138
It has a permanent protection on it,

468
00:26:49.239 --> 00:26:51.638
so you can get it back if you end up never getting sick.

469
00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:53.709
It's a great product.

470
00:26:54.108 --> 00:26:55.279
Could you...

471
00:26:55.479 --> 00:26:56.719
help me out?

472
00:27:05.489 --> 00:27:06.588
Thank you.

473
00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:26.578
My life 20 years from today?

474
00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:28.378
(My Life 20 Years from Today)

475
00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:34.989
I'll be the best movie director in Korea.

476
00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:38.989
I'll get an award at Paeksang Arts Awards.

477
00:27:39.588 --> 00:27:41.789
I'll be nominated to Cannes Film Festival.

478
00:27:46.529 --> 00:27:48.168
I had such big dreams.

479
00:27:58.192 --> 00:28:01.424
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E08 Go Back Couple "Your Weapon Against the World"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

480
00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:12.559
Goodness.

481
00:28:12.928 --> 00:28:15.989
Why are you in a hurry? Dry your hair thoroughly.

482
00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:17.559
- Let me see you. - I'm fine. You should do it.

483
00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:20.199
You'll catch a cold if you leave with wet hair.

484
00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:36.318
Goodness, you two are such loving mother and daughter.

485
00:28:37.578 --> 00:28:38.719
Are you a university student?

486
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:40.618
Yes.

487
00:28:40.618 --> 00:28:42.388
My eldest daughter is a university student too.

488
00:28:42.588 --> 00:28:44.059
She goes to Hankook University.

489
00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:45.789
Goodness, really?

490
00:28:46.118 --> 00:28:47.888
She goes to Hankook University too.

491
00:28:47.888 --> 00:28:49.059
Really?

492
00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:51.898
Goodness, you must've been a good student.

493
00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:54.328
You have to be a good student to get into that school.

494
00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:58.098
My eldest daughter studies so hard...

495
00:28:58.098 --> 00:29:00.269
because she knows how hard I work.

496
00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:01.769
She got a scholarship too.

497
00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:04.779
Gosh, you have such a great daughter.

498
00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:06.509
Good for you.

499
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:08.449
She's the only thing that gets me going.

500
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:10.648
She's the only pride of my life.

501
00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:14.088
Ma'am, can you scrub my back?

502
00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:15.449
Yes, coming.

503
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:16.888
Goodbye.

504
00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:20.689
Here, Mom.

505
00:29:24.628 --> 00:29:26.928
Why did you want to go to a public bath with me?

506
00:29:27.128 --> 00:29:29.598
You never wanted to go because you were embarrassed.

507
00:29:31.398 --> 00:29:32.598
Just because.

508
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:35.709
When would I get to scrub your back again?

509
00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:38.979
Why? Was that the last time you did it for me?

510
00:29:39.979 --> 00:29:41.148
No.

511
00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:43.519
Look at you.

512
00:29:44.578 --> 00:29:45.918
Goodness.

513
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:55.489
What a nice day.

514
00:29:57.628 --> 00:29:59.098
Wait here.

515
00:30:01.398 --> 00:30:02.799
Goodness, you're so adorable.

516
00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:04.539
My goodness.

517
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.969
Do you like your mom's milk that much?

518
00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:09.638
He's so chubby.

519
00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:11.939
You're so happy.

520
00:30:13.209 --> 00:30:14.209
Is he pretty?

521
00:30:14.749 --> 00:30:17.118
Of course he is.

522
00:30:17.578 --> 00:30:18.678
Still,

523
00:30:18.848 --> 00:30:21.749
you were the prettiest when you were his age.

524
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:25.118
Your cheeks were so plump with baby fat.

525
00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:28.888
You're so cute.

526
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:32.499
You're adorable.

527
00:30:33.628 --> 00:30:34.668
Bye.

528
00:30:34.668 --> 00:30:37.239
(Gunyoung Mart)

529
00:30:42.338 --> 00:30:43.439
You'll be...

530
00:30:44.378 --> 00:30:47.078
so happy to see my son.

531
00:30:47.578 --> 00:30:49.378
Goodness.

532
00:30:49.678 --> 00:30:52.848
You're thinking about having a son when you aren't even married yet.

533
00:30:52.918 --> 00:30:56.148
Gosh. You're still a kid. How will you have a kid?

534
00:30:58.219 --> 00:30:59.219
Anyway,

535
00:30:59.489 --> 00:31:01.428
he'll be fair and pretty...

536
00:31:01.428 --> 00:31:03.699
if he takes after you.

537
00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:05.229
Right?

538
00:31:06.828 --> 00:31:07.898
What's wrong?

539
00:31:13.969 --> 00:31:15.568
What's going on?

540
00:31:19.309 --> 00:31:21.348
- Gosh. - Goodness.

541
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:23.049
- My gosh. - Goodness.

542
00:31:23.049 --> 00:31:25.719
Look at him. Goodness.

543
00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:28.118
He looks just like his dad.

544
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:30.989
He looks just like you.

545
00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:34.259
He has Ban Do's nose and lips.

546
00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:37.858
His ears and eyes look just like Ban Do's when he was young.

547
00:31:37.858 --> 00:31:39.529
He so fair.

548
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:40.969
Right, honey?

549
00:31:40.969 --> 00:31:43.568
Jin Joo is fair, not Ban Do.

550
00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:44.969
He had dark skin when he was born.

551
00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:46.868
No baby is dark skinned when he's born.

552
00:31:46.868 --> 00:31:49.108
He was really fair when he was this tiny.

553
00:31:49.108 --> 00:31:50.539
They look the same.

554
00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:52.209
Gosh, he's so cute.

555
00:31:52.209 --> 00:31:54.749
Jin Joo, you went through so much.

556
00:31:54.749 --> 00:31:56.449
I heard you had a long labor.

557
00:31:57.418 --> 00:31:59.118
Giving birth isn't easy.

558
00:31:59.118 --> 00:32:00.888
Great job, Jin Joo.

559
00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:02.749
No worries.

560
00:32:02.749 --> 00:32:04.489
Everyone does it.

561
00:32:05.588 --> 00:32:07.759
- Look at him smile. - Yes.

562
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.489
He's the spitting image of Ban Do.

563
00:32:09.489 --> 00:32:11.529
- Exactly. - Yes.

564
00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:12.999
I'm your grandpa.

565
00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:14.668
He recognizes you.

566
00:32:33.449 --> 00:32:34.549
Mom.

567
00:32:35.489 --> 00:32:36.559
Mom.

568
00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:38.559
Mom.

569
00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:43.858
Mom.

570
00:32:50.138 --> 00:32:51.769
What's wrong?

571
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.338
Thank you.

572
00:32:58.279 --> 00:32:59.338
For what?

573
00:33:01.578 --> 00:33:03.878
Thank you for giving birth to me.

574
00:33:05.348 --> 00:33:06.348
What?

575
00:33:08.088 --> 00:33:09.148
Well...

576
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:11.158
Why all of a sudden...

577
00:33:11.588 --> 00:33:13.088
Thank you, Mom.

578
00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:16.759
Okay.

579
00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:19.358
I got it. Stop crying.

580
00:33:25.068 --> 00:33:30.039
(Gunyoung Mart)

581
00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:38.719
Sul is gone.

582
00:33:41.749 --> 00:33:44.689
Okay. I'll be there too.

583
00:33:44.888 --> 00:33:45.918
Hey.

584
00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:48.088
Sul disappeared.

585
00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:51.229
That's right.

586
00:33:51.499 --> 00:33:53.628
She took time off from school around this time.

587
00:33:54.398 --> 00:33:55.598
Are you a fortune teller?

588
00:33:55.598 --> 00:33:56.598
What?

589
00:33:56.739 --> 00:33:58.469
I didn't tell you she took a leave of absence.

590
00:33:58.939 --> 00:34:00.539
It's obvious.

591
00:34:01.568 --> 00:34:04.809
Jin Joo will be super nosy.

592
00:34:05.608 --> 00:34:07.479
Get out of my way.

593
00:34:08.408 --> 00:34:09.548
Where are you going?

594
00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:10.948
To get money.

595
00:34:11.778 --> 00:34:12.778
What?

596
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:15.718
His dad's wallet is ripped or something.

597
00:34:15.718 --> 00:34:17.789
He's getting money, so he won't get beaten to death.

598
00:34:18.019 --> 00:34:19.218
Where would he get money?

599
00:34:19.319 --> 00:34:21.629
There's only one place where he can get money.

600
00:34:21.758 --> 00:34:23.229
His father's piggy bank.

601
00:34:23.798 --> 00:34:25.559
(Jin Joo)

602
00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:27.399
These two were left on her desk.

603
00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:28.598
Yours and mine.

604
00:34:28.968 --> 00:34:29.968
Wait.

605
00:34:31.339 --> 00:34:32.839
This is at my house.

606
00:34:34.408 --> 00:34:36.379
Why would that be at your house?

607
00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:38.778
- What? - It's handmade.

608
00:34:39.948 --> 00:34:41.278
Goodness.

609
00:34:42.048 --> 00:34:43.419
Why are you here?

610
00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:46.289
Because I have nothing else to do.

611
00:34:46.848 --> 00:34:49.189
Maybe something happened that she can't tell us about.

612
00:34:49.189 --> 00:34:50.589
Should we wait for her to call?

613
00:34:51.118 --> 00:34:52.928
She won't call.

614
00:34:57.598 --> 00:35:00.229
Maybe she'll come back next semester.

615
00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:01.798
She won't.

616
00:35:04.798 --> 00:35:07.138
- Hey. Are you challenging me? - Hey.

617
00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:08.569
Come on.

618
00:35:08.569 --> 00:35:10.209
What are you doing?

619
00:35:11.508 --> 00:35:14.109
He's right. We need to find her now.

620
00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:15.879
She won't come back.

621
00:35:16.149 --> 00:35:17.678
Did you call her parents?

622
00:35:17.848 --> 00:35:18.848
Yes.

623
00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:20.888
But her mom doesn't know.

624
00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:23.388
I didn't tell her because I didn't want her to worry.

625
00:35:23.419 --> 00:35:24.488
We have to tell her.

626
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.828
She even took a leave of absence.

627
00:35:26.828 --> 00:35:28.359
Her parents must know.

628
00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:30.399
Of course. We have to tell them.

629
00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:32.798
Because parents are always concerned about their kids.

630
00:35:41.508 --> 00:35:44.578
How can Bo Reum still scare me?

631
00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.278
Her eyes are ferocious.

632
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:49.209
She was fierce when she dumped Jae Woo too.

633
00:35:49.448 --> 00:35:51.348
Hey, watch your mouth.

634
00:35:51.348 --> 00:35:53.388
Okay. I'm not a kid.

635
00:35:54.089 --> 00:35:55.149
But you know that, right?

636
00:35:56.289 --> 00:35:57.289
Know what?

637
00:35:57.359 --> 00:35:58.618
Bo Reum...

638
00:35:58.919 --> 00:36:01.888
dumped Jae Woo so suddenly.

639
00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:03.698
She must've told you why.

640
00:36:04.229 --> 00:36:06.269
I don't know. It's none of your business.

641
00:36:07.328 --> 00:36:09.839
Anyway, where did Sul go?

642
00:36:11.439 --> 00:36:13.209
Either she's after someone who borrowed her money,

643
00:36:13.209 --> 00:36:14.908
or she's fallen for a pyramid scheme.

644
00:36:14.908 --> 00:36:16.439
Those two are the main reasons...

645
00:36:16.439 --> 00:36:17.939
for people disappearing suddenly.

646
00:36:18.078 --> 00:36:19.078
Hey.

647
00:36:20.149 --> 00:36:22.109
That was a joke.

648
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:23.979
Worrying now won't change anything.

649
00:36:23.979 --> 00:36:25.749
We'll start looking tomorrow.

650
00:36:26.519 --> 00:36:27.888
You said not to look for her...

651
00:36:27.888 --> 00:36:29.548
when she disappeared in the past.

652
00:36:29.758 --> 00:36:31.289
Because I was young then.

653
00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:34.689
I thought that was being considerate.

654
00:36:35.158 --> 00:36:37.758
I know you'll still search for her even if I tell you not to.

655
00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:38.859
What?

656
00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:40.499
The coaster.

657
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:43.698
The one I told you to throw out because it's all faded.

658
00:36:43.698 --> 00:36:44.769
Isn't it that one?

659
00:36:45.638 --> 00:36:47.669
Yes, it is.

660
00:36:47.868 --> 00:36:49.809
You had it for 18 years.

661
00:36:49.809 --> 00:36:52.309
That means you've been worried about her.

662
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:56.948
Even if I didn't use it,

663
00:36:57.319 --> 00:36:59.218
how could I throw out a gift from a friend?

664
00:36:59.948 --> 00:37:02.488
I know. So you should find her this time.

665
00:37:03.519 --> 00:37:06.928
You're such an old lady with a warm heart.

666
00:37:11.859 --> 00:37:13.198
Well...

667
00:37:14.528 --> 00:37:15.598
Did you...

668
00:37:16.569 --> 00:37:17.769
go home okay last night?

669
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:22.169
Why do you carry a phone...

670
00:37:22.169 --> 00:37:23.479
when you don't even answer it?

671
00:37:23.479 --> 00:37:24.839
Did you call?

672
00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:26.479
I didn't know.

673
00:37:26.678 --> 00:37:27.678
Why did you call?

674
00:37:29.408 --> 00:37:30.419
Dr. Park...

675
00:37:32.448 --> 00:37:34.019
No. Never mind.

676
00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:35.848
What about Dr. Park?

677
00:37:36.048 --> 00:37:37.689
Keep talking.

678
00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.289
I called you because something happened.

679
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:44.399
I shouldn't have had my hopes up.

680
00:37:45.658 --> 00:37:47.229
What do you mean?

681
00:37:49.798 --> 00:37:52.569
You were never there when I needed you.

682
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:55.669
What?

683
00:37:58.439 --> 00:37:59.439
Go home.

684
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:01.178
I'll go inside.

685
00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:16.758
You were never there when I needed you.

686
00:38:20.098 --> 00:38:21.198
Ban Do.

687
00:38:21.598 --> 00:38:23.069
Come home quick.

688
00:38:25.769 --> 00:38:27.868
Ban Do, hurry up.

689
00:38:35.508 --> 00:38:36.578
Because of you...

690
00:38:39.278 --> 00:38:40.919
Because of you, my mom...

691
00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:44.589
died without seeing me.

692
00:39:11.778 --> 00:39:14.749
You're that student, right?

693
00:39:15.118 --> 00:39:16.919
The one who helped me back there.

694
00:39:20.258 --> 00:39:21.289
Hello.

695
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:24.298
Yes, I'm that student.

696
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:29.798
If he helps you again,

697
00:39:30.238 --> 00:39:32.069
just kick him.

698
00:39:32.968 --> 00:39:34.109
That jerk.

699
00:39:37.678 --> 00:39:39.309
- I'll help you carry... - Wait.

700
00:39:42.578 --> 00:39:44.048
Are you...

701
00:39:45.979 --> 00:39:47.249
Seo Jin?

702
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:51.388
Pardon?

703
00:39:53.129 --> 00:39:54.328
I guess you are.

704
00:39:55.758 --> 00:39:58.129
Thank you for helping me the other day.

705
00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:01.269
But I don't like a guy who makes my daughter cry.

706
00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:02.769
What do you mean?

707
00:40:03.899 --> 00:40:05.738
She's been crying over him every night,

708
00:40:05.738 --> 00:40:08.008
so I thought he was someone amazing.

709
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:10.908
Thank you for what you did then.

710
00:40:11.439 --> 00:40:12.539
Goodbye.

711
00:40:13.149 --> 00:40:14.848
You're not even good enough for her. Why would she like you?

712
00:40:16.749 --> 00:40:17.919
I'm Choi Ban Do.

713
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:21.649
That's my name.

714
00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:29.528
I'm Choi Ban Do.

715
00:40:31.859 --> 00:40:34.569
You're not Seo Jin?

716
00:40:36.368 --> 00:40:37.499
No.

717
00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:51.479
Gosh, Chun Sul.

718
00:40:52.678 --> 00:40:54.348
Yes, you must have a drinking habit.

719
00:40:54.348 --> 00:40:56.258
I heard you can fix that.

720
00:40:56.959 --> 00:40:58.118
Good luck.

721
00:40:58.658 --> 00:40:59.959
What? Where are you going? Hey!

722
00:41:00.289 --> 00:41:01.388
Hey! Hey!

723
00:41:02.258 --> 00:41:03.999
You did this when you were drunk!

724
00:41:05.158 --> 00:41:07.069
If I see her again, I won't let her get away with this.

725
00:41:29.658 --> 00:41:31.758
Gosh, he's so meticulous.

726
00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:34.189
I've doing it for so many years.

727
00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.189
Did he think that I wouldn't be able to find this?

728
00:41:36.459 --> 00:41:38.828
Gosh, my father isn't that careful.

729
00:41:42.229 --> 00:41:43.298
Hey.

730
00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:44.868
What are you doing?

731
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:47.738
Go. Go.

732
00:41:47.939 --> 00:41:49.339
Go. Go away.

733
00:41:56.278 --> 00:41:57.848
Be quiet, and go.

734
00:41:58.618 --> 00:41:59.618
I told you to go.

735
00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.348
Father.

736
00:42:03.118 --> 00:42:05.289
Go Dok Jae!

737
00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:07.559
- Go Dok Jae! Stop right there! - No, Father.

738
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:09.059
It's not like that. I'm sorry.

739
00:42:09.859 --> 00:42:11.559
There's a customer over there.

740
00:42:11.859 --> 00:42:13.368
- Come over here. - Father!

741
00:42:13.368 --> 00:42:14.598
It wasn't like that.

742
00:42:14.669 --> 00:42:16.569
- Come here. Come here right now! - Father, no.

743
00:42:16.569 --> 00:42:17.968
Come here. Come here!

744
00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.809
- Come here. - No!

745
00:42:19.809 --> 00:42:21.309
I'm sorry, Dad.

746
00:42:23.738 --> 00:42:25.939
Open up. Open up!

747
00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:28.048
I don't want to go outside and end up dead.

748
00:42:29.548 --> 00:42:30.578
Go Dok Jae.

749
00:42:30.578 --> 00:42:31.718
Gosh, you surprised me.

750
00:42:34.189 --> 00:42:35.189
Chun Sul?

751
00:42:36.459 --> 00:42:37.488
Why are you here?

752
00:42:38.618 --> 00:42:40.158
Why are you here?

753
00:42:40.388 --> 00:42:43.158
I raised my child to be a thief.

754
00:42:43.158 --> 00:42:44.258
That's my father.

755
00:42:44.258 --> 00:42:45.928
You should either die of hunger there,

756
00:42:46.098 --> 00:42:47.899
or get killed by me outside.

757
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:49.229
Gosh, Father,

758
00:42:49.499 --> 00:42:51.698
have you seen anyone starve to death in a kitchen?

759
00:42:51.968 --> 00:42:53.769
You scum! Come outside!

760
00:42:53.908 --> 00:42:54.968
Come outside!

761
00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:58.109
This is your father's restaurant.

762
00:42:58.578 --> 00:43:00.479
- I didn't know. - Yes, it's our restaurant.

763
00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.709
- Good luck. - You too.

764
00:43:03.048 --> 00:43:05.249
No, where are you going? What are you doing?

765
00:43:05.519 --> 00:43:06.548
I'm going to go out.

766
00:43:06.548 --> 00:43:09.319
If you open this door, I'll die.

767
00:43:09.758 --> 00:43:10.789
By the way,

768
00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:12.689
I'm in this trouble because of you.

769
00:43:14.528 --> 00:43:16.559
Give me the money to pay back my wallet.

770
00:43:17.198 --> 00:43:18.198
What?

771
00:43:18.198 --> 00:43:19.258
What?

772
00:43:19.798 --> 00:43:23.169
You know, the wallet that you tore up when you were drunk!

773
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:24.939
It's my father's wallet.

774
00:43:28.008 --> 00:43:29.309
You can't run away.

775
00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:32.138
I won't get fooled twice.

776
00:43:33.008 --> 00:43:34.249
- Oh, my. - Come outside!

777
00:43:35.508 --> 00:43:36.778
Gosh, Father.

778
00:43:37.379 --> 00:43:39.348
There's a hostage in here.

779
00:43:39.888 --> 00:43:40.948
You know that...

780
00:43:41.189 --> 00:43:44.689
if she works overtime, you need to pay her more.

781
00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:47.629
Hey, you should just get scolded.

782
00:43:47.689 --> 00:43:48.828
It's fine.

783
00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:50.798
I once got hit by my dad...

784
00:43:50.798 --> 00:43:51.999
and broke my chin.

785
00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:54.729
Father.

786
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:57.169
Do you want to pay her more...

787
00:43:57.569 --> 00:43:59.298
or just go home?

788
00:44:00.408 --> 00:44:02.309
It's going to be difficult for you, right?

789
00:44:02.868 --> 00:44:04.379
- Don't. - it's fine.

790
00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:09.278
You're going to take time off school?

791
00:44:10.078 --> 00:44:11.178
Why?

792
00:44:11.218 --> 00:44:12.988
I don't really feel like I came to the right major.

793
00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:14.749
And I don't have anything I want to do.

794
00:44:15.448 --> 00:44:16.758
I'll just earn money.

795
00:44:16.919 --> 00:44:19.158
You can earn money later.

796
00:44:19.689 --> 00:44:22.528
If I start early, I'll probably be able to earn more.

797
00:44:24.729 --> 00:44:26.828
It's not like that nowadays.

798
00:44:27.169 --> 00:44:29.298
You can't catch up to people who are already rich.

799
00:44:30.899 --> 00:44:33.109
You can't tell anyone...

800
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:35.008
that I'm here.

801
00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:36.908
Not even your friends.

802
00:44:38.738 --> 00:44:39.908
All right.

803
00:44:40.848 --> 00:44:42.078
I can keep a secret.

804
00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:43.379
I won't tell anyone.

805
00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.819
- Come here! - My ears are ripping apart!

806
00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:52.488
- Don't be ridiculous. - It hurts. It hurts.

807
00:44:52.488 --> 00:44:54.459
- My ears are about to rip! - Be quiet!

808
00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:56.328
- Come here. - Dad, I love you. Dad!

809
00:44:56.629 --> 00:44:58.598
Dad, I love you. I'll be good.

810
00:44:58.598 --> 00:44:59.729
Please, Dad.

811
00:44:59.729 --> 00:45:01.399
I'm dying. Dok Jae is dying.

812
00:45:02.098 --> 00:45:04.368
Our family is going through some troubles.

813
00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:07.368
Her father is staying at home because he hurt his back.

814
00:45:09.508 --> 00:45:10.879
She's so mature for her age.

815
00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:14.448
This is why I didn't tell her that he hurt his back.

816
00:45:16.448 --> 00:45:18.919
Her sister must have told her.

817
00:45:25.988 --> 00:45:27.589
Why didn't she even show it?

818
00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:30.198
I didn't know this for months.

819
00:45:32.028 --> 00:45:34.028
I didn't know this twice.

820
00:45:34.269 --> 00:45:35.399
You're here.

821
00:45:37.499 --> 00:45:38.539
Gosh.

822
00:45:38.968 --> 00:45:41.008
You didn't find Sul yet?

823
00:45:42.368 --> 00:45:44.638
What is going on? Chun Sul has gone missing?

824
00:45:45.178 --> 00:45:47.078
Yes, but you didn't see her anywhere right?

825
00:45:48.649 --> 00:45:50.419
I've seen her.

826
00:45:50.548 --> 00:45:51.749
- Really? - Where?

827
00:45:53.948 --> 00:45:55.519
In Busan.

828
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:57.658
What?

829
00:45:58.089 --> 00:45:59.158
Busan.

830
00:45:59.928 --> 00:46:01.258
I'm from Busan.

831
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:03.359
Weren't you talking about where I'm from? It's Busan.

832
00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:06.269
Gosh, you must be crazy. You shouldn't joke about this.

833
00:46:06.868 --> 00:46:08.999
She's not a child. You don't need to look for her.

834
00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.698
She'll be fine somewhere.

835
00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:13.638
If you disappear without telling us,

836
00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.908
we'll pretend like you didn't exist.

837
00:46:16.339 --> 00:46:18.278
Her mom reported her missing,

838
00:46:19.138 --> 00:46:20.448
so we should just wait.

839
00:46:23.548 --> 00:46:25.979
What? She reported her missing?

840
00:46:32.059 --> 00:46:33.359
Hey, Chun Sul!

841
00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.229
You brat. Goodness!

842
00:46:40.569 --> 00:46:42.428
What are you doing here?

843
00:46:42.629 --> 00:46:44.569
Why didn't you tell us?

844
00:46:45.098 --> 00:46:46.809
Gosh.

845
00:46:49.138 --> 00:46:50.278
How have you been?

846
00:47:00.618 --> 00:47:02.118
During the IMF,

847
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:04.658
major companies all went broke.

848
00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:07.388
My dad's small business was no exception.

849
00:47:09.798 --> 00:47:11.698
They overdid it to send me to college.

850
00:47:13.028 --> 00:47:14.468
Dad worked at a construction site,

851
00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:16.598
and Mom worked at a public bath.

852
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:19.769
College is a luxury we can't afford.

853
00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:23.578
When I...

854
00:47:24.908 --> 00:47:26.649
buy a book for class,

855
00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:30.149
I keep thinking that it's what Mom gets paid for scrubbing someone.

856
00:47:31.778 --> 00:47:33.348
When I look at my tuition fees,

857
00:47:34.048 --> 00:47:37.789
I think, "My dad won't be able to rest at all this month."

858
00:47:40.129 --> 00:47:41.589
That's how I feel all the time.

859
00:47:42.888 --> 00:47:45.258
You should have told us. Why did you keep that to yourself?

860
00:47:45.459 --> 00:47:46.828
How can I tell you this?

861
00:47:47.098 --> 00:47:48.468
It'll just make you all gloomy too.

862
00:47:49.669 --> 00:47:52.098
When I'm with you, I feel happy.

863
00:47:53.169 --> 00:47:55.439
But I also wonder if I deserve to have fun and laugh.

864
00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:56.709
Gosh, this is nothing.

865
00:47:57.278 --> 00:47:59.809
It feels like there's something separating me from you.

866
00:48:00.479 --> 00:48:02.048
I've been thinking,

867
00:48:03.178 --> 00:48:05.519
and I don't think I can just study while doing nothing...

868
00:48:07.019 --> 00:48:09.289
while my parents work so hard for me.

869
00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:10.589
Hey.

870
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:11.789
It's always like that.

871
00:48:13.459 --> 00:48:15.258
Parents always work hard for their children,

872
00:48:15.258 --> 00:48:17.729
and their children study while doing nothing.

873
00:48:18.658 --> 00:48:20.468
Do you think that...

874
00:48:20.468 --> 00:48:22.769
this will make your parents feel happy?

875
00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.039
Why did you...

876
00:48:30.578 --> 00:48:32.408
become mature so fast?

877
00:48:33.548 --> 00:48:34.678
Do you...

878
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:36.979
know...

879
00:48:37.548 --> 00:48:39.448
how many people my mom scrubs every day?

880
00:48:40.819 --> 00:48:42.149
She scrubs over 20 people a day.

881
00:48:43.319 --> 00:48:46.758
She hurt her wrist, so she can't hold her spoon properly.

882
00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:49.289
But she goes to work again.

883
00:48:50.459 --> 00:48:52.028
How can I just watch that and...

884
00:48:53.598 --> 00:48:55.129
I want to do it.

885
00:48:56.638 --> 00:48:57.769
Mom.

886
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:04.109
I do it because I want to help my daughter study.

887
00:49:04.209 --> 00:49:06.249
Why do you act as if you don't have any parents?

888
00:49:06.709 --> 00:49:08.008
If we fail in business,

889
00:49:08.408 --> 00:49:10.178
does that mean we can't be parents to our children?

890
00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:13.718
You're still young. Why do you try to act like an adult?

891
00:49:14.988 --> 00:49:16.559
Our business failed,

892
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:18.888
not our lives.

893
00:49:19.258 --> 00:49:21.289
Your dad and I can stand up again and again...

894
00:49:21.629 --> 00:49:24.129
until you get married.

895
00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:28.769
Why do you act like a grown-up?

896
00:49:30.439 --> 00:49:31.468
It's so upsetting.

897
00:49:38.439 --> 00:49:39.539
Mom.

898
00:49:42.609 --> 00:49:43.948
Mom, I'm sorry.

899
00:49:47.048 --> 00:49:49.048
Mom, I'm sorry.

900
00:49:53.758 --> 00:49:54.888
I did well.

901
00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:00.028
It's a relief that things worked out.

902
00:50:01.669 --> 00:50:03.499
We might have never seen her again.

903
00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:05.598
I know.

904
00:50:05.939 --> 00:50:07.868
Gosh, Jin Joo.

905
00:50:07.868 --> 00:50:10.039
How did you think of bringing Sul's mom here?

906
00:50:11.178 --> 00:50:14.078
She's the one who should know before anyone else.

907
00:50:14.479 --> 00:50:15.508
Her mom.

908
00:50:15.809 --> 00:50:16.848
Right.

909
00:50:17.178 --> 00:50:19.848
She'd be even sadder if she found out later.

910
00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:22.388
You seem...

911
00:50:24.059 --> 00:50:25.118
a bit like a grown-up.

912
00:50:26.758 --> 00:50:27.758
No.

913
00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:30.198
You suddenly changed over the last few weeks.

914
00:50:30.629 --> 00:50:31.758
Do I sound like an old lady?

915
00:50:32.328 --> 00:50:33.569
Yes, a bit.

916
00:50:33.569 --> 00:50:34.569
Really?

917
00:50:34.828 --> 00:50:36.368
I guess it shows.

918
00:50:36.368 --> 00:50:37.698
So you know.

919
00:51:25.419 --> 00:51:26.789
I'm sorry.

920
00:51:27.189 --> 00:51:29.419
I've been a bit sensitive...

921
00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.888
because my daughter has been a little weird.

922
00:51:32.158 --> 00:51:33.629
Jin Joo?

923
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:36.089
Oh, right. You two know each other.

924
00:51:38.158 --> 00:51:40.298
Anyway, I'm sorry.

925
00:51:45.598 --> 00:51:46.609
Take these.

926
00:51:48.008 --> 00:51:49.678
I always get some...

927
00:51:49.678 --> 00:51:51.339
because Jin Joo really loves peaches.

928
00:51:51.379 --> 00:51:52.638
Take them.

929
00:51:58.778 --> 00:52:01.319
Then send everything except for peaches.

930
00:52:02.019 --> 00:52:03.019
Yes.

931
00:52:03.488 --> 00:52:04.919
She's sending us fruits.

932
00:52:04.919 --> 00:52:06.019
- Really? - Yes.

933
00:52:06.528 --> 00:52:08.328
- What? - Everything except for peaches.

934
00:52:14.669 --> 00:52:17.868
Right, she loved peaches.

935
00:52:25.278 --> 00:52:27.379
Why are you sitting around?

936
00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:29.109
Hey.

937
00:52:29.678 --> 00:52:32.479
You have a peach allergy. Why are you sitting here with these?

938
00:52:32.479 --> 00:52:33.789
My gosh.

939
00:52:34.988 --> 00:52:36.118
What's with him?

940
00:52:37.258 --> 00:52:38.258
Hey!

941
00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:40.089
Hey.

- Seo Jin. - Yes?

946
00:53:07.948 --> 00:53:09.589
Do you like dinosaurs or Mommy?

947
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:10.888
- Mommy. - Mommy?

948
00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:13.258
- Oh, really? Do you like me? - Daddy.

949
00:53:13.258 --> 00:53:14.258
- Daddy? - Daddy.

950
00:53:14.258 --> 00:53:16.698
Kiss the daddy dinosaur.

951
00:53:17.129 --> 00:53:18.859
Gosh, great job.

952
00:53:18.859 --> 00:53:22.129
Seo Jin, you want to walk into the TV, don't you?

953
00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:25.569
Do you like dinosaurs that much?

954
00:53:26.098 --> 00:53:28.039
You're so excited.

955
00:53:34.448 --> 00:53:36.048
Do you like dinosaurs that much?

Are you Seo Jin?

958
00:53:58.999 --> 00:54:00.539
She cried every night over him,

959
00:54:00.539 --> 00:54:03.008
so I was wondering how great of a guy he was.

960
00:54:03.638 --> 00:54:04.638
Seo Jin...

961
00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:06.678
Seo Jin...

962
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:08.209
Seo Jin...

963
00:56:17.178 --> 00:56:18.209
What?

964
00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:20.448
Why am I here?

965
00:56:21.848 --> 00:56:24.678
Choi Ban Do! Wake up!

966
00:56:33.828 --> 00:56:34.859
Jin Joo...

967
00:56:49.368 --> 00:56:53.008
We're back. Right?

968
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:55.649
I'm so relieved.

969
00:56:56.718 --> 00:56:57.879
I'm so relieved.

970

I'm so relieved.

971
00:57:10.658 --> 00:57:12.758
Thank you so much.

972
00:57:13.598 --> 00:57:16.198
No, I was looking for a good insurance plan.

973
00:57:17.298 --> 00:57:19.868
Hey, eat up. This place is excellent.

974
00:57:20.339 --> 00:57:21.868
Thank you.

975
00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:27.678
Do you stay in touch with people from school?

976
00:57:27.778 --> 00:57:28.948
Of course.

977
00:57:29.448 --> 00:57:31.218
You were even the president of our major,

978
00:57:31.218 --> 00:57:32.578
and you cut us all off.

979
00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:35.488
Civil construction major is all about loyalty.

980
00:57:35.488 --> 00:57:37.488
If you ask them, they'll all join a plan.

981
00:57:37.488 --> 00:57:38.488
You're right.

982
00:57:38.919 --> 00:57:40.828
I was embarrassed to face my juniors.

983
00:57:40.828 --> 00:57:42.758
It felt a bit awkward to go to reunions...

984
00:57:42.999 --> 00:57:44.258
or call you guys.

985
00:57:44.698 --> 00:57:46.428
Don't be embarrassed.

986
00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:49.698
I went around saying I'll become an architect back then.

987
00:57:50.098 --> 00:57:51.468
I'm embarrassed,

988
00:57:52.499 --> 00:57:53.968
and it hurts my pride...

989
00:57:54.839 --> 00:57:56.479
to ask you for a favor.

990
00:57:56.839 --> 00:57:58.178
Everyone had a dream...

991
00:57:58.178 --> 00:58:00.109
back when they were in college.

992
00:58:00.408 --> 00:58:01.479
You're right.

993
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:03.848
But you know,

994
00:58:05.019 --> 00:58:06.519
once I had a kid,

995
00:58:07.289 --> 00:58:08.519
there's nothing you can't do in this world.

996
00:58:13.729 --> 00:58:15.028
My gosh.

997
00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:22.899
Do you have a son or a daughter?

998
00:58:23.738 --> 00:58:25.738
A son. Do you want to see him?

999
00:58:25.899 --> 00:58:26.939
Yes, show me.

1000
00:58:27.709 --> 00:58:28.709
It's him.

1001
00:58:28.809 --> 00:58:30.979
Gosh, he'd so handsome.

1002
00:58:30.979 --> 00:58:31.979
Do you have a kid too?

1003
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:33.879
He's three months old. Look.

1004
00:58:37.348 --> 00:58:38.948
- Isn't he adorable? - He is.

1005

The youth may have dreams and passion...

1006
00:58:42.959 --> 00:58:44.789
as their weapon.

1007
00:58:45.459 --> 00:58:46.488
But we have...

1008
00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:48.988
a bigger weapon that helps us fight against anything...

1009
00:58:48.988 --> 00:58:50.758
we face in this world.
