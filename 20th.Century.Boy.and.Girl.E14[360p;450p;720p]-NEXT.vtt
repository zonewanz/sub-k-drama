1
00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:10.640
We'll take a picture like this.

2
00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:15.840
I'll make sure you two look great. Okay.

3
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.910
All right.

4
00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:22.600
But why would you take a picture with 
her and not your wife?

5
00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.150
I have a feeling...

6
00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:27.720
that this is the last day.
 I don't think I'll get to see her again.

7
00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:29.830
Can I get your autograph here?

8
00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:33.580
Thank you, sir.

9
00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:37.470
(From Sa Jin Jin. Good luck!)

10
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.140
Thank you.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.640
I've fulfilled my dream.

12
00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:46.260
Thank you.

13
00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:48.090
- Thank you. - You did well.

14
00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:49.880
- Thank you. - Thank you.

15
00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:51.630
Thank you.

16
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:52.930
You did great today.

17
00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:57.290
Your names are on the top 
ten portal search rankings.

18
00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:59.250
Well done.

19
00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:01.390
Ms. Im!

20
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:04.710
I reserved a restaurant in Sangam.

21
00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:07.160
- Get ready for dinner. 
- Yes, I'll tell the others.

22
00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:09.400
- Thank you. - Your welcome.

23
00:01:09.453 --> 00:01:11.500
- Is there a company dinner? - Yes.

24
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.690
The producers and writers have 
gone through a lot to cast you guys.

25
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.440
We're going to get pork and soju.

26
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.540
If you two have time, you should join us.

27
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.880
Today, we have...

28
00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:26.030
- I will. - Great.

29
00:01:26.036 --> 00:01:27.520
It'll be great.

30
00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:30.090
Do you drink?

31
00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:38.060
Do you need anything? Do you need anything?

32
00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:42.400
Do you need anything? Do you need anything?

33
00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:48.840
Mr. 18D.

34
00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.240
Do you need something?

35
00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.990
Sir, I think you're confused.

36
00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.700
The bell is not here. It's up there.

37
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.900
What did he do?

38
00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.170
What's wrong with him?

39
00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:07.260
If you ever feel confused again, do call me.

40
00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:14.000
Then, I will break your wrist.

41
00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.860
What is wrong with that jerk?

42
00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:20.670
Or I could call the police for aviation security reasons.

43
00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:23.100
Thank you.

44
00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:40.960
Do you know why I always sit up front?

45
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:43.930
To run over whenever you're in trouble.

46
00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:48.610
Flight attendants like us need to be kind,

47
00:02:48.618 --> 00:02:51.470
but let's not put up with injustice.

48
00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:54.000
At least not our team.

49
00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:55.950
Serve people as best as we can,

50
00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.160
and if there's a problem, call me right away, okay?

51
00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:00.160
- Okay. - Okay.

52
00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:02.660
- You were way cool. - Was I?

53
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:05.300
Did I sound like a sheep? I was so nervous.

54
00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:07.580
- You sounded fine. - I loved it.

55
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:12.420
One of the passengers asked me to give you this.

56
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:19.060
Who's it from?

57
00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:23.200
(I'm watching!)

58
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:41.170
Who are you?

59
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.720
You dropped something.

60
00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:47.190
- It's not mine. - I see.

61
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.090
Touch me, and I bite.

62
00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:58.670
What a jerk.

63
00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.940
Get going.

64
00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:05.420
No, I'll stay.

65
00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:08.830
You'll have to stand guard without drinking yourself.

66
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.130
Go home.

67
00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:13.150
- Remember your post-drama dinner? - Just this once.

68
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.940
Mi Dal, didn't your dad's part-timer not show up?

69
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.170
You can't eavesdrop on other people's conversations.

70
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.490
Your voice is hard to ignore.

71
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.110
Hong Hee, take her to her dad's shop.

72
00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:27.550
I have to go. Bye.

73
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.580
- Jin Jin. - Jin Jin.

74
00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:31.050
Bye. See you. Take care.

75
00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:33.850
To the Candy Couple.

76
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.670
- Cheers. - Cheers.

77
00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.890
Let's make this a hit.

78
00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:40.940
We cast the perfect couple.

79
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.060
- They're adorable. - They are.

80
00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:45.360
You can hold your drink.

81
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.480
Thank you.

82
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.640
Jin Jin.

83
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.900
Let's make it a hit...

84
00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:54.960
and keep going until the 10th season.

85
00:04:55.845 --> 00:04:57.710
- How about another shot? - Shall we?

86
00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.580
Another shot.

87
00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:01.330
Drink all you want.

88
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.050
Eat up.

89
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:10.070
It was a long day today.

90
00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:14.230
- Cheers. - Drink up.

91
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.430
That's great!

92
00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:19.380
We haven't had a drink in ages.

93
00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:22.350
Can we have some more soju?

94
00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:26.550
You too.

95
00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:32.940
- Come on. - It's fine.

96
00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.650
Fill my glass, will you?

97
00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:38.820
- Cheers. - You need to eat as well.

98
00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:41.120
We should get more meat.

99
00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:42.750
There's nothing to eat.

100
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.260
Mr. Director.

101
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.040
We're low on meat.

102
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:49.580
Have another drink.

103
00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.950
Let me pour you one.

104
00:05:56.873 --> 00:05:58.470
Let's drink.

105
00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:00.490
- Cheers. - Cheers.

106
00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:03.990
I'm getting drunk.

107
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.610
I'm getting drunk already.

108
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.680
- You should eat. - Here you go.

109
00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:13.620
- Thank you. - It's fine.

110
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.800
I think I'll get drunk before you do.

111
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:20.540
You've had enough. What's wrong with you?

112
00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:22.640
I'll pour you one.

113
00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:28.800
- Ms. Writer. - Shall we order more meat?

114
00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.150
Order as much as you want.

115
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.310
- Hey, our writer's drunk. - Is she really?

116
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:40.010
- No, no. - I think you're drunk.

117
00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:42.250
Go, and sleep at home.

118
00:06:42.252 --> 00:06:43.670
- I want more. - More?

119
00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:46.030
- Cheers. - Okay, okay.

120
00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:50.310
Haven't you had enough?

121
00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.720
- Are you okay? - Yes.

122
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.600
You can drink a lot. You had two bottles.

123
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:19.270
What about you? You're sick. You need to rest.

124
00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:20.570
I'm fine.

125
00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:23.510
Thanks to you.

126
00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:30.550
What's your wish?

127
00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:34.050
- My wish? - You took my drinks.

128
00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:37.390
What shall I do for you? Do you want something?

129
00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:41.790
- I got so much over the years. - From me?

130
00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:44.460
You gave me so many memories.

131
00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:47.280
Your songs, your photos,

132
00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:50.780
your TV appearances, going to see you, and waiting.

133
00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:52.100
They were all memories.

134
00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:55.840
It's true.

135
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.340
Do you remember the fan meeting in 2000?

136
00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.380
In the summer?

137
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.080
On Christmas.

138
00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:08.050
It was our first and last fan meeting.

139
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:12.400
You sang carols for us, and it snowed too.

140
00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:14.220
It was so romantic.

141
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.760
Your third album concert.

142
00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:23.010
Terius kissed your cheek because you were so cute.

143
00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:24.570
I remember that.

144
00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:27.670
It rained so much that day.

145
00:08:27.824 --> 00:08:30.220
I didn't feel cold during the concert,

146
00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:33.530
but I started to shiver as soon as it was over.

147
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.280
I had some fishcakes afterwards. Yet another memory.

148
00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:41.700
- What about now? - What?

149
00:08:41.704 --> 00:08:42.950
Your wish.

150
00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:45.250
Not then, but now.

151
00:08:45.975 --> 00:08:47.520
The present is more important.

152
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.330
My wish is that...

153
00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:01.370
you sleep well and take that.

154
00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.690
Come with me. I'll drop you off.

155
00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:08.960
I'll take the next taxi.

156
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.830
As you can see, I'm sober.

157
00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:14.000
- I can't do that. - You said you'd grant me a wish.

158
00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:15.650
I changed my mind.

159
00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:17.950
I'll grant your wish next time.

160
00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:24.130
I'll take the next taxi.

161
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:30.600
Bye.

162
00:09:35.758 --> 00:09:38.310
Drive her safely. Bye.

163
00:09:53.977 --> 00:09:56.610
(Cold medicine)

164
00:09:56.613 --> 00:09:58.930
From Sa Jin Jin, representing the Candies.

165
00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.140
Mi Dal.

166
00:10:10.493 --> 00:10:13.160
- Where are you? - On my way home.

167
00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:15.760
I'll come over. My dad just closed up.

168
00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:17.550
It's fine.

169
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:20.260
Mi Dal.

170
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:24.950
I'm in such a good mood.

171
00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:28.370
That means you're incredibly drunk.

172
00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.660
Where are you?

173
00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:32.560
I'm on my way home.

174
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.830
My home sweet home.

175
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.690
Welcome to Busan. Where are you? Join us.

176
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.120
I'm in Seoul. We had a quick turn.

177
00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:45.270
We took the same plane back.

178
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:46.920
- Did you? - Bye.

179
00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:48.990
Too bad. You're missing out.

180
00:10:48.998 --> 00:10:51.110
I could've taken you to some famous eateries.

181
00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:55.500
Pork noodle soup, milmyeon, nakgobsae,

182
00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:57.720
eel, and grilled clams.

183
00:10:57.874 --> 00:11:00.910
- You just love to eat. - Where are you?

184
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.160
Where do you think? In Haeundae.

185
00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:07.800
- Don't you hear the seagulls? - I do.

186
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.080
My bus is here. Bye.

187
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.300
Enjoy Haeundae.

188
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:15.570
(Gimhae International Airport)

189
00:12:00.737 --> 00:12:02.050
Sa Jin Jin.

190
00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.200
This is so pretty.

191
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.170
Ji Won.

192
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.300
Yes?

193
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.210
Do you know what the cosmos flower means?

194
00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:04.610
Not what it actually means.

195
00:13:05.902 --> 00:13:08.080
The meaning my sister made up.

196
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.820
"I love you."

197
00:14:38.995 --> 00:14:40.910
- Ji Won. - Hey.

198
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.690
I got the ice cream.

199
00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:44.950
Did you make it?

200
00:14:45.868 --> 00:14:47.680
It took you four hours.

201
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:55.690
Hey.

202
00:15:39.755 --> 00:15:40.800
I'm late.

203
00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:44.690
Breakfast's ready. Can't you eat?

204
00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:45.810
I can't.

205
00:15:55.972 --> 00:15:58.020
Have some breakfast.

206
00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:25.050
How is work?

207
00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:26.550
Fine.

208
00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:29.250
Are your colleagues good to you?

209
00:16:30.373 --> 00:16:31.490
Yes.

210
00:16:31.807 --> 00:16:33.420
Did you skip breakfast?

211
00:16:44.887 --> 00:16:47.540
I got this yesterday.

212
00:16:51.193 --> 00:16:54.640
Pastries like this aren't that great.

213
00:16:56.565 --> 00:16:58.110
You eat it.

214
00:17:00.036 --> 00:17:01.320
It's fine.

215
00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.050
See you later.

216
00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:11.430
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.

217
00:17:11.914 --> 00:17:13.330
Sorry.

218
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.530
I'm so sorry.

219
00:17:17.253 --> 00:17:20.120
I dozed off and missed the stop...

220
00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.700
- Let's go. - Okay.

221
00:17:25.227 --> 00:17:26.910
- Lawyer Jang. - Yes?

222
00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.490
Do you have the papers?

223
00:17:29.498 --> 00:17:32.250
Yes, including the contract and files.

224
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.050
Business cards.

225
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:37.790
A full pack.

226
00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:41.210
Just in case, I have one more.

227
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.660
That's enough.

228
00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:47.760
If I taught her 1 thing, she picked up 3, 4 facts.

229
00:17:48.117 --> 00:17:52.570
She was famous for being smart when she was this tall.

230
00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:56.500
You have such a bright daughter.

231
00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.340
- You must be proud. - Of course, I am.

232
00:18:02.398 --> 00:18:04.280
Whenever I think of her,

233
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.380
I'm full even when I don't eat.

234
00:18:06.702 --> 00:18:08.680
My lawyer daughter...

235
00:18:09.472 --> 00:18:11.450
You have to take notes.

236
00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.300
Lawyer Jang, can you take notes?

237
00:18:39.602 --> 00:18:42.050
There are so many parcels.

238
00:18:43.105 --> 00:18:44.890
Non-fulfillment of a contract, was it?

239
00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:47.790
We're struggling and so are the workers.

240
00:18:47.977 --> 00:18:49.390
They weren't paid.

241
00:18:49.578 --> 00:18:52.390
Do you have the contract and proof of payment?

242
00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:55.560
And certification of contents when you annulled the contract.

243
00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:15.380
Mr. Kang, would you mind...

244
00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:19.190
if I took a five-minute break?

245
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.810
(Ah Reum)

246
00:19:45.134 --> 00:19:47.780
I'm really busy. Bye.

247
00:19:54.877 --> 00:19:56.020
(Jin Jin)

248
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.530
Young Shim.

249
00:20:02.918 --> 00:20:04.870
- Jin Jin. - Just a moment.

250
00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:07.600
Why does he keep calling me?

251
00:20:07.923 --> 00:20:09.270
Let's hang up.

252
00:20:19.868 --> 00:20:21.280
Is something wrong?

253
00:20:21.337 --> 00:20:24.400
Nothing's wrong. How are you feeling?

254
00:20:24.406 --> 00:20:25.940
Did you see me?

255
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:28.470
What? Ms. Sa Jin Jin.

256
00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:31.040
Oh no. I don't remember anything.

257
00:20:31.046 --> 00:20:33.580
I only remember paying the taxi driver 8 dollars 70 cents.

258
00:20:33.582 --> 00:20:36.400
You shouldn't drink so much without your manager around.

259
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.330
Why didn't you call me?

260
00:20:38.387 --> 00:20:41.370
Did I say or do something weird?

261
00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:44.610
You just...

262
00:20:46.195 --> 00:20:47.410
fell asleep.

263
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.230
Where are you? Did you eat something?

264
00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:54.720
I'm out in town to buy something.

265
00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:23.310
I'll take these.

266
00:21:40.783 --> 00:21:45.720
(Dad)

267
00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:47.700
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

268
00:21:52.695 --> 00:21:54.980
(Jang Young Shim)

269
00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.990
Hey, Young Shim.

270
00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:09.710
Yes.

271
00:22:09.712 --> 00:22:13.490
Hey, you must be busy right now.

272
00:22:15.117 --> 00:22:16.180
Yes.

273
00:22:16.185 --> 00:22:18.400
But don't forget to eat.

274
00:22:19.288 --> 00:22:21.900
Your body is your biggest asset.

275
00:22:22.458 --> 00:22:24.940
- Staying healthy is the best. - Okay.

276
00:22:26.995 --> 00:22:28.740
You too, Dad.

277
00:22:30.566 --> 00:22:34.110
I bought some dried seaweed.

278
00:22:35.003 --> 00:22:37.020
You should eat before you go.

279
00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.390
- Bye, then. - Thanks.

280
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.830
Thanks for calling me.

281
00:22:51.487 --> 00:22:52.770
Bye.

282
00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:27.670
Lawyer Jang, you can go first. I still have work left.

283
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.590
Do you have a long way to go?

284
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:31.610
It's okay. You can go.

285
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.130
Then I'll get going for today.

286
00:23:38.133 --> 00:23:39.250
Sure.

287
00:24:06.962 --> 00:24:09.580
Goodness, what a long day!

288
00:24:10.165 --> 00:24:11.950
Gosh, I'm sorry.

289
00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:13.550
Hey!

290
00:24:28.784 --> 00:24:31.680
That's amazing. How did you know I didn't have an umbrella?

291
00:24:31.687 --> 00:24:33.050
My gut told me.

292
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:36.670
Your room lights were off, so I felt like coming out to meet you.

293
00:24:38.126 --> 00:24:41.860
You guys used to come often when I was studying for the bar exam.

294
00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:45.080
Exactly. You should always carry an umbrella. You're too much work.

295
00:24:48.604 --> 00:24:51.130
I have good news.

296
00:24:51.139 --> 00:24:52.600
- What? - What is it?

297
00:24:52.608 --> 00:24:55.240
My dad got a job.

298
00:24:55.244 --> 00:24:57.370
He's working in some building near Yangjae Station.

299
00:24:57.379 --> 00:25:00.560
Wow, that's great. Congratulations.

300
00:25:00.716 --> 00:25:02.210
This is great, right?

301
00:25:02.217 --> 00:25:05.180
Of course, people live up to 100 nowadays, and he's still young.

302
00:25:05.187 --> 00:25:06.870
It's great to have work.

303
00:25:07.122 --> 00:25:09.790
Wow, we have so many great news today.

304
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:11.050
What else?

305
00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:14.220
- Jin Jin bought us bags. - Bags?

306
00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:15.790
- Mine too? - Don't you want it?

307
00:25:15.797 --> 00:25:17.410
No, I do. I love it.

308
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.200
Jin Jin.

309
00:25:20.202 --> 00:25:23.070
- Get us some coats too. - What do you mean?

310
00:25:23.071 --> 00:25:25.740
You show off your body in summer, and you show off coats in winter.

311
00:25:25.741 --> 00:25:28.440
I'm too scared to face the winter.

312
00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:29.910
I'll get you two coats.

313
00:25:29.912 --> 00:25:31.380
- What? - Really?

314
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.830
Yes. But give me three years.

315
00:25:34.483 --> 00:25:35.860
Really?

316
00:25:36.885 --> 00:25:37.920
Five years.

317
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.850
Come on, Young Shim.

318
00:25:40.856 --> 00:25:43.450
I missed you

319
00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.740
I want to hear you

320
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.730
I want to run

321
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.890
I want to see you

322
00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:53.600
- Oh, gosh! - No way!

323
00:25:53.602 --> 00:25:56.280
- Run! - Oh my goodness!

324
00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:11.770
- I'm going on a diet. - What?

325
00:26:11.954 --> 00:26:14.270
You don't have any weight to lose.

326
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.020
I think I might get fired.

327
00:26:17.025 --> 00:26:19.670
It's a wonder you haven't been fired yet.

328
00:26:19.928 --> 00:26:23.290
You can starve yourself, take medications, or herbal tonic.

329
00:26:23.298 --> 00:26:24.580
Lose some weight no matter what.

330
00:26:36.812 --> 00:26:38.430
I had the dried seaweed.

331
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.670
I gave the bread to your mom yesterday.

332
00:26:52.928 --> 00:26:55.010
(Soy milk)

333
00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:06.050
Thanks, Dad.

334
00:27:12.648 --> 00:27:14.700
Goodbye.

335
00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:19.600
Mom and Dad. Hurry up, and come.

336
00:27:22.224 --> 00:27:23.400
Okay.

337
00:27:24.126 --> 00:27:26.390
- Ji Won, will you be okay? - Why?

338
00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:27.790
What if Jin Jin jumps on you?

339
00:27:27.796 --> 00:27:31.630
Goodness. Stop saying stupid things.

340
00:27:31.633 --> 00:27:33.100
I'm just concerned.

341
00:27:33.101 --> 00:27:36.350
Don't you think we're concerned to leave them here?

342
00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:40.940
Get along well, and don't forget to eat.

343
00:27:40.942 --> 00:27:42.510
Don't worry.

344
00:27:42.511 --> 00:27:45.010
Mr. Sa, take this. You can grab a meal together.

345
00:27:45.013 --> 00:27:47.530
- Forget it. - But still...

346
00:27:48.116 --> 00:27:50.800
Mom, eat something delicious.

347
00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:53.850
- Thanks, Ji Won. - Have fun.

348
00:27:53.855 --> 00:27:54.970
Okay.

349
00:27:59.861 --> 00:28:01.160
- You don't have to come out. - Okay.

350
00:28:01.163 --> 00:28:03.380
- Goodbye. - Have fun.

351
00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:14.690
(We thank Jeong Ji Yeong, Ji Yun Ho, and Park Eun Ji for appearing.)

352
00:28:31.526 --> 00:28:33.960
(Children of 20th Century)

353
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.210
I have a present.

354
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.760
A present is only meaningful when the receiver is happy.

355
00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:40.930
If you're happy, I'm glad no matter what it is.

356
00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:43.130
What about me? Do you have any questions for me?

357
00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:45.540
Jin Jin's death day? Will that brat die today?

358
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.940
Jin Jin, open your eyes.

359
00:28:47.943 --> 00:28:50.270
Where's Sa Jin Jin? I'm her guardian.

360
00:28:50.278 --> 00:28:53.310
Anthony is doing a fan signing event at a market in Hangeum-dong.

361
00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:55.780
If any Candies are around, hurry up, and come.

362
00:28:55.784 --> 00:28:57.880
You like Anthony as a man.

363
00:28:57.886 --> 00:28:59.800
Let's eat dinner. Just the two of us.
