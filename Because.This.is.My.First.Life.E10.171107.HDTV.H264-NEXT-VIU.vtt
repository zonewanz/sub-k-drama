1
00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:32.703
Hello.

2
00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:34.834
Hello.

3
00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:37.944
I'm Yang Ho Rang. We were in the same class in middle school.

4
00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:39.944
Yes, I know.

5
00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:42.514
I wanted to be in your class.

6
00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.544
You're the top student at our school.

7
00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:48.254
I'll sit next to you, so help me get into a university in Seoul.

8
00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:49.254
Okay?

9
00:00:56.194 --> 00:00:57.463
By the way,

10
00:00:58.423 --> 00:01:00.234
why do you talk in Seoul dialect?

11
00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:04.304
I moved here from Seoul. Didn't you know?

12
00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.474
I know, but you moved here when you were in kindergarten.

13
00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.743
The teacher's coming!

14
00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:22.983
All right, girls. Get to your senses.

15
00:01:23.653 --> 00:01:25.883
You're 18 years old now.

16
00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:27.323
You're in your junior year.

17
00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:30.894
Also, we obviously have a transfer student.

18
00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:32.564
This is Woo Soo Ji.

19
00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:35.293
She just moved from Jinju. Say hello.

20
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:43.573
Is that it?

21
00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:44.944
Yes.

22
00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:49.144
Go sit in the empty seat.

23
00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:02.954
What's with her? Is she a volleyball player?

24
00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:10.934
Make sure you get signatures on your report cards.

25
00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:18.274
Ji Ho, are you the top junior student again?

26
00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:20.573
(School ranking: 2 of 147)

27
00:02:21.944 --> 00:02:23.013
You're second?

28
00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:26.583
If you're second, then who's first?

29
00:02:27.154 --> 00:02:29.714
- You're the top student? - Really?

30
00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:30.823
No way.

31
00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:33.124
- Soo Ji, teach me. - Me too.

32
00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:34.553
- My parents will kill me. - Teach me too.

33
00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:35.823
Get in line, I asked first.

34
00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:38.393
Don't be mean, she can help us both.

35
00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:40.124
Right?

36
00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.833
What? She's the top student?

37
00:02:51.173 --> 00:02:53.474
How can she get good marks when she looks like an athlete?

38
00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:58.043
It looked like she always got highest marks in Jinju too.

39
00:02:58.914 --> 00:03:02.053
Do you know why she moved to Namhae?

40
00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:04.483
No. Why?

41
00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:07.724
Her mom ran a brothel in Jinju,

42
00:03:07.994 --> 00:03:09.293
and a married man...

43
00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:16.194
She doesn't have a dad either.

44
00:03:16.534 --> 00:03:18.904
Or he exists, and they just don't know who he is.

45
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.844
Don't tell other people this.

46
00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:25.844
I won't. Why would I?

47
00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:43.624
Look at the stars.

48
00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.064
There are so many.

49
00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:52.133
What a bloody boring country town.

50
00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:02.844
What?

51
00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:04.414
Do you want to die?

52
00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:07.284
No! Why?

53
00:04:08.754 --> 00:04:09.814
What's wrong?

54
00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:12.983
I heard you started a rumor saying my mom ran a brothel.

55
00:04:14.893 --> 00:04:16.454
I heard it from someone else.

56
00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:17.923
Is that right?

57
00:04:18.264 --> 00:04:22.534
Did you just hear about her getting into an affair...

58
00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:24.464
with a married man too?

59
00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.204
Come on. Who started it?

60
00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.634
Hey!

61
00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:29.904
Let her go and talk it out.

62
00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:33.974
Let me go! Let go!

63
00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:35.514
Stay out of this.

64
00:04:35.873 --> 00:04:37.084
No, come with me!

65
00:04:43.923 --> 00:04:48.123
I was so proud to have two top students in my class.

66
00:04:48.524 --> 00:04:49.793
How embarrassing.

67
00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:51.793
Wake up.

68
00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:58.664
Gosh. What are you doing here, Ji Ho?

69
00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:03.474
Hey. It's your fault, isn't it?

70
00:05:04.873 --> 00:05:07.074
Good job.

71
00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:08.574
Come to your senses.

72
00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:11.014
My gosh.

73
00:05:28.534 --> 00:05:31.334
Why do they only hit me? Why only me?

74
00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:34.034
Are stupid girls not human?

75
00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:37.803
You're not much better than me.

76
00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:40.673
You look like dumplings.

77
00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:43.014
You guys are ugly!

78
00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:52.454
Ho Rang, don't cry.

79
00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:55.954
What's this? You're good at talking in Namhae dialect.

80
00:05:57.394 --> 00:06:01.363
If it bothers you so much, then study harder.

81
00:06:01.563 --> 00:06:04.634
It's not something I can help.

82
00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:06.603
If I could help it, I'd already be a top student.

83
00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:09.704
She's crazy.

84
00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:12.803
Stop acting so conceited! I hate you!

85
00:06:18.284 --> 00:06:21.654
Ho Rang. I heard you came to my house.

86
00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:26.654
What kind of childish act is this?

87
00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:28.824
I accept your apology.

88
00:06:32.423 --> 00:06:35.634
Do the questions circled in red three times each.

89
00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:37.464
It'll be on the exam.

90
00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:45.103
Also, don't you dare talk in Seoul dialect in front of me.

91
00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:46.673
I hate it.

92
00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:49.373
You make me laugh.

93
00:06:58.024 --> 00:07:01.394
That's how the three of us became friends.

94
00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:05.493
Hey! Look at this! I got 70!

95
00:07:05.894 --> 00:07:06.964
(Math)

96
00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:08.433
How is that?

97
00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:11.003
- You did so well. - Good job.

98
00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:14.634
You only got three wrong.

99
00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:16.803
Good.

100
00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:28.183
(Woo Soo Rang Ji Ho)

101
00:07:33.084 --> 00:07:36.024
I'm going to get you! You girls!

102
00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:37.764
Hey, I got one!

103
00:07:37.764 --> 00:07:38.824
- I got one. - What is it?

104
00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:40.233
- I got it. - What is it?

105
00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:43.394
It's huge. It's a bream.

106
00:07:43.803 --> 00:07:45.764
Wow! It's so big!

107
00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:15.233
I want to be an owner.

108
00:08:15.964 --> 00:08:17.233
I'll become an owner.

109
00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:19.803
But you're so smart. Why do you want to run a business?

110
00:08:19.863 --> 00:08:21.704
Be a professor instead.

111
00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:24.074
Or you can get into a conglomerate.

112
00:08:24.274 --> 00:08:28.074
Even if I do, I'll be dependent on my salary.

113
00:08:28.873 --> 00:08:32.843
You only live once. How can you live under someone's orders forever?

114
00:08:33.284 --> 00:08:36.254
I'm going to make my own money.

115
00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:39.183
That's true. She can't work under people with that temper.

116
00:08:39.884 --> 00:08:43.494
I want to marry a successful man who worked hard for it...

117
00:08:43.494 --> 00:08:44.864
and become a housewife.

118
00:08:45.563 --> 00:08:49.063
Someone who worked for it? Why?

119
00:08:49.134 --> 00:08:51.004
You don't want to marry into a rich family?

120
00:08:51.004 --> 00:08:52.134
No.

121
00:08:52.203 --> 00:08:56.034
If he gets money from his parents, I'd have to live with my in-laws.

122
00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:58.874
If the man made it for himself, then it'll be all ours.

123
00:08:58.943 --> 00:09:02.843
Does that mean one of us will marry a professional?

124
00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:05.343
Maybe a doctor or a lawyer?

125
00:09:06.183 --> 00:09:07.884
These days, engineers are the best.

126
00:09:07.884 --> 00:09:09.813
A businessman who graduated from engineering.

127
00:09:10.014 --> 00:09:13.654
That's the type of successful man I dream of.

128
00:09:15.654 --> 00:09:16.793
Ji Ho, what about you?

129
00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:20.734
What do you think? She wants to be a writer. Right?

130
00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:24.404
No.

131
00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:25.963
What is it then?

132
00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:31.573
It's true I want to be a writer because I like writing,

133
00:09:32.274 --> 00:09:34.813
but that's not my dream.

134
00:09:35.073 --> 00:09:36.644
My dream...

135
00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:40.813
- is love. - Love?

136
00:09:40.884 --> 00:09:42.683
How can love be a dream?

137
00:09:42.784 --> 00:09:45.254
Your next door neighbor Min Gook likes you.

138
00:09:45.254 --> 00:09:46.624
Date him.

139
00:09:46.624 --> 00:09:48.654
No way, he's ugly.

140
00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.024
Date Seung Hoon instead.

141
00:09:50.593 --> 00:09:52.364
It's not like that.

142
00:09:53.563 --> 00:09:57.364
I want to have the love of my life.

143
00:09:59.203 --> 00:10:03.404
I want to meet someone that's like a fate.

144
00:10:04.774 --> 00:10:06.004
That's my dream.

145
00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:12.514
I think I like someone.

146
00:10:13.484 --> 00:10:14.583
What are you talking about?

147
00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:16.083
What? Who?

148
00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:22.024
My husband.

149
00:10:22.553 --> 00:10:23.963
Are you kidding me?

150
00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:26.793
What is this? Are you trying to make us jealous?

151
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.333
Should I say that I love Won Seok here too?

152
00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:31.664
Just go to bed!

153
00:10:38.473 --> 00:10:40.744
Actually, I still don't know...

154
00:10:41.943 --> 00:10:44.343
what marriage means.

155
00:10:45.284 --> 00:10:47.953
However, liking someone...

156
00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:01.333
In life, having one love...

157
00:11:03.494 --> 00:11:04.703
is more than enough.

158
00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:09.973
Something he said keeps on replaying in my heart.

159
00:11:24.953 --> 00:11:27.053
Even the back of his head...

160
00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:31.193
looks charming.

161
00:11:38.604 --> 00:11:39.864
Are you up?

162
00:11:40.604 --> 00:11:41.673
Yes.

163
00:11:42.604 --> 00:11:44.673
Is Kitty feeling better?

164
00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:49.274
Yes. Like the hospital said, it was temporary.

165
00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:02.453
What is it? Do I have something on my face?

166
00:12:03.124 --> 00:12:04.264
Yes.

167
00:12:04.864 --> 00:12:06.394
Handsome.

168
00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:13.203
Is there something on the window?

169
00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.904
Should I clean it?

170
00:12:27.553 --> 00:12:30.953
I can see the person I like every day.

171
00:12:32.524 --> 00:12:35.223
Marriage is...

172
00:12:36.793 --> 00:12:38.323
really nice.

173
00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:45.933
You're home?

174
00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:47.933
Mother.

175
00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:59.213
( Episode 10: Because This Is My First Time Having In-laws)

176
00:13:00.114 --> 00:13:03.524
This is pickled deodeok, and this is braised mackerel.

177
00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:05.823
He loves braised fish dishes.

178
00:13:06.154 --> 00:13:07.254
I see.

179
00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:09.354
Why didn't you call first?

180
00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:12.264
Why would I call my son's house?

181
00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:15.463
It's the weekend, so I figured you'd be home.

182
00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:17.504
Let's put this in the fridge.

183
00:13:18.203 --> 00:13:19.333
Yes, of course.

184
00:13:19.634 --> 00:13:22.234
- Leave it. I'll do it. - Forget it.

185
00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.374
You don't know anything about working the kitchen.

186
00:13:24.874 --> 00:13:27.514
Us experts should take care of housework.

187
00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:28.774
Right, Ji Ho?

188
00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:30.313
Yes.

189
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.313
- Here. - Yes, give it to me.

190
00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:55.933
Do you remember Vice-principal Hwang?

191
00:13:56.374 --> 00:13:58.244
He sent us a box of apples.

192
00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:01.514
I had some with your father-in-law, and it's very delicious.

193
00:14:02.073 --> 00:14:05.144
- I see. - Do you like apples?

194
00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:09.654
Yes, I do. I'm not a picky eater.

195
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.024
That's great.

196
00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.933
Please give...

197
00:14:24.203 --> 00:14:25.864
Give it to me. I'll do it.

198
00:14:31.443 --> 00:14:33.713
I heard you work at a cafe.

199
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:36.213
Yes, I felt like I should be working.

200
00:14:36.313 --> 00:14:37.943
You were worried your husband might feel burdened, weren't you?

201
00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:41.014
How sweet of you.

202
00:14:41.854 --> 00:14:44.553
Where did he find someone so nice like you?

203
00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.654
You didn't forget about the memorial service tomorrow, right?

204
00:14:48.994 --> 00:14:51.463
- If you leave work early... - I won't leave work early.

205
00:14:51.963 --> 00:14:53.963
You know I've never joined the family memorial service.

206
00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:56.693
- Why would you... - Right.

207
00:14:56.693 --> 00:14:58.164
I know you're busy.

208
00:14:58.604 --> 00:15:01.933
I'm only telling you to come if you have time.

209
00:15:04.843 --> 00:15:06.443
Gosh, give that to me.

210
00:15:06.943 --> 00:15:08.644
You're bad at peeling an apple.

211
00:15:09.043 --> 00:15:12.543
Only those who're used to it can peel an apple. Don't you agree?

212
00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:14.614
Yes.

213
00:15:18.254 --> 00:15:20.654
- Give it to me. I'll do it. - Will you?

214
00:15:24.864 --> 00:15:28.394
Ji Ho, we arrived already. When will you come out?

215
00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:32.563
You said you have an appointment with your friends, right?

216
00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:39.504
- Yes. - Go on. You might run late.

217
00:15:42.173 --> 00:15:44.583
I didn't know that. Go on.

218
00:15:46.484 --> 00:15:47.884
Well, then.

219
00:15:55.823 --> 00:15:57.024
I'll just peel it.

220
00:16:06.634 --> 00:16:08.004
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:08.004 --> 00:16:09.734
- You're here. - Did you wait long?

222
00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:11.203
It's okay.

223
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.004
My mother-in-law visited our house suddenly.

224
00:16:13.004 --> 00:16:14.874
I said, it's okay.

225
00:16:16.114 --> 00:16:18.244
Gosh, why am I getting a headache?

226
00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:20.514
You have a headache? Why?

227
00:16:23.624 --> 00:16:24.823
What's this ring?

228
00:16:26.354 --> 00:16:27.524
Did Won Seok give this to you?

229
00:16:28.894 --> 00:16:31.323
- You're getting married? - Yes.

230
00:16:31.524 --> 00:16:32.894
I'm getting married!

231
00:16:36.534 --> 00:16:37.664
Goodness!

232
00:16:40.604 --> 00:16:43.473
- Oh my goodness! - I'm finally getting married.

233
00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:44.774
Goodness.

234
00:16:51.843 --> 00:16:53.313
Will you not visit our house?

235
00:16:53.683 --> 00:16:54.754
We'll see.

236
00:16:55.384 --> 00:16:57.953
Well... Your dad...

237
00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:00.323
says he'll pay for your debt.

238
00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:02.553
It's okay.

239
00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:07.733
Until when will you stay this way with your dad?

240
00:17:08.433 --> 00:17:10.064
You're married now,

241
00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.703
so it's time you forget and move on.

242
00:17:13.134 --> 00:17:15.374
Forget and move on?

243
00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:19.503
What are you talking about? Forget what?

244
00:17:20.003 --> 00:17:22.614
And my marriage has nothing to do with him.

245
00:17:22.914 --> 00:17:23.943
Se Hee.

246
00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:26.814
Your dad is feeling very much apologetic too.

247
00:17:27.483 --> 00:17:29.453
He's grown old.

248
00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:32.324
I'll say goodbye here. I have a business to take care of.

249
00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:33.894
And...

250
00:17:34.324 --> 00:17:37.064
don't visit us without any notice from now on.

251
00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:40.993
It's not polite to the person I'm living with.

252
00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:44.834
Take a taxi home.

253
00:17:50.104 --> 00:17:52.003
The person he's living with?

254
00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:56.213
He calls his wife like she's a tenant.

255
00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:00.554
So I told him to look at my fingers closely...

256
00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.354
and saw my hand.

257
00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:05.953
And I found this ring.

258
00:18:06.124 --> 00:18:09.493
I didn't know he'd make such a nice proposal.

259
00:18:09.753 --> 00:18:11.963
It was worth putting your effort on him after all.

260
00:18:11.963 --> 00:18:13.064
I know.

261
00:18:13.223 --> 00:18:16.193
Won Seok used to buy a flashlight...

262
00:18:16.193 --> 00:18:18.433
when she said she was afraid to walk alone at night seven years ago.

263
00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:21.473
I told you...

264
00:18:21.473 --> 00:18:23.644
I'd turn him to be like Mark Jukebox.

265
00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:27.374
He joined your husband's company, so he just needs to be successful now.

266
00:18:27.443 --> 00:18:30.344
Hey, it's not Mark Jukebox. It's Mark...

267
00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:35.654
By the way, why did your mother-in-law visit you suddenly?

268
00:18:36.614 --> 00:18:37.783
She came to give us side dishes.

269
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.523
To the newlyweds' house on a weekend day?

270
00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.423
Don't tell me she knew your house passcode...

271
00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:46.324
and entered your house unexpectedly.

272
00:18:46.324 --> 00:18:47.433
No way.

273
00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:53.463
Her life with her in-laws has begun.

274
00:18:53.463 --> 00:18:56.273
She only visited our house, and it's no big deal.

275
00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:59.344
Right, it may be a natural thing to do in her position.

276
00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:02.273
It's her son's house, so she thinks she has the right...

277
00:19:02.273 --> 00:19:03.814
to enter his house as she wants.

278
00:19:03.884 --> 00:19:07.084
How can she have the right to enter her son's house freely?

279
00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:10.723
You become an independent being with your own family once you grow up.

280
00:19:10.753 --> 00:19:13.723
If someone is to have the right, it belongs to...

281
00:19:13.723 --> 00:19:15.654
the son's wife whom he chose to marry himself.

282
00:19:16.223 --> 00:19:17.493
I agree.

283
00:19:17.864 --> 00:19:20.693
But that's only for those who live in the western countries.

284
00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:22.233
We're living in Korea.

285
00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:26.334
She wouldn't think that Ji Ho has any right to that house...

286
00:19:26.334 --> 00:19:28.003
when her son paid his money to buy it.

287
00:19:28.203 --> 00:19:30.134
It's not like Ji Ho's paying her rent to reside there.

288
00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:34.614
Right. She wouldn't be able to say a thing if his wife paid her rent.

289
00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:38.884
If I paid the rent?

290
00:19:39.584 --> 00:19:41.054
That doesn't make sense.

291
00:19:42.384 --> 00:19:46.324
And she isn't that intimidating.

292
00:19:46.624 --> 00:19:48.154
She's nice to me.

293
00:19:48.723 --> 00:19:51.523
So I'm nice to her too.

294
00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:53.693
And I want to win her favor.

295
00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:58.134
Another daughter-in-law is about to go into the syndrome here.

296
00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.733
- What syndrome? - Nice daughter-in-law syndrome.

297
00:20:18.683 --> 00:20:20.324
Was it because of this?

298
00:20:23.523 --> 00:20:26.263
- Should I cut your hair as usual? - Yes, please.

299
00:20:27.463 --> 00:20:30.933
By the way, is there something strange about me?

300
00:20:31.304 --> 00:20:32.304
What?

301
00:20:33.364 --> 00:20:35.074
No, you look just the same.

302
00:20:42.144 --> 00:20:45.283
Is this discount voucher still valid?

303
00:20:45.683 --> 00:20:46.713
Yes.

304
00:20:56.753 --> 00:20:58.223
Nice daughter-in-law syndrome?

305
00:20:58.463 --> 00:21:01.664
It's what newlywed wives often have.

306
00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:03.703
They strain themselves...

307
00:21:03.703 --> 00:21:06.733
because they feel like they have to be a nice, obeying daughter-in-law.

308
00:21:07.104 --> 00:21:08.574
I understand them though.

309
00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:12.144
I'd want to be loved by my husband and in-laws too.

310
00:21:12.844 --> 00:21:15.644
It's pretty common for newlywed wives to experience the syndrome.

311
00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.584
Am I experiencing the nice daughter-in-law syndrome?

312
00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:25.124
Why can't I say no to what my in-laws ask me to do?

313
00:21:26.183 --> 00:21:27.523
This isn't right.

314
00:21:27.894 --> 00:21:29.854
Why can't they say no?

315
00:21:29.993 --> 00:21:31.124
I just...

316
00:21:42.673 --> 00:21:44.003
It's just...

317
00:21:45.243 --> 00:21:47.243
that I can't say no to that man.

318
00:22:04.894 --> 00:22:07.993
You changed your hairstyle.

319
00:22:09.763 --> 00:22:10.763
Yes.

320
00:22:11.533 --> 00:22:13.533
I did because I felt bothered a bit.

321
00:22:14.173 --> 00:22:16.634
- Does it look bad? - No, I love it.

322
00:22:20.973 --> 00:22:22.473
I mean, your hairstyle.

323
00:22:23.273 --> 00:22:25.914
I love your new hairstyle.

324
00:22:28.753 --> 00:22:29.814
I see.

325
00:22:38.993 --> 00:22:41.763
Did your mother go back safely?

326
00:22:41.963 --> 00:22:43.094
Yes.

327
00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:46.033
I'm really sorry about what happened earlier.

328
00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:48.673
I warned her not to visit like this many times, but...

329
00:22:48.673 --> 00:22:52.473
No, she only came to her son's house as his mother.

330
00:22:52.644 --> 00:22:55.173
Still, it's not right.

331
00:22:55.773 --> 00:22:59.644
I think we should change our house passcode.

332
00:23:00.283 --> 00:23:01.654
That's not necessary.

333
00:23:02.783 --> 00:23:06.223
If it's because you're concerned about me, I'm all right.

334
00:23:06.854 --> 00:23:09.824
I'm not all right.

335
00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:13.324
I see.

336
00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.473
It's been complete.

337
00:23:25.773 --> 00:23:28.473
I'm letting it go because your fake husband is cool.

338
00:23:28.544 --> 00:23:30.314
I never thought I'd fall by such words.

339
00:23:30.584 --> 00:23:32.344
You have a sweet landlord.

340
00:23:32.743 --> 00:23:33.854
What did he say?

341
00:23:34.354 --> 00:23:36.713
I asked him when he came to pay for the rearview mirror.

342
00:23:36.923 --> 00:23:38.354
I asked him why he married you.

343
00:23:38.354 --> 00:23:40.554
So? What did he say?

344
00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:43.423
Of course, he said he married you for rent.

345
00:23:45.693 --> 00:23:46.864
I see.

346
00:23:47.263 --> 00:23:48.963
And he said he respects you.

347
00:23:50.134 --> 00:23:51.233
What?

348
00:23:52.104 --> 00:23:54.104
He respects you as a defender.

349
00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.074
What?

350
00:23:56.733 --> 00:23:58.644
He respects me as a defender?

351
00:24:07.453 --> 00:24:09.914
He respects me as a defender?

352
00:24:09.914 --> 00:24:13.124
- The last one didn't go through. - What does that mean?

353
00:24:14.693 --> 00:24:18.023
- Sanchez's is on the left side. - Yes.

354
00:24:36.844 --> 00:24:38.914
- They passed the crisis. - They did.

355
00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.654
Tottenham is trying to fight back.

356
00:24:42.554 --> 00:24:43.683
They are moving fast.

357
00:24:44.154 --> 00:24:45.354
Is it a rerun?

358
00:24:45.923 --> 00:24:48.223
I think so.

359
00:24:48.223 --> 00:24:50.154
- They are coming all the way. - That's a good way to get a chance.

360
00:24:50.154 --> 00:24:52.564
Kane is on the left. Rose is coming for the ball.

361
00:24:52.664 --> 00:24:54.134
He tries the low cross!

362
00:24:55.294 --> 00:24:56.794
Arsenal got it.

363
00:24:56.963 --> 00:25:01.233
Arsenal is lucky to have a solid defender like Koscielny.

364
00:25:01.503 --> 00:25:04.144
I agree. He's a good defender.

365
00:25:04.374 --> 00:25:07.544
Iwobi's last shot didn't turn out that well.

366
00:25:07.544 --> 00:25:11.414
Anyway, I'm going to a grocery shop because it's weekend.

367
00:25:12.743 --> 00:25:14.183
I'll go with you.

368
00:25:14.953 --> 00:25:17.324
I need to go grocery shopping too.

369
00:25:17.324 --> 00:25:18.723
I see.

370
00:25:27.334 --> 00:25:31.104
Can I ask you something?

371
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:35.104
Bok Nam told me...

372
00:25:36.033 --> 00:25:40.574
you respect me as a defender.

373
00:25:42.273 --> 00:25:45.783
Yes. He asked me why I married you.

374
00:25:47.183 --> 00:25:51.654
Can I ask you what that means?

375
00:25:53.554 --> 00:25:56.253
Well, it literally means what I said.

376
00:25:57.023 --> 00:26:00.564
You are the only tenant I've respected in my life.

377
00:26:01.263 --> 00:26:03.604
You have never skipped taking out the recycling.

378
00:26:03.864 --> 00:26:05.533
I don't even have to mention feeding the cat.

379
00:26:06.003 --> 00:26:09.233
Above all, in any situations,

380
00:26:10.134 --> 00:26:12.604
you know how to defend yourself properly.

381
00:26:15.544 --> 00:26:18.344
- Honey... - What did you say?

382
00:26:21.783 --> 00:26:22.953
No, that's not it.

383
00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:24.723
I...

384
00:26:26.054 --> 00:26:27.154
I love...

385
00:26:28.193 --> 00:26:29.453
Se Hee.

386
00:26:34.794 --> 00:26:37.664
That's what you mean as a defender.

387
00:26:37.864 --> 00:26:40.003
Marriage is not just a matter of two.

388
00:26:40.304 --> 00:26:43.574
It's more about the interests of others around us...

389
00:26:43.574 --> 00:26:45.104
than what's important to us.

390
00:26:45.574 --> 00:26:49.874
Think about this morning. You knew how to handle the situation.

391
00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:52.283
It could go well because you introduced my mom to them.

392
00:26:52.783 --> 00:26:54.713
I have to thank you about a lot of things.

393
00:26:56.384 --> 00:26:57.953
I really appreciate it.

394
00:27:01.094 --> 00:27:04.364
I need to buy some cat food.

395
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.894
I see. I need to buy rice.

396
00:27:08.233 --> 00:27:09.334
Okay.

397
00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:20.473
Do you know what your husband's nickname is at his work?

398
00:27:20.814 --> 00:27:22.473
No, I don't. What is it?

399
00:27:23.414 --> 00:27:25.013
Loan in the left. Cat in the right.

400
00:27:25.013 --> 00:27:27.753
His left brain is all about loan and the right one is all about his cat.

401
00:27:29.054 --> 00:27:30.154
Really?

402
00:27:30.354 --> 00:27:32.183
Do you think it's funny?

403
00:27:32.523 --> 00:27:34.094
- Where are you then? - What?

404
00:27:34.094 --> 00:27:37.564
I mean, if he only thinks about his loan and his cat,

405
00:27:37.564 --> 00:27:38.993
what about you? When does he think about you?

406
00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:43.733
Well, I don't know.

407
00:27:45.533 --> 00:27:46.664
In his mind?

408
00:27:53.173 --> 00:27:54.914
- Here you are. - Thanks.

409
00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:00.983
I know I shouldn't think like this.

410
00:28:03.414 --> 00:28:05.054
I know I'm not...

411
00:28:06.824 --> 00:28:10.364
the one in his mind.

412
00:28:11.594 --> 00:28:14.634
- I didn't put it on my mileage. - Oh, sorry.

413
00:28:17.164 --> 00:28:21.273
I'm just someone who guarantees him the steady rent income.

414
00:28:22.104 --> 00:28:24.804
I'm his tenant.

415
00:28:27.443 --> 00:28:32.213
I'm just here to keep his faith about no-marriage life.

416
00:28:34.183 --> 00:28:37.183
I'm the great defender for him.

417
00:28:49.993 --> 00:28:51.834
What does he have...

418
00:28:53.574 --> 00:28:55.604
in his mind?

419
00:28:58.074 --> 00:28:59.304
By the way,

420
00:29:00.644 --> 00:29:02.213
do you have any dream,

421
00:29:04.084 --> 00:29:06.953
Se Hee?

422
00:29:07.054 --> 00:29:08.154
What?

423
00:29:08.683 --> 00:29:13.223
I mean, do you have any goal you want to achieve?

424
00:29:13.693 --> 00:29:15.023
A goal?

425
00:29:20.664 --> 00:29:21.794
I...

426
00:29:23.933 --> 00:29:25.364
I just want...

427
00:29:26.763 --> 00:29:29.203
nothing to happen in my life.

428
00:29:30.074 --> 00:29:31.203
What?

429
00:29:32.273 --> 00:29:33.973
Nothing?

430
00:29:34.243 --> 00:29:35.344
Yes.

431
00:29:36.743 --> 00:29:40.554
I just want my everyday to be the same as today.

432
00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:43.114
I want to go to work and pay back for my loan.

433
00:29:43.483 --> 00:29:47.054
I want to come back home to watch a soccer game and drink a beer.

434
00:29:47.824 --> 00:29:51.164
Is that your dream?

435
00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:52.594
Yes.

436
00:29:53.664 --> 00:29:57.364
After all, I want to die at my own place.

437
00:29:58.233 --> 00:29:59.334
So it is...

438
00:30:00.804 --> 00:30:03.644
my dream, I guess.

439
00:30:12.713 --> 00:30:17.423
Is there any way...

440
00:30:18.753 --> 00:30:22.753
that I can be in his mind?

441
00:30:33.904 --> 00:30:35.304
Why are you making me wear a tie?

442
00:30:35.304 --> 00:30:37.544
I can wear casual clothes there. I don't have to suit up like this.

443
00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:39.943
But it's your first day. It's not too much at all.

444
00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:41.273
The first impression is really important.

445
00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:44.443
You are all set.

446
00:30:46.683 --> 00:30:49.213
By the way, Sang Hoon unfriended me on Facebook.

447
00:30:49.953 --> 00:30:51.183
Did he?

448
00:30:51.554 --> 00:30:54.324
Did you not sort out things well with the guys at "Get Up"?

449
00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:57.023
It's all fine.

450
00:30:57.894 --> 00:30:59.594
- Really? - Of course.

451
00:30:59.594 --> 00:31:02.263
Everyone was happy for me for getting this job.

452
00:31:02.664 --> 00:31:03.904
- Really? - Yes.

453
00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:09.733
You look like Mark Jukebox now.

454
00:31:10.273 --> 00:31:11.844
- Ho Rang. - Yes?

455
00:31:12.374 --> 00:31:14.173
- Are you happy now? - Yes, I am.

456
00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:16.374
I'm over the moon!

457
00:31:18.584 --> 00:31:20.453
That's all I need.

458
00:31:20.854 --> 00:31:23.154
- I should leave now. - Have a great day at work!

459
00:31:23.253 --> 00:31:24.753
You should kiss me.

460
00:31:27.253 --> 00:31:28.324
Bye!

461
00:31:28.324 --> 00:31:29.894
- Bye. - Have fun.

462
00:31:52.513 --> 00:31:54.483
Do I not have to sell my company off?

463
00:31:56.584 --> 00:31:58.453
Are we dating now?

464
00:31:58.453 --> 00:31:59.554
Yes, we are.

465
00:32:01.723 --> 00:32:03.723
But there are some conditions.

466
00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.124
Conditions?

467
00:32:09.864 --> 00:32:11.463
(Dating agreement)

468
00:32:13.134 --> 00:32:14.304
What is this?

469
00:32:14.673 --> 00:32:17.203
The rule of confidentiality...

470
00:32:17.943 --> 00:32:20.414
Are you sure you are not insane?

471
00:32:21.443 --> 00:32:22.644
What is this?

472
00:32:23.173 --> 00:32:25.243
It's an agreement...

473
00:32:25.414 --> 00:32:26.683
of our relationship.

474
00:32:28.054 --> 00:32:29.753
What do we have to agree with?

475
00:32:29.854 --> 00:32:31.624
- Do we have to do this to date? - Yes.

476
00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:36.354
I see what's going on.

477
00:32:36.693 --> 00:32:39.993
I think you've seen too many TV dramas.

478
00:32:39.993 --> 00:32:41.993
Having a relationship under an agreement is for...

479
00:32:42.094 --> 00:32:44.064
a rich man who has a lot of free time,

480
00:32:44.064 --> 00:32:47.104
or a celebrity. This is for those people.

481
00:32:47.104 --> 00:32:49.533
We are just normal people. Why would we need it?

482
00:32:49.533 --> 00:32:52.144
That's why we need it.

483
00:32:52.374 --> 00:32:55.574
We are normal people who don't have much free time.

484
00:32:55.574 --> 00:32:58.783
We need this agreement to concern our time and interests.

485
00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:02.884
I see where you are coming from, but...

486
00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:06.953
we are not trying to make money. We are trying to date.

487
00:33:06.953 --> 00:33:09.223
So what? Do you not want it?

488
00:33:09.854 --> 00:33:10.993
What?

489
00:33:12.294 --> 00:33:14.033
I didn't say that.

490
00:33:14.463 --> 00:33:15.933
Take a look at it.

491
00:33:16.064 --> 00:33:19.064
First of all, we can only meet outside,

492
00:33:19.064 --> 00:33:20.304
whether it's a weekday or not.

493
00:33:20.304 --> 00:33:22.773
I'm fine with that. I like being outside.

494
00:33:22.773 --> 00:33:26.273
Getting sun is the best thing you can do to get some vitamin D.

495
00:33:26.443 --> 00:33:29.614
Second of all, never ask each other about private lives.

496
00:33:29.914 --> 00:33:32.743
How is it even possible?

497
00:33:32.743 --> 00:33:35.054
Dating is part of our privacies.

498
00:33:35.054 --> 00:33:37.183
I don't think so.

499
00:33:37.183 --> 00:33:41.824
Sharing every little detail sounds like violence to me.

500
00:33:42.594 --> 00:33:43.963
Don't you think so, Mr. Ma?

501
00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:48.894
If you don't want to date me, just tell me.

502
00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:52.834
Why are you making everything so frustrating like this?

503
00:33:53.334 --> 00:33:54.773
No, that's not what I'm doing.

504
00:33:55.134 --> 00:33:57.874
I like you and I want to date you.

505
00:33:58.844 --> 00:34:00.673
That's why I'm trying to make this work.

506
00:34:01.173 --> 00:34:04.344
Originally, my rule is not to sleep with anyone I work with.

507
00:34:04.344 --> 00:34:08.613
But I'm even thinking about dating you. It's a big deal for me.

508
00:34:10.624 --> 00:34:11.823
Oh, I see.

509
00:34:12.653 --> 00:34:14.754
Of course...

510
00:34:15.223 --> 00:34:17.694
I understand everything.

511
00:34:17.694 --> 00:34:21.493
But there's no affection between us, you know?

512
00:34:22.033 --> 00:34:25.064
Whenever we see each other,

513
00:34:26.734 --> 00:34:28.104
we can do it twice.

514
00:34:30.504 --> 00:34:34.073
I think this contract is full of affection.

515
00:34:34.814 --> 00:34:37.944
2, 3, 4, and even 5 times.

516
00:34:38.283 --> 00:34:40.283
I can do it.

517
00:34:40.283 --> 00:34:43.453
And you'll agree to renewal of contract every 100 days.

518
00:34:43.484 --> 00:34:45.584
- Why does it have to be 100 days? - Why not?

519
00:34:46.183 --> 00:34:47.394
Is it too hard?

520
00:34:55.418 --> 00:34:58.650

521

(Dating Contract)

522
00:35:11.714 --> 00:35:13.113
She's so bad.

523
00:35:14.254 --> 00:35:15.754
She's so good at this.

524
00:35:19.223 --> 00:35:22.493
That's it. This is enough. I have to end it.

525
00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:26.723
Ma Sang Goo, how did your mother teach you?

526
00:35:26.723 --> 00:35:28.763
She told me never to meet bad girls.

527
00:35:28.964 --> 00:35:32.464
I have to stop here before things get so ugly for me.

528
00:35:33.303 --> 00:35:34.433
Can I kiss you?

529
00:35:46.113 --> 00:35:47.513
What on earth are you doing?

530
00:35:47.854 --> 00:35:50.013
Hey, right brain. Are you dead? Why isn't it working?

531
00:35:50.013 --> 00:35:52.223
Delete it! Delete!

532
00:35:52.754 --> 00:35:54.493
Why are you doing this to me? Let's delete it.

533
00:35:54.624 --> 00:35:55.953
I have to delete it.

534
00:35:57.493 --> 00:36:00.334
Whenever we see each other,

535
00:36:01.263 --> 00:36:02.533
we can do it twice.

536
00:36:04.334 --> 00:36:05.433
Ma Sang Goo.

537
00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:08.303
Are your mental mind and body being controlled by her?

538
00:36:08.303 --> 00:36:09.504
What are you, an animal?

539
00:36:10.104 --> 00:36:13.073
Come to your senses. Goodness! It hurts!

540
00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:15.513
- Why is this happening to me? - Hello.

541
00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:17.484
Don't you know how scary this world is?

542
00:36:17.783 --> 00:36:20.653
No, you can't do this. Don't.

543
00:36:20.683 --> 00:36:23.354
- Oh, my goodness. - What's wrong with him?

544
00:36:23.354 --> 00:36:25.883
- Why did you make me go through it? - I have no idea.

545
00:36:26.283 --> 00:36:27.993
- I can't be controlled by her. - Are you really okay...

546
00:36:28.223 --> 00:36:31.294
with working here?

547
00:36:31.664 --> 00:36:34.093
She cannot control my mind and body.

548
00:36:34.093 --> 00:36:36.593
Come to your senses! Listen to your mothers' words.

549
00:36:36.593 --> 00:36:39.633
Oh, darn it. Why does it hurt so much?

550
00:36:43.104 --> 00:36:45.703
This is the meeting room, and that's the CEO's room.

551
00:36:45.774 --> 00:36:49.113
And there's a lounge for the employees.

552
00:36:49.843 --> 00:36:50.883
Okay.

553
00:36:50.883 --> 00:36:53.144
And this...

554
00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:55.214
is your seat.

555
00:36:55.883 --> 00:36:56.953
Okay.

556
00:36:57.424 --> 00:36:59.783
Then are you my immediate superior, sir?

557
00:36:59.924 --> 00:37:01.024
No.

558
00:37:01.624 --> 00:37:04.394
You should just call me Se Hee.

559
00:37:05.993 --> 00:37:08.894
- Okay. - Your immediate superior...

560
00:37:10.763 --> 00:37:11.964
is that lady.

561
00:37:15.093 --> 00:37:17.594
Your immediate superior...

562
00:37:18.563 --> 00:37:19.764
is that lady.

563
00:37:34.469 --> 00:37:37.509
Your desk is all ready.

564
00:37:38.009 --> 00:37:39.138
But there's one thing missing.

565
00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.208
Do you happen to have the phone you used for testing?

566
00:37:42.348 --> 00:37:44.179
- Yes. - Then do you have...

567
00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:45.248
a mechanical keyboard?

568
00:37:45.518 --> 00:37:46.719
Yes, I also have that.

569
00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:49.688
Then what about a girlfriend?

570
00:37:49.958 --> 00:37:51.058
Pardon?

571
00:37:52.759 --> 00:37:54.589
I also have a girlfriend.

572
00:37:56.058 --> 00:37:58.759
I see. When did you start using Slack?

573
00:37:59.029 --> 00:38:01.529
I've been using it ever since it was released.

574
00:38:01.629 --> 00:38:02.998
So I guess it's been about four years.

575
00:38:03.368 --> 00:38:05.638
Then how long have you been going out with your girlfriend?

576
00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:09.009
We've been dating for about seven years.

577
00:38:09.009 --> 00:38:11.009
Why do you keep asking about that?

578
00:38:11.538 --> 00:38:12.839
It's for work.

579
00:38:13.308 --> 00:38:15.609
You can ask me questions anytime.

580
00:38:15.908 --> 00:38:17.518
I'll get going then.

581
00:38:42.138 --> 00:38:43.509
Darn it.

582
00:38:43.509 --> 00:38:44.679
(Soo Ji)

583
00:38:49.078 --> 00:38:52.018
Is my stomach upset? It's killing me.

584
00:38:54.688 --> 00:38:56.419
Gosh, this feels good.

585
00:39:03.129 --> 00:39:05.458
Woo Seok, can I talk to you for a second?

586
00:39:10.438 --> 00:39:11.438
Okay.

587
00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:14.669
You know, your friend... Who was it?

588
00:39:14.708 --> 00:39:17.009
Woo Ji Soo? Woo Soo Soo? What was her name?

589
00:39:17.009 --> 00:39:20.248
- You mean Soo Ji? - Oh, that's her name.

590
00:39:20.449 --> 00:39:22.109
- Did you go to college with her? - Yes.

591
00:39:22.748 --> 00:39:26.219
I got to meet Ho Rang thanks to Ji Ho and Soo Ji.

592
00:39:26.649 --> 00:39:30.089
Ho Rang used to come to my school more often than she went to hers.

593
00:39:31.058 --> 00:39:32.388
Oh, I see.

594
00:39:32.558 --> 00:39:35.658
Was she popular back then?

595
00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:38.458
Many guys hit on her.

596
00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:39.859
Oh, really?

597
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:42.529
What about you? Have you ever hit on her?

598
00:39:42.529 --> 00:39:43.868
- What? Me? - Yes.

599
00:39:44.138 --> 00:39:46.538
No, that can never happen between us.

600
00:39:46.569 --> 00:39:49.408
Why not? She's your college friend,

601
00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:50.978
and you met her before you met your current girlfriend.

602
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:53.808
I think she's pretty good-looking, and she has a nice personality.

603
00:39:54.279 --> 00:39:55.748
That's correct,

604
00:39:56.049 --> 00:39:58.819
but I can never go out with a scary girl like her.

605
00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:02.719
And she's not the type that can handle my stupidity as well.

606
00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:04.058
She's in a different league.

607
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:07.859
Then what do you think about me?

608
00:40:08.658 --> 00:40:10.359
Do you think I'm in her league?

609
00:40:10.728 --> 00:40:12.458
- You and Soo Ji? - Yes.

610
00:40:13.969 --> 00:40:16.768
I can compare it to ransomware getting immediately infected.

611
00:40:17.038 --> 00:40:20.868
You can never go back once you catch that, and your life will be ruined.

612
00:40:25.978 --> 00:40:27.609
Oh, thanks for telling me that. Go back to work now.

613
00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:34.589
My life will be ruined?

614
00:40:46.768 --> 00:40:47.768
Excuse me.

615
00:40:52.098 --> 00:40:53.169
Yes, ma'am?

616
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:56.638
I think this is too bland.

617
00:40:56.938 --> 00:40:59.179
It tastes like nothing.

618
00:41:00.649 --> 00:41:02.478
Can I taste it?

619
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:16.529
I think it's all right.

620
00:41:17.799 --> 00:41:20.529
I don't think you're getting what I'm saying.

621
00:41:21.299 --> 00:41:23.029
How do you expect me to have this?

622
00:41:23.228 --> 00:41:25.069
I don't like it.

623
00:41:25.598 --> 00:41:28.538
So either make a new one or refund my money.

624
00:41:30.438 --> 00:41:32.179
Yes, I can do that for you,

625
00:41:32.839 --> 00:41:35.779
but I personally think you eat too much of salty food.

626
00:41:36.248 --> 00:41:39.518
What? How dare you run your mouth...

627
00:41:39.518 --> 00:41:41.219
in front of me?

628
00:41:42.989 --> 00:41:45.958
Ms. Yang. How could you say that to a customer?

629
00:41:47.158 --> 00:41:49.728
- I'm sorry. - What's gotten into you?

630
00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:51.998
Are you on your period?

631
00:41:55.228 --> 00:41:56.368
Sir.

632
00:41:56.938 --> 00:41:57.969
What?

633
00:41:58.799 --> 00:42:01.208
I've been meaning to tell you this.

634
00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:03.908
Why do you keep insulting my womb, asking if I'm on my period...

635
00:42:03.908 --> 00:42:05.638
every time I do something wrong?

636
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:09.779
- What? - I mean,

637
00:42:10.248 --> 00:42:12.879
I'm the one who's at fault, not my womb.

638
00:42:12.879 --> 00:42:14.419
The same goes for my other organs.

639
00:42:17.788 --> 00:42:20.529
Ms. Yang. Are you drunk?

640
00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:23.759
No, I'm not. And I'm done with my period already.

641
00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:28.529
Since my break time is almost over, I'll go take a rest for a second.

642
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:45.679
Ms. Yang. Why are you behaving that way to him?

643
00:42:46.018 --> 00:42:48.149
What if you get fired?

644
00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:51.859
It's all good. I'll quit before he has a chance to fire me.

645
00:42:52.458 --> 00:42:55.158
Sorry? Are you moving to another branch?

646
00:42:55.828 --> 00:42:58.199
Yes, I'm going to move soon.

647
00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:00.328
- Really? - To where?

648
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:03.768
I'm going to be a good wife.

649
00:43:03.768 --> 00:43:05.069
A good wife?

650
00:43:06.938 --> 00:43:09.169
Is that a new concept of some restaurant?

651
00:43:15.879 --> 00:43:17.078
This is pretty.

652
00:43:17.649 --> 00:43:19.819
Ho Rang, I'm home.

653
00:43:20.388 --> 00:43:22.549
Oh, my. You're home, my darling.

654
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:23.658
Give it to me.

655
00:43:23.658 --> 00:43:24.759
What?

656
00:43:25.518 --> 00:43:27.558
Why are you acting that way? It's weird.

657
00:43:27.788 --> 00:43:29.828
What is? I have to start practicing.

658
00:43:29.828 --> 00:43:31.199
I have to practice being a wife.

659
00:43:33.498 --> 00:43:34.699
What's all this?

660
00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:38.538
I took a half day off and went to a wedding expo.

661
00:43:38.538 --> 00:43:42.408
There are so many things to prepare like gifts, a venue, and others.

662
00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:43.978
Sit. I'll brief you on this.

663
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:45.408
- Come here. Sit down. - Okay.

664
00:43:48.708 --> 00:43:51.379
Oh, right. We have to join the wedding mileage.

665
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:53.018
- A wedding mileage? - Yes.

666
00:43:53.118 --> 00:43:56.219
We have to, since we're going to spend a lot of money for everything.

667
00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:00.888
But they said they'll let us join only if we have a venue contract.

668
00:44:02.688 --> 00:44:03.899
A venue?

669
00:44:05.558 --> 00:44:08.029
Then we must reserve the venue, right?

670
00:44:08.029 --> 00:44:10.268
Decent places must be all booked until next year, don't you think so?

671
00:44:10.498 --> 00:44:12.038
Darn, we're in trouble.

672
00:44:12.368 --> 00:44:13.469
Next year?

673
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:19.779
Well, if not next year,

674
00:44:19.779 --> 00:44:22.348
we can get married a year after that but it'd be better to be prepared.

675
00:44:23.379 --> 00:44:25.679
Ho Rang, what are you talking about?

676
00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:28.719
How can we get married two years later?

677
00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:32.458
What?

678
00:44:50.208 --> 00:44:51.879
It's open. Come in.

679
00:45:01.848 --> 00:45:03.219
What's this look?

680
00:45:04.058 --> 00:45:05.188
Are you rejecting me?

681
00:45:14.598 --> 00:45:16.328
I got this on my way here.

682
00:45:17.169 --> 00:45:18.938
It's brand new.

683
00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:23.638
It's a gift.

684
00:45:24.509 --> 00:45:25.808
My phone works fine.

685
00:45:25.808 --> 00:45:28.609
Use that for work. And use this...

686
00:45:29.478 --> 00:45:31.379
to talk to me only.

687
00:45:31.649 --> 00:45:32.848
Get it?

688
00:45:38.759 --> 00:45:41.429
All right, all right. Let's start dating.

689
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:44.828
I'll agree to all your conditions.

690
00:45:49.098 --> 00:45:52.469
Instead, don't ever tell this number to anyone else.

691
00:45:52.638 --> 00:45:55.569
Use this phone with me only.

692
00:45:56.408 --> 00:45:57.739
That's my condition.

693
00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:01.379
You sure know how to negotiate.

694
00:46:08.819 --> 00:46:10.419
What about your number? Did you save it?

695
00:46:12.819 --> 00:46:14.658
(My Honey Sang Goo)

696
00:46:20.929 --> 00:46:22.129
This is you.

697
00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:26.299
(My Baby)

698
00:46:32.938 --> 00:46:34.308
Why are you laughing?

699
00:46:36.949 --> 00:46:38.149
Sang Goo, honey.

700
00:46:39.679 --> 00:46:40.788
What?

701
00:46:41.288 --> 00:46:43.489
Why aren't you washing? You're wasting our time.

702
00:46:43.819 --> 00:46:45.288
We have a lot to do.

703
00:46:48.629 --> 00:46:51.199
You little rascal. You're getting spanked real good tonight.

704
00:46:51.199 --> 00:46:54.029
I'm going to teach you a lesson as a man.

705
00:46:54.029 --> 00:46:55.098
Just wait here.

706
00:46:55.098 --> 00:46:58.569
I'll comeback after 10 minutes. I mean 5 minutes.

707
00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:06.138
Two cups of Yirgacheffe.

708
00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:07.348
Okay.

709
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:18.018
Isn't one-sided love tough?

710
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:19.719
Having a crush on your husband...

711
00:47:19.919 --> 00:47:23.498
after marriage must not be easy.

712
00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:26.629
What are you talking about? What crush?

713
00:47:30.038 --> 00:47:31.239
Is it that obvious?

714
00:47:31.638 --> 00:47:32.768
Of course it is.

715
00:47:33.098 --> 00:47:35.368
The way you look at him is different from how he looks at you.

716
00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:39.808
How are mine and his different?

717
00:47:40.348 --> 00:47:42.049
You look at him...

718
00:47:43.149 --> 00:47:46.578
as if you're saying, "I'll do anything for you."

719
00:47:47.149 --> 00:47:48.919
And he looks at you...

720
00:47:50.618 --> 00:47:51.759
just like this.

721
00:47:52.819 --> 00:47:53.929
Didn't I look like him?

722
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.359
Don't be too into him.

723
00:47:59.558 --> 00:48:01.299
You'll get tired and sad.

724
00:48:01.529 --> 00:48:04.339
Love is reciprocal. You can't just give it.

725
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:17.649
Hello?

726
00:48:18.578 --> 00:48:19.719
Yes.

727
00:48:20.989 --> 00:48:23.359
Yes, Mother.

728
00:48:48.808 --> 00:48:51.279
Welcome! Wasn't it tiring to come?

729
00:48:51.279 --> 00:48:52.348
Not at all.

730
00:48:52.478 --> 00:48:55.949
I called you over because I thought it'd be better for you to attend.

731
00:48:55.949 --> 00:48:57.688
It looks bad if both of you don't attend it...

732
00:48:58.118 --> 00:49:00.188
since this is the first ancestral rites after you got married.

733
00:49:00.828 --> 00:49:01.888
Of course.

734
00:49:02.728 --> 00:49:05.259
- Where did Father go? - He'll be home soon.

735
00:49:05.429 --> 00:49:06.969
- Let's go inside. - All right.

736
00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:08.598
Come over here.

737
00:49:12.339 --> 00:49:15.009
How are you going to make everything alone?

738
00:49:15.009 --> 00:49:17.408
Oh, I'm an expert in this.

739
00:49:17.408 --> 00:49:19.138
I've been the first daughter-in-law for more than 40 years.

740
00:49:20.609 --> 00:49:22.549
You're amazing.

741
00:49:24.078 --> 00:49:26.919
How can I make my daughter-in-law work when she's so precious?

742
00:49:27.788 --> 00:49:30.259
You know, it was my life-long wish...

743
00:49:30.359 --> 00:49:32.259
to wear a matching apron with my daughter.

744
00:49:34.228 --> 00:49:36.259
- Your daughter? - Yes, of course.

745
00:49:36.259 --> 00:49:38.458
You're like my own daughter.

746
00:49:39.029 --> 00:49:42.598
I'm so happy that you became our family member...

747
00:49:42.598 --> 00:49:44.569
when there are only unfriendly men in our family.

748
00:49:47.739 --> 00:49:50.279
Where can I begin, Mother?

749
00:49:50.438 --> 00:49:52.208
Oh, just everything here.

750
00:50:18.169 --> 00:50:19.899
Are you still working?

751
00:50:31.618 --> 00:50:34.288
Oh, I'm at your parents' house.

752
00:50:39.688 --> 00:50:42.029
I don't understand why they air such things.

753
00:50:42.029 --> 00:50:45.699
Just watch it. You always throw cold water on everything.

754
00:50:45.998 --> 00:50:47.998
Come again for next year, okay?

755
00:50:47.998 --> 00:50:49.098
Okay.

756
00:50:50.339 --> 00:50:51.538
He's so adorable.

757
00:50:52.498 --> 00:50:54.509
Gosh, he's so silly.

758
00:50:55.569 --> 00:50:56.978
Do you want more apples?

759
00:50:56.978 --> 00:50:59.078
Yes, please. They're so good.

760
00:51:02.248 --> 00:51:03.549
Oh, right.

761
00:51:04.578 --> 00:51:07.489
Come over here, Sung Mi.

762
00:51:08.049 --> 00:51:10.688
Gosh, didn't she grow so big?

763
00:51:10.688 --> 00:51:12.518
Yes, she's a big girl.

764
00:51:14.929 --> 00:51:17.299
You're really good at that.

765
00:51:17.759 --> 00:51:20.228
Sung Mi, watch that carefully.

766
00:51:20.629 --> 00:51:23.368
She graduated from Seoul National University.

767
00:51:23.598 --> 00:51:25.938
You have to be smart and good like her when you grow up.

768
00:51:25.938 --> 00:51:27.469
- All right? - Okay.

769
00:51:27.469 --> 00:51:30.138
Gosh, she speaks well.

770
00:51:32.279 --> 00:51:34.808
I finally feel like home now.

771
00:51:34.908 --> 00:51:36.578
You always made me work.

772
00:51:36.578 --> 00:51:39.018
When did I ever do that?

773
00:51:40.348 --> 00:51:42.149
I'm just kidding.

774
00:51:43.458 --> 00:51:47.859
If I had a son, it'd have been fun to have a daughter-in-law like you.

775
00:51:47.859 --> 00:51:49.388
I envy you.

776
00:51:50.299 --> 00:51:51.299
Fun?

777
00:51:51.299 --> 00:51:54.629
I was always jealous that you have a daughter.

778
00:51:54.699 --> 00:51:57.038
But I'm not anymore.

779
00:51:57.299 --> 00:51:59.638
I also have a daughter-in-law who's like a daughter.

780
00:52:00.538 --> 00:52:01.839
My gosh.

781
00:52:03.379 --> 00:52:05.779
Your mother-in-law sounds really happy.

782
00:52:05.779 --> 00:52:09.348
Of course I am. I got a daughter for free.

783
00:52:09.478 --> 00:52:11.149
Dear, please finish this off.

784
00:52:11.319 --> 00:52:12.478
Oh, okay.

785
00:52:13.748 --> 00:52:16.518
Oh, right. You have to wash the utensils.

786
00:52:16.919 --> 00:52:18.158
Where did you put them?

787
00:52:18.259 --> 00:52:19.819
Let's go look for them.

788
00:52:30.569 --> 00:52:32.669
Se Hee, what are you doing here?

789
00:52:41.669 --> 00:52:43.769
Se Hee, what are you doing here?

790
00:52:44.583 --> 00:52:47.982
I thought I would never be able to see you!

791
00:52:48.322 --> 00:52:52.223
How did you find someone like her?

792
00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:10.943
Make a bow.

793
00:53:31.463 --> 00:53:34.634
Dad, don't you think the food is more delicious today?

794
00:53:36.634 --> 00:53:40.034
Your granddaughter-in-law is an amazing cook.

795
00:53:41.733 --> 00:53:43.233
You should make a bow too.

796
00:53:43.904 --> 00:53:45.744
You too, Ji Ho.

797
00:54:01.724 --> 00:54:03.623
Be careful!

798
00:54:04.994 --> 00:54:07.063
- Take care of your brother. - I see.

799
00:54:14.404 --> 00:54:15.674
I will do that.

800
00:54:19.904 --> 00:54:21.014
What are you doing?

801
00:54:21.474 --> 00:54:23.684
Stop making things complicated and get out of the kitchen.

802
00:54:23.684 --> 00:54:26.083
- I can do this. - I know.

803
00:54:26.413 --> 00:54:29.284
Everyone here knows you adore your wife.

804
00:54:29.614 --> 00:54:31.284
I know you are trying to help.

805
00:54:31.654 --> 00:54:33.954
But you are going to make things complicated.

806
00:54:35.193 --> 00:54:37.224
That's true. It's uncomfortable...

807
00:54:37.224 --> 00:54:38.764
for Ji Ho too.

808
00:54:39.094 --> 00:54:41.264
- What are you talking about? - You can go now.

809
00:55:08.224 --> 00:55:09.393
Help yourself.

810
00:55:10.963 --> 00:55:13.534
I know, right?

811
00:55:17.603 --> 00:55:18.634
Did you...

812
00:55:21.904 --> 00:55:24.643
pay everything back for your loan?

813
00:55:25.603 --> 00:55:26.813
I'm working on it.

814
00:55:30.344 --> 00:55:31.913
I'll pay for the rest of it...

815
00:55:33.184 --> 00:55:34.614
as I promised.

816
00:55:35.713 --> 00:55:38.353
Why would you do that? That's my loan.

817
00:55:38.424 --> 00:55:40.324
Your wife is working as a part-timer.

818
00:55:40.924 --> 00:55:42.824
That doesn't look good to their parents too.

819
00:55:44.293 --> 00:55:45.424
I promised anyway.

820
00:55:46.324 --> 00:55:48.563
I said I would buy you a house if you get married.

821
00:55:50.134 --> 00:55:51.264
The promise...

822
00:55:53.204 --> 00:55:54.974
It can't be just made by one person.

823
00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:58.974
What you did was more like a notification...

824
00:55:59.373 --> 00:56:01.174
or a delusion.

825
00:56:02.413 --> 00:56:04.443
I just want to buy a house for my married son.

826
00:56:04.713 --> 00:56:07.083
How can it be a notification or a delusion?

827
00:56:08.184 --> 00:56:09.284
Have we ever been in a...

828
00:56:10.324 --> 00:56:12.154
father-son relationship?

829
00:56:13.954 --> 00:56:16.924
I thought we were just a landlord and a tenant.

830
00:56:19.063 --> 00:56:20.864
You told me that 12 years ago.

831
00:56:21.764 --> 00:56:23.134
"Get out of my house."

832
00:56:24.163 --> 00:56:26.364
"Don't you ever step into my house again."

833
00:56:28.204 --> 00:56:30.344
Why do you think I bought the house?

834
00:56:32.474 --> 00:56:33.574
That's because...

835
00:56:35.174 --> 00:56:36.413
I'm your dad.

836
00:56:37.483 --> 00:56:38.713
You'll know when you become a dad.

837
00:56:39.014 --> 00:56:41.253
That was the only thing I could say as your parent.

838
00:56:41.384 --> 00:56:42.514
No, that wasn't.

839
00:56:43.384 --> 00:56:45.824
You were the landlord, not my parent.

840
00:56:46.523 --> 00:56:49.253
You said it was your house.

841
00:56:49.494 --> 00:56:50.724
You don't even think...

842
00:56:52.563 --> 00:56:53.764
I'm your father anymore, do you?

843
00:56:53.864 --> 00:56:55.463
Even though you are my father,

844
00:56:56.864 --> 00:57:00.034
if you just act like a landlord, I can only treat you like one.

845
00:57:03.034 --> 00:57:04.344
Did you eat well?

846
00:57:06.373 --> 00:57:08.443
Let's go.

847
00:57:09.043 --> 00:57:10.143
Take this with you.

848
00:57:11.043 --> 00:57:13.353
You are giving me a lot!

849
00:57:15.114 --> 00:57:16.784
We don't have anyone to eat this all.

850
00:57:17.724 --> 00:57:19.824
- Thank you so much. - Take care.

851
00:57:21.724 --> 00:57:22.793
Why...

852
00:57:24.364 --> 00:57:25.824
were you there?

853
00:57:27.663 --> 00:57:29.934
What do you mean?

854
00:57:31.304 --> 00:57:33.634
Your mother called me.

855
00:57:34.603 --> 00:57:37.174
You should have called me first.

856
00:57:39.244 --> 00:57:40.244
She said...

857
00:57:42.143 --> 00:57:44.244
I should be there at least...

858
00:57:44.844 --> 00:57:46.443
because you are busy.

859
00:57:47.753 --> 00:57:49.413
How could I call you?

860
00:57:49.913 --> 00:57:51.954
You should have made them think you couldn't go.

861
00:57:52.784 --> 00:57:54.393
You could have said you were busy.

862
00:57:56.864 --> 00:57:58.764
I thought you were a good defender.

863
00:58:06.563 --> 00:58:08.534
I thought I didn't have...

864
00:58:11.643 --> 00:58:13.614
Good Daughter-in-law Syndrome.

865
00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:17.943
I thought I wasn't going to be like those people.

866
00:58:18.983 --> 00:58:20.114
But...

867
00:58:22.114 --> 00:58:23.483
why did I do that...

868
00:58:25.954 --> 00:58:27.494
today?

869
00:58:45.143 --> 00:58:46.844
It's Good Daughter-in-law syndrome.

870
00:58:48.943 --> 00:58:50.184
Have you heard of that?

871
00:58:52.114 --> 00:58:53.284
Do you know about that?

872
00:58:53.514 --> 00:58:54.684
What?

873
00:58:55.213 --> 00:58:56.554
What syndrome?

874
00:58:58.054 --> 00:58:59.954
Married women tend to think...

875
00:59:01.594 --> 00:59:04.824
they should be nice and obedient...

876
00:59:06.494 --> 00:59:09.293
to their parents-in-law.

877
00:59:10.304 --> 00:59:11.603
That's what...

878
00:59:13.404 --> 00:59:14.904
they call it.

879
00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:17.543
Good...

880
00:59:19.143 --> 00:59:20.413
daughter-in-law syndrome.

881
00:59:22.543 --> 00:59:25.014
It's kind of a desire...

882
00:59:26.813 --> 00:59:29.614
for getting recognized.

883
00:59:30.623 --> 00:59:32.684
If you are fulfilled your lower level desires,

884
00:59:33.154 --> 00:59:35.693
that means you will want more things.

885
00:59:36.393 --> 00:59:39.023
You now have sense of belonging because of the marriage.

886
00:59:39.324 --> 00:59:42.333
Now, you want to be recognized.

887
00:59:42.693 --> 00:59:46.233
It's a natural process.

888
00:59:46.904 --> 00:59:49.804
Getting recognition from other people is...

889
00:59:50.244 --> 00:59:53.643
one of the basic animalistic desire as a human being.

890
00:59:55.213 --> 00:59:56.614
How can you...

891
00:59:59.184 --> 01:00:00.614
only think that way?

892
01:00:02.213 --> 01:00:03.253
What?

893
01:00:04.554 --> 01:00:07.554
It can't be just the animalistic desire as a human being.

894
01:00:10.924 --> 01:00:12.693
It can be also about caring.

895
01:00:15.563 --> 01:00:17.804
It's the family of the person I like.

896
01:00:19.804 --> 01:00:21.404
So I wanted to be nice.

897
01:00:24.043 --> 01:00:25.503
I wanted to make the person I like...

898
01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:30.443
happy and comfortable.

899
01:00:31.384 --> 01:00:32.483
That's what I care.

900
01:00:35.554 --> 01:00:37.924
Have you not thought...

901
01:00:41.253 --> 01:00:42.654
that could be the reason why?

902
01:00:49.094 --> 01:00:51.063
I will shower first tonight.

903
01:00:53.773 --> 01:00:54.804
Excuse me,

904
01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:58.503
Ji Ho.

905
01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:08.454
It wasn't in our contract,

906
01:01:10.724 --> 01:01:12.724
but this is the compensation for...

907
01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:15.994
your unfair labor tonight.

908
01:01:18.324 --> 01:01:19.663
I'm sorry...

909
01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:23.963
you had to go through that.

910
01:01:47.623 --> 01:01:49.454
I know I shouldn't think this way.

911
01:01:56.934 --> 01:01:58.634
I know...

912
01:02:00.304 --> 01:02:02.373
I'm not in his heart.

913
01:02:17.424 --> 01:02:18.724
I'm just...

914
01:02:19.684 --> 01:02:21.994
a trustable tenant who guarantees...

915
01:02:22.954 --> 01:02:26.324
a monthly rental fee.

916
01:02:29.594 --> 01:02:30.963
I'm just...

917
01:02:32.103 --> 01:02:34.574
an excellent defender...

918
01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:39.404
who helps him live a marriage-free life.

919
01:02:40.773 --> 01:02:43.443
Isn't she really pretty?

920
01:02:43.784 --> 01:02:47.753
Yes, she is. Imagine...

921
01:02:47.884 --> 01:02:49.713
how pretty she'll look to Se Hee.

922
01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:51.753
He got himself such a kind wife.

923
01:02:51.954 --> 01:02:53.293
I know.

924
01:02:54.753 --> 01:02:56.224
You must be really happy.

925
01:02:59.463 --> 01:03:01.094
What I meant by labor...

926
01:03:02.934 --> 01:03:04.603
wasn't this.

927
01:03:06.904 --> 01:03:08.204
My defense...

928
01:03:11.404 --> 01:03:13.344
isn't something like this.

929
01:03:27.753 --> 01:03:28.954
It's me.

930
01:03:29.853 --> 01:03:30.994
Yes.

931
01:03:31.293 --> 01:03:32.864
How did you calculate...

932
01:03:34.434 --> 01:03:36.264
what you've given me?

933
01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:39.833
Oh, is it not enough?

934
01:03:40.534 --> 01:03:44.474
I put in enough to cover your hourly wage and extra hours.

935
01:03:45.643 --> 01:03:46.773
Yes.

936
01:03:47.713 --> 01:03:49.983
It's not enough by much.

937
01:03:50.543 --> 01:03:52.384
Oh, I see.

938
01:03:52.943 --> 01:03:54.753
Then how much more...

939
01:03:54.853 --> 01:03:56.213
I don't want money.

940
01:03:57.154 --> 01:03:58.424
I want you to pay me with something else.

941
01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.554
Something else?

942
01:04:01.054 --> 01:04:04.663
Pay me back with your labor.

943
01:04:05.264 --> 01:04:06.364
Sorry?

944
01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.134
Pay me back with your labor...

945
01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:11.503
by working in my parents' place.

946
01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:15.904
We're making kimchi for the winter...

947
01:04:18.744 --> 01:04:20.014
this week.

948
01:04:24.184 --> 01:04:25.844
There's no more defending...

949
01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.514
in my life.

950
01:04:48.404 --> 01:04:51.273
I'm going to play as a forward...

951
01:04:57.313 --> 01:05:00.483
to protect my heart.

952
01:05:21.404 --> 01:05:25.043
(Because This Is My First Life)

953
01:05:25.244 --> 01:05:27.474
You only think about loans and cats.

954
01:05:27.474 --> 01:05:29.813
Why did you choose to do something so irrational?

955
01:05:29.813 --> 01:05:31.114
She's beautiful.

956
01:05:31.114 --> 01:05:33.184
I'd do that...

957
01:05:33.483 --> 01:05:34.614
if I can see the beautiful woman every day.

958
01:05:34.614 --> 01:05:36.014
You are in trouble, aren't you?

959
01:05:36.114 --> 01:05:37.954
I don't fight with her anymore.

960
01:05:38.054 --> 01:05:40.623
- If I do... - Things might never be the same.

961
01:05:41.324 --> 01:05:42.623
Who's coming?

962
01:05:43.293 --> 01:05:45.023
Hey, it's cold. Close the window.

963
01:05:45.393 --> 01:05:47.563
I'm going to start my labor right now.

964
01:05:48.663 --> 01:05:49.864
That's weird.

965
01:05:51.434 --> 01:05:54.003
I realized that there could be a room in my heart...

966
01:05:54.074 --> 01:05:56.034
through this marriage.

967
01:05:56.844 --> 01:05:58.503
Ji Ho!

968
01:06:00.213 --> 01:06:03.043
His heart came to me.
