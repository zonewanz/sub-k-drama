Corrections by Uncle Andy

3
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.160
I will try, yeobo.

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.480
I will try to change.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.480
Episode 6

6
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.180
Son of a dog. Kill you.

7
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.540
Oh.

8
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.880
Oh?

9
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.520
Son of a d...

10
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.720
Darling, you've come.
You said you would be late.

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.640
Yes.

12
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.440
That's right. Son of a d...

13
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.000
Thoughtlessly, we've stayed too long.

14
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.180
Look here!

15
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.880
Just a moment.

16
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.400
Chicken fight

17
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.760
Oh.

18
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.800
We've met before, haven't we?

19
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.020
What to do? I've unintentionally
caused you some trouble.

20
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.940
Then we will really now...

21
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.060
We'll go. We'll go.

22
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.960
Here. Unnie, unnie, here.

23
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.080
We had a little gathering of parents.

24
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.000
She's Seo Yeon's friend's mom.

25
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.540
You should be careful of who you
befriend. That kind of person...

26
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.060
You like these.

27
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.600
Unnie. We have to go to a second round.

28
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.780
Somewhere more fun than a hotel,
and without worrying about prying eyes.

29
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.120
Okay, okay. Sleep. Sleep.
You need some sleep.

30
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.300
And, Hee Soo has to make me some ramen.

31
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.780
Oh, Soo Gyum. We're going right now,
but her condition is...

32
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.400
Anyway, when I call you, come out.

33
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.000
I wonder if Mi Sook will be okay.

34
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.400
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.

35
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.920
Okay, let's say that
Director Lee's wife is fine

36
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.420
but the chicken fight woman,
who is that?

37
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.620
She's an ajumma I know from
a shop I go to occasionally,

38
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.900
but it turned out that she is
Seo Yeon's friend's mother.

39
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.660
Still, don't bring just anyone home.

40
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.100
Especially, when it's a time that
a lot of rumors could start,

41
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.530
we have to be careful.

42
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.960
Yes, I will do that.

43
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.920
It's a relief that father will be late.

44
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.040
Alcohol...

45
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.120
I did have something to tell you.

46
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.200
But, I think it would be
better to save it for later.

47
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.200
Are you okay?

48
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.800
I'm okay.

49
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.120
It's not that direction!

50
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.260
Huh?

51
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.140
I know. I know.

52
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.580
This way is my room.

53
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.620
Yes? Come in!

54
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.500
You called for me?

55
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.300
Yes. Come on in.

56
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.500
Teacher Hee Kyung seems to
be a person of many talents

57
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.780
but you're not letting them
show as much as they could.

58
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.540
Yes.

59
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.420
That your natural talents are
not shining is a regretful thing.

60
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.300
Why did you call me?

61
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.740
Yes? Yes.

62
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.820
Our Teacher Kim, do you make coffee?

63
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.660
Yes?

64
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.760
You know that Candidate Baek Young
Pyo is coming tomorrow, don't you?

65
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.380
Please help out. Present the flower bouquet.
And, make some delicious coffee for us.

66
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.720
Principal,
I'm a physical education teacher.

67
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.980
Yes, that's why.

68
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.940
If the the physical education teacher also
makes good coffee, that's even better.

69
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.260
Don't you think so?

70
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.640
No matter how true that might be...

71
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.000
Teacher Kim,
tomorrow is pay day, isn't it?

72
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.460
Shouldn't you pick up your first
paycheck doing your work properly?

73
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.580
Sweaty and dirty, continuously
until the day your contract ends.

74
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.811
Not too long ago, the contract teacher,
before she became a full time teacher

75
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:21.020
also did everything and anything
for the sake of the school.

76
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.320
That is an educator's dedication.

77
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.178
Our Teacher Kim as well,
don't worry about it being fitting

78
00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:30.420
or not fitting your role
and just do your best.

79
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.400
Okay, and tomorrow,
put on your best appearance.

80
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.960
If I had acted on how I felt,
I should have just sidekicked him!

81
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.900
Ha!

82
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.460
Don't.

83
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.540
I told you not to just going around
doing kicks anywhere, didn't I?

84
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.000
I was just stretching.

85
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.480
You're okay, right?

86
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.080
It was close.

87
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.500
Oh! Oh, you're our Hee Soo's savior?

88
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.380
It just happened that way.

89
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.960
Oh, yah, I should buy some
bread for you some time.

90
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.040
Do you want to go to the store?

91
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.040
I think we've already eaten that.

92
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.580
The kick.

93
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.180
Heor! You're my type. Oh, Lee Soo Gyum!

94
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.120
Hyung, I'll leave first. Noona.

95
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.940
Bye!

96
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.280
She's Hong Do ajumma's daughter,
for sure.

97
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.620
Here.

98
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.140
After the expressway went in, the
price of land has gone up tremendously.

99
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.320
Have you talked with that child?

100
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.800
Does it matter whether I do or not?

101
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.960
As soon as I've decided,
then it will be done.

102
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.980
Still, legally...

103
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.440
I am that child's guardian.

104
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.440
Oh, oh, oh! That, that, that even a
person like that could be a father.

105
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.280
Makjang. Makjang.

106
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.600
Whether in dramas or in real life, there
isn't anyone who is a proper human being.

107
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.000
Reality is more makjang.

108
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.020
At least in dramas,
the bad guys get their punishment.

109
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.900
Yeah. Since when did 'Encouraging good
and punishing evil' become a fantasy?

110
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.620
Should I take a day off tomorrow?

111
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.240
Why? What's wrong?
Did something happen again?

112
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.660
Pervert Hong?

113
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.320
No! No!

114
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.900
You're not just continuing
to pull grass are you?

115
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.680
As if! Whose daughter am I?

116
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.080
If they disturb one strand of my hair,
then I'll with my sidekick just...

117
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.480
If something else happens,
tell me immediately.

118
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.540
This time,
I'll just pull out all of his hair.

119
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.080
That's right.

120
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.160
As befitting Madam Hong's daughter,
from the front.

121
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.820
Oh, I can't watch this.
Turn to a different channel.

122
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.300
They say that there is a good
drama on these days on Wed-Thurs.

123
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.320
Wed-Thurs?

124
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.940
Yes, something with a revenge plot.

125
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.840
That starts at 9:30.
What time is it now?

126
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.640
Where's the remote control?

127
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.640
The remote? It's gone.
Just go and turn the channel.

128
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.560
Noona,
are you going to take much longer?

129
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.500
Go first!
I still have a lot to get ready.

130
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.020
Then I'll go ahead and go.

131
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.800
I'll be back later.

132
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.220
Bye.

133
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.720
Yes, today's style,
I'll pay extra attention to it.

134
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.920
Mom, I'm going!

135
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:38.980
Oh, okay.

136
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.200
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah!

137
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.280
Are you sure you're going to school?!

138
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.100
Yes, it's the dress code.

139
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.740
Oh. Who does she resemble that she...

140
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.460
Do you have to go to Seo Yeon's school?

141
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.060
Is there a reason that I can't go?

142
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.031
It's because it's
uncomfortable for Seo Yoon.

143
00:10:00.231 --> 00:10:02.080
Perhaps you could discuss
it with her first...

144
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.960
It's because you're so nervous like this
that the child is going anyway she wants.

145
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.980
As much as your success, this is an
important time for Seo Yeon as well.

146
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.260
I'm not doing this just so
I can do well for myself.

147
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.680
I have to do well in order for
you and Seo Yeon to do well.

148
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.920
Isn't that so?

149
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.680
Ah! Thank you.

150
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.960
Why isn't she here yet?

151
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.880
Ah. I had to take my contact
lenses so I couldn't see very well.

152
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.800
Teacher Kim,
I asked to take special care.

153
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.200
Oh, I just finished class and
I was in a rush to get here.

154
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.380
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.180
Oh, this is what I have to
present to him, isn't it?

156
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.120
No, that's fine.

157
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.300
Go inside!

158
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.140
Hurry and go. Go!

159
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.420
Aigoo. Our Candidate Baek. Thank you.

160
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.100
Thank you.

161
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.300
Oh, you are giving these
to me directly yourself?

162
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.240
Thank you. You've all worked very hard.

163
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.311
The candidate for the Superintendent
of Education wanted

164
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:46.700
to come here to directly hear the
voices of the students himself.

165
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.740
Even though he's so busy, he's using
his precious time to come see us.

166
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.360
For our Candidate Baek Young Pyo,
a big round of applause.

167
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.060
Hello. Nice to meet you!

168
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.700
I'm Baek Young Pyo.

169
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.120
Student Seo Yeon.
Please come to the front!

170
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.700
What kind of a father
our Candidate Baek is,

171
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.500
would Student Baek Seo Yeon
like to brag about him?

172
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.840
Ask him directly!

173
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.300
Since we're seeing each other at school,
she must be a little embarrassed,

174
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.120
though she's not like that at home.

175
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.880
Of course. She's at that age.

176
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.900
Okay then, students,

177
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.900
will you one at a time comfortably
tell me what your concerns are?

178
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.420
She's at that sensitive time.

179
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.020
Even I can't disturb the female
students too much these days.

180
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.630
No matter how much she's
going through puberty,

181
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.160
she should have a sense
of appropriateness.

182
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.480
It's because her mother lets her get away
with too much, so that the child is...

183
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.020
Yes, come in!

184
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.800
This is Director Lee's son.
I called him in to introduce him to you.

185
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.700
Oh.

186
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.740
Make your greetings!

187
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.360
This is Candidate Baek Young Pyo,
Student Seo Yeon's father.

188
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.640
Hello. My name is Lee Soo Gyum.

189
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.240
Yes. You resemble your father a lot.

190
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.080
I've been taking particular care of him.

191
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.660
And, I also told him to get
along well with Seo Yeon.

192
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.140
Yes. Please take care
of my Seo Yeon well.

193
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.940
Yes. I will.

194
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.620
Then...

195
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.580
Okay, you can go. Study hard!

196
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.560
And, my office is always open to you.

197
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.325
So, if there is any help
that I can give you,

198
00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:51.200
don't make it hard on yourself,
just come find me.

199
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.040
Yes.

200
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.720
Director Lee has told you, hasn't he? That
he'll give the merchandise to you soon?

201
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.780
Yes, I've heard from him.

202
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.460
Nonhyeon-dong, shall we meet there?

203
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.860
That would probably be best.

204
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.200
This day is really funny.

205
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.260
Mi Sook must not be able to come out.

206
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.320
For the time being,
she probably has to be careful.

207
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.200
Did you do some review at home?

208
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.080
Review?

209
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.760
Son of...

210
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:23.980
What?

211
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.880
This son of...

212
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.400
This son of...

213
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.160
We had some fresh ones come out.

214
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.200
This bullshit

215
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.250
Ooh, with some emotion even...
you have a talent.

216
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.220
Only one cup today?

217
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.400
Has our Madam become tired of the
vending machine coffee already?

218
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.400
Why doesn't it taste good today?

219
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.080
Have you not recovered
from your hangover yet?

220
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.280
Today, do you want to go
and completely recover?

221
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.320
For recovering from a hangover,
a sauna is the best.

222
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.280
Let's go in.

223
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.760
That looks good on you.

224
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.780
Then shall we go take a
look around the place?

225
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.140
Since you shouldn't lose this.

226
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.440
No... sit, sit, sit, sit.

227
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.180
Like this.

228
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.700
Okay.

229
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.040
Finished.

230
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.400
Let's go!

231
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.200
Let's go.

232
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.180
Hee Soo!

233
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.000
Yah, noona got her first paycheck today.

234
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.420
Come on out so that we
can eat dinner with mom.

235
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.120
Where?

236
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.420
Ow. They're totally stuck to me.

237
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.440
Why? Are your legs too long,
so it isn't comfortable?

238
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.260
Stretch them out.
Comfortably. Comfortably.

239
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.900
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.

240
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.020
Let's lie down together.

241
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.240
Lie down. Lie down.

242
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.300
It's so nice.

243
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.460
So nice that I almost want to take
the floor apart and take it with me.

244
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.960
It's comfy, isn't it?

245
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.020
Comfy.

246
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.900
Since we're like this,
it really feels as if we're one family.

247
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.940
As if even if we were together,
we wouldn't look strange.

248
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.280
Did we look that strange?

249
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.760
Truthfully, it was kind of strange.

250
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.960
You two people and I are not
exactly from the same clay.

251
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.700
I like the sauna a lot.

252
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.060
Should I put one in the house?

253
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.400
Which brand would be good?

254
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.420
Who made this?

255
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.260
Whose is this?

256
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.740
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.

257
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.260
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.

258
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.400
Okay, I love you. I love you.

259
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.260
Here.

260
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.480
Let's do everything that others do!

261
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.380
However,
do you even know how to peel an egg?

262
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.040
Even I know that much.

263
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.660
Ttok-ttok

264
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.520
In a sauna, this is the right way.

265
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.520
Hee Kyung!

266
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.480
Oh, what are you doing?

267
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.140
Huh?

268
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.200
I'm a little sad.
Mom's sauna partner is me.

269
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.020
Mom's friend.

270
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.440
Friend?

271
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.240
You saw her last time, right?
Make your greeting.

272
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.420
Hello.

273
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.540
Me, too!

274
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.000
However, how did you come here?

275
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.000
Ah, I got my first paycheck today!

276
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.060
Ohhhhhh, you've worked hard,
my daughter.

277
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.060
It's already been a month. You got
your first paycheck, my daughter.

278
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.140
Please choose anything!

279
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.580
My daughter's money, it's so precious,
how can I eat anything?

280
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.680
Is it okay if I order a lot?

281
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.400
For a paycheck meal,
isn't it too meager?

282
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.520
If it's white rice and eggs,
then that's plentiful.

283
00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.820
I'll eat well.

284
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.840
Did I do something wrong?

285
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.460
You're Hong Do unnie's daughter.

286
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.340
Did mom do something wrong?

287
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.880
Can I peel one more?

288
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.900
I hit my forehead.

289
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.740
Oh, did it hurt?

290
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.680
So, that is, the merchandise...

291
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.860
It's a bribe. I'm certain of it.

292
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.780
Lee Byung Soo is
supporting Candidate Baek.

293
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.300
Still, that doesn't mean that's proof.

294
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.920
Let's check the location.

295
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.400
Yes.

296
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.660
But where is it?

297
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.900
Nonhyeon-dong, there?

298
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.780
Wouldn't it be a regular place for them?

299
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.640
It seems as if it's some place they
go to often. Do you not know of it?

300
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.520
There are a few places.

301
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.060
Find out!

302
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:07.840
Where?

303
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.640
Yes, I understand.

304
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.920
They say it's not this place either.

305
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.900
If we tried ten places
and none of them are it...

306
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.000
What if we arrange for the location?

307
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.080
Hm?

308
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.640
So that we don't need to go
looking for it, we bring them.

309
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.180
To the house.

310
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.760
Surely not, our house?

311
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.660
Of course.

312
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.180
Oh, that's a good idea!

313
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.780
So, you're saying, we'll set it up.

314
00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.380
Won't that be dangerous?

315
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.200
And, how do we get them
to change the location?

316
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.160
That.

317
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.620
Madam will...

318
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.840
Huh?

319
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.620
Yes, yes.

320
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.200
Just say that you want to support them,
so invite them to the house.

321
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.820
Okay. Let's try it anyway.

322
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.680
Though,
I don't know if they will believe me.

323
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.220
It seems the stakes are
slowly getting bigger.

324
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.120
With that in mind,
I have something to tell you.

325
00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:11.860
To a uselessly likable grandson,
grandfather will tell you an amusing story.

326
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.880
I originally wanted to be an educator.

327
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.280
But, I learned too early
to have fun making money.

328
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.320
In order to try to fulfill
their father's dream,

329
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.123
the older son claims he wants
to build a school so he's involved

330
00:21:28.323 --> 00:21:30.140
in a Superintendent
of Education election.

331
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:35.380
The younger son wants
to set up a foundation.

332
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.760
However

333
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.820
who do you think will fulfill my dream?

334
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:44.920
Or

335
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.580
do you want to do it?

336
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.752
There is a reason that
father is obsessed

337
00:21:49.952 --> 00:21:52.410
with the election of Mi
Sook ajumma's husband.

338
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.160
It's for the choice of the successor,
right?

339
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.740
Then how about the
bastard Hong Sang Man?

340
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.130
Wouldn't he have been
promised a position?

341
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:07.560
So, if he is elected, it would
help Jung Hye's husband's business?

342
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.830
Or the contrary, if he fails,
my father becomes disadvantaged.

343
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.310
This election

344
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.380
of the Superintendent of
Education may be the chance

345
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.700
to get both of them
properly at the same time.

346
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.230
Will it be ok, Mi Sook?

347
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.880
It will hit your husband first.

348
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.190
That's why we started this.
I hope our revenge succeeds

349
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.000
and Mi Sook unnie has
no more hard times.

350
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.460
It would be good if we can
beat all the bad guys at once.

351
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.560
Hello?

352
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.500
Did you call me to confirm it?

353
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.740
Your dad says that he
can do as he pleases,

354
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.740
but that's yours.

355
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.400
I don't think it's fun to steal
someone else's things away.

356
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.570
I will definitely not
touch the land that

357
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.320
grandmother and grandfather left for me.

358
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.080
I thought that would be the case.

359
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.150
Thank you for informing me.
No need.

360
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.500
Since it's just that I didn't
want to waste any effort.

361
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.150
Then...

362
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.550
You're not able to trust in your father,
are you?

363
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.490
Still, thanks to you,
he was able to raise his stature.

364
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.330
Since actually, the designated heir

365
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.170
was determined to be your uncle.

366
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.760
I'm not curious about it.

367
00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:49.880
You're quite amusing.

368
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.440
However, now, you're going to
have develop some interest.

369
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.800
Who are the people who can help you,
think about that carefully.

370
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.140
This is a little too much,

371
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.140
but even if you don't want to,

372
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.780
I think we'll see each other frequently
in the future. You can go now.

373
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:14.830
So.

374
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.610
what do you think of my grandson?

375
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.460
He is worthy of the
Chairman's desire to have him.

376
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.750
You're thinking of him after
your second son, aren't you?

377
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.460
There is no need to rush.

378
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.460
Since I don't even know who is after me.

379
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.280
Okay.

380
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.120
The Chairman

381
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.250
probably doesn't want you
to be close to your father.

382
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.120
Since that person is working
closely with my uncle.

383
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.917
Yes, that's probably why you were needed.

384
00:24:58.117 --> 00:25:00.110
There are a legion of
people checking me out,

385
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.400
all looking to see how to
make the best use of me.

386
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.280
I also wanted to pull you in.

387
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.500
When you first said that
you wanted to join the club.

388
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.370
However, the unnies were opposed,

389
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.360
saying that if we did, then like your
blood relatives, we were just using you.

390
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.170
I totally like it.

391
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.500
With good spirits,
I've allowed myself to be used by you.

392
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.640
Thinking about it now,

393
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.520
I wonder if I should have
listened to the unnies.

394
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.730
It's okay,

395
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.780
since I chose...

396
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.780
to be used by you.

397
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.480
<i>President Kim Jung Yun met
with your son Soo Gyum...</i>

398
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:41.710
What?

399
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.450
Okay.

400
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.240
Yah, since you came in together,
it looks good.

401
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.160
We met outside.
Father,

402
00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.810
I met President Kim Jung Yun and
figured out the issue about my land.

403
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.480
Figured out?

404
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.770
I told her explicitly that I have
no interest in selling the land,

405
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.770
and she has accepted that.

406
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.160
I never agreed to sell it.

407
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.060
But, that would have been a good thing
for you. It would be for your own good.

408
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.060
It would probably be for your good.

409
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.730
What?

410
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.250
Go ahead and go up first.

411
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.680
I'm not done talking.
I'll go up first.

412
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.290
In the future, whoever you meet,
you have to report it to me.

413
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.360
You really seem like a proper mom.

414
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.720
Even knowing to protect the child.

415
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.880
I had wanted to ask you at least once.

416
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.440
Did you really only have that reason?

417
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:49.350
About what?

418
00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.660
The reason that you
brought your son here.

419
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.400
Well, then why else would I have
brought him here? Without any point?

420
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.560
Though, I didn't realize that he would
go around doing foolish things like this.

421
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.190
Are you that lacking in self-confidence?

422
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.210
So that you have to use
even your son's inheritance?

423
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.360
Do you even know
anything about business?

424
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.150
Anyway, since when do you have
interest in things like this?

425
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.950
I may not have any interest,

426
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.300
but that you want to look good in
front of President Kim Jung Yun

427
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.800
and that you're competing against
your brother, even I know that much.

428
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.960
Using your son.
Am I doing this for myself?

429
00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.975
It's all for the sake of the child.

430
00:27:27.175 --> 00:27:29.210
It is probably for your
chances of being heir.

431
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.150
Oh, why is she so late?

432
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.920
<i>You call is not connected.
It will switched to the voice mail...</i>

433
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:55.920
<i>Seo Yeon,</i>

434
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.140
<i>are you coming home?</i>

435
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.720
<i>Please call me.</i>

436
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.740
Is that you, Seo Yeon?

437
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.820
Oh my queen of support.

438
00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.820
Wash and go to bed quickly.

439
00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.550
You get zero points for child education.

440
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:25.000
Do you know what humiliation I
suffered in Seo Yeon's school?

441
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.200
Did something happen?
It did.

442
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.200
Hey Baek Seo Yeon.

443
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.000
Come out here.

444
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.240
Seo Yeon hasn't come home yet.

445
00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.550
That bastard,
does she know what time it is?!

446
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.040
After dragging her
father through the mud!

447
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.690
When she comes, I'll tell her well.

448
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.910
That little...!

449
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.990
Baek Seo Yeon, you come here.

450
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.800
You bastard, how dare you be so rude?

451
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.110
Why? You will hit me too?

452
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.710
If it makes you sane.
Honey!

453
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.000
You won't come out here?

454
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.840
Come out!

455
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.870
Come out!

456
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.870
Come out!

457
00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.450
Seo Yeon. It's okay.
Open the door!

458
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.840
Mom will take care of it.

459
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.410
Open the door! Open the door!

460
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.410
Open the door!

461
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.080
Open the door! Open the door!

462
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.080
Open it in the count of three.

463
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.820
One..

464
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.760
two..

465
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.520
Baek Seo Yeon open the door!

466
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:06.600
Hey!

467
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.640
Open the door!

468
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:22.010
Try it. So that all the
neighbors can hear it and see it.

469
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.010
Are you crazy?

470
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.870
I told you I wouldn't
stand for it anymore.

471
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.580
If you don't change,
I don't know what I will do.

472
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.150
I'll tell everyone everything,
all that you had done.

473
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.420
This aw..
So!

474
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.110
Stop it.

475
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:53.740
Baek Young Pyo!

476
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.130
Baek Young Pyo!

477
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.500
Is your business doing well?

478
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.500
Aigoo..

479
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.130
How are you?

480
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.090
Ay I want to eat too.

481
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.580
Aigoo. Hello.

482
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.550
Please sell a lot.

483
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.680
Aigoo.

484
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.520
Aigoo.

485
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.910
So we meet again, Seo Yeon's father.

486
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:28.910
Ahh yes.

487
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.380
Should I be calling you Mr. Candidate now?
- Ai well...

488
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.440
Please manage our
country's education well.

489
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.560
Yes yes..

490
00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.420
Mr. Candidate, let's move.
Yes Yes.

491
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.800
You're working hard.

492
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.990
Thank you for your effort.

493
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.370
Mr. Candidate,

494
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.880
Education has to be proper...

495
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.570
so that malicious personalities who
bully their friends won't appear!

496
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:11.900
Eh.

497
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.280
Aigoo.. What's wrong with this world?

498
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.780
This one?

499
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.060
What do I do when I don't have this?

500
00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.970
Hey be quiet.

501
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.940
I'm going out soon!

502
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.860
He used to turn up the TV volume loudly.

503
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.390
Hah..

504
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.410
Uhm..

505
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:47.690
[Soo Gyum's dad]

506
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.770
<i>Your call is not connected,
it will be switched to the voice mail.</i>

507
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.760
If you act like this to me

508
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.520
then I have choice but
to find another supplier.

509
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.710
Uhm..

510
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.370
Uhm..

511
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.450
Hello. I'm Soo Gyum's mom.

512
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.550
Shall we meet?

513
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.320
Who was it that made
your face have that look?

514
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.130
I d<i>on't know why, of all people,
that kind of person gave birth to me.</i>

515
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.390
I f<i>eel like it was much
better when I didn't know.</i>

516
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.840
Hello, Kim Jung Hye-ssi.

517
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.520
Since leaving my child with you,
my greeting has been delayed.

518
00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.500
Why did you want me to see?

519
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:51.720
You're more abrupt than I thought.

520
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.170
Since you answered my call,

521
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:58.170
you also...

522
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.310
must have reason to see me?

523
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.320
I don't have any reason to see you.

524
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.780
Then why did you come here?

525
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.360
I thought I should
see you at least once.

526
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.120
So you had a reason.

527
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.670
So, how do you feel having seen me?

528
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.670
If we have nothing to talk about,
let's stand up.

529
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:22.670
I...

530
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.660
I am concerned about my son's future...

531
00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.720
so my Soo Gyum will
be your family's heir.

532
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.780
Well, Byung Soo-ssi or your
father-in-law will think the same.

533
00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.450
And you will want the same too.

534
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.730
Since Byung Soo has to become the heir

535
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.450
for it to be good for you.

536
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.680
So?
I heard...

537
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.140
You were infertile.

538
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.680
If I had not had my son,

539
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.690
If I had not sent him to your home,

540
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:00.620
Would you...

541
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.600
have been able to keep your position?

542
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.850
What do you want?

543
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.380
An appropriate payment?

544
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.040
So...

545
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.140
it's money after all.
There is no other way to...

546
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.280
reward besides money, isn't that so?

547
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.090
Do you think you deserve it?
Of course. There's no reason I don't...

548
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.270
If you really don't want to
reward me I have another choice...

549
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.235
"Geon Ha Group's son-in-law

550
00:36:33.435 --> 00:36:35.390
has a mistress like me."

551
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.680
Oh, that would be so much fun!
Should I meet with reporters?

552
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.670
Or should I post directly to internet?

553
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.090
Just do it.

554
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.240
It's been many days since a
19-year-old illegitimate son

555
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.960
came to Hae Rang Construction's
first son's house.

556
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.810
If it was to going to reported,
it already would have been.

557
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.230
Why do you think it has been quiet?

558
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.860
What do you mean?

559
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.860
Do you think my family, Geon Ha Group

560
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.120
wants to admit knowing that I'm
raising an illegitimate child?

561
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:10.220
What you're disturbing
is not just one person.

562
00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.760
Then,

563
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.750
How about this?
Whatever it is,

564
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.490
both you and Lee Byung Soo
have no right to be parents.

565
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.450
I gave birth to Soo Gyum. He is my son.

566
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.400
No one can deny that.
No.

567
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.050
I deny it.

568
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.340
Omo Son. How did you know I'm here?
Sit down here.

569
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:43.870
Hey..

570
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.370
Hey..

571
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.000
I will deal with it...

572
00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.200
Mother.

573
00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.330
I'm okay.

574
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.990
Hey there, Kim Jung Hye-ssi, I'm not yet...
Sit down.

575
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.040
Hey, I'm...
I said sit down.

576
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.040
Ajumma!

577
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.350
Aw that's Omo Hey!

578
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.010
Hey, you don't know what that's worth!
Then how much am I worth?

579
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.100
What?

580
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.000
Was the reward you received
from father not enough?

581
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.395
How much more do you want to grab,
that you appear again so shamelessly?

582
00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:49.790
Hey! Such a tiny amount of money is
far from enough to shut my mouth.

583
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.860
Do you know how much I suffered
when I had you in my youth?

584
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.640
I still feel pain in my waist.
Stop being noisy.

585
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.920
Let's never see each other again.

586
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.600
Son, why are you so harsh to your mom.

587
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.940
Where on earth is my mom?
Here I am, here.

588
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.330
My mom died...

589
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.230
when you abandoned me.

590
00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.990
Hey,

591
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.720
let's speak properly, huh? Did I abandon
you on the street or at an orphange?

592
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.180
I just left you to my
mom and dad for a while.

593
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Right. For a while.

594
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.690
For 18 years. And speak properly.

595
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.360
If you're a real mom,
then you shouldn't be acting like this.

596
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.545
Being an illegitimate child wasn't enough,

597
00:39:33.745 --> 00:39:35.930
you shouldn't try to make me
into a mistress' son.

598
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.480
You shouldn't have sold your child.

599
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.000
You're never lost for words. So?
Are you taking revenge on me?

600
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.640
Revenge?

601
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.280
Is it?

602
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.380
Do you know how hard I've lived so far?

603
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.220
How would I know?
You've never given me a chance to know.

604
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.020
I should not...

605
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.800
have given birth to something like you.

606
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:05.800
Aigoo.

607
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.240
Why did you come here?

608
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.340
I met with that woman.

609
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.720
Ah, just ignore her.

610
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.080
I won't bother you,
I'll handle it myself.

611
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:32.000
No.

612
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.680
I think the meeting was necessary.

613
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.810
Perhaps it has helped
me realize what to do.

614
00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.400
And what our family needs.

615
00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.480
Yes, that's right.

616
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.250
Although...

617
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:45.530
At the start...

618
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.590
We didn't get along
well with each other...

619
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.550
The three of us should make
more of an effort together.

620
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.950
Alright.

621
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.010
The three of us.

622
00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.310
Then...

623
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.020
Including Soo Gyum?

624
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:03.370
I will try my best.

625
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.130
After all, you and I...

626
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.430
Need that kid.

627
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.870
Yes!

628
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.580
I knew you will stand by my side!

629
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.750
We're family after all.

630
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.980
Yes, yes, yes.

631
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.520
Yes, he's lonely and suffering, too.

632
00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.350
Please take care of him.

633
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:19.370
Okay.

634
00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.760
But don't put high hopes on me.

635
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.490
Actually,

636
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.930
I have complex emotions about it.

637
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.700
But, you're the only person
who's standing with me.

638
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.970
So, I'll help you.

639
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.610
Aigoo...

640
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.280
Aigoo, thank you!

641
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.260
I'm so thankful!

642
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:38.780
But, help where?

643
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.460
Aren't you...

644
00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.870
Struggling to help candidate Baek be
elected as the Superintendent of Education?

645
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.690
I'll help, too.

646
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.000
Really?

647
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.290
Once he becomes
the Superintendent of Education,

648
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.640
Father-in-law will acknowledge you,
right?

649
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.310
But of course!

650
00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:54.880
Ah, that's right!

651
00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:57.710
Aigoo! Really!

652
00:42:35.688 --> 00:42:36.408
Ah... this...

653
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.168
What the...

654
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.790
Aigoo, I...

655
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:44.760
It seems you've forgotten.

656
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.110
I'm just 19 years old.

657
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.300
Seeing such a picture... I shouldn't
be delivering such a picture to you.

658
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.400
This is not how any
parent or adult should act.

659
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.160
Yah, things like this...
You should've told me beforehand.

660
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.880
Then I wouldn't have let you
see that woman.

661
00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.460
My real mom is "that woman."

662
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.000
Stepmom is "Madam."

663
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.930
Father,

664
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.940
You can't give me a mother, can you?

665
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.430
Yah.

666
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.380
Don't you worry.

667
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.400
I have...

668
00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.940
Discussed this with your mother.

669
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.360
Your mother said...

670
00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.645
That us three are a family...

671
00:43:18.845 --> 00:43:20.900
So we should get along well.

672
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:22.600
Now, really...

673
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.430
We're a real family.

674
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.980
Okay?

675
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.240
All this time,

676
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.340
You've worked hard.

677
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:28.750
In the future...

678
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:29.840
Let's work together.

679
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.410
Good.

680
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:38.830
Finally, it's D-Day.

681
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.710
We can do it, right?

682
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.460
The arrangement and plan has been set.

683
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.210
All good.

684
00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.830
Now, those people...

685
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.330
Are like rats inside a trap.

686
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.390
That's right.

687
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.990
This time...

688
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.430
Let's catch those rats.

689
00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:55.790
Avengers Social Club...

690
00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.420
Avengers Social Club...

691
00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.220
Fighting!
Fighting!

692
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.520
Have you ever served as a hostess?

693
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:02.320
Nope.

694
00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:04.590
Mi Sook, you have to help her.

695
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.660
Ah, alright.

696
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.210
Jung Hye,

697
00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.500
Since we're pretending
to help our husbands,

698
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.210
We can't act close like we usually do.

699
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.240
So, I should have to act like you,
right Unnie?

700
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.240
Yes, that's right, right.

701
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:15.310
Let's practice.

702
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:16.720
Set up the table.

703
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.040
Then...

704
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:29.040
What should you say after serving food?

705
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.140
Do I need to say something?

706
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.340
"Although I haven't prepared much,
please enjoy the food."

707
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.650
Are we going to prepare
only a few dishes?

708
00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.290
Just copy what she said.

709
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.070
Please...

710
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.800
Please enjoy the food.

711
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.110
Please enjoy the food.

712
00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.520
Be more sincere. Smile when you say it.

713
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.000
Please enjoy the food.

714
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.080
Alright, alright... That's good, good.

715
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.850
I should leave the house naturally,
right?

716
00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.010
Yeobo!

717
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.120
They're here.

718
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.280
Hello, how are you?

719
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.380
Hello, welcome to our house.

720
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.690
Aigoo, thank you for inviting us.

721
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.900
It's a little gift my wife made.

722
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.060
Aigoo, I've heard so much about
Mrs. Baek's flower arranging skills.

723
00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.000
As expected...

724
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:21.770
Thank you so much.

725
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:23.930
Hello, nice to meet you.

726
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.120
I'm Lee Soo Gyum.

727
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.540
Aigoo, we meet again.

728
00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.500
Is he your son?

729
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.090
Yes.

730
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.130
He's our son.

731
00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.450
Don't we look alike?

732
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.560
Total carbon copies of each other.

733
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.280
Indeed.

734
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.630
But, Soo Gyum...

735
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.830
Where are you going?

736
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.920
To the library...

737
00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.120
Since I'm already a senior...

738
00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.440
Aigoo,
it must be tiring to constantly study.

739
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.930
Excuse me.

740
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:48.480
Well, study hard.

741
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.610
Sunbae, please come in.

742
00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.910
Yes. Ah, your house is nice.

743
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:54.570
Aigoo...

744
00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.660
Principal Hong isn't here yet?

745
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:58.800
Not yet, but he said he'll arrive soon.

746
00:45:58.890 --> 00:45:59.290
Aigoo...

747
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.280
Aigoo...

748
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.480
This house is not bad.

749
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.360
It's nice.

750
00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.360
Hello, sir.

751
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:12.160
Oh.

752
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.120
Soo Gyum.

753
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.105
They're waiting for you inside.

754
00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:16.910
As expected, what a gentle kid.

755
00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:25.160
I'm here. Here!

756
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:39.595
What an extraordinarily sweet smell!

757
00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:41.120
I've been starving since this morning.

758
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.960
Principal Hong, please sit here.

759
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.950
Our Superintendent of Education,
please sit here.

760
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.280
Ah, this crazy...

761
00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:51.550
Ah,
my wife said she wants to cook for us.

762
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.710
Hopefully, it's delicious.

763
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.840
Did you cook all by yourself?

764
00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.180
I am honored, Madam.

765
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.950
Ah, no...

766
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.120
Sister-in-law...

767
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.220
Yah, I...

768
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.440
Never thought that I'd eat
dishes made by Jung Hye.

769
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.290
Yes.

770
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.380
I also never thought that I'd have
the chance to cook for Principal Hong.

771
00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:10.920
I thought you two...

772
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.880
Only compete in beauty,
but as it turns out...

773
00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.440
You also compete in the
standards of being a good wife.

774
00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:15.720
Aigoo!

775
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.640
How can Jung Hye compare with Mrs. Baek?

776
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.430
Aigoo, I can do some house chores,
that's all.

777
00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.980
You are welcome here anytime.

778
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.680
You three...

779
00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.110
Can talk comfortably,

780
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.760
While I prepare the food.

781
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.100
Ah,
how nice to have sister-in-law's help.

782
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.000
We need to be cautious during election
period, so I invited you all to come here.

783
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:34.810
Next time...

784
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.730
I'll invite you to a better place.

785
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.200
Thank you.

786
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.240
Ah, what...

787
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.540
Hong Do Seafood!

788
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.660
Ah, you startled me! Let's go!

789
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.280
Window, open the window.

790
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:52.650
Turn it off, turn it off!

791
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.000
Next.

792
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.240
Go to the back.

793
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:13.080
Who's going to record?

794
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:14.510
I will.

795
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.320
Change!

796
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.320
I will keep a lookout, you can rest.

797
00:49:29.144 --> 00:49:29.928
Aigoo...

798
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.360
By this time,

799
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.310
They should be eating, right?

800
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:55.770
Delicious, isn't it?

801
00:49:56.088 --> 00:49:56.376
Uh.

802
00:50:58.325 --> 00:50:58.981
Delicious!

803
00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.440
Me, too. Me, too.

804
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.220
Hmm...

805
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.640
Okay, set aside the food for us.

806
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.540
Let's start.

807
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

808
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.600
Oh... vinegar.

809
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.660
It's quite pretty.

810
00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.540
Won't it be too obvious?

811
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:43.970
Taste it.

812
00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:45.400
No, thanks.

813
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.500
Unnie?

814
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.460
Here. Ah.

815
00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.710
Is it too much?

816
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:59.880
Just a bit.

817
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.080
- He says it's too much.
- Just a little.

818
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.280
What's wrong?

819
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.480
Does it not suit your taste?

820
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.480
No, that's not it.

821
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.420
Because it's food with
so much sincerity...

822
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.560
Please don't force yourself to finish.

823
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.360
No, that's okay.

824
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.460
It has a certain flavor.

825
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.380
Yes.

826
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:43.120
Jung Hye was bragging that the Director
always praises her for doing so well.

827
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.780
Ah. Yes.

828
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:52.140
Your cooking today was very amazing.

829
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.600
Thank you.

830
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.660
Is your stomach okay?

831
00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.900
In the future, it would be best
if sister-in-law didn't cook.

832
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.700
I know but she insisted
she wanted to do it.

833
00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.860
That's right.

834
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.560
It would have been good to
meet outside as we had planned.

835
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.220
And, we can't even go to a second round.

836
00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.120
What could I do?

837
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.680
She really wanted to
do something for us.

838
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.800
I really thought I was dying.

839
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.780
Is your stomach still not feeling well?

840
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.960
My apologies. My apologies.

841
00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:03.360
Put it in his car so that he
won't have to concern himself.

842
00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:08.560
Lee Byung Soo, you have a subtle touch.

843
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.560
Thank you. I will receive it well.

844
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.560
That's very least I could do.

845
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.500
The ladies should please join us.

846
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.700
Please speak comfortably by yourselves.

847
00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:21.700
We are drinking tea separately.

848
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.520
I think something was given.

849
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.890
A bribe?

850
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:28.260
I'm certain.

851
00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.260
To avoid any concern,
he said to place it in the car.

852
00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.620
Then it's really true.

853
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.225
They're coming out.

854
00:54:49.425 --> 00:54:51.650
Coming out soon.

855
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:54.250
It's about time for them to come out.

856
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.300
Start recording.

857
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:51.900
Is he gone?

858
00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:56.600
He's gone.

859
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:59.000
Oh, my nerves.

860
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.350
Did the recording go well?

861
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:04.350
Daebak!

862
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:17.300
Your head, your head.
Watch your head. Get home safely.

863
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.500
I ate well.

864
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.500
Mi Sook, have a safe drive home.

865
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.150
Have a good night.

866
00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.550
Ahh... Jung Hye, tonight...

867
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:38.300
I mean, sister-in-law,
your effort was the best.

868
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.700
As long as you don't cook. Don't cook.

869
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.700
Get him home safely!

870
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:31.450
Omo. Don't be like that.
It's making me more anxious.

871
00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:34.700
Yeobo, get up. We're here.

872
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:40.250
Be careful.

873
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.800
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

874
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
I'm so nervous.

875
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.800
We're taking a huge step. Right?

876
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.250
Yes.

877
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:13.300
I'm ready.

878
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.500
Business draft? Personal checks?

879
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.850
What is it?

880
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:34.000
It says to take two pills a day.

881
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:43.150
Is this what's called
a pointless effort?

882
01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.750
That's how it seems.

883
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.000
Plan B is necessary.

884
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:09.800
The ladies should join us.

885
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.850
Please converse comfortably by
yourselves. We're drinking tea separately.

886
01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:24.900
Truly? There was nothing there?

887
01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:29.650
Really?

888
01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:33.500
Really,
there was nothing but the medicine.

889
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.350
Why did the driver
ajusshi behave like that?

890
01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:39.150
I agree.

891
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:41.700
I thought several hundred thousand
dollars were exchanging hands.

892
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.200
Still we worked well together today.

893
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.300
Yes, more and more,
we are able to fit together well.

894
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.150
Yeobo...

895
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:06.250
give me some water.

896
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:10.250
Did you do some review at home?

897
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:10.850
Review?

898
01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:12.475
This son of a...

899
01:03:12.675 --> 01:03:13.900
This bullshit.

900
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.900
The sauna is too nice.

901
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.950
Should I install one in the house?
What brand is good? Whose is this?

902
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.200
Enjoy your meal.

903
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400
More pleasantly. Smiling.

904
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.400
Enjoy your meal.

905
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:29.950
Three... four...

906
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.700
Oh!

907
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.300
It looks edible.

908
01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.650
Here.
