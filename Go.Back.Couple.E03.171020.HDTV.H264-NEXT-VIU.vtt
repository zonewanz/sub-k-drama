(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:10.883
Seo Jin, what's wrong? What am I going to do?

4
00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:12.583
You need to go visit Ms. Kim right now.

5
00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:13.952
My wife is onto me.

6
00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:16.352
Isn't this your husband?

7
00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.293
How dare you touch her?

8
00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:19.622
Let's keep it quiet.

9
00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:22.162
How could you do this to me?

10
00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:23.662
Let's end this.

11
00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:25.892
Fine, let's get divorced!

12
00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:30.933
I woke up this morning and became 20 again.

13
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.433
This is the year 1999.

14
00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.442
Mom, you probably have no idea...

15
00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.673
what's happening to me right now.

16
00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:38.973
Hello, Nam Gil.

17
00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.312
Have you lost your mind?

18
00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:41.842
Yesterday you dumped him because he smelled.

19
00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.982
Today you said hi because you were happy to see him.

20
00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:45.812
Meeting? We're meeting girls?

21
00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.923
Why is she here?

22
00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:49.853
Ms. Ma Jin Joo. Your physiognomy tells me you should be studying.

23
00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:51.293
You're not the only one who came back.

24
00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:52.923
You're Min Seo Young, aren't you?

25
00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:55.762
How did he live with me when he missed her so much?

26
00:00:56.793 --> 00:00:57.992
Scumbag.

27
00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:02.662
In the movies, they go back on time machines.

28
00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.772
I might go back when I wake up.

29
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.503
- What is this? - I didn't go back.

30
00:01:17.283 --> 00:01:22.552
(The year 2004)

31
00:01:28.093 --> 00:01:29.093
Hello?

32
00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:30.733
What?

33
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.662
I can't hear you. I'll go out and call you back.

34
00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.373
No, I was just bored.

35
00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:39.902
Okay, have fun.

36
00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:43.513
She's such a club addict.

37
00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.382
Let's eat.

38
00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:54.253
I have to pay back the loan,

39
00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:57.152
the maintenance cost,

40
00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.423
and goodness, Father's birthday is soon.

41
00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:02.923
I can't meet the ends with my entire paycheck.

42
00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:05.533
Why don't I ever have enough money to make a living?

43
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.802
Gosh, we used so much money.

44
00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:12.472
People have...

45
00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:15.772
rights they can enjoy in a particular season of their lives.

46
00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:21.013
Hello, friends. Are you two here by yourselves?

47
00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:22.682
We're a party of two as well.

48
00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.413
When you're in your teens, you have the right...

49
00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:29.122
to know the beauty of life instead of the evil of it.

50
00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:31.953
Hello, I'm Choi Ban Do, a new employee of Hankook Pharmaceutical.

51
00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:34.293
Sir, can you please take a look at our drugs?

52
00:02:34.293 --> 00:02:37.833
I heard we make them with excellent ingredients.

53
00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:39.062
Please, take a look...

54
00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:49.972
And when you're in your 20s, you have the right...

55
00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:53.312
to enjoy your brightly shining youth.

56
00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.953
That passionate and youthful time which everyone enjoyed,

57
00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:03.423
to us,

58
00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:06.252
was like the springtime that passed by without giving us a chance...

59
00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:07.992
to look at the flowers.

60
00:03:08.763 --> 00:03:12.562
(Episode 3, Springtime Returns)

61
00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:20.302
People say youth withers in a blink of an eye.

62
00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:23.242
Just like cherry blossoms that last only for a season.

63
00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:26.242
Before your youth passes away,

64
00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:29.013
why don't you just do that thing you want to do?

65
00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:31.712
It could be hanging out with friends, going on a trip,

66
00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.652
or falling madly in love.

67
00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:36.022
This song is "Barefooted Youth" by Buck.

68
00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:43.893
The food is here.

69
00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:47.733
You must be a quick drinker.

70
00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:50.103
I'm going very slow right now.

71
00:03:50.302 --> 00:03:51.802
Very slow.

72
00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:56.002
You don't have to match my speed.

73
00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.413
You can keep your pace.

74
00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:01.182
I'll pour you...

75
00:04:03.652 --> 00:04:05.282
- What are you doing? - Pardon?

76
00:04:05.652 --> 00:04:07.383
You're never supposed to...

77
00:04:07.383 --> 00:04:09.383
pour a drink to a woman or make her pour one for you.

78
00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:11.992
You pour your own drink.

79
00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:13.923
Each to your own.

80
00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:39.712
This song.

81
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.253
I hate it.

82
00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:44.722
What?

83
00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:48.922
This song is about how he'll say whatever he wants...

84
00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:51.133
because he won't remember a thing tomorrow because he's drunk.

85
00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:52.792
Guys always say they don't remember.

86
00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.862
Do they think they have dementia due to alcohol consumption?

87
00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:56.873
Don't you think so?

88
00:04:57.272 --> 00:04:58.803
Oh, yes. Yes, right. I agree.

89
00:04:58.803 --> 00:05:00.743
I hate this song too.

90
00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:03.003
I hate how people confess their love after they get drunk.

91
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:04.472
I don't do that.

92
00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:10.053
How would I know that? I just met you.

93
00:05:13.823 --> 00:05:17.592
Slow down. You'll get drunk.

94
00:05:32.073 --> 00:05:33.703
I want stir-fried cartilage.

95
00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:35.803
Buy me some stir-fried cartilage.

96
00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:37.672
- Come here. - I want it.

97
00:05:38.513 --> 00:05:41.712
- I want stir-fried cartilage. - Let's go.

98
00:05:41.712 --> 00:05:44.083
I drink like a dolphin.

99
00:05:44.183 --> 00:05:45.282
I'm going to kill him.

100
00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:47.323
You drink like a whale.

101
00:05:47.652 --> 00:05:50.422
Oh, goodness.

102
00:05:56.362 --> 00:06:00.232
(Male Dormitory)

103
00:06:06.602 --> 00:06:07.602
What's this?

104
00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.842
Hey, wake up.

105
00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:12.143
Wake up.

106
00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:14.683
Why are you sleeping here?

107
00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:16.212
Why am I here?

108
00:06:26.623 --> 00:06:27.662
What is this?

109
00:06:28.193 --> 00:06:29.422
What is it?

110
00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:31.763
- Oh, gosh. Mom! - What?

111
00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:33.433
Mom, her eyes are infected.

112
00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:34.703
Don't look at me.

113
00:06:34.703 --> 00:06:37.102
Goodness, you idiots.

114
00:06:37.102 --> 00:06:39.402
You two are already too much from the morning.

115
00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:40.643
My gosh.

116
00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:45.772
Gosh.

117
00:06:46.313 --> 00:06:47.712
I'm the same as yesterday.

118
00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:55.053
Yes!

119
00:06:55.323 --> 00:06:56.453
Yes!

120
00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:57.953
I didn't go back.

121
00:07:02.763 --> 00:07:04.693
What if she gives the infection to me?

122
00:07:04.693 --> 00:07:06.263
I'm meeting boys tomorrow.

123
00:07:06.263 --> 00:07:08.462
It's so gross how she got an eye infection.

124
00:07:11.803 --> 00:07:14.873
Hey, don't come near me, okay?

125
00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:17.013
What's with her?

126
00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:20.143
And why did she sleep in the master bedroom?

127
00:07:20.813 --> 00:07:22.143
What's with her eyes?

128
00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:25.513
You kids have no idea how I feel when you've been inside of me.

129
00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:27.422
How would I know what's on your minds?

130
00:07:42.803 --> 00:07:43.803
Jin Joo.

131
00:07:43.972 --> 00:07:45.703
Is something wrong?

132
00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.472
Are you angry at me?

133
00:07:48.573 --> 00:07:49.643
No.

134
00:07:50.443 --> 00:07:52.243
Wait.

135
00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:54.683
Do you need some allowance?

136
00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:55.912
No.

137
00:07:59.652 --> 00:08:00.683
Is she...

138
00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.393
going through puberty again?

139
00:08:04.123 --> 00:08:05.722
Why is she doing that to me?

140
00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:14.602
So I don't know when I'll go back.

141
00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:17.703
Maybe never?

142
00:08:19.943 --> 00:08:22.203
That means I have to serve in the military again.

143
00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:23.772
No.

144
00:08:23.912 --> 00:08:25.513
It's better than being divorced.

145
00:08:27.282 --> 00:08:28.643
I don't know.

146
00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:33.283
Gosh. So this is...

147
00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:35.423
my old room.

148
00:08:36.823 --> 00:08:38.392
My treasures.

149
00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:41.693
Jin Joo threw them all out when we got married.

150
00:08:42.462 --> 00:08:44.663
"Scions of Fate".

151
00:08:47.063 --> 00:08:48.232
It's "Days of Being Wild"!

152
00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:51.002
Leslie Cheung.

153
00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:15.862
All right.

154
00:09:16.663 --> 00:09:19.232
Let's have some fun.

155
00:09:24.632 --> 00:09:27.872
What did he just ask for?

156
00:09:28.002 --> 00:09:29.543
Mom. Dad.

157
00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:31.673
Give me all your savings, house deed,

158
00:09:31.673 --> 00:09:34.712
and every asset you have.

159
00:09:35.512 --> 00:09:36.752
All of them.

160
00:09:37.212 --> 00:09:39.653
Why you little punk!

161
00:09:40.053 --> 00:09:42.482
I'm not a little punk.

162
00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.823
I can make you a fortune with that.

163
00:09:44.823 --> 00:09:46.622
I'll make you super rich.

164
00:09:46.622 --> 00:09:49.362
I'm going to be a really good son to you.

165
00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:55.163
If you invest in Gwanggyo or Panggyo,

166
00:09:55.163 --> 00:09:57.173
you'll never have to work a day in your life.

167
00:09:57.173 --> 00:09:58.972
How do you know that?

168
00:09:58.972 --> 00:10:01.372
I told you I'm from the future.

169
00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.872
- My neck is getting stiff. - Honey.

170
00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.742
Stop it already.

171
00:10:06.882 --> 00:10:08.313
- Are you okay? - Dad.

172
00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:10.852
This is nothing get upset about.

173
00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:13.553
You can live in luxury from now on.

174
00:10:14.852 --> 00:10:17.352
I'll make the amount of money you can never earn...

175
00:10:17.693 --> 00:10:18.953
with your salary.

176
00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:21.122
Bring it now.

177
00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:22.762
This stupid punk.

178
00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:27.462
Where are you going?

179
00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:29.232
It must be in your bedroom.

180
00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:31.673
Dad. Bring everything.

181
00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:36.203
Mom. Should we take out some loan?

182
00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:37.443
Are you crazy?

183
00:10:38.242 --> 00:10:41.482
Hey, did you get a lesson from a professional scammer?

184
00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:42.982
Just you wait.

185
00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.683
You'll see what I'm up to.

186
00:10:45.913 --> 00:10:47.122
No good.

187
00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:48.882
You're up to no good.

188
00:10:49.352 --> 00:10:50.453
Hey.

189
00:10:52.222 --> 00:10:53.462
Did I ever starve you...

190
00:10:53.462 --> 00:10:56.423
or not pay your tuition with my small income?

191
00:10:57.992 --> 00:11:00.903
- Dad, wait. - Honey.

192
00:11:01.063 --> 00:11:02.833
You punk. Come over here.

193
00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:05.372
What did you say? Bring all the assets?

194
00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:07.142
- You crazy punk. - Honey.

195
00:11:07.142 --> 00:11:08.602
Just trust me.

196
00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:10.142
I can't believe...

197
00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:12.642
I was so happy when you were born.

198
00:11:12.642 --> 00:11:14.512
I can't believe I was too.

199
00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:16.712
Don't get worked up, and just trust me.

200
00:11:16.712 --> 00:11:18.612
- Trust you? How? - Goodness.

201
00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:19.923
Trust you?

202
00:11:19.923 --> 00:11:22.153
How can I trust you?

203
00:11:26.023 --> 00:11:27.122
Gosh.

204
00:11:30.092 --> 00:11:31.232
Let me count this.

205
00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:44.673
Did he sell all his treasures?

206
00:11:44.673 --> 00:11:46.913
I think he'll make a big trouble.

207
00:11:47.212 --> 00:11:48.512
Dad.

208
00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:50.183
I think he already did.

209
00:11:55.453 --> 00:11:57.722
Being young makes you feel so light.

210
00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:03.333
All right.

211
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:04.492
Ready, go!

212
00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:26.313
Yes! I won!

213
00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:28.453
I'll run all the way to school!

214
00:12:28.852 --> 00:12:30.092
Yes!

215
00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:31.653
Hey, Choi Ban Do!

216
00:12:31.892 --> 00:12:33.563
I won!

217
00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:45.573
I have to see Choi Ban Do first.

218
00:12:49.972 --> 00:12:52.273
Who pays a cab fare with a card?

219
00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:53.842
Well...

220
00:12:53.842 --> 00:12:56.313
I did yesterday. Why can't I?

221
00:12:56.482 --> 00:12:58.683
There isn't a cab that accepts cards.

222
00:12:58.683 --> 00:12:59.852
This isn't a department store.

223
00:13:00.183 --> 00:13:03.053
Are you doing this to avoid paying the fare?

224
00:13:03.852 --> 00:13:05.953
- Pay with cash now. - Well, I...

225
00:13:06.092 --> 00:13:07.693
did pay with this yesterday.

226
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.262
Well...

227
00:13:10.793 --> 00:13:12.132
Where's my wallet?

228
00:13:12.132 --> 00:13:13.962
Goodness, where did it go?

229
00:13:28.012 --> 00:13:29.543
Come on, lady.

230
00:13:31.413 --> 00:13:33.783
Please wait a minute. I don't have any cash.

231
00:13:33.783 --> 00:13:35.323
Wait. What am I going to do?

232
00:13:36.122 --> 00:13:37.293
I have it.

233
00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.273
- Goodness. - He's so handsome.

234
00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:01.083
- Gosh. - He's hot.

235
00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:03.212
- He's really cool. - My goodness.

236
00:14:03.212 --> 00:14:04.882
- He's really handsome. - Isn't he?

237
00:14:04.913 --> 00:14:06.413
Now I understand.

238
00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:08.982
He let me go because I left my wallet in the cab.

239
00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:12.092
If I catch that stupid cab driver...

240
00:14:13.193 --> 00:14:14.523
What's this?

241
00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:19.663
I'll talk to your mom about your cellphone.

242
00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:23.002
Whatever.

243
00:14:25.002 --> 00:14:27.242
Where is Choi Ban Do?

244
00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:28.502
Let's see.

245
00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:35.683
Gosh.

246
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.783
Salute.

247
00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:47.592
Hello.

248
00:14:49.163 --> 00:14:50.392
Nam Gil.

249
00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:53.663
You must be going to your class.

250
00:15:00.242 --> 00:15:02.943
I don't want to bump into him this morning.

251
00:15:03.142 --> 00:15:06.112
I said hello to him after dumping him so cruelly.

252
00:15:06.112 --> 00:15:07.842
He must think I'm crazy.

253
00:15:08.943 --> 00:15:11.183
Gosh, lady. You're so silly.

254
00:15:11.183 --> 00:15:12.352
- What are you doing? - You scared me.

255
00:15:14.423 --> 00:15:15.752
I see.

256
00:15:17.453 --> 00:15:20.892
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

257
00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:23.663
I guess you aren't the girl from the future today.

258
00:15:24.592 --> 00:15:27.563
Go away. What if he sees us?

259
00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:29.102
What are you doing here?

260
00:15:30.102 --> 00:15:31.732
Hey.

261
00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:33.642
Hi. We met yesterday.

262
00:15:33.773 --> 00:15:35.803
I'm Go Dok Jae.

263
00:15:35.943 --> 00:15:37.142
That's Jae Woo.

264
00:15:37.512 --> 00:15:38.943
Don't girls...

265
00:15:38.943 --> 00:15:41.142
usually chat in front of a restroom?

266
00:15:41.543 --> 00:15:44.783
But why are you gathered here next to a trashcan?

267
00:15:45.683 --> 00:15:47.722
- Go away! - What?

268
00:16:00.563 --> 00:16:01.732
Salute.

269
00:16:14.783 --> 00:16:16.112
What are you wearing?

270
00:16:18.283 --> 00:16:19.413
Are you Bruce Lee?

271
00:16:20.882 --> 00:16:22.283
It's civil construction major uniform.

272
00:16:24.122 --> 00:16:25.852
- It's pickled radish color. - Pickled radish?

273
00:16:26.423 --> 00:16:28.063
Simple, stupid, and crazy?

274
00:16:28.163 --> 00:16:30.333
So you know the hidden meaning.

275
00:16:30.362 --> 00:16:32.092
You got that scar from getting beaten up.

276
00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:38.732
- You guessed right. - I saw it.

277
00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:40.203
You should've stopped her then.

278
00:16:40.673 --> 00:16:41.742
Why would I do that?

279
00:16:42.102 --> 00:16:43.943
We'll get going now.

280
00:16:44.173 --> 00:16:45.242
Let's go.

281
00:16:47.813 --> 00:16:48.943
Hey.

282
00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:50.653
I'll see you later.

283
00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:52.683
Me?

284
00:16:54.823 --> 00:16:55.823
Why me?

285
00:16:57.953 --> 00:16:59.023
Hey.

286
00:16:59.892 --> 00:17:01.222
Where's Choi Ban Do?

287
00:17:18.743 --> 00:17:20.142
Min Seo Young.

288
00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:22.142
Your fan club is here again.

289
00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:24.952
- She's looking at us. - She looked at me.

290
00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:28.382
But I don't see the guy with a yellow tracksuit.

291
00:17:29.723 --> 00:17:31.753
You mean the civil construction major?

292
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:37.833
He's here. It's him.

293
00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:44.303
I'll make it happen today.

294
00:18:06.192 --> 00:18:07.192
Goodness.

295
00:18:07.592 --> 00:18:09.293
She saw you. Why would you hide?

296
00:18:09.563 --> 00:18:11.632
My goodness.

297
00:18:12.162 --> 00:18:13.763
Hey, he's coming.

298
00:18:41.993 --> 00:18:43.333
That's Seo Young.

299
00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:45.793
She's still the same.

300
00:18:47.263 --> 00:18:48.763
She's like a fairy.

301
00:18:55.473 --> 00:18:56.872
Even if you go back in time,

302
00:18:56.872 --> 00:18:58.172
you won't be able to date Seo Young.

303
00:18:58.172 --> 00:18:59.642
If I go back in time, I'll date her.

304
00:18:59.642 --> 00:19:01.483
Why would I date Jin Joo?

305
00:19:05.013 --> 00:19:06.013
Right.

306
00:19:07.182 --> 00:19:09.452
I had no choice but to give up on her back then,

307
00:19:09.823 --> 00:19:11.092
but things are different now.

308
00:19:13.922 --> 00:19:16.122
Seo Young, the yellow guy is here.

309
00:19:16.733 --> 00:19:19.333
He's not wearing his yellow uniform today.

310
00:19:19.963 --> 00:19:20.963
He's coming.

311
00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:24.833
Hello.

312
00:19:25.672 --> 00:19:26.672
Hey.

313
00:19:27.303 --> 00:19:28.803
I'm sorry about yesterday. I surprised you, right?

314
00:19:29.342 --> 00:19:31.243
I was just really glad to see you.

315
00:19:33.382 --> 00:19:35.112
I'm Choi Ban Do, a freshman in civil construction.

316
00:19:35.682 --> 00:19:36.682
Oh, wait.

317
00:19:41.852 --> 00:19:42.952
You're good.

318
00:19:44.122 --> 00:19:45.993
Oh, thanks.

319
00:19:47.323 --> 00:19:48.323
Right.

320
00:19:49.463 --> 00:19:50.463
Here you are.

321
00:19:51.463 --> 00:19:52.493
You all can share.

322
00:19:55.132 --> 00:19:56.162
See you around.

323
00:20:06.783 --> 00:20:07.942
Can I have your number?

324
00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:13.723
The next time, I want to say hi to you as a friend.

325
00:20:19.023 --> 00:20:20.463
Stop lying.

326
00:20:21.662 --> 00:20:24.533
You couldn't even speak to her for months.

327
00:20:24.533 --> 00:20:25.932
He's lying.

328
00:20:26.463 --> 00:20:27.463
Give that to me.

329
00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:30.773
Yes, call that number now.

330
00:20:31.803 --> 00:20:33.602
You didn't know we would do this, did you?

331
00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:35.702
- Hello? Who is... - What will you do now?

332
00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:37.642
- My gosh! - What is it?

333
00:20:37.842 --> 00:20:38.942
It's her.

334
00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:42.713
Hey, you're the man.

335
00:20:42.912 --> 00:20:44.583
Hey, hey.

336
00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:45.583
- This. - What?

337
00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:48.753
Did you really do this? Did you really get her number?

338
00:20:48.753 --> 00:20:51.452
You used to stutter in front of her.

339
00:20:51.452 --> 00:20:54.162
Did you really talk to her to get her number?

340
00:20:54.162 --> 00:20:55.622
Why are you stuttering all of a sudden?

341
00:20:55.622 --> 00:20:57.662
Then do you think I got this through sign language?

342
00:20:57.662 --> 00:20:59.563
I'm not who I used to be.

343
00:20:59.563 --> 00:21:01.263
I've got the wisdom that comes with age...

344
00:21:01.263 --> 00:21:03.773
and a youthful body which is as strong as...

345
00:21:04.003 --> 00:21:05.172
Iron Man's suit.

346
00:21:05.773 --> 00:21:08.003
- Got it? - What are you talking about?

347
00:21:08.003 --> 00:21:09.702
What kind of suit?

348
00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:11.942
Okay, fine, then.

349
00:21:12.213 --> 00:21:13.283
Did you tell her that you like her?

350
00:21:13.283 --> 00:21:15.942
Yes, did you tell her that you like her?

351
00:21:16.313 --> 00:21:19.452
Goodness, you can't just suddenly tell someone you like her.

352
00:21:19.452 --> 00:21:22.483
You have to create a well-organized story.

353
00:21:22.483 --> 00:21:24.023
There are steps in dating.

354
00:21:39.533 --> 00:21:42.642
Hey, is Seo Young crazy? Why would she date you?

355
00:21:42.642 --> 00:21:46.372
There's a long line of guys who wish they could date her.

356
00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:48.543
Yes, just tell her you like her and end the whole thing.

357
00:21:48.713 --> 00:21:51.152
What is this odd logic?

358
00:21:51.882 --> 00:21:54.682
Why would you tell her you like her if you aren't going to date her?

359
00:21:54.682 --> 00:21:56.922
You only tell a woman you like her when you know...

360
00:21:56.922 --> 00:21:58.622
you have a chance of dating her.

361
00:21:58.622 --> 00:22:00.563
You fools. You're impotent when it comes to dating.

362
00:22:02.192 --> 00:22:04.563
What? Impotent?

363
00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.233
Did you say we're impotent?

364
00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:09.702
Hey, have you ever seen me in the morning?

365
00:22:09.733 --> 00:22:10.803
Have you seen it when it gets angry?

366
00:22:10.803 --> 00:22:12.833
Be quiet, you're embarrassing me.

367
00:22:13.243 --> 00:22:15.602
- Oh, gosh. - We're not impotent.

368
00:22:16.142 --> 00:22:17.213
My neck is getting stiff.

369
00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:21.942
There's no talking to these kids. I'll stop talking.

370
00:22:21.942 --> 00:22:24.253
I'm feeling tired after having a good laugh.

371
00:22:28.352 --> 00:22:29.483
Gosh, this is bitter.

372
00:22:29.652 --> 00:22:32.293
Why did Mom get something bitter than before?

373
00:22:32.293 --> 00:22:34.493
Gosh, Mom. I hate you.

374
00:22:35.023 --> 00:22:36.122
Hey.

375
00:22:36.833 --> 00:22:39.592
Why do you keep throwing this away? This is really precious.

376
00:22:39.592 --> 00:22:41.033
Give it to me. I'll have it.

377
00:22:42.102 --> 00:22:43.432
You have no idea how precious this is.

378
00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:48.142
Hey, that girl, Ma Jin Joo from yesterday.

379
00:22:48.342 --> 00:22:49.503
She's been looking for you.

380
00:22:49.672 --> 00:22:51.043
Ma Jin Joo? Why?

381
00:22:51.612 --> 00:22:53.213
Forget about her.

382
00:22:53.213 --> 00:22:56.513
Goodness, she's looking for me to nitpick over things.

383
00:22:56.983 --> 00:22:59.952
She's been quite feisty since she was young.

384
00:23:01.583 --> 00:23:02.723
I'm so hungry.

385
00:23:02.723 --> 00:23:04.092
Let's eat tteokbokki later.

386
00:23:07.963 --> 00:23:08.963
Hey!

387
00:23:18.973 --> 00:23:19.973
Hey.

388
00:23:20.402 --> 00:23:21.503
We need to talk.

389
00:23:21.803 --> 00:23:22.803
Come here.

390
00:23:24.573 --> 00:23:26.273
Goodness, the class will begin soon.

391
00:23:26.273 --> 00:23:28.543
Let's get ready. Open up the textbook. Hurry up.

392
00:23:28.842 --> 00:23:31.013
Come out. I have something to say to you.

393
00:23:31.553 --> 00:23:32.553
To me?

394
00:23:32.882 --> 00:23:34.882
You have something to say? I don't.

395
00:23:37.352 --> 00:23:38.352
Hey.

396
00:23:38.422 --> 00:23:40.892
The class will begin now. Have a seat.

397
00:23:43.632 --> 00:23:45.493
We'll talk later.

398
00:23:56.073 --> 00:23:57.573
Hey, did something happen yesterday?

399
00:23:57.573 --> 00:23:58.912
She wasn't so angry this morning...

400
00:24:00.612 --> 00:24:02.912
Gosh, she's scary. Lasers are coming out of her eyes.

401
00:24:04.253 --> 00:24:05.783
Don't mind her.

402
00:24:06.253 --> 00:24:10.253
Does she have trouble managing her anger or something?

403
00:24:10.622 --> 00:24:11.622
What's that?

404
00:24:12.293 --> 00:24:14.563
It's a condition which you can't control your anger.

405
00:24:14.563 --> 00:24:17.362
Don't ruin your life by getting involved with me again.

406
00:24:18.162 --> 00:24:19.162
The class is starting.

407
00:24:19.293 --> 00:24:22.803
On the sheet of paper I gave out, jot down some things about...

408
00:24:22.932 --> 00:24:25.533
the person you would like to observe.

409
00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:28.303
What is in that person's head?

410
00:24:28.303 --> 00:24:29.672
What's on their mind?

411
00:24:29.672 --> 00:24:31.573
And of course, this is anonymous.

412
00:24:34.612 --> 00:24:36.342
(Person observed)

413
00:24:43.622 --> 00:24:48.362
(Person observed: Choi Ban Do)

414
00:24:48.592 --> 00:24:52.833
Did you all get the paper of how your friends analyzed you?

415
00:24:52.833 --> 00:24:54.202
- Yes. - Yes.

416
00:24:54.432 --> 00:24:57.602
The common theme on this paper is how others...

417
00:24:57.902 --> 00:24:58.973
view you.

418
00:24:59.172 --> 00:25:00.303
How do you feel?

419
00:25:00.642 --> 00:25:02.642
(Park Wan Kyu, dandruff, gross, wig, cut your hair, you look old)

420
00:25:02.642 --> 00:25:03.842
Do you think you're a rock star?

421
00:25:03.942 --> 00:25:06.583
Dandruff, Park Wan Kyu, a wig.

422
00:25:06.942 --> 00:25:08.713
Cut your hair, and go to the army.

423
00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:12.753
Goodness, he must be shocked to see the result.

424
00:25:14.422 --> 00:25:16.352
(Park Wan Kyu, dandruff, gross, wig, cut your hair, you look old)

425
00:25:18.793 --> 00:25:19.862
(A ball of poop, a scrooge, cheapskate, coward)

426
00:25:19.862 --> 00:25:23.192
A ball of poop, a scrooge, coward,

427
00:25:23.192 --> 00:25:26.132
cheapskate, cheapskate, cheapskate!

428
00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:28.563
Cheapskate. Cheapskate. Cheapskate!

429
00:25:28.563 --> 00:25:30.672
Cheapskate. Cheapskate. Cheapskate!

430
00:25:30.672 --> 00:25:32.632
Cheapskate. Cheapskate. Cheapskate!

431
00:25:50.122 --> 00:25:52.553
- What is it? - We have to talk.

432
00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:53.622
Goodness.

433
00:25:54.422 --> 00:25:55.892
I'll be late for class.

434
00:25:57.932 --> 00:25:59.632
We have something to discuss.

435
00:25:59.763 --> 00:26:00.833
Do you?

436
00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:02.033
I don't.

437
00:26:04.632 --> 00:26:05.702
Are you serious?

438
00:26:06.172 --> 00:26:08.273
- Follow me. - Hey, that hurts. Let go of me.

439
00:26:09.003 --> 00:26:10.013
Hey.

440
00:26:10.442 --> 00:26:11.543
What's with them?

441
00:26:12.313 --> 00:26:15.083
Are they madly in love?

442
00:26:15.213 --> 00:26:16.213
What was that?

443
00:26:17.652 --> 00:26:18.652
No idea.

444
00:26:24.523 --> 00:26:26.892
You almost had me fooled.

445
00:26:29.932 --> 00:26:31.293
Do you want to be an actress?

446
00:26:31.293 --> 00:26:32.592
You were as good as Jeon Do Yeon.

447
00:26:32.592 --> 00:26:34.162
You should try to do that.

448
00:26:34.162 --> 00:26:35.233
Should I?

449
00:26:35.432 --> 00:26:36.672
Goodness.

450
00:26:37.102 --> 00:26:40.942
Forget that. Since when did you know it was me?

451
00:26:40.942 --> 00:26:43.243
Did you ignore me because you wanted a new life?

452
00:26:43.243 --> 00:26:46.043
Goodness, I can't believe what a scary woman you are.

453
00:26:46.043 --> 00:26:48.342
What's this nonsense? Right back at you.

454
00:26:49.283 --> 00:26:51.452
Did you say I should study? And I'll be a "Gold Miss"?

455
00:26:51.452 --> 00:26:52.783
What did I ever do to you?

456
00:26:52.783 --> 00:26:56.723
You ruined my life completely, you cheapskate!

457
00:26:57.823 --> 00:26:59.993
You're scary. You're really scary.

458
00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:03.122
It's really scary when you say those things with this face.

459
00:27:03.493 --> 00:27:05.392
Oh, gosh.

460
00:27:06.662 --> 00:27:08.803
- What are you doing? - Don't you get it?

461
00:27:09.602 --> 00:27:12.102
I'm comforting myself for living with a scary woman.

462
00:27:12.102 --> 00:27:14.273
Gosh, you're such a nerd.

463
00:27:14.273 --> 00:27:16.573
I've always been nerdy. Didn't you know?

464
00:27:16.573 --> 00:27:18.743
So what? Haven't you seen a nerd before?

465
00:27:19.213 --> 00:27:21.513
Forget that. What's going on?

466
00:27:21.513 --> 00:27:22.983
Why are we here?

467
00:27:24.112 --> 00:27:25.253
How would I know?

468
00:27:27.553 --> 00:27:29.753
I thought we'd be back once I wake up in the morning.

469
00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:31.523
I thought it was a miracle that happened for a day.

470
00:27:31.823 --> 00:27:33.122
But we didn't go back.

471
00:27:33.422 --> 00:27:35.993
We might have to stay here forever.

472
00:27:37.132 --> 00:27:38.263
Forever.

473
00:27:39.932 --> 00:27:41.602
I'd be grateful.

474
00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.503
- What? - It's like winning a lottery.

475
00:27:44.503 --> 00:27:46.842
Think about it. You woke up, and you're young again.

476
00:27:46.842 --> 00:27:47.973
You're 20 again.

477
00:27:48.872 --> 00:27:50.172
You should be thankful.

478
00:27:50.672 --> 00:27:53.743
If we go back, you and I will be divorcees.

479
00:27:53.743 --> 00:27:55.182
We're also old.

480
00:27:55.313 --> 00:27:56.483
Do you want to go back?

481
00:27:57.412 --> 00:27:58.612
Did I say I wanted to go back?

482
00:27:58.612 --> 00:27:59.753
Exactly.

483
00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:03.553
Since I'm here, I'm going to enjoy my life.

484
00:28:03.823 --> 00:28:06.253
Let's live our lives separately.

485
00:28:06.392 --> 00:28:08.862
I know you wouldn't want to get involved with me either.

486
00:28:09.862 --> 00:28:12.092
Of course, I don't want to.

487
00:28:12.493 --> 00:28:13.563
Exactly.

488
00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:15.102
Okay.

489
00:28:15.602 --> 00:28:17.303
Goodbye, comrade.

490
00:28:18.402 --> 00:28:20.172
Okay. Goodbye.

491
00:28:24.872 --> 00:28:25.973
Good luck.

492
00:28:35.723 --> 00:28:38.523
That means we're both back in the past.

493
00:28:39.223 --> 00:28:40.263
Why?

494
00:28:45.192 --> 00:28:46.463
Was I too mean to her?

495
00:28:46.763 --> 00:28:47.902
Let's get a divorce.

496
00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:49.533
We're too unhappy together.

497
00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:51.833
I am unimaginably unhappy.

498
00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:54.073
I don't know.

499
00:28:54.073 --> 00:28:56.003
It all turned out well. She was unhappy.

500
00:29:00.382 --> 00:29:02.882
Since I'm here, I'm going to enjoy my life.

501
00:29:02.912 --> 00:29:05.313
Let's live our lives separately.

502
00:29:06.622 --> 00:29:10.392
I'll wish for nothing else if I get to be young again.

503
00:29:12.323 --> 00:29:15.192
- Why is that? - You might think I'm nagging.

504
00:29:15.192 --> 00:29:18.763
But if I were you, I'd go out and let loose.

505
00:29:18.963 --> 00:29:20.162
I'd do whatever I want.

506
00:29:22.003 --> 00:29:24.902
You can't go back to being young again.

507
00:29:26.273 --> 00:29:29.342
Your youth doesn't wait for you.

508
00:29:30.612 --> 00:29:35.013
All right. Write your bucket list.

509
00:29:44.793 --> 00:29:49.523
(Bucket list)

510
00:29:49.523 --> 00:29:53.033
(Bucket list)

511
00:29:55.833 --> 00:29:56.872
Hey.

512
00:29:57.073 --> 00:29:59.672
Guys, let's go out.

513
00:29:59.942 --> 00:30:02.602
Why are we in here? We don't have time.

514
00:30:02.702 --> 00:30:04.642
We're hanging out.

515
00:30:04.642 --> 00:30:07.342
We have a lot of time on our hands.

516
00:30:07.912 --> 00:30:09.043
What's wrong?

517
00:30:11.412 --> 00:30:12.513
I mean,

518
00:30:12.513 --> 00:30:14.753
let's go out, and do something.

519
00:30:16.323 --> 00:30:18.922
We had a class in the morning. I'm tired.

520
00:30:19.723 --> 00:30:21.692
You young girls.

521
00:30:22.063 --> 00:30:23.432
What do you mean you're tired?

522
00:30:23.632 --> 00:30:25.392
Do you think you'll have that energy forever?

523
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:27.632
Okay.

524
00:30:27.902 --> 00:30:30.233
What? What do you want to do? Tell me.

525
00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:33.702
What do kids these days do?

526
00:30:34.273 --> 00:30:36.102
What was that?

527
00:30:36.303 --> 00:30:37.442
You sounded like Sul's mom.

528
00:30:38.412 --> 00:30:42.283
Ma'am. Kids these days drink and dance.

529
00:30:42.283 --> 00:30:43.983
Kids go dancing and drinking.

530
00:30:44.213 --> 00:30:45.753
In a club.

531
00:30:46.213 --> 00:30:47.352
A club?

532
00:30:48.622 --> 00:30:49.753
I want to go there.

533
00:30:50.823 --> 00:30:53.053
What? You want to go to a club?

534
00:30:53.493 --> 00:30:56.662
Yes. The place you go every night.

535
00:30:57.993 --> 00:30:59.632
I've been there only twice.

536
00:30:59.862 --> 00:31:01.303
Do you think I'm addicted to clubbing?

537
00:31:02.063 --> 00:31:05.333
You said you'd never go to a club.

538
00:31:05.503 --> 00:31:07.573
But here you are dreaming of breaking your rules.

539
00:31:08.942 --> 00:31:10.642
All right then,

540
00:31:12.513 --> 00:31:13.583
shall we go?

541
00:31:20.452 --> 00:31:24.692
(Female Dormitory)

542
00:31:51.652 --> 00:31:52.783
Hey.

543
00:31:53.352 --> 00:31:55.553
I told you we should wear low heel shoes.

544
00:31:56.652 --> 00:31:58.892
I didn't expect a downhill.

545
00:32:00.422 --> 00:32:01.463
Let's go.

546
00:32:14.073 --> 00:32:15.372
Hey.

547
00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:16.973
Guys!

548
00:32:20.313 --> 00:32:21.483
Goodness.

549
00:32:22.243 --> 00:32:23.882
Get out of the way!

550
00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:26.112
- Hey. - No.

551
00:32:29.023 --> 00:32:30.622
Get out! You'll get hurt!

552
00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:32.223
Goodness.

553
00:32:32.293 --> 00:32:33.523
- Goodness. - You there!

554
00:32:33.523 --> 00:32:34.793
Get out of my way!

555
00:32:34.892 --> 00:32:36.422
Step aside!

557
00:33:08.392 --> 00:33:09.993
You should get off me now that your brakes have been set.

558
00:33:10.963 --> 00:33:12.092
I must be smelly.

559
00:33:21.172 --> 00:33:22.273
Well...

560
00:33:22.872 --> 00:33:25.313
I've never worn heels this high.

561
00:33:26.172 --> 00:33:27.942
It's really steep, isn't it?

562
00:33:28.412 --> 00:33:30.152
By the way, you don't smell...

563
00:33:34.682 --> 00:33:35.952
Why did you...

564
00:33:38.293 --> 00:33:39.553
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:41.162 --> 00:33:42.362
I'm sorry!

566
00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:44.932
Who is she?

567
00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:49.833
Why did you run into his arms?

568
00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:52.902
Well...

569
00:33:54.102 --> 00:33:55.543
I'm more than acting silly.

570
00:33:55.642 --> 00:33:57.073
I'm a total nuisance.

571
00:34:02.583 --> 00:34:04.253
Wasn't that an accident?

572
00:34:05.553 --> 00:34:06.952
Why don't we stand there every day?

573
00:34:11.523 --> 00:34:12.722
Good idea.

574
00:34:30.142 --> 00:34:31.412
He's really handsome. Come.

575
00:34:35.343 --> 00:34:37.282
I can't believe I'm in a club with you.

576
00:34:37.552 --> 00:34:38.653
What's gotten into you?

577
00:34:39.352 --> 00:34:41.352
When else am I going to come here?

578
00:34:42.253 --> 00:34:44.552
That's right. When else?

579
00:34:44.793 --> 00:34:47.423
We have to live today like it's our last.

580
00:34:48.262 --> 00:34:50.293
Hey, Sul. You shouldn't wear glasses.

581
00:34:50.432 --> 00:34:51.532
You look much prettier without them.

582
00:34:52.193 --> 00:34:53.503
You should put some makeup on.

583
00:34:54.932 --> 00:34:56.003
I did.

584
00:34:56.202 --> 00:34:58.932
It's your dark history. Do you know that?

585
00:34:59.302 --> 00:35:00.343
What?

586
00:35:01.173 --> 00:35:02.242
"Dark history"?

587
00:35:03.543 --> 00:35:04.613
What is she saying?

588
00:35:05.773 --> 00:35:08.182
Why did we dress like that?

589
00:35:09.083 --> 00:35:11.083
That kind of makeup was popular then.

590
00:35:13.852 --> 00:35:15.083
I know.

591
00:35:15.452 --> 00:35:17.492
We all looked like that back then.

592
00:35:17.892 --> 00:35:20.822
How come we look older then than now?

593
00:35:24.093 --> 00:35:25.863
It's our dark history.

594
00:35:43.552 --> 00:35:45.383
Yes, miss. I'm here.

595
00:35:46.782 --> 00:35:48.352
Hey, put that down.

596
00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:50.093
You hold that up to call a waiter.

597
00:35:50.352 --> 00:35:52.023
Don't act like you've never been to a club.

598
00:35:52.852 --> 00:35:54.363
So this is your first time?

599
00:35:54.463 --> 00:35:56.423
Why don't you try booking then?

600
00:35:57.063 --> 00:35:58.133
"Booking"?

Guys, let's do it.

602
00:35:59.963 --> 00:36:04.102
I love your enthusiasm. Okay. Let's go.

603
00:36:04.102 --> 00:36:05.503
Let's go.

604
00:36:05.773 --> 00:36:08.302
I'm here only to dance.

605
00:36:09.003 --> 00:36:11.843
Who comes to a club only to dance?

606
00:36:12.443 --> 00:36:13.443
Let's go.

607
00:36:14.543 --> 00:36:15.682
- Come this way. - Okay.

608
00:36:19.383 --> 00:36:21.383
Yes. I'm still in the library.

609
00:36:21.952 --> 00:36:24.352
Being in medical school doesn't mean I'm a doctor already.

610
00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:27.863
I have to cut down on sleep and study more.

611
00:36:27.863 --> 00:36:31.032
Don't worry about me. Go to bed, princess.

612
00:36:31.093 --> 00:36:33.403
Good night.

Did you put your princess to sleep?

615
00:36:50.412 --> 00:36:52.552
Gosh, she never goes to sleep.

616
00:36:52.813 --> 00:36:54.523
She's like the main character in "Misery".

Hey, how are the girls today?

618
00:36:58.193 --> 00:37:00.193
- All right. - Come this way.

619
00:37:00.193 --> 00:37:01.293
How about her?

620
00:37:01.762 --> 00:37:03.762
She looks powerful. She's just my type.

621
00:37:05.563 --> 00:37:07.762
A girl like her doesn't give in easily.

622
00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:09.833
Pick someone worthwhile.

623
00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:11.733
Be careful. This way.

624
00:37:13.202 --> 00:37:14.872
Come this way. Be careful.

625
00:37:22.383 --> 00:37:23.552
Gosh.

626
00:37:23.952 --> 00:37:26.653
We haven't been to a club in so long.

627
00:37:26.753 --> 00:37:29.383
Hey, how old are we now?

628
00:37:29.722 --> 00:37:32.552
Our lives have been too PG rated.

629
00:37:32.852 --> 00:37:35.622
Today, we're going all in,

630
00:37:36.262 --> 00:37:39.063
and we'll play like a rated-R movie, okay?

631
00:37:39.293 --> 00:37:43.032
While we're at it, should we order a bottle of hard liquor?

632
00:37:43.162 --> 00:37:45.673
- Hey, that's expensive. - Right?

633
00:37:45.673 --> 00:37:48.602
Hey, order it.

634
00:37:48.602 --> 00:37:50.072
I have a lot of money.

635
00:37:50.072 --> 00:37:51.072
Order it.

636
00:37:51.072 --> 00:37:53.443
You need to have some liquor when you're at a club.

637
00:37:53.443 --> 00:37:54.443
Bring it on.

638
00:37:56.912 --> 00:37:59.583
All right, let's have fun tonight.

639
00:37:59.753 --> 00:38:02.722
Right, don't pour hard liquor for anyone that comes in.

640
00:38:02.722 --> 00:38:04.392
If you like her, give her hard liquor.

641
00:38:04.392 --> 00:38:06.693
If you don't, give her beer. Don't forget.

642
00:38:06.923 --> 00:38:08.593
- Oh, and Ahn Jae Woo. - Yes?

643
00:38:08.622 --> 00:38:11.492
I'm telling you to not give expensive liquor to ugly girls.

644
00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:12.593
Okay?

645
00:38:12.662 --> 00:38:15.403
Okay, why are you telling me that?

646
00:38:15.963 --> 00:38:17.273
Okay!

647
00:38:21.642 --> 00:38:23.102
- Oh, gosh. - Goodness.

648
00:38:23.773 --> 00:38:24.773
Oh, right.

649
00:38:29.813 --> 00:38:31.113
I want hard liquor.

650
00:38:31.613 --> 00:38:34.182
Beer makes me full.

651
00:38:36.282 --> 00:38:37.753
Oh, hey.

652
00:38:51.532 --> 00:38:52.802
What's your major again?

653
00:38:53.173 --> 00:38:54.543
Civil construction.

654
00:38:54.642 --> 00:38:56.043
What do you learn there?

655
00:38:56.142 --> 00:38:57.613
You plan, design, and construct...

656
00:38:57.613 --> 00:39:00.412
a variety of buildings using nature,

657
00:39:00.412 --> 00:39:02.742
and maintain buildings. In a word,

658
00:39:02.742 --> 00:39:04.512
we study to become professionals...

659
00:39:04.512 --> 00:39:07.452
who are both experts on paper and in the field.

660
00:39:07.452 --> 00:39:10.892
I actually got in because my dad used to be a carpenter.

661
00:39:10.892 --> 00:39:13.293
Well, it wasn't my dad's dream to become a carpenter.

662
00:39:13.293 --> 00:39:14.492
But you have to do...

663
00:39:14.492 --> 00:39:15.992
What is it?

664
00:39:19.563 --> 00:39:20.903
I have another one.

665
00:39:20.903 --> 00:39:23.063
What do you call a pig with no legs?

666
00:39:23.063 --> 00:39:25.133
- A pig with no legs? - A pig?

667
00:39:25.133 --> 00:39:26.333
A ground-hog.

668
00:39:28.242 --> 00:39:29.443
Goodness.

669
00:39:29.503 --> 00:39:32.443
What do you call someone who steals pigs?

670
00:39:32.443 --> 00:39:33.512
A ham-burglar.

671
00:39:34.583 --> 00:39:35.682
That's hilarious!

672
00:39:35.682 --> 00:39:37.282
You're so hilarious.

673
00:39:38.282 --> 00:39:39.682
That's all.

674
00:39:41.153 --> 00:39:42.253
Let's go.

675
00:39:43.253 --> 00:39:44.452
It's all right.

676
00:39:45.023 --> 00:39:46.923
We won't be coming back any time soon.

677
00:39:52.593 --> 00:39:53.602
Nice to meet you.

678
00:39:53.662 --> 00:39:54.662
Sure.

679
00:40:02.472 --> 00:40:03.472
How old are you?

680
00:40:03.713 --> 00:40:04.912
I'm 38...

681
00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:10.383
How old do I look?

682
00:40:10.713 --> 00:40:12.952
I'm sure you aren't underage,

683
00:40:13.222 --> 00:40:14.222
so about 20?

684
00:40:18.492 --> 00:40:20.363
You guys are like babies.

685
00:40:20.423 --> 00:40:21.593
You're so adorable.

686
00:40:21.793 --> 00:40:23.162
I'm 26.

687
00:40:23.492 --> 00:40:24.532
That means I'm older.

688
00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:26.532
I guess so.

689
00:40:27.463 --> 00:40:31.202
You. How dare you speak so casually to my friend?

690
00:40:31.702 --> 00:40:32.702
What?

691
00:40:32.872 --> 00:40:34.102
I'm sorry if I offended you.

692
00:40:35.443 --> 00:40:36.943
Hey, come on.

693
00:40:36.943 --> 00:40:38.742
Don't worry about it.

694
00:40:38.742 --> 00:40:40.912
It's all right. You can speak casually.

695
00:40:41.782 --> 00:40:42.883
Hyun Seok.

696
00:40:44.782 --> 00:40:46.883
- What's wrong? He's cute. - Wow.

697
00:40:48.153 --> 00:40:50.222
I like how you're very feisty.

698
00:40:50.222 --> 00:40:52.322
If you're 20, you probably can't drink well.

699
00:40:52.793 --> 00:40:56.633
You'll get better at it if you drink more and more.

700
00:40:58.532 --> 00:40:59.532
Take it.

701
00:41:10.213 --> 00:41:11.213
Hey, let's go dance.

702
00:41:11.642 --> 00:41:12.673
It's a techno song.

703
00:41:14.983 --> 00:41:16.813
Can we stay here?

704
00:41:16.852 --> 00:41:17.883
Hey.

705
00:41:18.383 --> 00:41:19.852
Come on. Let's go.

706
00:41:20.052 --> 00:41:21.052
Let's go.

707
00:41:22.452 --> 00:41:23.452
Let's go.

708
00:41:29.063 --> 00:41:30.833
(Park Hyun Seok)

709
00:41:32.492 --> 00:41:33.503
See you again.

710
00:41:35.802 --> 00:41:36.802
Sure.

711
00:43:24.912 --> 00:43:25.912
Hey!

712
00:43:26.412 --> 00:43:28.742
Goodness, and now you're at a club.

713
00:43:29.343 --> 00:43:31.552
Your knees will give out, you old lady.

714
00:43:31.883 --> 00:43:33.682
You said you wanted a whole new life,

715
00:43:33.682 --> 00:43:35.583
and it looks like you're enjoying it.

716
00:43:35.583 --> 00:43:37.352
How did you hold yourself back?

717
00:43:37.352 --> 00:43:39.492
Exactly. How did I do that?

718
00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:42.262
I need to be here to meet a woman to live a whole new life.

719
00:43:42.593 --> 00:43:45.563
Do you think guys will like you if you dress like this?

720
00:43:45.563 --> 00:43:47.733
Get a grip, you old lady.

721
00:43:48.932 --> 00:43:49.932
That jerk...

722
00:43:52.173 --> 00:43:53.872
He must be insane.

723
00:44:04.852 --> 00:44:06.483
- Goodness. - You there!

724
00:44:06.483 --> 00:44:08.182
Get out of my way!

725
00:44:24.432 --> 00:44:25.733
Is there something good there?

726
00:44:25.733 --> 00:44:27.072
What are you staring at?

727
00:44:27.302 --> 00:44:28.503
Nothing.

728
00:44:30.912 --> 00:44:34.182
Have you ever hugged someone?

729
00:44:34.182 --> 00:44:36.043
What? Have I ever had what?

730
00:44:36.313 --> 00:44:38.713
No, have you ever hugged a...

731
00:44:39.753 --> 00:44:40.952
No, never mind.

732
00:44:41.653 --> 00:44:42.653
Let's go.

733
00:44:43.753 --> 00:44:44.753
What was that?

734
00:44:50.262 --> 00:44:52.532
Did something happen between you and Jin Joo yesterday?

735
00:44:52.532 --> 00:44:54.003
Why doesn't she want to be here?

736
00:44:54.003 --> 00:44:55.932
You're right. It's because of you, isn't it?

737
00:44:55.932 --> 00:44:57.432
I think she hates you.

738
00:44:57.432 --> 00:44:59.602
I'm glad to hear that.

739
00:45:04.043 --> 00:45:08.083
My goodness, I have to avoid drinking with Bo Reum.

740
00:45:08.142 --> 00:45:10.383
Let me just stay away from provoking her.

741
00:45:12.653 --> 00:45:13.852
Hey, Bo Reum.

742
00:45:15.552 --> 00:45:16.722
It looks like you're a weak drinker.

743
00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:20.822
I guess a girl needs to be a weak drinker, you know.

744
00:45:21.023 --> 00:45:23.262
It's weird for a girl to be stronger than a guy.

745
00:45:23.363 --> 00:45:25.733
It doesn't look too great, is it?

746
00:45:26.093 --> 00:45:27.102
What?

747
00:45:27.532 --> 00:45:28.863
Stop it. Stop it.

748
00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:30.102
Why? Do you agree with me?

749
00:45:34.173 --> 00:45:35.773
I was having so much fun.

750
00:45:36.043 --> 00:45:38.412
Why did he have to come?

751
00:45:46.313 --> 00:45:47.423
Ta-da.

752
00:45:48.523 --> 00:45:51.523
Gosh, Jin Joo. You're on a roll.

753
00:45:53.423 --> 00:45:54.722
Goodness.

754
00:45:58.432 --> 00:46:00.633
- Come with me to a room. - No, I don't want to.

755
00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:02.863
- Just once. - I don't want to.

756
00:46:06.273 --> 00:46:07.273
Over here.

757
00:46:08.302 --> 00:46:10.213
Over here, yes. Me.

758
00:46:21.483 --> 00:46:23.923
Gosh, fine. You're the best.

759
00:46:23.923 --> 00:46:25.193
I lost.

760
00:46:26.293 --> 00:46:28.822
You can challenge me anytime you want.

761
00:46:29.793 --> 00:46:31.932
But I won't let you off like this the next time.

762
00:46:34.403 --> 00:46:35.463
What's with you?

763
00:46:36.432 --> 00:46:37.503
Did you just laugh?

764
00:46:38.072 --> 00:46:41.242
What? No. That was cute.

765
00:46:42.043 --> 00:46:44.443
I don't believe this.

766
00:46:45.472 --> 00:46:46.782
Are you challenging me too?

767
00:46:47.543 --> 00:46:50.483
No, no. Please don't misunderstand.

768
00:46:50.483 --> 00:46:52.483
You're a much better drinker than I am.

769
00:46:59.122 --> 00:47:00.363
I said that I'll see you later,

770
00:47:00.622 --> 00:47:01.762
and I'm seeing you here.

771
00:47:03.662 --> 00:47:04.662
You.

772
00:47:07.202 --> 00:47:08.202
Me?

773
00:47:08.463 --> 00:47:10.333
Do you remember what happened yesterday, or no?

774
00:47:13.032 --> 00:47:14.372
Make sure you answer me right.

775
00:47:14.572 --> 00:47:16.642
Well, I...

776
00:47:16.642 --> 00:47:20.613
I... I think I do.

777
00:47:21.512 --> 00:47:22.512
You think?

778
00:47:23.113 --> 00:47:24.813
You said you remembered.

779
00:47:24.813 --> 00:47:27.052
Well, I...

780
00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:29.023
Then you need to keep the promise you made.

781
00:47:29.253 --> 00:47:30.253
Okay?

782
00:47:30.722 --> 00:47:32.293
The promise?

783
00:47:38.492 --> 00:47:40.702
Your friend is too drunk.

784
00:47:41.363 --> 00:47:42.503
Hurry.

785
00:47:46.742 --> 00:47:48.242
- What? - What's going on?

786
00:47:49.173 --> 00:47:50.642
She seems slow.

787
00:47:52.843 --> 00:47:53.943
Hi.

788
00:47:57.313 --> 00:47:58.753
Mic test.

789
00:47:59.653 --> 00:48:01.523
Mic test.

790
00:48:02.052 --> 00:48:03.423
She must be crazy.

791
00:48:03.593 --> 00:48:05.093
Hey! Ma Jin Joo!

792
00:48:05.653 --> 00:48:08.262
Bo Reum, come down here!

793
00:48:08.262 --> 00:48:09.293
My goodness.

794
00:48:11.093 --> 00:48:13.602
That lady's gone senile.

795
00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:16.302
Why did she drink so much?

796
00:48:18.503 --> 00:48:19.903
Hey, penny pincher.

797
00:48:19.903 --> 00:48:20.972
Goodness.

798
00:48:21.572 --> 00:48:23.572
Come here, cheapskate.

799
00:48:23.572 --> 00:48:24.773
Cheapskate.

800
00:48:28.443 --> 00:48:30.012
Cheapskate.

801
00:48:32.052 --> 00:48:33.852
Come down here.

802
00:48:34.883 --> 00:48:37.093
You aren't the only young thing. I'm young too.

803
00:48:40.923 --> 00:48:44.032
Someone gave me his number saying I'm pretty.

804
00:48:47.702 --> 00:48:50.072
I'm the best

805
00:48:55.543 --> 00:48:57.572
You're the one who fell for me.

806
00:48:57.972 --> 00:48:59.142
Aren't you?

807
00:49:04.253 --> 00:49:05.352
Doctor Park?

808
00:49:05.713 --> 00:49:07.253
I'll call you.

809
00:49:08.282 --> 00:49:09.653
Jin Joo, my goodness.

810
00:49:10.753 --> 00:49:12.222
She doesn't know what he's like.

811
00:49:13.363 --> 00:49:14.793
That jerk.

812
00:49:15.122 --> 00:49:16.162
Hey.

813
00:49:16.662 --> 00:49:17.932
Cheapskate.

814
00:49:19.093 --> 00:49:20.333
Because of you...

815
00:49:21.733 --> 00:49:24.173
my life got totally ruined.

816
00:49:27.102 --> 00:49:28.903
But what about Seo Jin?

817
00:49:36.282 --> 00:49:37.552
Seo Jin.

818
00:49:40.923 --> 00:49:42.222
What will you do?

819
00:49:47.523 --> 00:49:48.963
- What? - She must be drunk.

820
00:49:48.963 --> 00:49:50.892
She keeps saying nonsense.

821
00:49:52.662 --> 00:49:54.662
- Is she crazy? - Gosh.

822
00:49:55.532 --> 00:49:56.702
I guess so.

823
00:50:06.412 --> 00:50:08.213
What's this?

824
00:50:19.963 --> 00:50:21.162
What the...

825
00:50:22.923 --> 00:50:24.193
What is that?

826
00:50:24.532 --> 00:50:27.202
Cheapskate. I mean you. Choi...

827
00:50:47.682 --> 00:50:49.153
Gosh.

828
00:50:56.593 --> 00:50:58.463
- Come on. - Hey.

829
00:50:58.463 --> 00:51:00.602
Gosh.

830
00:51:00.662 --> 00:51:02.532
- Gosh. Do you want to die? - Stop it.

831
00:51:02.532 --> 00:51:04.773
- Let me go. - Gosh.

832
00:51:05.932 --> 00:51:07.142
You with the long hair.

833
00:51:07.702 --> 00:51:09.372
Never come back again.

834
00:51:10.313 --> 00:51:12.673
He's really drunk.

835
00:51:14.343 --> 00:51:17.213
Sir, go home and sleep. You'll freeze.

836
00:51:20.883 --> 00:51:22.923
- Hey. Get up! - Hey.

837
00:51:23.523 --> 00:51:25.753
I can't believe you. Why did you drink so much?

838
00:51:25.923 --> 00:51:27.193
- Gosh. - Hey.

839
00:51:27.193 --> 00:51:28.392
Hey, Ban Do.

840
00:51:28.622 --> 00:51:31.492
Who's Seo Jin? Why was she looking for him?

841
00:51:32.333 --> 00:51:33.463
Where are you going?

842
00:51:35.602 --> 00:51:36.733
I'll see you tomorrow.

843
00:51:38.133 --> 00:51:39.833
Hey. Wait.

844
00:51:39.833 --> 00:51:42.043
Who's going to take care of this mess?

845
00:51:42.043 --> 00:51:43.713
- Ban Do! - Do I smell?

846
00:51:44.072 --> 00:51:45.972
- Jerk. - Wake up.

847
00:51:49.412 --> 00:51:51.012
But what about Seo Jin?

848
00:51:52.182 --> 00:51:53.253
Seo Jin.

849
00:51:54.923 --> 00:51:56.122
What will you do?

850
00:52:19.313 --> 00:52:22.742
Dear fellow students, are you having a good morning?

851
00:52:23.383 --> 00:52:25.012
Spring is here.

852
00:52:25.383 --> 00:52:28.952
I wonder what this year's summer will be like.

853
00:52:29.682 --> 00:52:31.452
We'll listen to a song now.

854
00:52:31.793 --> 00:52:33.722
"Addio" by Yangpa.

855
00:52:44.802 --> 00:52:47.273
- I can't hold it anymore. - Hey.

856
00:52:48.602 --> 00:52:50.043
I can't either.

857
00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:57.083
Are you feeling okay?

858
00:53:00.782 --> 00:53:02.153
Hey, Ma Jin Joo.

859
00:53:04.153 --> 00:53:05.322
What are you doing?

860
00:53:06.662 --> 00:53:08.892
- Gosh. - Gosh. What are you doing?

861
00:53:08.892 --> 00:53:11.032
- Follow me. - Hey. Let me go.

862
00:53:15.202 --> 00:53:16.262
Hey.

863
00:53:16.872 --> 00:53:18.333
You said let's go separate ways.

864
00:53:18.403 --> 00:53:19.633
Why are you acting like you know me?

865
00:53:19.633 --> 00:53:20.943
"Why are you acting like you know me?"

866
00:53:21.242 --> 00:53:22.372
You...

867
00:53:24.142 --> 00:53:25.813
You don't know what he's really like.

868
00:53:28.043 --> 00:53:29.113
What?

869
00:53:31.512 --> 00:53:33.423
- Give it to me. - Give you what?

870
00:53:33.822 --> 00:53:36.153
His number you got last night in the club.

871
00:53:36.753 --> 00:53:38.793
Do you really think you're 20 years old?

872
00:53:39.523 --> 00:53:40.622
What are you doing?

873
00:53:40.963 --> 00:53:42.762
Why are you trying to take his number?

874
00:53:43.122 --> 00:53:46.093
It's none of your business whether not I get a number from a guy.

875
00:53:47.233 --> 00:53:50.233
You're a woman with a kid.

876
00:53:50.733 --> 00:53:54.343
How can you get drunk and cause a ruckus?

877
00:53:57.943 --> 00:53:59.213
Don't call him.

878
00:53:59.572 --> 00:54:00.883
He's really a piece of trash.

879
00:54:00.983 --> 00:54:02.043
Hey, mister.

880
00:54:02.313 --> 00:54:05.383
Why do you care if I drink or dance...

881
00:54:05.412 --> 00:54:06.883
or meet trashy people.

882
00:54:07.782 --> 00:54:09.452
It's none of your business.

883
00:54:11.293 --> 00:54:12.753
Fine, we're strangers.

884
00:54:12.753 --> 00:54:14.923
But why do you keep blabbering about me?

885
00:54:15.822 --> 00:54:17.333
Are you advertising our divorce?

886
00:54:17.693 --> 00:54:21.563
Why don't you put up a poster saying we have a kid too?

887
00:54:22.903 --> 00:54:25.072
Well, it was because I was drunk.

888
00:54:26.403 --> 00:54:27.802
You don't think I can do that?

889
00:54:28.302 --> 00:54:29.503
That's a fact.

890
00:54:29.843 --> 00:54:32.072
A fact, my foot.

891
00:54:32.773 --> 00:54:36.083
If that gets out, you and I both will be doomed.

892
00:54:37.583 --> 00:54:39.083
It won't be the both of us.

893
00:54:44.593 --> 00:54:47.963
If that gets out, you and I both will be doomed.

894
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:53.963
It won't be the both of us.

895
00:54:54.363 --> 00:54:58.233
You're a married man, but you're after your first love.

896
00:54:58.333 --> 00:55:01.273
Does she know that you're married with a kid?

897
00:55:01.472 --> 00:55:04.543
Why am I married? I'm divorced.

898
00:55:08.242 --> 00:55:10.753
Nobody here knows that I've been married.

899
00:55:10.813 --> 00:55:12.253
What about you?

900
00:55:12.282 --> 00:55:15.653
You're a married woman with a kid. But you were so happy...

901
00:55:15.753 --> 00:55:17.293
in a young man's arms.

902
00:55:17.423 --> 00:55:19.963
You're worse than me, lady.

903
00:55:19.963 --> 00:55:22.122
- What's going on? - Are they cheating on each other?

904
00:55:22.162 --> 00:55:23.662
Gosh, that's crazy.

905
00:55:23.762 --> 00:55:26.293
You mean yesterday? That was an accident.

906
00:55:29.003 --> 00:55:31.173
You better pay me the alimony.

907
00:55:31.233 --> 00:55:33.242
I'm going to get every penny from you.

908
00:55:33.242 --> 00:55:34.872
I'm a student.

909
00:55:34.972 --> 00:55:36.742
I can't even earn enough to buy gum.

910
00:55:36.843 --> 00:55:38.313
I'm a student with no money.

911
00:55:38.412 --> 00:55:40.043
I won't give it to you.

912
00:55:40.142 --> 00:55:41.912
I won't. Why would I give it to you?

913
00:55:42.182 --> 00:55:43.512
That's crazy.

914
00:55:44.182 --> 00:55:45.412
A married student?

915
00:55:54.423 --> 00:55:56.023
You cheapskate.

916
00:55:57.293 --> 00:55:58.432
What?

917
00:55:58.432 --> 00:56:00.463
You like gum, don't you?

918
00:56:10.113 --> 00:56:11.142
(Epilogue)

919
00:56:11.142 --> 00:56:14.483
(Honeymoon phase in 2004)

920
00:56:14.483 --> 00:56:15.583
You know what?

921
00:56:16.483 --> 00:56:18.182
We already used up this month's living expenses.

922
00:56:19.253 --> 00:56:20.923
We have to be frugal.

923
00:56:20.952 --> 00:56:22.282
Really? Already?

924
00:56:22.622 --> 00:56:23.693
It's only the beginning of the month.

925
00:56:26.423 --> 00:56:27.892
How are we going to get by?

926
00:56:28.423 --> 00:56:30.532
We'll get by with my love.

927
00:56:32.262 --> 00:56:33.403
You're right.

928
00:56:35.102 --> 00:56:36.733
What was that for?

929
00:56:42.903 --> 00:56:44.012
What did you do today?

930
00:56:44.813 --> 00:56:49.142
I cleaned, cooked, and organized the ledger.

931
00:56:49.642 --> 00:56:51.012
- You? - Me?

932
00:56:54.023 --> 00:56:55.822
I accomplished something big today.

933
00:56:57.222 --> 00:57:00.392
They said no newbie ever got so many contracts like me.

934
00:57:00.722 --> 00:57:01.722
Aren't I awesome?

935
00:57:02.563 --> 00:57:04.733
You'll be the best sales person.

936
00:57:04.733 --> 00:57:06.262
Good job.

937
00:57:14.142 --> 00:57:15.242
By the way,

938
00:57:15.872 --> 00:57:18.813
what would we be doing if we weren't married?

939
00:57:20.682 --> 00:57:21.742
What do you think?

940
00:57:21.742 --> 00:57:24.352
We'd be spending frivolously and wasting money like others.

941
00:57:24.983 --> 00:57:26.153
You think so?

942
00:57:26.952 --> 00:57:29.153
I kind of want to live frivolously for once.

943
00:57:29.452 --> 00:57:31.952
Why? Is there something you want to do?

944
00:57:34.093 --> 00:57:35.563
- What about you? - Me?

945
00:57:40.563 --> 00:57:41.833
Let's both say it at once.

946
00:57:42.602 --> 00:57:45.173
In 1, 2, 3.

947
00:57:45.173 --> 00:57:46.233
- Go clubbing. - Go clubbing.

948
00:58:08.463 --> 00:58:10.633
Our youth, which was like springtime that passed by...

949
00:58:10.633 --> 00:58:12.262
without giving us a chance to look at the flowers,

950
00:58:12.293 --> 00:58:13.532
went around and around,

951
00:58:13.702 --> 00:58:16.333
and returned to us even more passionately,

952
00:58:16.532 --> 00:58:17.972
and more intensely.

953
00:58:21.972 --> 00:58:24.773
(Bucket List, 1. Go to a night club.)

954
00:58:31.912 --> 00:58:33.282
I thought Jin Joo threw that away.

955
00:58:33.782 --> 00:58:35.153
Why did you bring it back?

956
00:58:35.452 --> 00:58:38.392
I can revive it. It's not completely dead yet.

957
00:58:59.273 --> 00:59:02.213
(Go Back Couple)

958
00:59:02.213 --> 00:59:04.852
There's a student in our school who has been through a divorce.

959
00:59:04.852 --> 00:59:06.622
Amazing people have shown up.

960
00:59:06.622 --> 00:59:08.322
Are you asking me out on a date?

961
00:59:10.622 --> 00:59:13.293
Could you be more gentle when you save someone?

962
00:59:13.622 --> 00:59:15.162
You should take care of yourself.

963
00:59:16.733 --> 00:59:18.733
Why did you suddenly do that?

964
00:59:18.733 --> 00:59:21.063
You asked me for my number, then you came to visit me.

965
00:59:21.063 --> 00:59:22.432
You seem like a different person.

966
00:59:22.762 --> 00:59:24.202
You're unbelievable.

967
00:59:24.432 --> 00:59:26.003
Why would your heart flutter at that moment?

968
00:59:26.642 --> 00:59:28.372
I'd like to know more about you.
