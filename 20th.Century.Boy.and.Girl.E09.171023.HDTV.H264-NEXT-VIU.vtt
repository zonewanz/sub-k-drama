00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:09.397
Gosh, my cellphone.

2
00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:12.226
I think I left it in the car. I'll go get it.

3
00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:29.617
Hey, he pulled the car and received gifts from his fans yesterday.

4
00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:30.747
Are you serious?

5
00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:33.386
Why didn't we go there yesterday?

6
00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.356
I thought he'd drink all night long.

7
00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:38.956
I mean, why do I always not get to see him?

8
00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.197
Even a passing dog sees him, and I don't.

9
00:00:41.827 --> 00:00:44.496
I hope I can see his face at least once.

10
00:00:44.827 --> 00:00:47.267
Why did it have to be yesterday of all days?

11
00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:55.236
It's all good.

12
00:00:59.147 --> 00:01:03.047
We're all ready. We just need Anthony to walk in now.

13
00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:56.166
Okay.

14
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.507
Go, go. Let's go.

15
00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:12.717
- She's so pretty. - She's really pretty.

16
00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:22.926
Camera five, are you getting the corner?

17
00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:24.266
Yes, that's it.

18
00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.636
(We Got Married)

19
00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:31.766
Here you go.

20
00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:40.747
(You are now a couple.)

21
00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:43.377
(Come up with a sweet nickname for each other.)

22
00:02:52.027 --> 00:02:54.757
Do you want something? Coffee?

23
00:02:55.326 --> 00:02:57.227
A soda? Or water?

24
00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.636
I made him feel uncomfortable.

25
00:03:08.636 --> 00:03:11.206
I should not. I'm remorseful. Let's be careful.

26
00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:15.016
What nicknames should we go for?

27
00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:18.586
Shall we think about that?

28
00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:38.106
People are saying you look nicer than Rain and Kim Tae Hee.

29
00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:39.366
I knew it.

30
00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:41.676
You should exchange phone numbers,

31
00:03:41.676 --> 00:03:44.606
get together with a beer if you can, and get closer.

32
00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:46.277
For the sake of the show.

33
00:03:46.277 --> 00:03:48.046
Sure. It was a long day.

34
00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:49.947
- Great job. - Bye.

35
00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:52.447
What a downpour.

36
00:03:52.447 --> 00:03:55.516
- See you for our next shoot. - Okay, bye.

37
00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:57.157
- Let's go. - Well done today.

38
00:03:57.157 --> 00:03:58.757
Yes, thanks.

39
00:03:58.757 --> 00:04:01.127
Jin Jin, can you wait here?

40
00:04:01.127 --> 00:04:02.856
I'll get you an umbrella.

41
00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:10.937
I'll walk you to your car.

42
00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:41.667
I love the smell of autumn rain.

43
00:04:52.976 --> 00:04:54.047
Hello?

44
00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:56.877
50,000 dollars?

45
00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:00.286
Sure, I'll see what I can do.

46
00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:04.257
It's no trouble at all. Did you skip dinner again?

47
00:05:05.357 --> 00:05:08.427
- You'll get sick doing that. - Jin Jin.

48
00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:12.497
Just a moment.

49
00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:13.997
Thanks.

50
00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:20.677
Okay, take care of yourself.

51
00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:51.206
Fess up while we're being nice.

52
00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:56.377
Real friends celebrate a friend's good news.

53
00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:58.406
We're ready...

54
00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:00.447
to celebrate your great news.

55
00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:01.846
Now fess up.

56
00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:06.947
Stop grinning so hard. What happened today? Tell us.

57
00:06:06.947 --> 00:06:09.117
How dare you?

58
00:06:09.687 --> 00:06:11.526
This won't do.

59
00:06:12.187 --> 00:06:15.927
You evil witch. We shall punish you.

60
00:06:15.927 --> 00:06:18.427
Fess up right now. Confess.

61
00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.096
Confess. Tell us.

62
00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:21.737
What happened today?

63
00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:24.466
- Tell us or else. - Stop! Stop it!

64
00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:26.307
- Go on. - I won't!

65
00:06:26.307 --> 00:06:28.136
(The fifth story: Everybody has secrets)

66
00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:29.636
Tell us right now.

67
00:06:32.247 --> 00:06:33.877
What was your first impression?

68
00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:36.146
(Anthony's first impression?)

69
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.447
Jin Jin? What was your first impression of him?

70
00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.586
(Zoned out)

71
00:06:44.326 --> 00:06:45.726
It was good to see her.

72
00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:50.096
I watched her movies and dramas.

73
00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:52.667
Jin Jin said she's been a long-time fan of yours.

74
00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:55.466
(Jin Jin is a long-time fan.)

75
00:06:55.466 --> 00:06:59.766
Right. I'm always thankful for my fans.

76
00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:04.877
It's a secret, okay? Keep it a secret.

77
00:07:04.877 --> 00:07:07.677
That's it? It's nothing, really.

78
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.877
It's "We Got Married" with Anthony.

79
00:07:09.877 --> 00:07:13.547
It's a virtual relationship. It's not real. It's fake.

80
00:07:13.547 --> 00:07:16.057
Still, you never know what will happen.

81
00:07:18.286 --> 00:07:19.487
I love it.

82
00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:29.067
- Ji Won, let's play a game. - I'll be right there.

83
00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:06.706
(In 1999)

84
00:08:19.317 --> 00:08:21.557
Who is this woman?

85
00:08:22.687 --> 00:08:25.187
Don't call her that. That's my mother.

86
00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:27.226
This is...

87
00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:30.766
the only photo Anthony has of him with his mom.

88
00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:34.466
She died giving birth to him.

89
00:08:35.537 --> 00:08:38.466
He never got to say "mom" to her.

90
00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:40.736
Jin Jin.

91
00:08:41.006 --> 00:08:42.606
- Look at this. - What?

92
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:46.407
Her eyes and Anthony's are the same, aren't they?

93
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:50.047
Jin Jin! Sa Jin Jin!

94
00:08:50.047 --> 00:08:51.447
What?

95
00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:09.996
You just redid your interior.

96
00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:12.106
Our upstairs neighbor's boiler exploded.

97
00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:14.706
Oh, dear, your house must be a mess.

98
00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:16.476
Come over to my place.

99
00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:18.447
It's fine. I'm staying at the house upstairs.

100
00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:19.706
- Upstairs? - Yes.

101
00:09:19.706 --> 00:09:22.076
- It's my friend's place. - Won't you feel uncomfortable?

102
00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:24.887
It'll be fine. We're really good friends.

103
00:09:36.057 --> 00:09:37.567
Yes, that's right.

104
00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:40.537
- With the parents. - Still?

105
00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:44.206
Your friend doesn't have a wife yet?

106
00:09:46.466 --> 00:09:48.576
That new dye job really...

107
00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:58.116
I'll call you back.

108
00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:00.657
Sorry, I thought you were my brother.

109
00:10:02.557 --> 00:10:05.287
What are you doing here?

110
00:10:28.817 --> 00:10:31.517
Sorry, I didn't know. What should I do?

111
00:10:31.787 --> 00:10:32.917
I don't care.

112
00:10:33.187 --> 00:10:35.887
- Alone? - Yes.

113
00:10:36.586 --> 00:10:39.726
- Why? What about your... - Come on, let's play a game.

114
00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:42.726
Okay. I have a lot to say. Let's take our time.

115
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.126
No. You can't talk to a pig.

116
00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:48.236
You play Real Madrid, I'll play Barcelona. Deal?

117
00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:51.236
- Deal. - At last, I can play with a human.

118
00:10:51.736 --> 00:10:54.037
- Are you good? - I always played against the PC.

119
00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:57.777
Here you go.

120
00:10:58.876 --> 00:11:00.147
There.

121
00:11:09.687 --> 00:11:11.086
Don't look. You'll ruin your eyesight.

122
00:11:11.826 --> 00:11:14.756
You're such an embarrassment. Aren't you ashamed?

123
00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:18.427
Why should I feel ashamed? We're friends,

124
00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:19.897
- aren't we? - Yes.

125
00:11:19.996 --> 00:11:22.336
It's good to see her eat so well after a long time.

126
00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:25.506
I heard the construction starts tomorrow.

127
00:11:25.907 --> 00:11:27.876
While we're at it, we should get...

128
00:11:27.876 --> 00:11:29.476
the ceiling and the walls redone too.

129
00:11:29.637 --> 00:11:33.346
I was going to do that. There's a lot to tend to.

130
00:11:35.547 --> 00:11:38.187
You don't have to mind it. You can relax, my friend.

131
00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:40.187
Thanks, my friend.

132
00:11:44.626 --> 00:11:46.126
How did your first night go?

133
00:11:46.687 --> 00:11:47.897
Remember this.

134
00:11:48.297 --> 00:11:50.057
Your body is still like that of an infant's.

135
00:11:50.356 --> 00:11:51.596
My body is different from yours.

136
00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:53.797
I get it.

137
00:11:55.067 --> 00:11:57.466
Right, Ji Won is staying at my parents' place.

138
00:11:58.236 --> 00:12:00.067
His boiler ruptured, so he's staying for a few days.

139
00:12:00.537 --> 00:12:02.277
Why would he stay there? It'll be uncomfortable.

140
00:12:03.137 --> 00:12:04.777
Is his wife pretty?

141
00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:10.017
He's here by himself. There must be a long story.

142
00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:12.116
He's full of stories.

143
00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:14.157
You should ask him about that while he's there.

144
00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:16.187
Ask what?

145
00:12:16.287 --> 00:12:18.326
You said you were really conscious about that.

146
00:12:28.836 --> 00:12:31.366
Do you have time? It'll only take five minutes.

147
00:12:32.866 --> 00:12:33.937
Sure.

148
00:12:44.187 --> 00:12:45.246
Anyway, what is it?

149
00:12:48.856 --> 00:12:50.586
I met this person for work,

150
00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:53.326
and I have to be really close with him, so I'm worried.

151
00:12:53.687 --> 00:12:55.297
- Is it a guy? - It's work.

152
00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:57.927
What kind of smell do men like?

153
00:13:04.307 --> 00:13:05.537
What do you think about this one?

154
00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:08.876
It's okay.

155
00:13:08.876 --> 00:13:09.976
Really?

156
00:13:14.277 --> 00:13:15.346
What about this one?

157
00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:18.517
This is okay too.

158
00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:27.297
Okay.

Right, don't you have to get to work?

161
00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:50.116
- Oh, I should go. - Right?

162
00:13:50.486 --> 00:13:51.616
I'm late.

- Goodbye. - Okay, bye.

We must grow away from our image as a latecomer.

00:14:09.866 --> 00:14:13.736
we must emphasize the importance of reaching the customers aggressively.

167
00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:16.836
How's the natural ingredient project of India going?

168
00:14:17.376 --> 00:14:21.147
India came up with a natural product that fights insects and diseases.

169
00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:24.147
We decided to make use of the materials from Egypt.

170
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.417
This product has been tested and confirmed for safety...

171
00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:29.557
in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand as well.

172
00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:30.986
Let's move on.

173
00:14:32.057 --> 00:14:33.157
Kimchi?

174
00:14:33.726 --> 00:14:35.797
You can eat it. I don't eat kimchi anyway.

175
00:14:36.427 --> 00:14:38.226
You should still be considerate of Mother.

176
00:14:38.767 --> 00:14:40.096
Your passcode is the same, right?

177
00:14:44.106 --> 00:14:47.177
Jin Jin, we're here. I'll come up right now.

178
00:14:49.037 --> 00:14:51.506
No, I'll be there. I already walked out the door.

179
00:15:56.277 --> 00:15:59.177
Here. President Jang said you can take time and look over them.

180
00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:02.947
Oh, and one of them is Producer Choi's new project.

181
00:16:03.047 --> 00:16:04.417
It's a blockbuster with 60 million dollars in budget.

182
00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.287
Oh, my. Okay.

183
00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:23.137
Something smells great.

184
00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:26.407
I don't think it's coming from you though.

185
00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:28.606
No, it's not me.

186
00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:37.187
Oh, the actress lady must've been here.

187
00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:44.187
Hong Hee, I heard you were visiting your parents.

188
00:16:45.856 --> 00:16:48.157
You can give this to them. And send them my regards.

189
00:16:49.456 --> 00:16:51.027
It's for them, not you. Take it.

190
00:16:52.397 --> 00:16:53.596
Thank you.

191
00:16:56.567 --> 00:17:00.606
Gosh, you don't look like the type, but you're pretty considerate.

192
00:17:01.006 --> 00:17:02.376
Did you say you have a younger brother?

193
00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:04.076
You definitely seem like the eldest daughter.

194
00:17:04.076 --> 00:17:06.276
I'm the youngest daughter. I have an older sister.

195
00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:09.016
What? How come I never heard that you have a sister?

196
00:17:10.816 --> 00:17:11.847
I'll get going.

197
00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:13.857
Jin Jin.

198
00:17:14.887 --> 00:17:15.986
Take this.

199
00:17:16.456 --> 00:17:18.056
It was buy 1 get 1 free.

200
00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:20.327
You're a newlywed bride, so you should take care of your skin.

201
00:17:20.327 --> 00:17:21.857
I'm a model for a cosmetics company.

202
00:17:22.226 --> 00:17:23.627
You can keep this for yourself next time.

203
00:17:25.466 --> 00:17:26.496
Bye.

204
00:17:26.496 --> 00:17:28.466
Jin Jin, have this. Open your mouth.

205
00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:32.566
- Bye, Jin Jin. - Goodbye.

206
00:17:45.786 --> 00:17:46.917
Do you live here?

207
00:17:52.327 --> 00:17:53.687
My brother lives here too.

208
00:18:28.956 --> 00:18:30.256
My brother lives here too.

209
00:18:32.367 --> 00:18:33.397
His brother?

210
00:18:35.036 --> 00:18:36.437
But he doesn't have a brother.

211
00:18:52.187 --> 00:18:55.187
It looks like you two will get married.

212
00:18:56.387 --> 00:18:58.056
My gut feelings are always right.

213
00:18:58.556 --> 00:19:01.296
When you two get married, I'll give you a huge present.

214
00:19:01.296 --> 00:19:03.157
Do you want a fridge?

215
00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:13.167
Ms. Han, I'm sorry. I should've told you before.

216
00:19:13.337 --> 00:19:15.337
I didn't want this to happen.

217
00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:19.046
Ji Hye, you are horrible at reading between the lines.

218
00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.417
I was joking.

219
00:19:21.816 --> 00:19:24.046
I'm already 35. Do you think I'm crazy?

220
00:19:24.486 --> 00:19:27.256
Look at her, she's so naive.

221
00:19:27.657 --> 00:19:31.456
I know that. Like I said, you had nothing to worry about.

222
00:19:32.927 --> 00:19:35.756
Ms. Han, Ji Hye was really worried about this.

223
00:19:36.097 --> 00:19:39.867
I told her numerous times that you'd understand.

224
00:19:39.867 --> 00:19:42.897
There's nothing to understand here.

225
00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:46.266
Forget about that. Let's eat.

226
00:19:46.437 --> 00:19:49.736
It's my treat today, so eat up. Okay?

227
00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:30.746
Hey, you fool.

228
00:20:31.187 --> 00:20:33.857
Me? I'm at the riverside of Han River.

229
00:20:34.716 --> 00:20:36.117
The riverside of Han River.

230
00:20:36.357 --> 00:20:38.587
Try to find me if you can.

231
00:20:38.657 --> 00:20:41.397
Am I at Yeouido? or Jamsil?

232
00:20:41.697 --> 00:20:44.597
Where am I right now? Let's grab a drink.

233
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.296
Hey, you're going to fall.

234
00:20:49.296 --> 00:20:52.407
I need water. I need more male energy!

235
00:20:52.407 --> 00:20:53.736
I have enough.

236
00:20:54.677 --> 00:20:57.246
- Let's go. - Hey, hey.

237
00:20:57.246 --> 00:20:58.706
- I'm sorry. - All right.

238
00:20:58.706 --> 00:21:00.077
- This is great. - Will you stay still?

239
00:21:01.316 --> 00:21:02.776
I'm the virgin ghost!

240
00:21:02.776 --> 00:21:04.216
Let's go! I'll get you.

241
00:21:04.216 --> 00:21:05.546
Will you please stop?

242
00:21:08.216 --> 00:21:09.587
- Stop it. - I'll get you!

243
00:21:09.956 --> 00:21:11.756
Hey, you know,

244
00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:14.956
- I lost weight once too. - Sure.

245
00:21:14.956 --> 00:21:16.397
- Oh, keep drinking. - I did it.

246
00:21:16.397 --> 00:21:19.127
I can be sexy too.

247
00:21:19.226 --> 00:21:22.036
Tall and sexy. Tall and sexy.

248
00:21:25.137 --> 00:21:27.677
I can do it!

249
00:21:27.677 --> 00:21:31.377
Tall and sexy. Tall and sexy.

250
00:21:31.377 --> 00:21:33.877
Tall and sexy. Gosh, I'm tired.

251
00:21:41.956 --> 00:21:43.016
Where are you going?

252
00:21:45.026 --> 00:21:46.157
I'm going for a walk.

253
00:21:51.697 --> 00:21:53.026
Again?

254
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.036
What?

255
00:21:55.036 --> 00:21:57.607
- Give me that. Let it go. - No, no.

256
00:22:01.337 --> 00:22:02.706
You told me to clean up my room.

257
00:22:02.706 --> 00:22:04.947
I wanted to throw them away on my way out.

258
00:22:06.276 --> 00:22:08.046
Goodness.

259
00:22:08.046 --> 00:22:11.286
You might get a hole in your stomach even before you get married.

260
00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:13.816
Stop drinking too much already.

261
00:22:13.816 --> 00:22:16.917
Why would I drink if I was going to drink only a little?

262
00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:20.796
How did I give birth to a brat like her?

263
00:22:20.796 --> 00:22:23.197
And my mom made me seaweed soup she got from Wan Island...

264
00:22:23.197 --> 00:22:25.226
for giving birth to that troublemaker.

265
00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:28.736
I'm so tired.

266
00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:30.867
It's a delivery.

267
00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.766
The resident of unit 1301 told me to put the package here.

268
00:22:33.036 --> 00:22:35.437
(From your vitamin)

269
00:22:41.746 --> 00:22:44.117
Yes, my package is here.

270
00:22:44.117 --> 00:22:46.847
It's Ji Won's. I think his wife sent it to him.

271
00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:48.687
What is she saying?

272
00:22:56.627 --> 00:22:59.597
Ji Won, I came back safely from my school field trip.

273
00:22:59.597 --> 00:23:03.036
I used up all the pocket money that you gave me.

274
00:23:03.036 --> 00:23:05.667
Enjoy your chocolate. With love.

275
00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:08.536
Oh, right. I'm going to Seoul soon.

276
00:23:08.536 --> 00:23:11.347
I'll let you go on a date with me. Let's go eat delicious food.

277
00:23:13.607 --> 00:23:15.917
- Is it the girl you talked about? - Yes.

278
00:23:15.917 --> 00:23:17.687
Right? I knew she was your sister.

279
00:23:18.387 --> 00:23:21.117
Then why did Jin Jin say such nonsense?

280
00:23:21.187 --> 00:23:22.357
What?

281
00:23:22.456 --> 00:23:25.786
She said you are married, and your wife sent you this.

282
00:23:26.556 --> 00:23:27.726
What?

283
00:23:34.966 --> 00:23:37.607
- Alone? - Yes.

284
00:23:38.867 --> 00:23:42.206
- Why? What about your... - Come on, let's play a game.

285
00:23:42.206 --> 00:23:43.276
Okay.

286
00:23:51.816 --> 00:23:52.947
Goodness.

287
00:23:57.587 --> 00:23:58.657
Are you busy?

288
00:24:07.397 --> 00:24:08.867
The gather of the Bongos.

289
00:24:08.867 --> 00:24:12.306
The Bongos was established in 1999,

290
00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:14.806
but its earliest beginning goes back to 1983, the year of our births.

291
00:24:14.806 --> 00:24:17.077
It's the social gathering with a long history.

292
00:24:17.746 --> 00:24:19.306
We didn't have you for 17 years,

293
00:24:19.306 --> 00:24:21.476
but staring today, we'll be complete again.

294
00:24:21.976 --> 00:24:23.347
Our main job is to have fried chicken.

295
00:24:23.347 --> 00:24:26.786
Koreans have a total of 80 million chickens a year.

296
00:24:27.157 --> 00:24:29.716
The Bongos is contributing a lot to it.

297
00:24:30.256 --> 00:24:33.726
What I mean is that the Bongos is a very healthy gathering.

298
00:24:34.256 --> 00:24:35.296
So...

299
00:24:37.056 --> 00:24:40.296
Tell your wife not to be mistaken about our relationship.

300
00:24:40.296 --> 00:24:41.697
She absolutely...

301
00:24:43.766 --> 00:24:44.937
doesn't need to.

302
00:24:47.107 --> 00:24:49.877
Men and women can't be friends as long as there are drinks and nights?

303
00:24:50.437 --> 00:24:52.407
That's ridiculous.

304
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:55.877
We're friends. We're just best friends.

305
00:24:55.877 --> 00:24:57.046
Who said that?

306
00:24:59.387 --> 00:25:02.157
Okay, we're just friends, not best friends.

307
00:25:12.566 --> 00:25:15.337
Who said that I was married?

308
00:25:31.647 --> 00:25:33.187
I'm not married.

309
00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:49.667
Let's not spread false rumors.

310
00:26:02.647 --> 00:26:05.316
- You're not married? - No.

311
00:26:05.917 --> 00:26:07.087
Not even once?

312
00:26:09.756 --> 00:26:11.526
- How about wedding... - Quiet.

313
00:26:12.526 --> 00:26:13.756
I almost got married.

314
00:26:14.327 --> 00:26:16.397
Then you called off...

315
00:26:16.397 --> 00:26:17.927
Quiet.

316
00:26:19.867 --> 00:26:22.867
Let's leave the past behind.

317
00:26:23.097 --> 00:26:24.107
What?

318
00:26:24.536 --> 00:26:26.637
We won't ask about your past.

319
00:26:26.637 --> 00:26:29.677
- Let's make it clear first. - What?

320
00:26:29.677 --> 00:26:32.877
We've never dated anyone before. And we don't have boyfriends.

321
00:26:34.216 --> 00:26:36.917
Then I'll make it clear too. Make what clear?

322
00:26:36.917 --> 00:26:38.316
I'm not dating anyone now.

323
00:26:39.447 --> 00:26:41.956
That's great. That's perfect.

324
00:26:41.956 --> 00:26:45.056
- Then let's settle it within here. - Settle what?

325
00:26:45.056 --> 00:26:47.427
I hate to admit it,

326
00:26:47.427 --> 00:26:50.627
but objectively speaking, he's okay.

327
00:26:50.627 --> 00:26:53.327
It's hard to meet someone as handsome as he is.

328
00:26:53.327 --> 00:26:55.697
And we don't want him to date other girls either.

329
00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:56.966
You're right about that.

330
00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:59.437
So choose one among us.

331
00:26:59.437 --> 00:27:01.236
Date one of us.

332
00:27:02.976 --> 00:27:04.276
Choose one. Who do you want?

333
00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:06.677
- Among you three? - Yes.

334
00:27:17.286 --> 00:27:19.056
Of course, it's you, Young Shim.

335
00:27:22.097 --> 00:27:24.367
I missed you every day.

336
00:27:31.206 --> 00:27:33.566
Why do we have to do this?

337
00:27:34.437 --> 00:27:36.206
It's obviously you,

338
00:27:36.536 --> 00:27:37.647
Ah Reum.

339
00:27:46.917 --> 00:27:50.687
What? You're not getting nervous, are you?

340
00:27:59.397 --> 00:28:00.996
I'm more nervous than you.

341
00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:04.607
I missed you, my Jin Jin.

342
00:28:20.387 --> 00:28:22.117
What's there to think?

343
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:23.927
I choose Jin Jin.

344
00:28:27.026 --> 00:28:28.197
Why?

345
00:28:29.357 --> 00:28:30.466
She's my first love.

346
00:28:35.337 --> 00:28:36.536
Your first love?

347
00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:39.206
First love, my foot.

348
00:28:39.206 --> 00:28:41.407
You think I don't know?

349
00:28:42.177 --> 00:28:45.877
- What? - You're after her money.

350
00:28:45.877 --> 00:28:48.246
You're such a scumbag.

351
00:28:48.246 --> 00:28:50.847
Where on earth did you go that you're being like this?

352
00:28:53.187 --> 00:28:55.587
Right. Where did you go?

353
00:28:55.587 --> 00:28:58.056
- We looked everywhere for you. - Right.

354
00:29:02.427 --> 00:29:04.827
Didn't I tell you?

355
00:29:07.597 --> 00:29:09.637
It's pouring down.

356
00:29:09.637 --> 00:29:12.337
- Goodness. - It's raining so hard.

357
00:29:12.337 --> 00:29:13.937
Why is it raining so hard?

358
00:29:14.306 --> 00:29:16.177
I hate it when it's cold.

359
00:29:17.647 --> 00:29:20.177
It's terrible. Hey, let's take the shortcut.

360
00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:21.216
Okay.

361
00:29:21.216 --> 00:29:22.877
Get home safely. It was nice to see you.

362
00:29:22.877 --> 00:29:23.986
Bye.

363
00:29:23.986 --> 00:29:25.647
- Bye. - Hold the umbrella.

364
00:29:46.167 --> 00:29:47.976
How old is your brother?

365
00:29:48.476 --> 00:29:51.107
- He's three years older than me. - I see.

366
00:29:52.107 --> 00:29:54.516
- And your sister is a junior? - Yes.

367
00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:58.887
- She must be so cute. - She's cute.

368
00:30:01.657 --> 00:30:03.857
You were cute too when you were a junior in high school.

369
00:30:35.986 --> 00:30:38.756
(Sa Jin Jin)

370
00:30:42.796 --> 00:30:43.897
But...

371
00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:46.667
why did we do it then?

372
00:30:50.097 --> 00:30:51.137
What do you mean?

373
00:30:52.966 --> 00:30:54.177
Why...

374
00:30:55.506 --> 00:30:57.147
did we break up?

375
00:31:10.087 --> 00:31:11.587
Don't you really remember?

376
00:31:12.187 --> 00:31:14.127
No, I don't. What is it?

377
00:31:14.127 --> 00:31:15.127
Forget it.

378
00:31:16.127 --> 00:31:17.766
I'll just ask the others then.

379
00:31:18.026 --> 00:31:20.397
Are you crazy? They don't know we dated.

380
00:31:20.397 --> 00:31:21.437
Why not?

381
00:31:21.996 --> 00:31:24.437
- Because it's a secret. - A secret?

382
00:31:24.536 --> 00:31:27.236
Yes, so don't tell them until the day you die.

383
00:31:28.907 --> 00:31:30.036
I refuse.

384
00:31:31.206 --> 00:31:32.246
You want to die?

385
00:31:32.877 --> 00:31:34.947
How could you say such a thing as an actress?

386
00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:38.447
Anyway, don't tell them.

387
00:31:40.187 --> 00:31:42.286
- I refuse. - Stop it.

388
00:31:46.602 --> 00:31:49.094
(Episode 10 will air shortly.)
