00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:07.709
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.720
I have a new goal.

3
00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:21.130
I need a Michelin Star in order to continue what I want to do.

4
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.990
(Michelin Star is a hallmark of fine dining quality and restaurants.)

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.659
I heard Michelin inspectors showed up in other restaurants.

6
00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.799
How did they know when they work in secret?

7
00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:31.970
It's not easy to make it a complete secret.

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.609
I'm sure people notice it somehow.

9
00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.609
That's right. I think I can tell right away.

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.279
People guess wrong all the time.

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.149
We have to be good always. Cramming won't work.

12
00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.579
They could've been here already.

13
00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:44.779
Let's be on our toes until November.

14
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.279
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

15
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.789
(Inside the kitchen of a French restaurant in Hongdae)

16
00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:54.060
(It's after lunch time.)

17
00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:55.990
I want to know what he's doing.

18
00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:58.029
I shouldn't call, right?

19
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.829
(Jung Sun)

20
00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:06.699
Why not?

21
00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:08.809
Let's just go.

22
00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.410
You have an interview.

23
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.800
Guess who?

24
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.369
You'll get hurt.

25
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100
You ruined the romantic moment.

26
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.990
I called you yesterday in front of Good Soup.

27
00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.729
I'm telling you where I was then.

28
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.350
Thank you.

29
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.590
I'm by your side.

30
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.130
The terrace is big.

31
00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.269
You'll have to buy a lot to fill the space.

32
00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.669
I won't buy a lot.

33
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.799
I'm just going to replant what I have,

34
00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.639
and get a few things.

35
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.370
You can buy what you want.

36
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.310
I'll pay for the few things you're going to buy.

37
00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.479
I'm securing a share of the terrace. Don't stop me.

38
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.690
I got it.

39
00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.400
Here.

40
00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.100
I want to nail it too.

41
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.239
All right. Do you know how to do it?

42
00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.269
Of course.

43
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.210
You'll hurt yourself like that.

44
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.940
I want to do it.

45
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.410
Give it to me.

46
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.750
- It's done. - It's done.

47
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.789
We did it.

48
00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.299
Jajangmyeon after work is the best.

49
00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:25.239
You got some on you too.

50
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.879
(Jung Sun's mom)

51
00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.080
It's your mom.

52
00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:34.679
Don't answer it.

53
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.950
- Why not? - Just don't.

54
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.350
There's no reason for her to call you.

55
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.320
You don't know that for sure. I should pick up.

56
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.160
Hi, Mother.

57
00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:53.429
How are you? It's been so long.

58
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.729
Why don't you call me?

59
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.340
Because I still find you difficult.

60
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.210
I'm not a difficult person.

61
00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.369
You're still dating Jung Sun, right?

62
00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:07.450
Of course. I'm with him right now.

63
00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.950
Is that right?

64
00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.650
How is Jung Sun feeling?

65
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.919
He's no different than usual.

66
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.059
Be nice to him.

67
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.330
Please be extra nice to him for me.

68
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.729
Okay.

69
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.160
If anything happens to Jung Sun,

70
00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.070
call me, all right?

71
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.700
Don't forget the emergency contact?

72
00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:32.640
Okay. Bye.

73
00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:44.720
What's wrong?

74
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.090
What did my mom say?

75
00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.359
Nothing much.

76
00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:55.660
She worried about you.

77
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.770
Are you upset because I answered her call?

78
00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.470
Mom and I aren't in good terms these days.

79
00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.570
I don't want you to be a messenger...

80
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.539
between my mom and me.

81
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.109
Put yourself in my shoes.

82
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.619
How could I decline her phone call?

83
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.619
She's your mother.

84
00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:23.520
I don't know what happened between you two,

85
00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.359
but she's still your mother.

86
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.160
You don't know everything about my mom...

87
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.460
and my family.

88
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.600
I still have things that are hard for me to tell you.

89
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.210
Your mother vaguely told me about it.

90
00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:44.979
I'm fine. You and your dad are different.

91
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.950
You have different lives.

92
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.820
Do you want coffee?

93
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.020
Are you uncomfortable talking about your family?

94
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.160
Sometimes I wish you'd just skip that subject.

95
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.499
I don't have blue mountain today.

96
00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:38.660
Hello?

97
00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:43.700
Hello. I'm Lee Hyun Soo's mother.

98
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.869
Yes, hello.

99
00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:50.640
I got your number from the gift you sent us.

100
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:52.910
I see.

101
00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.910
Could you make time to meet with me?

102
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.049
It'd be nice to see you.

103
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.189
I have time today. Will that work for you?

104
00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:16.570
Hello, Mr. Park.

105
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.140
Hello.

106
00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:21.770
- Please sit down. - Okay, thank you.

107
00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:27.379
Thank you...

108
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.419
for being good to Hyun Soo and us too.

109
00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:31.479
It's my pleasure.

110
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.720
You gave us such a wonderful gift the other time,

111
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.749
so I brought you something as a thank you.

112
00:08:37.859 --> 00:08:39.359
You didn't have to.

113
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.960
Open it.

114
00:08:45.499 --> 00:08:47.470
You should open it.

115
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.600
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.909
Citron is good for colds.

117
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.639
I make citron tea every year for cold and flu.

118
00:09:00.109 --> 00:09:01.749
I wanted to give some to you.

119
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.149
Thank you.

120
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.149
Thank you.

121
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.930
You and your dad are different.

122
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.470
You don't know about my mom...

123
00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:22.670
or my family.

124
00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:48.790
Are you sure you won't regret it?

125
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.259
You can't do business based on your emotions.

126
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.670
If you decide to cancel this right now,

127
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:55.970
I can take you back.

128
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.100
I won't be getting involved with you because of money again.

129
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.970
Yes. I hope we never have to.

130
00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:05.710
Your pride would be hurt.

131
00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:29.700
Hi, Jung Sun.

132
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.739
You have something to say me.

133
00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:32.970
How long will you avoid me?

134
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:34.810
I guess you heard from Hyun Soo...

135
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.739
that I asked about you.

136
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.580
I was scared to see you.

137
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.350
This has nothing to do with her. Don't drag her into it.

138
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.249
Don't call Hyun Soo again.

139
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.149
You care for her so much.

140
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.850
Why can't you care that much for me?

141
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.290
Never mind.

142
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.690
You care for me just as much.

143
00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.529
Add up the debt. I have to know how much it is.

144
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.639
He only says what he wants to say.

145
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.639
This is driving me crazy.

146
00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:44.540
What's important is that nothing changes between us,

147
00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.779
no matter how much people try to break us apart.

148
00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.460
My goodness.

149
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.029
What are you doing?

150
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800
Kyung.

151
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.430
Why do I feel lonely when I'm in love?

152
00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:09.930
What?

153
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.769
I'm in love,

154
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.040
but I feel emptier.

155
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.310
Hyun Soo, enough nonsense. Go inside and sleep.

156
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.779
Okay.

157
00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:24.749
Do you know this feeling?

158
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.119
Hyun Soo.

159
00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:29.190
A step further, and you'd be crazy.

160
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.519
Yes, I'm crazy. I think so too.

161
00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:38.700
(Salt)

162
00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:07.359
We have two reservations for lunch. One table will be foreigners.

163
00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:09.489
It's our first day with our new menu.

164
00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:10.629
Let's pay attention.

165
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:11.759
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

166
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.769
(I could only think...)

167
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.570
(I could only think of one thing at that time.)

168
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.909
Do you want tea?

169
00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:29.350
No, I'm on a roll. I'm going to keep going.

170
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.989
Please let me check with you one more time.

171
00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:40.729
Are there foods you cannot eat or any allergies?

172
00:13:40.729 --> 00:13:41.889
No.

173
00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:44.800
Would you like wine or anything to drink?

174
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.159
Yes, please.

175
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.710
Chef, I think we should pay extra attention to table nine.

176
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.550
- Why? - I think...

177
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.710
they might be Michelin inspectors.

178
00:14:03.149 --> 00:14:04.249
It's just a hunch.

179
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.889
Focus!

180
00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:13.560
Don't overreact, and focus on your job.

181
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.229
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

182
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.869
This dish is steak with puree made with carrots...

183
00:14:57.869 --> 00:14:59.840
and a bitter green.

184
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.639
Please enjoy.

185
00:15:11.779 --> 00:15:12.850
Delicious.

186
00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:23.659
Do you really think they're from Michelin?

187
00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:26.729
No. They wouldn't be so obvious.

188
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.600
I still want to have hope.

189
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.850
Stars?

190
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.619
They're from Michelin.

191
00:15:48.149 --> 00:15:50.590
- No. - There are stars. They must be.

192
00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:52.090
Are they gone?

193
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:54.960
Really?

194
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.259
Did you enjoy your meal?

195
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.369
I went to quite a few fine dining restaurants, and it's just my taste.

196
00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.269
Thank you.

197
00:16:04.369 --> 00:16:07.769
Chef On Jung Sun graduated from France's Le Cordon Bleu...

198
00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:09.970
I know. We researched.

199
00:16:10.609 --> 00:16:14.180
Will you contact me when you get a new menu?

200
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.210
A new menu?

201
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.879
I will. Thank you.

202
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.720
Thank you. Have a nice day.

203
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:21.619
Goodbye.

Are you done counting chickens? Who wants to do the staff work?

Why didn't Director Min come?

210
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.909
I'm sure he's on his way.

211
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:17.040
I should have come later.

212
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.250
If I'm here before him, it'll give him the higher hand.

213
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:27.290
Hello. I'm sorry I'm late.

214

Welcome.

215
00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:34.859
I don't plan on participating in your war.

216
00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:38.659
You can greet each other then move to another location.

217
00:17:40.469 --> 00:17:44.169
Director Min, it's important to get the first step right.

218
00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:45.240
Yes.

219
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.740
What are you trying to say?

220
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.679
I thought about...

221
00:17:50.679 --> 00:17:54.080
what I can do to work with you without getting stressed.

222
00:17:56.949 --> 00:17:58.020
And?

223
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.919
What is this?

224
00:18:04.389 --> 00:18:06.419
It's an agreement saying that I will sue you...

225
00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:08.290
if you touch my script.

226

(Business Agreement)

227
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.399
Wait...

228
00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:13.100
Are you joking with me?

229
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:17.240
I've never heard of such a strange agreement.

230
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.740
If you work with me,

231
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.840
you'll get to experience a lot of strange and fun things.

232
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.480
You're way ahead of yourself.

233
00:18:23.639 --> 00:18:25.740
I like your script.

234
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.080
Ms. Lee and I just didn't agree.

235
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.500
This sauce is addictive.

236
00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.740
You're seriously ill.

237
00:18:51.969 --> 00:18:54.570
Are you praising Chef On's sauce at a time like this?

238
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.570
It's so nice to have a chef boyfriend.

239
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.109
You think of him whenever you eat.

240
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.609
And eating makes you happy.

241
00:19:01.379 --> 00:19:03.820
That's true. It makes you happy.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.899
Yes, ma'am.

245
00:19:20.699 --> 00:19:21.730
What are you doing today?

246
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800
I'm working.

247
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.669
You should eat even when you work.

248
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:28.409
Let's eat together.

249
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.609
Okay.

250
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.909
I'm meeting Jung Sun soon.

251
00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:35.810
After I see him,

252
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:39.649
I will be very upset. That's why I want to see you.

253
00:19:40.949 --> 00:19:42.389
Yes, I understand.

254
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.530
- Was that Chef On's mother? - Yes.

255
00:19:49.389 --> 00:19:52.300
He's super great on his own.

256
00:19:52.429 --> 00:19:55.770
His mom is stupid. Super stupid.

257
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.439
Plus and minus makes it zero.

258
00:19:58.369 --> 00:19:59.800
You make me laugh.

259
00:20:13.449 --> 00:20:14.520
Here.

260
00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:25.760
I ordered your drink. Aren't you glad?

261
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.699
I don't want to talk too long.

262
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.740
How much did you borrow?

263
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:36.980
It's not much.

264
00:20:38.179 --> 00:20:40.750
I added it up since you asked me,

265
00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.550
and it's about 50,000 dollars.

266
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.689
Give me the exact number, so I can calculate the interest.

267
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.590
What interest? You're friends.

268
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.760
It's scary. Don't look at me like that.

269
00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:03.500
Fine.

270
00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:07.109
This must be the best you can do.

271
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.409
You have no choice but to live like this.

272
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.129
You're already here.

273
00:22:05.629 --> 00:22:07.369
What do you want to eat?

274
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:09.699
I studied the menu before you came.

275
00:22:10.139 --> 00:22:11.540
- Did you? - Yes.

276
00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:14.810
This is a bun cha. It's Vietnamese food.

277
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.510
It's a type of noodles. This is mixed noodles.

278
00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:20.750
There's one with soup. It's made with seafood broth.

279
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.290
Does it taste bad?

280
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.189
Do you want a drink?

281
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.199
It's the first menu we're introducing after Mr. Park left.

282
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.669
I'm nervous.

283
00:22:48.209 --> 00:22:50.409
I think it's too heavy to drink with seafood.

284
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480
I think so too.

285
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:01.320
This one is too light.

286
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.919
I personally recommend this one.

287
00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:08.990
It's very fruity and not too acidic.

288
00:23:09.629 --> 00:23:10.929
It has a nice balance.

289
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.500
I like it too.

290
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.969
It's even better since it has a pinch of sweetness.

291
00:23:16.969 --> 00:23:18.840
Then do we all agree?

292
00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:34.949
Will you listen to my life story?

293
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.859
You're a writer.

294
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.689
So...

295
00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:42.230
I feel like you'd understand. That's why I want to talk to you.

296
00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:45.129
Go ahead.

297
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.699
Why was I born?

298
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.609
Why was Jung Sun born to me to go through all this trouble?

299
00:23:58.109 --> 00:24:00.550
I feel sorry to him. I feel bad.

300
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.419
However, I can't fix myself.

301
00:24:10.389 --> 00:24:12.659
Do you think I could change if I try?

302
00:24:55.469 --> 00:24:56.669
Did you drink?

303
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.800
Yes, I did.

304
00:25:00.369 --> 00:25:01.639
Good job.

305
00:25:03.879 --> 00:25:06.040
Guess who I met with.

306
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.850
Who did you meet?

307
00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:10.050
Your mother.

308
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.550
What?

309
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.790
I met your mother.

310
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.619
You had drinks with Mom?

311
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.790
I was moved.

312
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.590
I want to be good to her.

313
00:25:22.659 --> 00:25:24.159
She asked you to meet, right?

314
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.100
Yes.

315
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.270
Didn't you think to tell me that you're going to her?

316
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.469
Do I have to tell you before?

317
00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:32.939
I told you, didn't I?

318
00:25:33.139 --> 00:25:34.840
Things are rough between us right now.

319
00:25:35.469 --> 00:25:38.310
I have a relationship with her too.

320
00:25:38.379 --> 00:25:40.649
I can't just tell her I won't meet her.

321
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.449
Your relationship with her...

322
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.179
is unnecessary if it wasn't for me.

323
00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:47.949
I can't leave her out if I want to be a part of your life.

324
00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:50.320
I'm trying.

325
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.490
Are you sure you're not just nervous about me?

326
00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.330
I am.

327
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.199
I'm nervous because you were never unsure before.

328
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.969
I'm scared you'd give up and disappear.

329
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.010
I've been swayed before.

330
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.550
So I know being swayed will make me stronger.

331
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.149
The more you're swayed,

332
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:21.250
the more you harden yourself and build yourself up.

333
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.659
You don't trust me.

334
00:26:23.659 --> 00:26:25.020
That's not true.

335
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.359
You just said so.

336
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.689
You're nervous because you think I'd give up and disappear.

337
00:26:35.629 --> 00:26:37.399
Do you think it's just fun and games for me?

338
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.939
Why do you only think about yourself?

339
00:27:04.929 --> 00:27:07.469
(Temperature of Love)

340
00:27:08.129 --> 00:27:09.800
I told you not to sell that land.

341
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.340
It's my property, and I'll do what I please with it.

342
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.510
Must you take money from Jung Sun?

343
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.840
Should I go on my knees?

344
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.469
They have to open up her head for the surgery?

345
00:27:16.469 --> 00:27:18.879
Why do we have to wait three months for her surgery?

346
00:27:18.879 --> 00:27:20.449
Talk to Mr. Park.

347
00:27:20.449 --> 00:27:22.209
- How can I do that? - Is it because of Jung Sun?

348
00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:23.719
- Where are you? - Something urgent came up.

349
00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:24.820
I'll call you after work.

350
00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.550
What if it explodes while we wait?

351
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.389
Why didn't you tell me about your mother's condition?

352
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:30.490
I was waiting for you.

353
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.889
When will you allow me into your life?

354
00:27:33.889 --> 00:27:35.560
You're already in my life.

355
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.830
How come I don't feel like I am?
