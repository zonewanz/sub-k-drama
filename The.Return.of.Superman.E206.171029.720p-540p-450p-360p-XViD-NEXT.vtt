1
00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:03.241
(Parental guidance advised for viewers under the age of 12.)

2
00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:06.343
Seol A and Soo A.

3
00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:08.513
Can you write your names yet or not?

4
00:00:08.513 --> 00:00:09.612
- I can... - It's a bit...

5
00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:12.352
- hard for me. - What is this?

6
00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:13.583
Write "Lee Soo A".

7
00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.323
- Write "Lee Soo A"? - Yes.

8
00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:18.422
I want to see who can write their names well.

9
00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:20.022
- One at a time. - I can do it.

10
00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.222
Seol A, look.

11
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.362
Soo...

12
00:00:24.132 --> 00:00:26.533
(What was next again?)

13
00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.472
(Soo A writes carefully and intelligently.)

14
00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:31.573
A circle.

15
00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:37.912
They're all grown up...

16
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.412
now that they can write their names.

17
00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:41.243
It's perfect.

18
00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:42.883
(Oh, It's brilliant.)

19
00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:44.652
I'm done, Daddy.

20
00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:48.023
Soo A, you did a great job.

21
00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:52.052
(Seol A surely but slowly writes her name.)

22
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.923
Daddy, I'm done.

23
00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.893
You did a great job too, Seol A.

24
00:00:57.893 --> 00:01:00.133
You've all written your names down, right?

25
00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:02.533
Now, whose dog is this?

26
00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:04.202
- It's mine. - Is it yours, Seol A?

27
00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:05.402
No, it's mine.

28
00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.303
You can get into fights while sharing toys.

29
00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:11.642
So, I've come up with an idea.

30
00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:15.113
(Whenever they get new toys...)

31
00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:16.652
(I want to try too.)

32
00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:19.383
(They all begin to covet them.)

33
00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:21.853
(Hey!)

34
00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:24.422
(A fiery battle of ownership ensues.)

35
00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:27.922
(Soo Jin asks, "Why?")

36
00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:30.163
(The toy inside is mine,)

37
00:01:30.163 --> 00:01:32.062
(but Soo A keeps taking it.)

38
00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:34.402
(They all cry and take claim.)

39
00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:36.333
But it's mine.

40
00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:40.303
You'll be labeling everything that's yours.

41
00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:42.913
Anything yellow will be Seol A's.

42
00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:46.142
Anything pink will belong to Soo A.

43
00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:48.113
Stick them on anything that's yours.

44
00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:49.913
Once they're labelled, they're yours, Soo A.

45
00:01:49.913 --> 00:01:51.652
(This method can curb ownership arguments.)

46
00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:53.823
You'll all stop fighting now, okay?

47
00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.892
Si An, everything they have...

48
00:01:56.892 --> 00:01:58.792
will become yours once they get older.

49
00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.463
You'll end up inheriting all their toys.

50
00:02:02.193 --> 00:02:03.392
Okay?

51
00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:04.762
I'm going to visit the supermarket,

52
00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:05.792
so finish the task.

53
00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.032
- Okay. - Okay.

54
00:02:07.032 --> 00:02:09.032
The Return of Superman, episode 204.

55
00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:11.233
"We Need Secrets of Our Own."

56
00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:15.203
Everything here is mine.

57
00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:16.972
(She frantically labels everything...)

58
00:02:16.972 --> 00:02:18.613
(just in case she'll lose them to Soo A.)

59
00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:21.513
This doll is mine.

60
00:02:22.412 --> 00:02:25.282
Then, the TV is mine.

61
00:02:26.382 --> 00:02:29.122
The fan is also mine.

62
00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.763
And this is mine too.

63
00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:36.062
Si An's toys are mine too.

64
00:02:36.062 --> 00:02:38.233
(Si An got tagged by Seol A.)

65
00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:41.833
Si An, you're mine now.

66
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.233
The bedroom is mine.

67
00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:45.833
(The possession dispute continues.)

68
00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.773
I'm going to stick more.

69
00:02:47.773 --> 00:02:50.713
No, I'm going to put more stickers.

70
00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:52.572
My little rascals.

71
00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:56.183
(What's all this?)

72
00:02:57.953 --> 00:02:59.083
- Hello. - Daddy...

73
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:02.352
(There are Post-it notes everywhere.)

74
00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:03.953
Why are there so many of them everywhere?

75
00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.923
- What's wrong? - Look at me.

76
00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:10.062
Take a good look. Ta-da.

77
00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:12.592
Everything got labelled?

78
00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.863
Yes, I stuck them everywhere.

79
00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:16.532
No, it wasn't you, Si An.

80
00:03:16.532 --> 00:03:18.072
It was Seol A.

81
00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:21.243
No, I stuck all of them.

82
00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:22.912
Take a look at them.

83
00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.412
What? Stuck what?

84
00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:27.583
- This. - Whose is that?

85
00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.083
(The labels have changed to greenish yellow.)

86
00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:33.282
Si An stuck them all over, but they're all mine.

87
00:03:33.282 --> 00:03:35.083
(Si An sneakily labelled everything.)

88
00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:41.023
Everyone is surprised.

89
00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:43.162
I didn't give you any. Where did you get these?

90
00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:46.833
I did...

91
00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:51.773
(Si An is concerned over something.)

92
00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:55.102
While his sisters fought over their stuff,

93
00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:57.942
he secretly participated in the ownership battle.

94
00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:59.213
(Greenish yellow Post-its?)

95
00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.912
(I have an idea.)

96
00:04:02.312 --> 00:04:04.613
This belongs to me now.

97
00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:06.852
I put it on the TV too.

98
00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:08.882
This isn't done yet.

99
00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.592
(He meticulously takes off the yellow memo.)

100
00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:13.322
This isn't Soo A's.

101
00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.793
It's mine.

102
00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:20.762
(He posts his label on it.)

103
00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:24.173
This is my potty.

104
00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:25.603
(He plans to win back all his stuff.)

105
00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.103
This is mine now.

106
00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.872
- You're mine too, right? - Sure.

107
00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:34.642
Only focus on me.

108
00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:37.983
(He enjoys a moment to himself.)

109
00:04:38.252 --> 00:04:39.622
There it is.

110
00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:43.223
(Soo A has already claimed this banana.)

111
00:04:43.522 --> 00:04:47.593
I'm going to take this off the banana.

112
00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:51.363
I like bananas.

113
00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:54.002
This banana is delicious.

114
00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:59.033
This banana is tasty.

115
00:04:59.272 --> 00:05:02.243
It's tasty because it's mine.

116
00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:06.142
Whose greenish yellow Post-its are these?

117
00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:07.913
It's mine.

118
00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:09.212
- Is it yours? - Yes.

119
00:05:09.882 --> 00:05:11.512
Is this yours, Si An?

120
00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:13.723
Is that why you labelled it?

121
00:05:13.723 --> 00:05:15.423
I guess this is Si An's too.

122
00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:17.122
- What? - He labelled it.

123
00:05:17.293 --> 00:05:18.423
Why did you stick it here?

124
00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:20.223
(Labeling everything was real hard work.)

125
00:05:20.223 --> 00:05:21.593
Come here, Si An.

126
00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:24.062
I've confirmed all your belongings now.

127
00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:26.533
Now, take off all your labels.

128
00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:28.502
(Take them off?)

129
00:05:28.863 --> 00:05:30.973
I told you to only stick them on toys.

130
00:05:30.973 --> 00:05:33.372
I never told you to stick them on TV.

131
00:05:33.673 --> 00:05:36.272
You posted the most, Si An. Take them all off.

132
00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:39.983
Do you not want to because they're all yours?

133
00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:44.382
I told you to stick them only on your toys.

134
00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.752
(He even second-hands underwear.)

135
00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:49.452
Why are all your underwear red?

136
00:05:51.093 --> 00:05:53.923
(Even his walking training clothes were pink.)

137
00:05:53.923 --> 00:05:55.923
(His hand-me-down history goes all the way back.)

138
00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:57.993
(Sighing)

139
00:05:58.493 --> 00:06:00.533
Since Si An is the youngest,

140
00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:02.733
he takes hand-me-downs from his sisters.

141
00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:04.803
Surprisingly, he even inherits their underwear.

142
00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:09.343
I realized that he desires his own belongings.

143
00:06:10.012 --> 00:06:11.072
Now.

144
00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:14.812
I'll label them for you. Stop fighting now.

145
00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:19.312
(He writes Si An's name first.)

146
00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.082
Here, it's yours. Stick it on the front.

147
00:06:23.122 --> 00:06:24.692
Isn't this nice?

148
00:06:24.793 --> 00:06:27.423
Now, you can't fight anymore, okay?

149
00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:29.663
- All right. - I should do it too.

150
00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:31.762
Where would you stick yours, Daddy?

151
00:06:32.562 --> 00:06:35.262
Come here, Si An.

152
00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.502
Why? You're going to label Si An?

153
00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:39.973
How did you know?

154
00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:41.642
Si An, you're mine.

155
00:06:42.243 --> 00:06:43.312
Look.

156
00:06:44.072 --> 00:06:45.642
Okay, I'll take it off.

157
00:06:45.642 --> 00:06:48.283
Oh, did it hurt. I'm sorry.

158
00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.853
- I'm sorry, Si An. - It hurts, Daddy.

159
00:06:50.853 --> 00:06:52.053
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

160
00:06:53.353 --> 00:06:54.752
It's okay, right?

161
00:06:55.283 --> 00:06:57.122
It's okay, right?

162
00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:01.892
Stop it.

163
00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:03.192
You're not mine, Si An?

164
00:07:03.332 --> 00:07:05.233
I belong to Mommy.

165
00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:09.872
Then who is mine? Seol A, you're mine.

166
00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:11.332
Seol A, you're mine.

167
00:07:11.332 --> 00:07:13.973
Only Seol A is going to get a Popsicle.

168
00:07:13.973 --> 00:07:16.243
I'll be yours.

169
00:07:16.243 --> 00:07:17.613
- You'll be mine? - Me too.

170
00:07:17.613 --> 00:07:20.113
- Okay. - I'm yours, Daddy,

171
00:07:20.743 --> 00:07:23.483
- I'll be yours, Daddy. - You're mine.

172
00:07:24.613 --> 00:07:26.882
I belong to Daddy.

173
00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:29.593
I love you, Daddy.

174
00:07:29.593 --> 00:07:31.653
(We're forever daddy's children.)

175
00:07:33.192 --> 00:07:34.262
(The twins have come out to play.)

176
00:07:34.262 --> 00:07:35.293
Hello.

177
00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:37.632
- Hello. - Hello.

178
00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:39.192
- He's so cute. - Hello.

179
00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.303
(Is there anything fun to do?)

180
00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:42.872
They're so cute.

181
00:07:46.743 --> 00:07:48.543
Hey, Seo Jun.

182
00:07:48.543 --> 00:07:49.743
(Halting)

183
00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:52.512
(Someone appears from a distance.)

184
00:07:53.082 --> 00:07:55.743
Someone welcomingly calls out to them.

185
00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:59.522
(The face becomes clearer as they approach.)

186
00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:03.452
Hey, Seo Eon and Seo Jun.

187
00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:04.952
(A voice longingly calls the twins' names.)

188
00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:08.223
Seung Hoon.

189
00:08:08.892 --> 00:08:10.363
Hey, Seung Hoon.

190
00:08:10.363 --> 00:08:12.803
- Hey, Seo Jun. - Seung Hoon.

191
00:08:12.803 --> 00:08:14.562
(We missed our friend, Seung Hoon.)

192
00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.632
How did you get here?

193
00:08:17.803 --> 00:08:20.103
You didn't know that I was coming today, right?

194
00:08:20.372 --> 00:08:23.272
(How did Seung Hoon end up surprising them?)

195
00:08:24.473 --> 00:08:26.382
I challenge Daddy.

196
00:08:26.642 --> 00:08:29.653
- You challenge me? - I challenge you, Daddy.

197
00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:31.382
I will beat everyone.

198
00:08:31.382 --> 00:08:32.783
You can't beat me.

199
00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:34.653
- You can't be defeated? - Yes.

200
00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:36.352
Same goes for me too.

201
00:08:37.423 --> 00:08:39.793
In 3, 2, 1. Go.

202
00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:42.322
Let's go.

203
00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:47.102
Seo Jun is out.

204
00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:48.763
(Oh, gosh)

205
00:08:49.232 --> 00:08:50.602
Don't lose.

206
00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:53.442
Win, win.

207
00:08:53.673 --> 00:08:55.643
Win, win.

208
00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:57.742
There you go.

209
00:08:57.742 --> 00:08:58.812
(Hwi Jae clears Seo Jun's top.)

210
00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.413
There you go.

211
00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:02.513
(Due to Hwi Jae's move,)

212
00:09:02.513 --> 00:09:04.582
(Seo Eon's top comes to a halt.)

213
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.153
You touched mine, Dad.

214
00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:09.082
(You touched mine!)

215
00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:10.822
No.

216
00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:12.293
No, you did.

217
00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:14.393
I just took this out.

218
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.033
(This was all a ruse.)

219
00:09:17.293 --> 00:09:18.933
This isn't fun.

220
00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:21.633
It's not fun.

221
00:09:21.633 --> 00:09:24.803
We're tired of playing by ourselves.

222
00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.342
(Is it not fun because you're with me?)

223
00:09:28.543 --> 00:09:30.812
Let's challenge Seung Hoon.

224
00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:32.013
Seung Hoon?

225
00:09:33.013 --> 00:09:36.883
(He calls Seung Hoon to challenge him.)

226
00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:38.183
Hello?

227
00:09:38.183 --> 00:09:39.383
Hello?

228
00:09:39.852 --> 00:09:41.753
- Who is it? - Who did you call?

229
00:09:41.753 --> 00:09:42.923
It's Seo Eon.

230
00:09:43.423 --> 00:09:44.423
Seo Eon called.

231
00:09:44.423 --> 00:09:47.423
Hey, it's me.

232
00:09:47.562 --> 00:09:49.832
I miss you, Seo Eon.

233
00:09:49.862 --> 00:09:51.793
Me too.

234
00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:53.933
What's with this all the sudden?

235
00:09:54.362 --> 00:09:55.433
(They couldn't meet him a lot after moving.)

236
00:09:55.433 --> 00:09:56.433
Hello?

237
00:09:56.903 --> 00:09:57.903
Uncle.

238
00:09:57.903 --> 00:09:59.433
Hi, Seung Hoon. Hold on, okay?

239
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.972
Is it Seung Hoon?

240
00:10:01.043 --> 00:10:02.273
Hey, Seung Hoon.

241
00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:03.742
Yes?

242
00:10:03.742 --> 00:10:05.273
Are you good at spinning tops?

243
00:10:05.273 --> 00:10:08.112
Yes, I'm totally good at it.

244
00:10:08.112 --> 00:10:11.482
Can you beat me? I'm totally strong.

245
00:10:11.482 --> 00:10:13.923
(Laughing)

246
00:10:14.383 --> 00:10:19.822
Hey, don't cry after you lose to me, okay?

247
00:10:20.163 --> 00:10:21.992
There's no reason to cry.

248
00:10:22.092 --> 00:10:24.533
I challenge you tomorrow, Seung Hoon.

249
00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:26.602
Are you confident enough to face me?

250
00:10:26.602 --> 00:10:28.303
I'm a bit busy.

251
00:10:28.303 --> 00:10:30.472
(I'm a bit busy.)

252
00:10:30.472 --> 00:10:32.003
Why are you busy?

253
00:10:32.572 --> 00:10:34.273
I have to study.

254
00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.072
(Study? That can't be right.)

255
00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:37.112
Hey, Seung Hoon.

256
00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:40.212
I'm busy, so I'll think about it.

257
00:10:41.812 --> 00:10:44.753
I thought you were busy. How did you get here?

258
00:10:44.883 --> 00:10:46.952
I have a question.

259
00:10:46.952 --> 00:10:49.822
Why did you study yesterday?

260
00:10:50.452 --> 00:10:51.623
I didn't study.

261
00:10:51.623 --> 00:10:53.623
You lied?

262
00:10:53.763 --> 00:10:54.893
So, did you study?

263
00:10:54.893 --> 00:10:56.362
Yes, twice.

264
00:10:56.362 --> 00:10:58.663
- You studied? - I studied.

265
00:10:58.663 --> 00:11:01.633
Well, I have my top right here.

266
00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:03.572
I brought my top.

267
00:11:03.972 --> 00:11:05.732
See, take a look.

268
00:11:06.673 --> 00:11:08.643
Are you going to compete today?

269
00:11:08.643 --> 00:11:11.273
See you later, okay?

270
00:11:11.273 --> 00:11:13.242
Should we have a match?

271
00:11:13.242 --> 00:11:15.883
Let's go spin them.

272
00:11:15.982 --> 00:11:18.253
Let's go spin them, friends.

273
00:11:18.253 --> 00:11:19.283
Let's all go.

274
00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:22.383
Follow me.

275
00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:25.352
- Let's go. - Let's go.

276
00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:28.263
(The three musketeers bust into a song.)

277
00:11:29.832 --> 00:11:32.293
(Humming happily)

278
00:11:32.462 --> 00:11:35.033
Hey, it's time to move out.

279
00:11:37.003 --> 00:11:39.133
- In 1, 2, 3, 4. - 3, 4.

280
00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:41.342
(They're full of 5-year-old camaraderie.)

281
00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:43.612
- 11, 12. - 11, 12.

282
00:11:43.842 --> 00:11:46.013
(They trio arrive at the neighborhood park.)

283
00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:47.442
We're here.

284
00:11:47.442 --> 00:11:50.253
Let's take out our tops.

285
00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:52.053
Do you have a purple one?

286
00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:53.123
Yes.

287
00:11:53.123 --> 00:11:54.352
Really?

288
00:11:54.822 --> 00:11:56.423
I have one too.

289
00:11:57.253 --> 00:11:58.753
See.

290
00:11:59.722 --> 00:12:01.962
Hey, we have the same color.

291
00:12:01.962 --> 00:12:03.763
We have the same color.

292
00:12:04.232 --> 00:12:06.462
Yes, except Seo Eon.

293
00:12:06.462 --> 00:12:08.602
(We have the same color except Seo Eon.)

294
00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:12.673
Teasing him will make him mad. Right?

295
00:12:12.803 --> 00:12:14.143
(Nodding)

296
00:12:14.873 --> 00:12:17.413
Are you the best in Dongcheon-dong?

297
00:12:17.413 --> 00:12:18.442
(Nodding)

298
00:12:18.442 --> 00:12:21.612
We're the best in our neighborhood.

299
00:12:21.712 --> 00:12:25.852
Let's compete to see who's the best here.

300
00:12:26.123 --> 00:12:28.883
Let's go. I'll show you my strength.

301
00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:32.123
I'm probably the best in the world.

302
00:12:32.423 --> 00:12:33.923
- Are you ready? - Yes.

303
00:12:33.923 --> 00:12:36.732
In, 3, 2, 1...

304
00:12:36.732 --> 00:12:38.862
- Let it rip. - Let it rip.

305
00:12:39.702 --> 00:12:41.202
- Let it rip. - Let it rip.

306
00:12:41.202 --> 00:12:43.303
(It lands on Seo Jun's shoe and falls apart.)

307
00:12:43.303 --> 00:12:45.332
What's going on?

308
00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:46.472
It's destroyed.

309
00:12:47.003 --> 00:12:48.543
It's destroyed.

310
00:12:48.543 --> 00:12:49.812
What does that mean?

311
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:50.873
It's broken.

312
00:12:50.873 --> 00:12:52.513
I won.

313
00:12:52.513 --> 00:12:54.342
That's unbelievable.

314
00:12:54.342 --> 00:12:56.482
That's what you call unbelievable.

315
00:12:56.482 --> 00:12:59.013
- Unbelievable. - It's unbelievable.

316
00:12:59.013 --> 00:13:00.222
Unbelievable.

317
00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.322
In 3, 2, 1.

318
00:13:03.352 --> 00:13:06.293
(What is this familiar sound?)

319
00:13:06.293 --> 00:13:08.423
Hey.

320
00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:11.232
I hear someone saying,

321
00:13:11.232 --> 00:13:13.232
"Let it rip".

322
00:13:13.303 --> 00:13:14.332
Right?

323
00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:16.273
Let's go.

324
00:13:16.403 --> 00:13:18.873
- Why? - They're older than us.

325
00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:21.503
We can just play with them.

326
00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:24.612
(Seo Eon runs ahead with excitement.)

327
00:13:24.612 --> 00:13:26.442
Hey, take your bags.

328
00:13:27.812 --> 00:13:29.952
(Oh, that's right.)

329
00:13:30.312 --> 00:13:33.053
Let's go. En-guard.

330
00:13:33.053 --> 00:13:34.283
(He gets excited quickly.)

331
00:13:36.653 --> 00:13:39.893
Hey, did you steal mine?

332
00:13:39.893 --> 00:13:42.062
- No. Why? - Let me see.

333
00:13:42.263 --> 00:13:43.893
(Seo Eon is missing a top.)

334
00:13:43.893 --> 00:13:45.062
I didn't.

335
00:13:46.862 --> 00:13:48.263
Did Seung Hoon take it?

336
00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.633
I'll be off.

337
00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:55.003
Hey, where's my top.

338
00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:56.072
I don't have it.

339
00:13:56.273 --> 00:13:58.913
But I only have two.

340
00:13:58.913 --> 00:14:00.342
(It's a poltergeist's mischief.)

341
00:14:00.812 --> 00:14:02.482
I think Seo Jun took it.

342
00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:04.112
It's not me.

343
00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:06.482
Hey, show me.

344
00:14:06.482 --> 00:14:07.482
I have three.

345
00:14:07.952 --> 00:14:09.793
One of these is Seo Eon's.

346
00:14:10.423 --> 00:14:11.893
(What?)

347
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.322
Is this yours?

348
00:14:13.322 --> 00:14:14.923
(He got the same ones confused.)

349
00:14:14.923 --> 00:14:17.633
(He returns the mistakenly taken top.)

350
00:14:18.562 --> 00:14:20.503
In 3, 2, 1.

351
00:14:20.503 --> 00:14:21.732
- Let it rip. - Let it rip.

352
00:14:21.732 --> 00:14:23.472
They follow the familiar sound.

353
00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:24.533
(Smiling)

354
00:14:25.003 --> 00:14:27.702
They spot older kids competing with tops.

355
00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:29.173
(Older kids are spinning tops.)

356
00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:31.373
Hey.

357
00:14:31.773 --> 00:14:34.143
I know how to play too.

358
00:14:34.143 --> 00:14:36.482
Me too.

359
00:14:36.482 --> 00:14:38.913
But how is the ring so big?

360
00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:41.023
My dad got it for me.

361
00:14:41.023 --> 00:14:43.352
Ours is just this small.

362
00:14:43.352 --> 00:14:44.822
I have this one too.

363
00:14:45.722 --> 00:14:47.523
- Do you know this? - Yes.

364
00:14:47.523 --> 00:14:49.933
- It's Lost Longinus. - It's Lost Longinus.

365
00:14:50.062 --> 00:14:51.793
Oh, they know them all.

366
00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.903
- How old are you? - Five-years-old.

367
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.602
We're Seo Eon and Seo Jun.

368
00:14:55.602 --> 00:14:57.332
- He's Seung Hoon. - You're...

369
00:14:57.332 --> 00:14:59.673
- Seo Eon, Seo Jun. - He's Seung Hoon.

370
00:14:59.673 --> 00:15:01.472
How old are you?

371
00:15:01.472 --> 00:15:03.143
- We're 9-years-old. - We're 9-years-old.

372
00:15:03.143 --> 00:15:04.643
Are you friends?

373
00:15:04.643 --> 00:15:06.013
- Yes. - Yes.

374
00:15:06.013 --> 00:15:08.212
- Do you know how to play? - Yes.

375
00:15:08.212 --> 00:15:09.952
- Are you good? - Yes.

376
00:15:10.112 --> 00:15:11.183
Want to play?

377
00:15:11.183 --> 00:15:12.653
- Want to? - Want to join?

378
00:15:12.653 --> 00:15:14.923
- Sure, let's play. - Come join.

379
00:15:15.452 --> 00:15:17.992
(Let me warm up.)

380
00:15:18.553 --> 00:15:20.523
It's red.

381
00:15:20.523 --> 00:15:22.562
Hey, he's very good.

382
00:15:23.062 --> 00:15:26.062
He spins it better than me.

383
00:15:26.062 --> 00:15:27.462
(He's shocked at Seo Jun's skill.)

384
00:15:28.062 --> 00:15:30.373
(Well, it's not much.)

385
00:15:32.303 --> 00:15:33.543
(The Dongcheon-dong master is struggling.)

386
00:15:33.873 --> 00:15:36.112
Hey, Seo Eon. This isn't working.

387
00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:38.342
Seo Eon, this isn't going in.

388
00:15:39.883 --> 00:15:43.212
- Hold on. - It's not working.

389
00:15:43.212 --> 00:15:46.952
Seo Eon, we're friends. Lend me the white one.

390
00:15:47.153 --> 00:15:49.722
- Use this. - Try one more time.

391
00:15:49.722 --> 00:15:51.893
(I guess I have to help.)

392
00:15:51.893 --> 00:15:53.462
I'll fix it for you.

393
00:15:54.623 --> 00:15:56.763
(He helps his friends diligently.)

394
00:15:56.763 --> 00:15:58.793
Here you go, Seung Hoon.

395
00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:01.003
- Let's go, Seung Hoon. - Let's do this.

396
00:16:01.163 --> 00:16:03.773
Guys, we challenge you.

397
00:16:03.773 --> 00:16:05.803
We challenge you.

398
00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:08.643
I accept your challenge.

399
00:16:08.643 --> 00:16:09.643
It's 3 versus 3.

400
00:16:09.643 --> 00:16:11.712
This match decides the winning team.

401
00:16:11.712 --> 00:16:14.442
- Choose a name. - A name for your team.

402
00:16:14.442 --> 00:16:16.112
Let's be Galaxy Zeus.

403
00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:18.413
- Galaxy Zeus. - Legendary Galaxy Zeus.

404
00:16:18.413 --> 00:16:20.722
("Legendary"? That rings nicely.)

405
00:16:20.783 --> 00:16:22.053
What's going to be your team's name?

406
00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:23.852
The Legendary...

407
00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:25.253
(He copies them first.)

408
00:16:25.253 --> 00:16:26.822
Emperor Pokemon.

409
00:16:27.692 --> 00:16:30.562

417
00:16:44.342 --> 00:16:49.812
- Let's go... - Legendary Rich Man.

00:16:53.822 --> 00:16:54.822
(Top Battle)

420
00:16:54.822 --> 00:16:56.623
Their reputations are on the line.

421

00:17:01.263 --> 00:17:02.692
- Yes. - Face off now.

424
00:17:02.692 --> 00:17:03.992
Who will go alone?

425
00:17:03.992 --> 00:17:05.063
Me.

426
00:17:05.663 --> 00:17:07.133
I'll go first.

Spin it hard.

436
00:17:25.653 --> 00:17:28.452
Competitors, are you ready?

437
00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:30.923

00:27:56.482 --> 00:27:57.552
(Isn't that Sam?)

670
00:27:57.552 --> 00:27:58.982
Isn't that Sam?

671
00:28:00.952 --> 00:28:02.893
(Isn't that daddy?)

672
00:28:02.893 --> 00:28:03.992
Who is that?

673
00:28:08.923 --> 00:28:10.262
(He's completely focused on the screen.)

674
00:28:10.262 --> 00:28:11.492
Did you see me?

675
00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:16.032
(It's a weeping scene.)

676
00:28:16.972 --> 00:28:19.702
(He cries too.)

677
00:28:20.173 --> 00:28:23.512
(I can't watch without a handkerchief.)

678
00:28:23.712 --> 00:28:25.913
(Suddenly, Sam appears.)

679
00:28:27.242 --> 00:28:31.183
(It's Sam's first time acting for a drama.)

680
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:35.552
(Upon seeing his dad, William becomes excited.)

681
00:28:37.022 --> 00:28:39.663
- Where is he? - It's too late.

682
00:28:40.792 --> 00:28:42.563
Jun Hyung is gone.

683
00:28:42.863 --> 00:28:44.462
(Breathing heavily)

684
00:28:44.462 --> 00:28:46.563
He passed away.

685
00:28:46.962 --> 00:28:50.403
(Sam acts with his breaths.)

686
00:28:50.403 --> 00:28:52.073
(He is absorbed in his performance.)

687
00:28:53.242 --> 00:28:55.173
Dad. Dad.

688
00:28:56.002 --> 00:28:57.643
That's me.

689
00:28:58.272 --> 00:28:59.683
I am a good actor, right?

690
00:28:59.683 --> 00:29:02.683
(No comment.)

691
00:29:03.383 --> 00:29:04.482
Come here.

692
00:29:04.583 --> 00:29:07.383
(Sam makes a call.)

693
00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:10.222
- Hello? - Sam?

694
00:29:10.492 --> 00:29:13.163
- What are you doing? - I am waiting for you.

695
00:29:13.163 --> 00:29:15.792
Really? It's boring without me, right?

696
00:29:15.923 --> 00:29:17.563
Not really.

697
00:29:18.593 --> 00:29:20.302
- Come on. - Without you,

698
00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:21.603
the place does feel a bit empty.

699
00:29:21.603 --> 00:29:23.702
- It does, right? - What is William doing?

700
00:29:23.972 --> 00:29:26.442
- William is next to me. - I miss him.

701
00:29:26.442 --> 00:29:29.103
Would you bring William here? Please.

702
00:29:29.103 --> 00:29:31.472
Sure. I will be there soon.

703
00:29:31.472 --> 00:29:33.982
- Yes! - All right. Bye.

704
00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:37.252
Let's go meet them. Come this way.

705
00:29:37.683 --> 00:29:40.583
William, I have cool things to show you.

706
00:29:43.393 --> 00:29:44.653
William, who is that?

707
00:29:44.653 --> 00:29:46.093
Who is that?

708
00:29:47.492 --> 00:29:48.563
Who is that?

709
00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:50.792
Come here.

710
00:29:51.593 --> 00:29:52.663
Who is that?

711
00:29:52.663 --> 00:29:54.202
(Sam's picture is on the wall.)

712
00:29:54.202 --> 00:29:55.363
Who is that?

713
00:29:56.373 --> 00:29:57.502
Who is that?

714
00:29:57.502 --> 00:29:58.673
(Let's see.)

715
00:30:00.272 --> 00:30:02.143
Dad. Dad.

716
00:30:02.873 --> 00:30:04.712
Where am I?

717
00:30:04.942 --> 00:30:05.972
Sam!

718
00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:08.212
Sam!

719
00:30:08.383 --> 00:30:10.683
- It's good to see you. - Sam.

720
00:30:10.683 --> 00:30:12.583
Why am I so happy to see you?

721
00:30:12.583 --> 00:30:14.252
It has been a while. How have you been?

722
00:30:14.853 --> 00:30:16.022
He is so small!

723
00:30:16.022 --> 00:30:17.222
- He is, right? - Sam is here.

724
00:30:17.222 --> 00:30:19.323
(Seo Hye Jin runs out upon hearing his voice.)

725
00:30:19.492 --> 00:30:21.063
- William! - How have you been?

726
00:30:21.063 --> 00:30:23.692
This is incredible. He is so cute.

727
00:30:23.692 --> 00:30:24.893
Is that Sam?

728
00:30:26.232 --> 00:30:27.262
William!

729
00:30:27.262 --> 00:30:28.732
(Hye Jin tires to get William's attention.)

730
00:30:29.903 --> 00:30:31.032
Hello, William.

731
00:30:31.032 --> 00:30:32.373
(No, I like that one.)

732
00:30:32.373 --> 00:30:33.403
It's Wanna One.

733
00:30:34.502 --> 00:30:36.073
He must like Wanna One.

734
00:30:36.073 --> 00:30:37.212
He likes music.

735
00:30:37.512 --> 00:30:40.012
(Dancing)

736
00:30:41.482 --> 00:30:43.282
This is for you. Hold on.

737
00:30:43.282 --> 00:30:45.113
(Sam prepared drinks for his colleagues.)

738
00:30:45.113 --> 00:30:46.982
Give it to her.

739
00:30:48.052 --> 00:30:49.383
Thank you.

740
00:30:49.893 --> 00:30:51.522
William, let's go.

741
00:30:52.492 --> 00:30:54.022
There are a lot of people to see today.

742
00:30:55.323 --> 00:30:57.633
Hello. How pretty!

743
00:30:57.633 --> 00:30:59.433
Hello. Hello.

744
00:30:59.663 --> 00:31:00.732
(Who ran out of her waiting room?)

745
00:31:00.732 --> 00:31:01.962
- William. - I ran out of the room...

746
00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:03.202
upon hearing that William is here.

747
00:31:03.202 --> 00:31:04.302
Really?

748
00:31:04.302 --> 00:31:06.542
William, say hello to her.

749
00:31:06.542 --> 00:31:08.772
(The queen, Hyun A)

750
00:31:10.613 --> 00:31:13.982
How will William react to Hyun A?

751
00:31:14.942 --> 00:31:16.452
William. William.

752
00:31:16.452 --> 00:31:18.313
William, don't go.

753
00:31:18.653 --> 00:31:20.183
- William. - How cute!

754
00:31:20.183 --> 00:31:22.282
- William, come here. - Let's have a handshake.

755
00:31:22.522 --> 00:31:24.522
- Give her a handshake. - High five!

756
00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:28.923
Would you like to give her a kiss?

757
00:31:28.923 --> 00:31:30.333
Would you give me a kiss?

758
00:31:31.093 --> 00:31:33.202
Give her a kiss. Give her a kiss.

759
00:31:33.202 --> 00:31:35.232
(I am not ready for that.)

760
00:31:35.962 --> 00:31:37.373
Give her a kiss. Give her a kiss.

761
00:31:37.373 --> 00:31:39.702
(William is the master of playing hot and cold.)

762
00:31:39.702 --> 00:31:42.813
You are playing too hard to get.

763
00:31:43.913 --> 00:31:45.212
Thank you.

764
00:31:45.212 --> 00:31:46.883
(He gives her a hug instead.)

765
00:31:47.883 --> 00:31:49.913
Bye. See you again.

766
00:31:50.782 --> 00:31:52.782
Bye. Bye.

767
00:31:52.782 --> 00:31:54.153
(See you again.)

768
00:31:55.222 --> 00:31:56.792
It has been a while, Sam.

769
00:31:57.093 --> 00:31:59.123
Hello. Say hello to her.

770
00:31:59.123 --> 00:32:01.992
- She is Geum Bo Ra. - Hello.

771
00:32:01.992 --> 00:32:03.292
It's grandma.

772
00:32:03.762 --> 00:32:05.133
My goodness.

773
00:32:05.962 --> 00:32:07.603
This is crazy. He is so cute.

774
00:32:07.603 --> 00:32:09.532
William, say hello.

775
00:32:09.532 --> 00:32:11.802
- Hi. - Hello.

776
00:32:13.542 --> 00:32:15.403
- My daughter is a fan. - Really?

777
00:32:15.403 --> 00:32:16.643
She goes crazy when he is on TV.

778
00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:18.113
I saw the episode in which his grandma came.

779
00:32:18.113 --> 00:32:19.512
You went to the market with her.

780
00:32:19.512 --> 00:32:22.143
- She came the last time. - How pretty!

781
00:32:22.143 --> 00:32:23.153
William.

782
00:32:23.482 --> 00:32:26.782
I forgot to ask you for a picture.

783
00:32:27.052 --> 00:32:28.683
- I want to a picture. - It's a picture time.

784
00:32:29.183 --> 00:32:31.692
I never ask anyone for a picture.

785
00:32:31.692 --> 00:32:33.192
(William is the stars' star.)

786
00:32:34.393 --> 00:32:36.262
- Look over here. - In 1, 2, 3.

787
00:32:36.633 --> 00:32:38.492
William is very popular today.

788
00:32:38.492 --> 00:32:41.103
I want to see him in real life, too.

789
00:32:41.103 --> 00:32:42.833
My daughter became so excited.

790
00:32:42.833 --> 00:32:45.833
She got so excited when I sent her a picture.

791
00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:48.343
- Really? - She loves him so much.

792
00:32:48.343 --> 00:32:50.772
- Thank you. - She became so excited.

793
00:32:50.772 --> 00:32:52.373
(Bo Ra is taken with William.)

794
00:32:52.373 --> 00:32:53.913
This is incredible.

795
00:32:54.282 --> 00:32:57.052
William. William. Give this to Grandma.

796
00:32:58.413 --> 00:33:01.083
You can even give things. My goodness.

797
00:33:01.653 --> 00:33:03.893
Thank you. Thank you.

798
00:33:05.623 --> 00:33:06.663
Hello.

799
00:33:06.663 --> 00:33:08.593
(He goes to say hello to the staff and actors.)

800
00:33:08.593 --> 00:33:10.962
- Director, hello. - Hello, Sam.

801
00:33:10.962 --> 00:33:12.903
(The director takes William with him.)

802
00:33:12.903 --> 00:33:14.962
Please drink one. Hello.

803
00:33:14.962 --> 00:33:16.532
(He lets William see the cameras.)

804
00:33:16.532 --> 00:33:18.802
Hello. Hello.

805
00:33:19.702 --> 00:33:21.202
Please cheer up.

806
00:33:22.472 --> 00:33:24.643
(Someone appears suddenly.)

807
00:33:25.573 --> 00:33:27.012
Who are you?

808
00:33:27.012 --> 00:33:28.583
I wondered who you are.

809
00:33:28.782 --> 00:33:30.353
I wondered who you are.

810
00:33:30.353 --> 00:33:32.012
(The lead actress, Park Si Eun)

811
00:33:32.012 --> 00:33:33.323
You are here.

812
00:33:34.353 --> 00:33:35.752
Hello.

813
00:33:35.752 --> 00:33:37.992
- You gained weight. - What?

814
00:33:37.992 --> 00:33:40.022
You gained weight.

815
00:33:40.022 --> 00:33:41.192
I look like a different person, right?

816
00:33:41.192 --> 00:33:43.762
- My goodness. - He grew up.

817
00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:45.192
- He grew up. - Seriously.

818
00:33:45.192 --> 00:33:46.333
- Dad. Dad. - Sons are hard to raise.

819
00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:48.702
- Dad. - I am here. I am here.

820
00:33:48.702 --> 00:33:49.772
- How cute! - You can even speak.

821
00:33:49.772 --> 00:33:51.903
Peek-a-boo! Give me a kiss.

822
00:33:51.903 --> 00:33:53.302
(Everyone wants a kiss from him.)

823
00:33:53.302 --> 00:33:54.903
Give her a kiss.

824
00:33:55.643 --> 00:33:56.742
He doesn't want to.

825
00:33:57.972 --> 00:34:01.143
He has never been this popular.

826
00:34:03.012 --> 00:34:05.252
- How cute! - You are so pretty.

827
00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:08.023
- See you later. - Thank you.

828

William.

830
00:34:15.362 --> 00:34:16.592
Where is he?

831
00:34:17.492 --> 00:34:18.632
Should I call him?

832
00:34:19.193 --> 00:34:20.563
I need to find him.

833
00:34:22.463 --> 00:34:23.532
Is he not here?

834
00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:27.143
It's a monster! It's a monster!

835
00:34:27.143 --> 00:34:29.472
(Surprised)

836
00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:33.382
(Lifting up)

837
00:34:33.382 --> 00:34:35.043
(He is a strong boy.)

838
00:34:36.913 --> 00:34:39.213
- Dad. - I am your dad.

839
00:34:39.213 --> 00:34:42.483
- Sam! - How have you been?

840
00:34:43.523 --> 00:34:45.052
How have you been?

841
00:34:46.163 --> 00:34:47.193
Hi.

842
00:34:47.563 --> 00:34:49.532
William, it's Ro Woon.

843
00:34:50.293 --> 00:34:51.463
Say hello.

844
00:34:51.463 --> 00:34:53.402
(Sam's best friend, Lee Ro Woon)

845
00:34:54.063 --> 00:34:56.873
(He has played the young Hong Gil Dong.)

846
00:34:59.103 --> 00:35:02.273
(He showed a great performance.)

847
00:35:03.012 --> 00:35:06.583
(He is Song Kang Ho among child actors.)

848
00:35:06.583 --> 00:35:08.443
Father.

849
00:35:09.452 --> 00:35:12.282
(He appeared in a drama with Sam.)

850
00:35:12.822 --> 00:35:15.322
(They became good friends.)

851
00:35:15.652 --> 00:35:16.793
During the shoot, people said....

852
00:35:16.793 --> 00:35:19.322
Ro Woon and William look very much alike.

853
00:35:19.322 --> 00:35:22.963
William will be like him when he grows up.

854
00:35:22.963 --> 00:35:25.532
Ro Woon was interested in William.

855
00:35:25.532 --> 00:35:28.233
He always asked me to bring William.

856
00:35:28.233 --> 00:35:29.333
Did you have a nice shoot?

857
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:31.572
Today? I had a nice shoot.

858
00:35:32.632 --> 00:35:34.902
(William makes farting sounds.)

859
00:35:36.112 --> 00:35:37.572
(He does it too.)

860
00:35:38.413 --> 00:35:40.083
(William is the king of farting.)

861
00:35:41.242 --> 00:35:42.882
(Fart, fart, fart)

862
00:35:42.882 --> 00:35:44.583
(The three men have a good teamwork.)

863
00:35:45.552 --> 00:35:48.183
(They go back and forth.)

864
00:35:48.183 --> 00:35:50.523
(He is funny.)

865
00:35:51.853 --> 00:35:52.992
Please lay the mat.

866
00:35:52.992 --> 00:35:54.963
I will do that.

867
00:35:55.222 --> 00:35:56.833
You are like a big brother.

868
00:35:58.032 --> 00:36:00.503
(He lays out the mat that is taller than him.)

869
00:36:00.503 --> 00:36:02.233
- All right. - I did it well, right?

870
00:36:02.233 --> 00:36:03.472
William, you saw that, right?

871
00:36:03.472 --> 00:36:04.702
It's comfortable.

872
00:36:04.702 --> 00:36:08.643
If you sit, there is no space for us.

873
00:36:08.643 --> 00:36:09.742
That's not true.

874
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:12.742
William can sit on my lap.

875
00:36:13.882 --> 00:36:14.943
Okay.

876
00:36:14.943 --> 00:36:16.552
You can't sit on my lap.

877
00:36:16.552 --> 00:36:17.813
My goodness.

878
00:36:17.813 --> 00:36:20.253
(Ro Woon joins in.)

879
00:36:25.353 --> 00:36:28.893
(Ro Woon attacks him.)

880
00:36:29.963 --> 00:36:31.592
(Hitting)

881
00:36:32.293 --> 00:36:34.762
(He punishes Ro Woon.)

882
00:36:34.762 --> 00:36:36.273
Did you just hit him?

883
00:36:36.702 --> 00:36:37.773
He did.

884
00:36:38.132 --> 00:36:39.842
You can't hit him.

885
00:36:40.043 --> 00:36:41.972
Tell him that you are sorry.

886
00:36:42.342 --> 00:36:43.943
- "I am sorry." - Let's shake our hands.

887
00:36:44.972 --> 00:36:46.882
Don't hit people.

888
00:36:46.882 --> 00:36:48.413
(Don't hit people.)

889
00:36:48.913 --> 00:36:50.552
You have a lot of bags.

890
00:36:50.552 --> 00:36:52.612
I only have two bags. That's not a lot.

891
00:36:52.612 --> 00:36:53.822
You are like a middle-aged woman.

892
00:36:54.322 --> 00:36:56.253
(What's inside your bag?)

893
00:36:56.253 --> 00:36:58.322
- What is that? - It's a gift.

894
00:36:58.822 --> 00:37:00.092
Where are there a lot?

895
00:37:01.193 --> 00:37:03.293
(They have a good teamwork.)

896
00:37:03.693 --> 00:37:05.393
Try it. Blow on it.

897
00:37:05.393 --> 00:37:07.532
(William gives it a try.)

898
00:37:07.532 --> 00:37:09.802
(He fails.)

899
00:37:10.503 --> 00:37:13.472
(He can't blow on the rolling whistle.)

900
00:37:13.472 --> 00:37:14.572
William.

901
00:37:15.643 --> 00:37:18.972
(Ro Woon teaches him.)

902
00:37:21.213 --> 00:37:22.342
Try it.

903
00:37:22.742 --> 00:37:24.652
Will he succeed this time?

904
00:37:25.483 --> 00:37:28.083
William! William! Give him a big hand!

905
00:37:28.083 --> 00:37:30.253
William! Give him a big hand!

906
00:37:32.652 --> 00:37:36.793
(He succeeded in blowing the rolling whistle.)

907
00:37:38.433 --> 00:37:40.503
It's one sunny afternoon in fall.

908
00:37:40.802 --> 00:37:43.873
Ji Yong is waiting for someone.

909
00:37:43.873 --> 00:37:45.472
When will he come out?

910
00:37:46.842 --> 00:37:49.443
(Who is he waiting for?)

911
00:37:50.273 --> 00:37:51.572
(Seung Jae is leaving the kindergarten.)

912
00:37:51.572 --> 00:37:54.313
He was waiting for Seung Jae.

913
00:37:54.612 --> 00:37:55.683
Seung Jae!

914
00:37:55.683 --> 00:37:56.913
(He is happy to see Seung Jae.)

915
00:37:57.382 --> 00:37:58.382
(Smiling)

916
00:37:59.413 --> 00:38:01.822
Dad is here. Dad is here.

917
00:38:02.552 --> 00:38:03.623
(Where are you going?)

918
00:38:04.152 --> 00:38:08.663
(He runs in a strange direction.)

919
00:38:08.663 --> 00:38:10.063
(Then he turns to Ji Yong.)

920
00:38:10.063 --> 00:38:11.393
I thought you were going somewhere.

921
00:38:11.393 --> 00:38:12.802
(Seung Jae knows how to play hot and cold.)

922
00:38:12.802 --> 00:38:14.402
Are you happy that I came to pick you up?

923
00:38:14.402 --> 00:38:15.762
- Yes. - Really?

924
00:38:15.762 --> 00:38:17.503
- How much do you like it? - This much.

925
00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:19.373
This much? How much is this much?

926
00:38:20.443 --> 00:38:22.543
- Much. - Much?

927
00:38:25.313 --> 00:38:26.683
It's a butterfly!

928
00:38:27.242 --> 00:38:29.612
- It's a butterfly! - Hi, butterfly!

929
00:38:30.282 --> 00:38:33.353
Two butterflies are flying.

930
00:38:33.683 --> 00:38:34.952
They are friends.

931
00:38:34.952 --> 00:38:35.952
Are they friends?

932
00:38:35.952 --> 00:38:37.992
They are hugging each other.

933
00:38:38.422 --> 00:38:39.922
(They suddenly go their separate ways.)

934
00:38:40.393 --> 00:38:41.492
They went their separate ways.

935
00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:43.132
It's alone now.

936
00:38:43.132 --> 00:38:44.632
Call for its friend.

937
00:38:44.632 --> 00:38:46.402
Butterfly!

938
00:38:46.402 --> 00:38:47.503
There it is.

939
00:38:51.572 --> 00:38:53.043
(Flying)

940
00:38:53.572 --> 00:38:55.972
Why are butterflies so fast?

941
00:38:55.972 --> 00:38:57.643
They can fly.

942
00:38:57.643 --> 00:38:59.983
Why? Why do they have wings?

943
00:38:59.983 --> 00:39:01.282
They have wings in order to fly.

944
00:39:01.282 --> 00:39:02.282
Why?

945
00:39:02.742 --> 00:39:05.083
It's because butterflies fly.

946
00:39:05.083 --> 00:39:06.353
They can't walk.

947
00:39:07.322 --> 00:39:09.652
The butterfly must be looking for its prey.

948
00:39:09.652 --> 00:39:11.492
Is the butterfly looking for its prey?

949
00:39:11.492 --> 00:39:13.563
It's searching for ants.

950
00:39:13.693 --> 00:39:15.063
(He is different from me.)

951
00:39:15.222 --> 00:39:16.933
Bye, butterfly.

952
00:39:16.933 --> 00:39:18.963
Do you like walking with me?

953
00:39:18.963 --> 00:39:19.963
- Yes. - Let's go.

954
00:39:19.963 --> 00:39:21.202
(He holds his dad's hand to go home.)

955
00:39:22.333 --> 00:39:23.902
Dad, hold by bag.

956
00:39:24.402 --> 00:39:25.702
Hold my bag.

957
00:39:26.202 --> 00:39:28.143
(Sure. Today is a good day.)

958
00:39:28.472 --> 00:39:31.342
Today is my birthday.

959
00:39:31.342 --> 00:39:34.043
It's your birthday today. What do you want to eat?

960
00:39:34.043 --> 00:39:37.882
I want a cake, grape, strawberry, and apple.

961
00:39:37.882 --> 00:39:40.623
Since I got my paycheck, I will buy you tasty food.

962
00:39:40.623 --> 00:39:42.722
What kind of a present would you like?

963
00:39:42.722 --> 00:39:44.052
A dinosaur.

964
00:39:45.222 --> 00:39:47.693
You have over 100 of them. Do you want another one?

965
00:39:47.693 --> 00:39:48.693
Yes.

966
00:39:48.793 --> 00:39:51.393
(Seung Jae is energetic on his birthday.)

967
00:39:52.663 --> 00:39:54.202
Hello.

968
00:39:54.702 --> 00:39:56.572
It's my birthday.

969
00:39:56.572 --> 00:39:58.003
- Is it your birthday? - Yes.

970
00:39:58.003 --> 00:40:00.003
Come to play later.

971
00:40:00.003 --> 00:40:01.543
That would be nice.

972
00:40:02.072 --> 00:40:04.643
Seung Jae, look at me.

973
00:40:04.842 --> 00:40:07.782
I need to ask you a favor. Listen to me, okay?

974
00:40:08.012 --> 00:40:10.552
Would you go to a mart and buy a zucchini?

975
00:40:10.552 --> 00:40:12.552
I will be making food for you.

976
00:40:12.552 --> 00:40:14.822
Please go to a mart and buy a zucchini.

977
00:40:14.822 --> 00:40:16.253
- Okay? - Okay.

978
00:40:16.253 --> 00:40:20.362
A zucchini! A zucchini! A zucchini! A zucchini!

979
00:40:20.362 --> 00:40:21.492
Seung Jae.

980
00:40:21.992 --> 00:40:25.032
Good things will happen to you today.

981
00:40:25.032 --> 00:40:27.663
- I will be back. - Okay.

982
00:40:27.663 --> 00:40:29.733
(What will happen to Seung Jae?)

983
00:40:30.733 --> 00:40:35.103
A zucchini! A zucchini! A zucchini! A zucchini!

984
00:40:35.242 --> 00:40:39.213
It's Seung Jae's birthday.

985
00:40:39.512 --> 00:40:40.742
Happy birthday!

986
00:40:40.742 --> 00:40:42.313
Happy birthday!

987
00:40:42.313 --> 00:40:43.583
Okay.

988
00:40:43.882 --> 00:40:45.112
Go, go.

989
00:40:46.983 --> 00:40:49.492
It's an ice cream store.

990
00:40:50.753 --> 00:40:52.862
Please give me ice cream.

991
00:40:53.123 --> 00:40:54.222
Hello.

992
00:40:54.222 --> 00:40:55.222
(This shop looks familiar.)

993
00:40:55.693 --> 00:40:56.793
(I am here for ice cream.)

994
00:40:57.663 --> 00:41:02.603
(He had failed to buy ice cream with a bottle.)

995
00:41:03.632 --> 00:41:06.273
- Do you want ice cream? - Yes.

996
00:41:06.402 --> 00:41:07.842
(He uses the money he got for a zucchini.)

997
00:41:07.842 --> 00:41:10.242
Here is money.

998
00:41:10.242 --> 00:41:12.242
You don't have to give me money.

999
00:41:12.242 --> 00:41:14.882
I will give you ice cream.

1000
00:41:15.143 --> 00:41:16.152
Why?

1001
00:41:16.152 --> 00:41:19.353
You were sad when you couldn't eat it.

1002
00:41:19.353 --> 00:41:21.183
That's why I will give it to you as a present.

1003
00:41:21.183 --> 00:41:22.623
- Please wait. - Okay.

1004
00:41:22.623 --> 00:41:24.893
Seung Jae receives an unexpected gift.

1005
00:41:25.052 --> 00:41:28.092
Seung Jae must be excited.

1006
00:41:28.293 --> 00:41:29.833
- It's a gift. - Okay.

1007
00:41:29.833 --> 00:41:31.132
Bye.

1008
00:41:31.132 --> 00:41:33.202
I like strawberry flavor.

1009
00:41:33.202 --> 00:41:34.563
Do you like strawberry flavor?

1010
00:41:34.563 --> 00:41:36.702
Next time, I will give you strawberry flavor.

1011
00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:37.933
Thank you.

1012
00:41:37.933 --> 00:41:39.802
All right. Bye.

1013
00:41:41.902 --> 00:41:44.813
(He goes to the mart after eating ice cream.)

1014
00:41:44.813 --> 00:41:46.683
(He holds the door.)

1015
00:41:46.683 --> 00:41:47.813
Hello.

1016
00:41:47.813 --> 00:41:48.882
Thank you.

1017
00:41:48.882 --> 00:41:50.083
Hello, Seung Jae.

1018
00:41:50.152 --> 00:41:52.552
What does a zucchini look like?

1019
00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:56.822
Zucchini, zucchini, zucchini, zucchini.

1020
00:41:56.822 --> 00:41:59.563
Zucchini, zucchini, zucchini.

1021
00:41:59.563 --> 00:42:01.422
Where is the zucchini?

1022
00:42:01.963 --> 00:42:03.663
A zucchini.

1023
00:42:04.492 --> 00:42:06.262
I will have this one.

1024
00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:07.862
- Are you going to buy it? - Yes.

1025
00:42:08.163 --> 00:42:11.032
Dad told me to get it.

1026
00:42:11.032 --> 00:42:13.202
Don't get me a pumpkin, okay?

1027
00:42:13.202 --> 00:42:14.972
- Did he? - Yes.

1028
00:42:14.972 --> 00:42:16.072
(Getting snacks)

1029
00:42:17.813 --> 00:42:20.313
I will give this to you as a gift.

1030
00:42:20.382 --> 00:42:22.983
My goodness, what a surprise!

1031
00:42:22.983 --> 00:42:26.322
I thought about what to do for Seung Jae.

1032
00:42:26.322 --> 00:42:28.952
I thought it would be nice...

1033
00:42:28.952 --> 00:42:31.092
to give him a lucky day.

1034
00:42:31.092 --> 00:42:33.922
That's why I asked the residents for a favor.

1035
00:42:34.023 --> 00:42:35.992
It's Seung Jae's birthday today.

1036
00:42:35.992 --> 00:42:37.733
He will be passing by later.

1037
00:42:37.733 --> 00:42:39.503
Would you give him ice cream...

1038
00:42:39.503 --> 00:42:41.503
as if it's a gift?

1039
00:42:41.503 --> 00:42:45.503
Would you give him jelly as if it's a gift?

1040
00:42:45.503 --> 00:42:47.902
I will pay for it in advance.

1041
00:42:47.902 --> 00:42:49.972
- I will do that. - Thank you.

1042
00:42:49.972 --> 00:42:52.072
Do you know Seung Jae by any chance?

1043
00:42:52.072 --> 00:42:53.813
Would you give one to Seung Jae...

1044
00:42:53.813 --> 00:42:55.413
and tell him that it's a gift?

1045
00:42:55.413 --> 00:42:56.913
Thank you.

1046
00:42:57.213 --> 00:42:58.952
Eat this one later.

1047
00:42:59.253 --> 00:43:00.483
Thank you.

1048
00:43:00.483 --> 00:43:01.853
It's for you.

1049
00:43:02.152 --> 00:43:03.523
- Okay. - Bye.

1050
00:43:03.592 --> 00:43:05.452
Bye.

1051
00:43:06.623 --> 00:43:08.963
(Running)

1052
00:43:09.262 --> 00:43:10.762
Hey.

1053
00:43:11.063 --> 00:43:12.092
What is it?

1054
00:43:12.393 --> 00:43:16.003
Look. Do you know what I have?

1055
00:43:16.063 --> 00:43:19.273
Look, I have this much.

1056
00:43:19.742 --> 00:43:21.672
It's a birthday present. It's a lollipop.

1057
00:43:22.172 --> 00:43:23.172
What is it?

1058
00:43:23.172 --> 00:43:24.913
You get to have it since it's your birthday.

1059
00:43:25.512 --> 00:43:28.813
I don't like black ones.

1060
00:43:28.813 --> 00:43:30.782
- You don't? - No.

1061
00:43:30.782 --> 00:43:33.822
I like the pretty ones.

1062
00:43:34.052 --> 00:43:36.052
The pretty ones are tasty.

1063
00:43:36.052 --> 00:43:37.893
- Hello. - What do I need to press?

1064
00:43:38.152 --> 00:43:40.222
Press this button.

1065
00:43:40.222 --> 00:43:41.893
Then you put your mouth close to it.

1066
00:43:41.893 --> 00:43:43.893
Hello, Sir.

1067
00:43:44.492 --> 00:43:47.063
(Only children understand the joke.)

1068
00:43:47.063 --> 00:43:48.463
I want to try it.

1069
00:43:48.463 --> 00:43:51.132
Hello, sir.

1070
00:43:51.402 --> 00:43:54.402
(He laughs at his own joke.)

1071
00:43:55.402 --> 00:43:58.913
I bought this.

1072
00:44:00.043 --> 00:44:01.282
Bye.

1073
00:44:01.512 --> 00:44:03.052
- Bye. - Bye.

1074
00:44:04.813 --> 00:44:07.853
(What a strange day!)

1075
00:44:08.822 --> 00:44:11.253
(It started with ice cream.)

1076
00:44:12.023 --> 00:44:14.422
(Then he received jelly...)

1077
00:44:14.422 --> 00:44:15.722
(and candies.)

1078
00:44:16.433 --> 00:44:18.632
(It's his lucky day.)

1079
00:44:19.233 --> 00:44:21.032
(Did he receive his gifts?)

1080
00:44:21.933 --> 00:44:23.172
Dad.

1081
00:44:23.503 --> 00:44:24.572
Seung Jae.

1082
00:44:25.003 --> 00:44:26.072
Look.

1083
00:44:27.873 --> 00:44:28.943
Here.

1084
00:44:29.472 --> 00:44:31.112
That's a pumpkin.

1085
00:44:31.213 --> 00:44:33.282
I didn't bring it.

1086
00:44:33.282 --> 00:44:35.213
- What is this? - A candy.

1087
00:44:35.213 --> 00:44:37.052
Where did you get the candy?

1088
00:44:37.052 --> 00:44:40.282
People gave me a lot of candies...

1089
00:44:40.282 --> 00:44:41.722
for my birthday.

1090
00:44:41.722 --> 00:44:43.023
Why are there only four?

1091
00:44:43.552 --> 00:44:46.123
What? I shouldn't have too many candies.

1092
00:44:46.123 --> 00:44:48.023
(He is innocent.)

1093
00:44:48.063 --> 00:44:49.632
What else did you get?

1094
00:44:49.632 --> 00:44:50.663
Ice cream.

1095
00:44:50.663 --> 00:44:52.333
- What? - Ice cream.

1096
00:44:52.463 --> 00:44:54.463
Are you happy that you received gifts?

1097
00:44:54.463 --> 00:44:56.003
Yes, this is how happy I am.

1098
00:44:56.003 --> 00:44:57.603
I am happy when he is.

1099
00:44:57.603 --> 00:45:00.342
When he returned with a big smile,

1100
00:45:00.342 --> 00:45:03.643
I was glad that I came up with the plan.

1101
00:45:04.213 --> 00:45:05.213
Let's go.

1102
00:45:05.213 --> 00:45:06.913
- Let's go. - Okay.

1103
00:45:07.382 --> 00:45:09.183
Where are we going?

1104
00:45:09.183 --> 00:45:11.713
I had left the car...

1105
00:45:11.713 --> 00:45:13.753
to a car hospital. We need to go and find it.

1106
00:45:13.753 --> 00:45:15.523
- We will be taking a bus. - Okay.

1107
00:45:15.683 --> 00:45:17.592
Have you taken a bus before?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1108
00:45:17.722 --> 00:45:21.063
We once took a train.

1109
00:45:21.063 --> 00:45:23.663
We once took a subway.

1110
00:45:23.663 --> 00:45:25.092
We have never taken a bus.

1111
00:45:25.092 --> 00:45:26.862
- No. - No, we haven't.

1112
00:45:26.862 --> 00:45:31.503
- I have taken a bus. - What?

1113
00:45:31.672 --> 00:45:33.202
- By yourself? - By yourself?

1114
00:45:33.202 --> 00:45:34.202
Yes.

1115
00:45:34.202 --> 00:45:36.572
Gosh, you are a baby.

1116
00:45:36.572 --> 00:45:38.572
No, I am strong.

1117
00:45:38.572 --> 00:45:40.943
- What? - I am a man.

1118
00:45:40.943 --> 00:45:42.853
It's my first time...

1119
00:45:42.853 --> 00:45:44.612
- taking a bus in Jeonju. - Me too.

1120
00:45:44.612 --> 00:45:47.822
I took a bus when the fare was 20 cents.

1121
00:45:47.822 --> 00:45:48.922
I bet you don't know this.

1122
00:45:48.922 --> 00:45:51.523
Back in the days,

1123
00:45:51.523 --> 00:45:54.092
people used tokens to ride the bus.

1124
00:45:54.092 --> 00:45:56.393
They were for riding the bus.

1125
00:45:56.393 --> 00:45:57.992
Also,

1126
00:45:57.992 --> 00:46:00.202
there was a way...

1127
00:46:00.202 --> 00:46:02.463
to turn 10 tickets into 11 tickets.

1128
00:46:02.463 --> 00:46:04.003
Instead of following the lines,

1129
00:46:04.003 --> 00:46:06.103
we cut the tickets a bit short of the line.

1130
00:46:06.103 --> 00:46:07.302
It gave you 11 tickets.

1131
00:46:07.572 --> 00:46:09.742
It's a trick.

1132
00:46:09.742 --> 00:46:11.472
I am sure everyone has done it.

1133
00:46:12.543 --> 00:46:15.382
I am excited to ride the bus.

1134
00:46:16.483 --> 00:46:17.652
Children.

1135
00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:21.052
This is a payphone.

1136
00:46:21.052 --> 00:46:23.353
I wonder how much it is to make a call.

1137
00:46:23.353 --> 00:46:26.422
People who don't have cell phones...

1138
00:46:26.422 --> 00:46:27.822
can use this to make a call.

1139
00:46:28.322 --> 00:46:30.262
I used it when a call cost two cents.

1140
00:46:31.132 --> 00:46:33.833
I bet it costs about five cents now.

1141
00:46:34.402 --> 00:46:36.132
People don't use it anymore.

1142
00:46:36.132 --> 00:46:38.003
Everyone has a cell phone these days.

1143
00:46:38.003 --> 00:46:40.342
Since you don't have one, use a payphone...

1144
00:46:40.342 --> 00:46:41.802
to call me, okay?

1145
00:46:41.802 --> 00:46:43.713
- What's your number? - Don't you know it?

1146
00:46:43.713 --> 00:46:44.813
No.

1147
00:46:44.873 --> 00:46:46.943
Oh, my goodness. 0, 1, 0.

1148
00:46:46.943 --> 00:46:48.983
- 0, 1, 0. - 0, 1, 0.

1149
00:46:49.282 --> 00:46:50.413
0, 1, 0.

1150
00:46:50.413 --> 00:46:51.882
(Hesitant)

1151
00:46:51.882 --> 00:46:53.452
- 0, 1, 0. - I can't reveal it.

1152
00:46:53.452 --> 00:46:55.322
People might call me...

1153
00:46:55.322 --> 00:46:56.893
and tell me not to tease Si An.

1154
00:46:57.523 --> 00:47:00.322
I will tell you later.

1155
00:47:00.592 --> 00:47:01.592
Okay.

1156
00:47:01.592 --> 00:47:03.333
Look, this is the station.

1157
00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:05.362
We get on the bus here.

1158
00:47:05.362 --> 00:47:07.202
We are taking bus number 61.

1159
00:47:07.202 --> 00:47:08.532
We need to wait 10 minutes.

1160
00:47:08.532 --> 00:47:11.402
Dad, I want chocolate milk.

1161
00:47:11.933 --> 00:47:14.472
We have 10 minutes.

1162
00:47:14.472 --> 00:47:15.643
What do you want?

1163
00:47:15.643 --> 00:47:17.143
- Chocolate milk. - Chocolate milk.

1164
00:47:17.143 --> 00:47:19.273
I want banana milk.

1165
00:47:19.273 --> 00:47:21.882
Si An, go and buy them, okay?

1166
00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:23.012
What about me?

1167
00:47:23.012 --> 00:47:25.683
We need to wait for the bus.

1168
00:47:25.683 --> 00:47:28.253
If Si An comes back with them in 10 minutes,

1169
00:47:28.422 --> 00:47:31.293
we will be able to have chocolate and banana milk.

1170
00:47:31.293 --> 00:47:32.592
Otherwise, we will have to leave.

1171
00:47:32.592 --> 00:47:35.262
You can't walk slowly, okay?

1172
00:47:36.793 --> 00:47:38.293
(Everything depends on Si An.)

1173
00:47:38.293 --> 00:47:41.532
Seol A and Soo A's snacks depend on Si An.

1174
00:47:41.663 --> 00:47:43.503
Will he succeed?

1175
00:47:44.972 --> 00:47:47.143
Si An will succeed, right?

1176
00:47:48.603 --> 00:47:49.742
Put your hand up.

1177
00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:51.742
We need to move fast.

1178
00:47:52.112 --> 00:47:54.483
(His legs move fast.)

1179
00:47:56.183 --> 00:47:59.583
I am hungry. Hurry up.

1180
00:47:59.683 --> 00:48:03.722
I will bring back chocolate milk.

1181
00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:05.853
Please wait.

1182
00:48:05.853 --> 00:48:07.422
We need to move fast.

1183
00:48:07.422 --> 00:48:09.193
I will be back fast.

1184
00:48:09.193 --> 00:48:11.193
Then you should run.

1185
00:48:11.532 --> 00:48:14.503
The bus will be here. Let's go quickly.

1186
00:48:14.802 --> 00:48:16.902
(9 minutes remain.)

1187
00:48:17.373 --> 00:48:20.072
2 chocolate milk and 2 banana milk, okay?

1188
00:48:20.202 --> 00:48:22.202
Buy them fast.

1189
00:48:22.202 --> 00:48:25.713
- Dad, what's wrong? - We don't have time.

1190
00:48:25.713 --> 00:48:26.983
Hurry up.

1191
00:48:26.983 --> 00:48:28.413
(Why is he in a hurry?)

1192
00:48:28.713 --> 00:48:30.882
No matter what he does,

1193
00:48:30.882 --> 00:48:32.313
Si An takes his time.

1194
00:48:32.583 --> 00:48:36.222
He is always relaxed and slow.

1195
00:48:37.193 --> 00:48:39.992
(The day he goes to the kindergarten)

1196
00:48:41.663 --> 00:48:43.793
(Taking his time)

1197
00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:46.433
(When he eats chocolate)

1198
00:48:48.762 --> 00:48:52.972
(This video has been slowed.)

1199
00:48:55.172 --> 00:48:57.773
It's time to take get on the boat. Look.

1200
00:48:57.773 --> 00:49:00.282
(He goes his way.)

1201
00:49:01.713 --> 00:49:04.452
(He was called a sloth.)

1202
00:49:04.452 --> 00:49:07.322
I want to see Si An hurry.

1203
00:49:08.523 --> 00:49:09.552
Ask her...

1204
00:49:09.552 --> 00:49:12.092
- where the items are. - Where are...

1205
00:49:12.092 --> 00:49:14.193
banana milk and chocolate milk?

1206
00:49:14.362 --> 00:49:16.733
- Go to the refrigerator. - Go quickly.

1207
00:49:17.663 --> 00:49:19.563
Refrigerator?

1208
00:49:19.762 --> 00:49:23.532
We don't have time to look around.

1209
00:49:24.202 --> 00:49:26.742
Run, run.

1210
00:49:26.873 --> 00:49:28.603
Go quickly. Run.

1211
00:49:28.943 --> 00:49:31.512
(He gathers his senses and sprints.)

1212
00:49:33.683 --> 00:49:35.813
There it is. Don't look around.

1213
00:49:35.813 --> 00:49:36.952
Come here.

1214
00:49:38.083 --> 00:49:40.882
(He is being a sloth today.)

1215
00:49:40.882 --> 00:49:42.552
You will miss the bus.

1216
00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:44.922
Here they are. Here they are.

1217
00:49:44.922 --> 00:49:47.862
What do you need? What do you need to get?

1218
00:49:48.063 --> 00:49:50.563
- Banana milk. - Yes. Banana milk.

1219
00:49:50.992 --> 00:49:52.362
(Scanning)

1220
00:49:52.362 --> 00:49:54.163
You don't have time to choose.

1221
00:49:55.132 --> 00:49:56.833
(It's too high.)

1222
00:49:57.933 --> 00:49:59.603
Hurry up. What do you want?

1223
00:49:59.603 --> 00:50:00.672
This one?

1224
00:50:00.943 --> 00:50:02.373
- This one. - That one?

1225
00:50:02.443 --> 00:50:03.443
- That one? - Yes.

1226
00:50:03.873 --> 00:50:06.112
Go quickly. We don't have time.

1227
00:50:06.183 --> 00:50:08.242
We have three minutes left.

1228
00:50:08.583 --> 00:50:12.052
Go quickly. I will get coffee.

1229
00:50:12.882 --> 00:50:14.552
Go to the counter.

1230
00:50:15.882 --> 00:50:17.922
Si An picks up the speed.

1231
00:50:18.123 --> 00:50:19.862
At this rate, he will succeed.

1232
00:50:20.463 --> 00:50:22.322
- Hello. Are you ready? - Yes.

1233
00:50:23.063 --> 00:50:25.563
Thank you. Would you like a bag?

1234
00:50:25.632 --> 00:50:26.963
- Yes. - Okay.

1235
00:50:27.063 --> 00:50:28.833
- Please hurry. - Okay.

1236
00:50:28.833 --> 00:50:30.873
Si An, this one too.

1237
00:50:30.933 --> 00:50:33.373
- Please hurry. - Okay, I will.

1238
00:50:33.543 --> 00:50:34.643
Do you have money?

1239
00:50:34.802 --> 00:50:37.342
- 6 dollars and 5 cents. - Money.

1240
00:50:37.342 --> 00:50:38.972
Take it out quickly.

1241
00:50:38.972 --> 00:50:41.943
Take it out quickly. You don't have time.

1242
00:50:41.943 --> 00:50:44.413
Take it out quickly. We have two minutes left.

1243
00:50:44.413 --> 00:50:46.282
Take it out quickly. Give it to her.

1244
00:50:46.282 --> 00:50:47.483
(Is this it?)

1245
00:50:47.483 --> 00:50:50.393
Take it out quickly. You don't have time.

1246
00:50:50.753 --> 00:50:52.552
You need to pay for it. Take it out quickly.

1247
00:50:53.893 --> 00:50:55.163
I need another dollar bill.

1248
00:50:55.163 --> 00:50:57.163
Giver her another one. Hurry up.

1249
00:50:57.463 --> 00:50:59.393
I need five cents, too.

1250
00:51:00.503 --> 00:51:03.472
50 cents. I received 7 dollars.

1251
00:51:03.733 --> 00:51:05.202
Put it inside.

1252
00:51:06.342 --> 00:51:09.472
- I can't do it. - No, put it inside.

1253
00:51:09.472 --> 00:51:10.813
Hurry up and zip it up.

1254
00:51:11.273 --> 00:51:13.043
(Wrinkling)

1255
00:51:13.043 --> 00:51:15.342
Take the change. Take the change first.

1256
00:51:15.683 --> 00:51:16.813
Take the change first.

1257
00:51:16.813 --> 00:51:19.152
Take 6 dollars and 5 cents.

1258
00:51:20.152 --> 00:51:22.253
Put it in the pouch. Let's go.

1259
00:51:22.793 --> 00:51:24.393
Gosh, I am so frustrated.

1260
00:51:24.552 --> 00:51:26.762
Put it in here with the receipt.

1261
00:51:27.262 --> 00:51:30.163
Thank you.

1262
00:51:30.333 --> 00:51:31.963
Let's go. Let's go.

1263
00:51:32.333 --> 00:51:35.202
- Don't forget to say bye. - Bye.

1264
00:51:35.262 --> 00:51:36.702
Let's go quickly.

1265
00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:39.202
Run. Oh, my goodness. We have one minute left.

1266
00:51:40.043 --> 00:51:41.172
Hurry up.

1267
00:51:41.603 --> 00:51:43.512
- Bye. - Hurry up.

1268
00:51:45.913 --> 00:51:47.413
Hurry up. Your sisters are waiting.

1269
00:51:47.413 --> 00:51:49.882
The bus is coming. We have one minute left.

1270
00:51:50.253 --> 00:51:51.683
We have one minute left. Hurry up.

1271
00:51:51.683 --> 00:51:55.422
(Seol A and Soo A, I am on my way.)

1272
00:51:56.222 --> 00:51:58.523
I see them.

1273
00:51:59.523 --> 00:52:02.322
- How many minutes remain? - How many minutes remain?

1274
00:52:02.362 --> 00:52:05.293
Bus number 61 will be here in a minute.

1275
00:52:06.933 --> 00:52:09.202
The bus is coming.

1276
00:52:10.503 --> 00:52:12.072
Did you get the straws?

1277
00:52:12.433 --> 00:52:13.873
Did you get the straws?

1278
00:52:15.643 --> 00:52:18.472
- Please give me straws. - Hurry up.

1279
00:52:19.172 --> 00:52:21.413
Please give me straws.

1280
00:52:23.652 --> 00:52:26.882
Si An, you need to hurry. We have one minute left.

1281
00:52:27.052 --> 00:52:30.293
Okay, Dad. Wait.

1282
00:52:32.353 --> 00:52:35.322
Please give me three straws.

1283
00:52:38.092 --> 00:52:40.233
Please hurry.

1284
00:52:45.103 --> 00:52:48.373
I got the straws, Dad.

1285
00:52:48.443 --> 00:52:51.342
I got the straws.

1286
00:52:51.643 --> 00:52:54.012
Hurry up, Si An. The bus is coming.

1287
00:52:54.012 --> 00:52:55.983
The bus is here. Hurry up.

1288
00:52:57.552 --> 00:53:01.353
(I am going with the straws, Dad.)

1289
00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:05.253
(I am going, Dad.)

1290
00:53:06.052 --> 00:53:07.163
Hurry up.

1291
00:53:07.722 --> 00:53:09.422
Hurry up. The bus is here.

1292
00:53:09.422 --> 00:53:11.463
(He is running as fast as he can.)

1293
00:53:14.802 --> 00:53:16.873
- Straws. Straws. - Hurry up.

1294
00:53:16.873 --> 00:53:19.302
Did you get the straws? There goes the bus.

1295
00:53:21.003 --> 00:53:22.603
We need to wait another 10 minutes.

1296
00:53:24.172 --> 00:53:26.983
I am sorry. Let's go. You did a good job.

1297
00:53:27.112 --> 00:53:28.512
It's okay to miss the bus.

1298
00:53:28.983 --> 00:53:31.782
Dad, the bus left.

1299
00:53:32.353 --> 00:53:33.652
Did the bus leave?

1300
00:53:33.822 --> 00:53:36.422
- Yes. - Si An was too slow.

1301
00:53:36.592 --> 00:53:38.952
- It's Dad's fault. - No, it's not.

1302
00:53:38.952 --> 00:53:42.063
Si An went into the store again.

1303
00:53:42.222 --> 00:53:44.762
It's your fault.

1304
00:53:45.092 --> 00:53:46.963
No, it's not.

1305
00:53:47.202 --> 00:53:49.833
- It's your fault. - I don't need the straw.

1306
00:53:49.833 --> 00:53:52.072
You went inside the mart to get the straws.

1307
00:53:53.802 --> 00:53:56.543
Si An is totally like a turtle.

1308
00:53:57.143 --> 00:53:58.543
He is so slow.

1309
00:53:58.543 --> 00:54:00.413
Were you a nobleman in your previous life?

1310
00:54:01.913 --> 00:54:04.612
He doesn't respond. How frustrating!

1311
00:54:05.282 --> 00:54:06.623
Respond.

1312
00:54:07.282 --> 00:54:08.353
Si An.

1313
00:54:09.552 --> 00:54:12.152
Finish the milk first. You must be thirsty.

1314
00:54:12.322 --> 00:54:13.663
You drink fast.

1315
00:54:15.362 --> 00:54:17.433
It's because his mouth is hungry.

1316
00:54:17.433 --> 00:54:18.933
Is his mouth hungry?

1317
00:54:19.063 --> 00:54:21.362
I finished...

1318
00:54:22.802 --> 00:54:24.503
How frustrating! What did you say?

1319
00:54:24.503 --> 00:54:25.972
Seol A...

1320
00:54:26.773 --> 00:54:29.402
Seol A finished the milk.

1321
00:54:29.572 --> 00:54:31.143
Did Seol A finish the milk?

1322
00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:34.342
Say it fast. "Seol A finished it."

1323
00:54:34.713 --> 00:54:36.012
Seol A finished it.

1324
00:54:36.043 --> 00:54:37.983
Say it fast. "Seol A finished it." Go.

1325
00:54:38.353 --> 00:54:40.152
Seol A...

1326
00:54:40.253 --> 00:54:41.583
How frustrating!

1327
00:54:41.853 --> 00:54:44.992
She finished it,

1328
00:54:44.992 --> 00:54:46.793
but I didn't.

1329
00:54:46.893 --> 00:54:50.492
I think you should learn how to speak faster.

1330
00:54:50.592 --> 00:54:52.333
It's frustrating for the others.

1331
00:54:52.433 --> 00:54:54.132
I don't know.

1332
00:54:54.132 --> 00:54:55.503
You don't know.

1333
00:54:56.632 --> 00:54:59.003
Okay. Stay slow.

1334
00:54:59.943 --> 00:55:02.672
You just need to go the right way.

1335
00:55:02.972 --> 00:55:05.443
Bus number 61.

1336
00:55:05.443 --> 00:55:06.813
Let's get on the bus.

1337
00:55:07.083 --> 00:55:08.443
Hello.

1338
00:55:08.713 --> 00:55:10.483
How much is the fare for a child?

1339
00:55:10.612 --> 00:55:12.713
It's free for preschoolers.

1340
00:55:12.753 --> 00:55:14.882
Let's go further in.

1341
00:55:15.222 --> 00:55:17.152
- Let's go further in. - Hello.

1342
00:55:17.152 --> 00:55:18.393
Hello.

1343
00:55:18.822 --> 00:55:19.992
Go further in.

1344
00:55:20.123 --> 00:55:21.762
My goodness.

1345
00:55:21.762 --> 00:55:23.293
Where are Seol A and Soo A?

1346
00:55:24.693 --> 00:55:26.032
Where are you, Seol A and Soo A?

1347
00:55:26.032 --> 00:55:27.302
(Where are my sisters?)

1348
00:55:28.333 --> 00:55:31.032
They look comfortable in the bus.

1349
00:55:31.032 --> 00:55:32.632
Have you taken the bus a few times?

1350
00:55:32.873 --> 00:55:33.972
Si An, where are you going?

1351
00:55:34.902 --> 00:55:37.242
We are going to the car hospital.

1352
00:55:37.242 --> 00:55:39.112
- You grew up. - Come here, Si An.

1353
00:55:39.443 --> 00:55:40.913
There is a seat. Let's go.

1354
00:55:42.612 --> 00:55:44.813
- Si An, sit here. - You grew up.

1355
00:55:44.813 --> 00:55:46.822
- Si An, sit here. - Sit here.

1356
00:55:47.152 --> 00:55:48.652
How pretty!

1357
00:55:49.382 --> 00:55:51.652
- Is your name Dae Bak? - No.

1358
00:55:52.052 --> 00:55:53.063
It's Si An.

1359
00:55:53.222 --> 00:55:55.793
It's Si An, not Dae Bak.

1360
00:55:56.762 --> 00:55:57.992
Is your name Ji An?

1361
00:55:58.092 --> 00:55:59.802
No, it's Si An.

1362
00:56:00.362 --> 00:56:01.902
I am cool.

1363
00:56:01.933 --> 00:56:04.233
I am getting off. Sit here with Dad.

1364
00:56:04.433 --> 00:56:07.242
Si An, you are riding a bus. This is a bus.

1365
00:56:08.302 --> 00:56:10.672
Bus is the biggest.

1366
00:56:11.043 --> 00:56:12.313
Bus is the biggest.

1367
00:56:12.313 --> 00:56:15.583
This is what you press to get off the bus.

1368
00:56:15.683 --> 00:56:19.083
When you go to school, you meet girls in a bus.

1369
00:56:20.422 --> 00:56:21.683
(It's a line that made men's hearts flutter.)

1370
00:56:21.683 --> 00:56:23.523
I get off here.

1371
00:56:23.523 --> 00:56:24.552
(It's a line that made men's hearts flutter.)

1372
00:56:26.123 --> 00:56:27.822
Say, "I get off here."

1373
00:56:28.163 --> 00:56:30.563
Aunt gets off here.

1374
00:56:30.563 --> 00:56:32.293
(Aunt gets off here.)

1375
00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:36.733
(Let's hurry up and get off.)

1376
00:56:37.902 --> 00:56:39.202
I smell something.

1377
00:56:40.603 --> 00:56:42.702
It's the smell of ginkgo nuts.

1378
00:56:42.913 --> 00:56:45.943
These are ginkgo nuts. Si An, step on them.

1379
00:56:47.282 --> 00:56:48.413
(Dong Gook picks up and smells one.)

1380
00:56:48.413 --> 00:56:49.813
I stepped on them.

1381
00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:52.353
I think it's poop.

1382
00:56:52.353 --> 00:56:53.722
(The smell of poop pierces his nose.)

1383
00:56:54.853 --> 00:56:56.052
Smell it.

1384
00:56:56.422 --> 00:56:57.523
Here.

1385
00:56:59.092 --> 00:57:01.393
- It's stinky. - Come here.

1386
00:57:02.992 --> 00:57:04.693
Si An, smell it.

1387
00:57:05.592 --> 00:57:08.233
Smell it.

1388
00:57:09.972 --> 00:57:12.373
I just want you to smell it once.

1389
00:57:12.672 --> 00:57:15.972
What are you doing? Look at me.

1390
00:57:16.443 --> 00:57:17.572
(Si An's nose is hidden.)

1391
00:57:17.572 --> 00:57:19.072
Smell it like this.

1392
00:57:19.782 --> 00:57:22.742
I bet her armpit smells worse. Smell it.

1393
00:57:24.282 --> 00:57:25.882
Go. It smells like poop.

1394
00:57:25.882 --> 00:57:27.452
(Let me get out of here.)

1395
00:57:27.452 --> 00:57:28.552
I don't like it.

1396
00:57:28.882 --> 00:57:31.552
(Dong Gook refuses to back down.)

1397
00:57:31.552 --> 00:57:32.693
(Sneaky)

1398
00:57:33.193 --> 00:57:34.322
Here.

1399
00:57:34.322 --> 00:57:36.733
(The smell gets on his nose.)

1400
00:57:38.233 --> 00:57:40.733
It got on my nose!

1401
00:57:40.733 --> 00:57:43.172
- It got on my nose! - No, it didn't.

1402
00:57:43.202 --> 00:57:45.202
It didn't get on your nose.

1403
00:57:46.443 --> 00:57:49.043
It got on my nose because of you.

1404
00:57:49.043 --> 00:57:50.543
It didn't get on your nose.

1405
00:57:51.143 --> 00:57:53.083
(He is busy laughing.)

1406
00:57:53.083 --> 00:57:54.083
Do you smell it?

1407
00:57:54.813 --> 00:57:55.983
What does it smell like?

1408
00:57:56.353 --> 00:57:58.282
It doesn't smell like poop,

1409
00:57:58.753 --> 00:58:01.452
but bird poop.

1410
00:58:01.452 --> 00:58:03.052
Does it smell like bird poop?

1411
00:58:03.552 --> 00:58:05.552
(He is slightly apologetic.)

1412
00:58:06.463 --> 00:58:08.862
Si An, do you still smell it?

1413
00:58:09.422 --> 00:58:10.833
Is the smell following you?

1414
00:58:11.563 --> 00:58:13.463
It's where cars get fixed.

1415
00:58:13.463 --> 00:58:14.902
Look.

1416
00:58:16.172 --> 00:58:17.433
That's our car.

1417
00:58:17.433 --> 00:58:18.503
(His eyes are on Si An.)

1418
00:58:18.503 --> 00:58:20.672
Si An. Si An, what is this?

1419
00:58:20.873 --> 00:58:23.643
Si An, you got something on your shirt.

1420
00:58:25.012 --> 00:58:27.543
(Dong Gook does it again.)

1421
00:58:28.943 --> 00:58:32.382
(Secretary Lee, are you serious?)

1422
00:58:33.083 --> 00:58:35.123
(I've been hit again.)

1423
00:58:35.123 --> 00:58:37.452
Dad, you're quite mischievous.

1424
00:58:38.092 --> 00:58:41.123
(Si An's survival story as a son of Dong Gook)

1425
00:58:41.992 --> 00:58:44.333
(He will continue to be mischievous.)

1426
00:58:47.433 --> 00:58:48.433
(William and Ro Woon spend a good time.)

1427
00:58:48.433 --> 00:58:51.333
William and Ro Woon are out for a walk.

1428
00:58:51.632 --> 00:58:53.172
- William. - Food!

1429
00:58:53.172 --> 00:58:55.972
(Crying)

1430
00:58:57.612 --> 00:58:58.972
(William has missed his mealtime.)

1431
00:58:58.972 --> 00:59:00.443
William, do you want some food?

1432
00:59:01.443 --> 00:59:04.152
- Food? - Food.

1433
00:59:04.512 --> 00:59:05.813
- Food? - Can I feed him?

1434
00:59:05.813 --> 00:59:07.483
Sure. Give it a go.

1435
00:59:09.753 --> 00:59:11.393
(Smiling)

1436
00:59:12.123 --> 00:59:14.793
(William has regained his smile quickly.)

1437
00:59:14.793 --> 00:59:16.163
William, sit down.

1438
00:59:16.293 --> 00:59:18.132
- How do I feed him? - Right here...

1439
00:59:19.233 --> 00:59:22.532
Let him lie down, and put his head on your lap.

1440
00:59:22.833 --> 00:59:24.233
Put him down? On my lap?

1441
00:59:24.233 --> 00:59:25.873
(Ro Woon moves to make it comfortable for William.)

1442
00:59:26.472 --> 00:59:27.672
Is it too high?

1443
00:59:28.702 --> 00:59:30.643
I've never seen someone lie down like that.

1444
00:59:31.842 --> 00:59:33.583
Hey, you're a genius.

1445
00:59:34.983 --> 00:59:38.052
(He eats while resting his head on Ro Woon's lap.)

1446
00:59:38.413 --> 00:59:39.922
You're so smart.

1447
00:59:39.922 --> 00:59:41.123
(Your lap is so comfortable.)

1448
00:59:41.123 --> 00:59:42.483
That's right.

1449
00:59:42.483 --> 00:59:44.052
You have an older brother, right?

1450
00:59:44.693 --> 00:59:45.722
I do.

1451
00:59:45.853 --> 00:59:47.293
Is your brother good to you?

1452
00:59:50.833 --> 00:59:52.163
- Your reaction... - He is good to me.

1453
00:59:52.163 --> 00:59:53.163
He is?

1454
00:59:53.163 --> 00:59:56.773
William is going to have a younger sibling soon.

1455
00:59:57.402 --> 00:59:58.972
- I'm hungry. - Are you?

1456
00:59:59.072 --> 01:00:00.603
What do you like?

1457
01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:03.072
I like omelet rice and seafood jjajangmyeon.

1458
01:00:05.913 --> 01:00:09.753
Two bowls of seafood jjajangmyeon, please.

1459
01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:11.983
(He butchered the pronunciation.)

1460
01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:16.293
(Ro Woon, you should cut him some slack.)

1461
01:00:17.523 --> 01:00:19.722
Our meal is here.

1462
01:00:19.722 --> 01:00:21.193
(Both of them turn around at the same time.)

1463
01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:23.333
- Where? - That guy has them.

1464
01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:24.862
The one with the motorcycle helmet.

1465
01:00:24.862 --> 01:00:26.092
Hello.

1466
01:00:26.402 --> 01:00:27.802
- Should I put them there? - Yes, please.

1467
01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:34.543
(They both get up at the same time.)

1468
01:00:37.413 --> 01:00:39.512
I'd like to welcome you to the new world of food.

1469
01:00:39.643 --> 01:00:42.282
William, you haven't had jjajangmyeon, right?

1470
01:00:42.282 --> 01:00:44.052
(It's William's first time seeing jjajangmyeon.)

1471
01:00:44.952 --> 01:00:46.523
(Where are my manners?)

1472
01:00:46.753 --> 01:00:48.952
(I'm sorry I said hi so late.)

1473
01:00:48.952 --> 01:00:50.393
Are you saying hello?

1474
01:00:50.652 --> 01:00:51.722
- Hi. - Hi.

1475
01:00:52.353 --> 01:00:54.163
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

1476
01:00:54.163 --> 01:00:56.063
- Please enjoy. - Have a tasty trip back.

1477
01:00:56.632 --> 01:00:58.163
What? Tasty trip back?

1478
01:00:58.663 --> 01:00:59.802
That looks delicious.

1479
01:01:00.163 --> 01:01:02.202
(Rubbing)

1480
01:01:03.972 --> 01:01:06.032
(The class of a guy living in Korea for 15 years)

1481
01:01:06.842 --> 01:01:08.943
I just remove the wrap. Why are you doing that?

1482
01:01:08.943 --> 01:01:10.413
It's neater this way.

1483
01:01:11.913 --> 01:01:13.183
I should do it later.

1484
01:01:13.183 --> 01:01:14.382
(My daddy is the best!)

1485
01:01:16.282 --> 01:01:19.382
(Is the plastic wrap coming off neatly?)

1486
01:01:19.683 --> 01:01:20.822
Did you see that?

1487
01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:22.452
This looks good.

1488
01:01:25.353 --> 01:01:27.563
William, this is how you mix the noodles.

1489
01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:30.193
I'm glad I learned how to mix the noodles.

1490
01:01:30.762 --> 01:01:32.293
- Jjajangmyeon... - Jjajang...

1491
01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:34.362
(Jjajang)

1492
01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:37.572
(The noodles are mixed well.)

1493
01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:41.202
(Daddy, please feed me quickly.)

1494
01:01:42.273 --> 01:01:44.172
William, have a taste. See what it tastes like.

1495
01:01:44.742 --> 01:01:47.143
William tastes it. How will he react?

1496
01:01:49.282 --> 01:01:51.353
(The size of his eyes double.)

1497
01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:52.583
This is like rice cake.

1498
01:01:53.483 --> 01:01:54.922
This is like glutinous rice cake.

1499
01:01:57.452 --> 01:01:59.762
It seems like he's in love with jjajangmyeon.

1500
01:02:00.822 --> 01:02:03.233
(Surprised by the taste, he raises his eyebrows.)

1501
01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:06.802
Since he's at it, he eats a noodle too.

1502
01:02:08.503 --> 01:02:09.802
Don't bite the chopsticks.

1503
01:02:09.802 --> 01:02:11.603
- I guess he likes it. - Don't spill.

1504
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:12.972
(He's about to eat the chopsticks as well.)

1505
01:02:13.443 --> 01:02:15.842
(He chews 2 times faster than before.)

1506
01:02:15.842 --> 01:02:18.472
He didn't even chew. He's just swallowing it.

1507
01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:19.842
(Slurping)

1508
01:02:20.983 --> 01:02:22.853
Is it good? Is it tasty?

1509
01:02:22.853 --> 01:02:24.512
(He eats up the last piece of the noodle.)

1510
01:02:26.983 --> 01:02:28.722
You should give the whole thing to William.

1511
01:02:29.353 --> 01:02:30.492
I think I should.

1512
01:02:30.492 --> 01:02:32.052
(Keep feeding me.)

1513
01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:33.523
William, I will feed you.

1514
01:02:35.322 --> 01:02:37.163
- A lot for Daddy. - He keeps on eating.

1515
01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:39.733
Food.

1516
01:02:41.503 --> 01:02:44.733
(He opens his mouth wide like a baby bird.)

1517
01:02:45.532 --> 01:02:50.612
(He eats a lot with a small mouth he has.)

1518
01:02:55.213 --> 01:02:57.413
It's healthier when babies eat well.

1519
01:02:57.853 --> 01:03:03.592
(That's right. This is the best.)

1520
01:03:03.793 --> 01:03:06.052
All right. I'll eat the fallen pieces.

1521
01:03:07.322 --> 01:03:08.563
(Don't eat my food.)

1522
01:03:08.563 --> 01:03:09.733
Is it good?

1523
01:03:14.802 --> 01:03:16.802
(Chewing)

1524
01:03:17.672 --> 01:03:20.472
(I never knew something could be so tasty.)

1525
01:03:20.742 --> 01:03:21.742
(What is this?)

1526
01:03:21.742 --> 01:03:23.213
- Is it empty? - Yes.

1527
01:03:23.213 --> 01:03:24.543
I told you that it was.

1528
01:03:26.213 --> 01:03:27.543
(Please give me that.)

1529
01:03:27.543 --> 01:03:28.612
You hurt me.

1530
01:03:28.983 --> 01:03:30.552
(What's wrong with William now?)

1531
01:03:31.483 --> 01:03:32.753
William, what do you want?

1532
01:03:34.152 --> 01:03:36.523
Oh, my. He wants slices of pickled radish too?

1533
01:03:37.152 --> 01:03:39.222
William, do you want a slice of picked radish?

1534
01:03:40.163 --> 01:03:41.222
This one?

1535
01:03:41.663 --> 01:03:43.933
But how can I eat this without a spoon?

1536
01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:47.362
(He's experiencing all kinds of new tastes.)

1537
01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:48.663
Spoon.

1538
01:03:50.802 --> 01:03:52.632
(What is this?)

1539
01:03:53.302 --> 01:03:56.943
(I didn't know there were so many I missed out on.)

1540
01:03:57.972 --> 01:03:59.273
Aren't you blown away, William?

1541
01:04:01.342 --> 01:04:03.052
(Crunchy)

1542
01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:05.253
(He can't stop eating it.)

1543
01:04:05.253 --> 01:04:07.853
I just got a compliment.

1544
01:04:08.253 --> 01:04:10.152
(This is tasty.)

1545
01:04:10.853 --> 01:04:12.552
(When I taste it after taking a breath,)

1546
01:04:12.552 --> 01:04:17.163
(it gets sourer and tastier.)

1547
01:04:18.532 --> 01:04:20.702
- We forgot something. - What is it?

1548
01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:22.972
- We didn't drink water. - We didn't?

1549
01:04:22.972 --> 01:04:25.333
- I might lose my breath. - Really?

1550
01:04:25.402 --> 01:04:27.342
(Ro Woon is certainly a good actor.)

1551
01:04:27.802 --> 01:04:29.572
I got it. I will...

1552
01:04:30.612 --> 01:04:32.172
get us some drinks.

1553
01:04:32.172 --> 01:04:34.413
- So watch William for me. - Okay.

1554
01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:36.083
Please watch him for me.

1555
01:04:36.382 --> 01:04:37.612
I will be back.

1556
01:04:38.382 --> 01:04:40.523
(Sam leaves to buy some water.)

1557
01:04:41.322 --> 01:04:42.452
Let's sit down.

1558
01:04:42.452 --> 01:04:43.952
(Ro Woon and William spend the time by themselves.)

1559
01:04:45.253 --> 01:04:48.463
This isn't a good song for William, but I'll try.

1560
01:04:49.163 --> 01:04:51.492
(What are you going to do?)

1561
01:04:53.302 --> 01:04:56.003
(Ro Woon sings "Gangnam Style" for William.)

1562
01:04:57.003 --> 01:04:59.472
In the afternoon, she's kind

1563
01:04:59.472 --> 01:05:01.802
(William reacts to his singing.)

1564
01:05:03.072 --> 01:05:05.512
(What is this song? This is nice.)

1565
01:05:05.813 --> 01:05:08.842
(This baby gets it going with the beat.)

1566
01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:13.753
(William, you are beautiful and lovely.)

1567
01:05:14.322 --> 01:05:15.452
(That's you)

1568
01:05:15.853 --> 01:05:17.422
(I'm talking about you)

1569
01:05:18.452 --> 01:05:20.822
(I'm so happy.)

1570
01:05:24.393 --> 01:05:25.793
(My style is from Gangnam)

1571
01:05:26.433 --> 01:05:30.933
(William, you're my kind of baby.)

1572
01:05:35.373 --> 01:05:38.012
(The joint performance of Ro Woon and William ends.)

1573
01:05:39.483 --> 01:05:40.612
Let's study.

1574
01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:45.112
This means snake.

1575
01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:47.382
Try it. Try all of it.

1576
01:05:47.483 --> 01:05:49.183
(When I don't, smiling is the best option.)

1577
01:05:49.183 --> 01:05:50.222
This is a skunk.

1578
01:05:51.422 --> 01:05:54.563
(He is completely distracted.)

1579
01:05:57.132 --> 01:05:58.193
There?

1580
01:05:58.762 --> 01:06:00.762
Isn't studying hard?

1581
01:06:01.603 --> 01:06:03.532
I was just like you when I was young.

1582
01:06:04.902 --> 01:06:07.873
But if you don't want a hard life as an adult,

1583
01:06:07.873 --> 01:06:10.273
you must start studying now.

1584
01:06:10.443 --> 01:06:12.242
If you don't study now,

1585
01:06:12.242 --> 01:06:13.782
things will be tough when you grow up.

1586
01:06:15.313 --> 01:06:17.152
Since we are out, let's ride the swing.

1587
01:06:18.382 --> 01:06:20.483
This is a lake.

1588
01:06:21.183 --> 01:06:23.492
(Looking stiff)

1589
01:06:23.492 --> 01:06:25.853
(Ro Woon is holding him tightly.)

1590
01:06:26.322 --> 01:06:27.463
Are you scared?

1591
01:06:30.092 --> 01:06:33.563
When you're older, swings are pieces of cake.

1592
01:06:34.632 --> 01:06:36.802
(This is fun, Ro Woon.)

1593
01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.873
What's taking Sam so long?

1594
01:06:42.103 --> 01:06:44.842
Taking care of a baby is hard.

1595
01:06:47.543 --> 01:06:50.052
Meanwhile, Sam left to buy some water.

1596
01:06:50.753 --> 01:06:52.683
He's heading to the restroom.

1597
01:06:52.683 --> 01:06:53.753
(Restroom)

1598
01:06:54.523 --> 01:06:55.882
(Letting out a sigh)

1599
01:06:55.882 --> 01:06:58.353
(Does his stomach hurt?)

1600
01:06:58.353 --> 01:06:59.822
I hope he likes this.

1601
01:07:04.262 --> 01:07:05.693
Goodness!

1602
01:07:05.693 --> 01:07:07.163
What's up with your outfit?

1603
01:07:07.163 --> 01:07:09.302
Since it was Ro Woon's birthday,

1604
01:07:09.302 --> 01:07:12.003
I wanted to do something special for him.

1605
01:07:12.003 --> 01:07:14.472
People go crazy when their favorite person shows up.

1606
01:07:14.643 --> 01:07:16.003
I think he will really like it.

1607
01:07:17.172 --> 01:07:19.373
I must do this as today is his birthday.

1608
01:07:20.782 --> 01:07:22.443
(Ro Woon, someone is coming.)

1609
01:07:23.483 --> 01:07:26.552
(He's suddenly feeling ecstatic.)

1610
01:07:27.382 --> 01:07:30.523
- Look at this. - Hi. I'm SpongeBob.

1611
01:07:30.623 --> 01:07:33.063
(This is Monster SpongeBob.)

1612
01:07:33.362 --> 01:07:36.862
The arm must stretch! Come on, stretch!

1613
01:07:36.862 --> 01:07:37.933
Hi.

1614
01:07:39.262 --> 01:07:40.862
(What about William?)

1615
01:07:43.702 --> 01:07:45.472
(He bursts into tears.)

1616
01:07:47.043 --> 01:07:51.112
(He's weeping like Zo In Sung.)

1617
01:07:53.143 --> 01:07:55.083
I'm SpongeBob.

1618
01:07:55.713 --> 01:07:58.112
Shake my hands. Give me a high-five.

1619
01:07:59.313 --> 01:08:01.123
(He keeps on crying.)

1620
01:08:01.123 --> 01:08:03.023
- Give me a high-five. - He misses his dad.

1621
01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:05.452
That's okay.

1622
01:08:05.452 --> 01:08:06.922
- He'll be back soon. - Daddy.

1623
01:08:08.422 --> 01:08:10.293
Stop crying.

1624
01:08:10.293 --> 01:08:11.433
(It seems he won't stop crying anytime soon.)

1625
01:08:11.663 --> 01:08:13.463
William, it's daddy.

1626
01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:14.833
Daddy?

1627
01:08:15.462 --> 01:08:18.773
William, it's daddy.

1628
01:08:19.502 --> 01:08:22.703
(Really? Are you my dad?)

1629
01:08:22.703 --> 01:08:23.743
William.

1630
01:08:23.743 --> 01:08:25.073
(William stopped crying instantly.)

1631
01:08:28.643 --> 01:08:30.313
(Wait. That's his dad?)

1632
01:08:31.953 --> 01:08:33.722
SpongeBob isn't this fat.

1633
01:08:33.953 --> 01:08:36.252
It's because I'm sitting down.

1634
01:08:39.052 --> 01:08:41.462
(Laughing)

1635
01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.493
- What did you say? - Take it off!

1636
01:08:44.493 --> 01:08:47.433
Why? I'm Bob...

1637
01:08:48.233 --> 01:08:51.073
Hey! My goodness.

1638
01:08:53.842 --> 01:08:55.573
William. Hello.

1639
01:08:57.012 --> 01:08:58.073
(Good job, Dad.)

1640
01:08:58.073 --> 01:08:59.542
You knew it was me, right?

1641
01:08:59.842 --> 01:09:00.842
I knew it.

1642
01:09:00.842 --> 01:09:02.853
I want to know why you chose SpongeBob.

1643
01:09:03.052 --> 01:09:05.353
I heard that you like SpongeBob the most.

1644
01:09:05.552 --> 01:09:08.582
I wanted to put on a special event for you.

1645
01:09:08.882 --> 01:09:09.893
How do you feel?

1646
01:09:10.092 --> 01:09:11.592
- Good. - Good, right?

1647
01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:15.162
It's a birthday cake made by SpongeBob!

1648
01:09:16.493 --> 01:09:18.632
Happy birthday to you

1649
01:09:18.632 --> 01:09:21.433
Happy birthday dear Ro Woon

1650
01:09:21.433 --> 01:09:23.433
Happy birthday to you

1651
01:09:23.433 --> 01:09:25.433
(Happy 9th birthday!)

1652
01:09:26.672 --> 01:09:28.342
Clap!

1653
01:09:28.943 --> 01:09:32.042
(Let's meet again soon.)

1654
01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:33.783
High-five.

1655
01:09:33.912 --> 01:09:34.912
Ta-da.

1656
01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:36.813
- What is it? - Guess.

1657
01:09:37.412 --> 01:09:40.523
Before you were born when you were inside Mom,

1658
01:09:40.523 --> 01:09:42.183
you were this big. You were like a pea.

1659
01:09:42.252 --> 01:09:43.823
You were smaller than your nail.

1660
01:09:44.222 --> 01:09:45.422
This is you.

1661
01:09:45.422 --> 01:09:47.063
(Seung Jae was as small as a pea.)

1662
01:09:47.292 --> 01:09:49.193
- What else? - More?

1663
01:09:49.563 --> 01:09:50.933
You must have been on your stomach.

1664
01:09:51.193 --> 01:09:52.233
That's your butt.

1665
01:09:52.363 --> 01:09:53.962
I see your penis too.

1666
01:09:54.762 --> 01:09:55.863
I'm serious.

1667
01:09:56.332 --> 01:09:57.332
Penis.

1668
01:09:58.132 --> 01:10:01.372
- I'll ask Mom. - Yes, ask her later.

1669
01:10:01.443 --> 01:10:03.273
Then what happened?

1670
01:10:03.342 --> 01:10:05.773
This is when you were 37 weeks and 4 days.

1671
01:10:05.912 --> 01:10:07.542
This is just before you were born.

1672
01:10:07.813 --> 01:10:09.983
Do you know what we called you then?

1673
01:10:09.983 --> 01:10:11.313
(Seung Jae's baby bump nickname)

1674
01:10:11.313 --> 01:10:13.283
We called you Thumb.

1675
01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:14.523
Guess why we picked that.

1676
01:10:16.023 --> 01:10:17.752
From a long time ago,

1677
01:10:17.752 --> 01:10:20.092
we used the word thumb to describe a beginning.

1678
01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:23.433
Seung Jae... That's right too.

1679
01:10:23.592 --> 01:10:26.403
We wanted you to become the best.

1680
01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:27.502
That's why you were Thumb.

1681
01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:29.533
Just like his nickname,

1682
01:10:29.603 --> 01:10:31.403
Seung Jae became the best to his parents.

1683
01:10:32.203 --> 01:10:33.943
What were you doing in Mom's belly?

1684
01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:35.903
I was playing a dinosaur.

1685
01:10:37.273 --> 01:10:40.082
The dinosaurs were swimming in the water.

1686
01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:41.542
How?

1687
01:10:42.512 --> 01:10:45.653
(Let's travel back to being Thumb.)

1688
01:10:47.622 --> 01:10:49.653
Were you swimming in Mom's belly?

1689
01:10:50.323 --> 01:10:51.622
Like a fish?

1690
01:10:52.323 --> 01:10:54.792
Seung Jae, did you like being inside Mom?

1691
01:10:54.863 --> 01:10:56.363
- Yes. - Really?

1692
01:10:56.433 --> 01:10:58.563
Mom set the sheets for me.

1693
01:10:58.563 --> 01:11:00.063
Did she set the sheets for you?

1694
01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:02.802
- It was comfortable. - Was it?

1695
01:11:02.802 --> 01:11:06.243
She set down the sheets, so I got a pillow...

1696
01:11:06.243 --> 01:11:08.243
and held tightly onto a baby rabbit.

1697
01:11:08.302 --> 01:11:09.813
- A baby rabbit? - Yes.

1698
01:11:09.872 --> 01:11:12.172
Were you friends since then?

1699
01:11:12.172 --> 01:11:13.313
- Yes. - Wow.

1700
01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:15.082
You were like this...

1701
01:11:15.342 --> 01:11:16.712
until you came out like this.

1702
01:11:16.712 --> 01:11:18.382
(Seung Jae was born on October 6, 2014.)

1703
01:11:19.052 --> 01:11:20.922
It's been six days since Thumb came out.

1704
01:11:22.422 --> 01:11:26.493
He's happy after eating. He's playing with Dad.

1705
01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:28.622
Gosh, you're cute.

1706
01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:30.832
(Seung Jae was as big as a thumb,)

1707
01:11:30.832 --> 01:11:32.262
(but now he's a big boy.)

1708
01:11:32.262 --> 01:11:34.132
Then Seung Jae came out?

1709
01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:37.972
You were in there for 39 weeks and 4 days.

1710
01:11:38.233 --> 01:11:40.542
She incubated me like a chicken.

1711
01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:41.703
Yes, like a chicken.

1712
01:11:41.773 --> 01:11:44.243
A chicken incubates the chicks.

1713
01:11:44.313 --> 01:11:46.113
Was it like that?

1714
01:11:46.183 --> 01:11:48.943
You should be good to Mom, right?

1715
01:11:49.113 --> 01:11:50.512
It's your birthday, right?

1716
01:11:50.512 --> 01:11:54.153
Mom became a mom that day too.

1717
01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:57.552
I thought about it and it's my wife's...

1718
01:11:57.622 --> 01:12:00.122
3rd birthday as a mom.

1719
01:12:00.262 --> 01:12:03.563
It would be nice to surprise her too.

1720
01:12:05.033 --> 01:12:06.632
What is Mom's favorite color?

1721
01:12:06.933 --> 01:12:08.533
- Purple. - Purple.

1722
01:12:08.703 --> 01:12:09.773
It's purple.

1723
01:12:09.802 --> 01:12:11.672
I'm going to go buy a cake.

1724
01:12:11.672 --> 01:12:15.103
You can go in and pick a flower she would like.

1725
01:12:15.103 --> 01:12:16.243
- Okay. - Here.

1726
01:12:16.943 --> 01:12:17.972
Welcome.

1727
01:12:18.073 --> 01:12:20.542
Hello. I'm here to buy flowers.

1728
01:12:20.542 --> 01:12:21.643
Do you want flowers?

1729
01:12:21.783 --> 01:12:23.313
Who are they for?

1730
01:12:23.613 --> 01:12:24.752
- Mom. - Your mom?

1731
01:12:24.813 --> 01:12:28.523
- My mom likes purple. - Purple?

1732
01:12:28.752 --> 01:12:30.552
Do you want me to pack this one?

1733
01:12:30.622 --> 01:12:31.622
Yes.

1734
01:12:32.552 --> 01:12:34.893
What color wrapping paper do you want?

1735
01:12:34.962 --> 01:12:36.762
Black, please. Black.

1736
01:12:37.233 --> 01:12:38.962
Is it a special day today?

1737
01:12:39.162 --> 01:12:42.433
- It's Mom's birthday. - It's her birthday?

1738
01:12:42.703 --> 01:12:45.502
- Should we write a card? - Yes.

1739
01:12:45.573 --> 01:12:47.703
What should we write? Can you write?

1740
01:12:47.703 --> 01:12:49.273
- Yes. - Try it.

1741
01:12:49.443 --> 01:12:50.972
- This is Mom. - Mom.

1742
01:12:50.972 --> 01:12:52.643
- This is Seung Jae. - Seung Jae.

1743
01:12:53.313 --> 01:12:54.313
I'm done.

1744
01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:57.412
- Bye. - Bye.

1745
01:12:57.853 --> 01:12:59.012
- Dad. - Did you buy it?

1746
01:12:59.483 --> 01:13:02.222
- Hello. Thank you. - I bought this.

1747
01:13:02.222 --> 01:13:04.252
- This is Mom's card. - Did you get a card too?

1748
01:13:04.252 --> 01:13:07.523
- She'll be happy, right? - Thank you.

1749
01:13:07.722 --> 01:13:08.722
Let's go.

1750
01:13:08.962 --> 01:13:10.233
Seung Jae, can you hear me? Over.

1751
01:13:10.292 --> 01:13:12.092
Dad, can you hear me? Over.

1752
01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:13.533
I can hear you. Over.

1753
01:13:14.063 --> 01:13:16.033
Seung Jae. Our mission name is...

1754
01:13:16.103 --> 01:13:19.233
"Surprise Mom". Do you understand? Over.

1755
01:13:19.433 --> 01:13:20.773
I got it. Over.

1756
01:13:21.342 --> 01:13:24.073
Let's make a path of flowers for her.

1757
01:13:25.012 --> 01:13:27.342
(He's so excited.)

1758
01:13:27.613 --> 01:13:29.983
- It looks great, Dad. - Isn't it?

1759
01:13:30.252 --> 01:13:32.783
Do I go in here?

1760
01:13:33.122 --> 01:13:34.122
No.

1761
01:13:35.382 --> 01:13:37.393
Let's have Mom open this.

1762
01:13:37.393 --> 01:13:39.323
(It's a mysterious box instead of Seung Jae.)

1763
01:13:40.462 --> 01:13:42.832
I'll go upstairs, and you should...

1764
01:13:42.832 --> 01:13:44.563
go to the kitchen until she comes. Over.

1765
01:13:45.132 --> 01:13:47.132
I'm downstairs. Over.

1766
01:13:47.733 --> 01:13:50.403
Will their surprise party be successful?

1767
01:13:50.832 --> 01:13:52.943
Call Mom. Over.

1768
01:13:53.443 --> 01:13:54.443
Okay. Over.

1769
01:13:54.743 --> 01:13:56.342
Go, Ko Ji Yong!

1770
01:13:58.972 --> 01:13:59.983
Hello?

1771
01:14:00.342 --> 01:14:02.183
Hello. Are you coming soon?

1772
01:14:02.643 --> 01:14:04.552
Very soon. I'm almost there.

1773
01:14:04.552 --> 01:14:06.122
- Soon? - Yes.

1774
01:14:06.122 --> 01:14:07.422
How many minutes?

1775
01:14:07.683 --> 01:14:09.183
Maybe 10 minutes? 5 to 10 minutes.

1776
01:14:09.252 --> 01:14:10.823
- Drive safe. - Okay.

1777
01:14:11.592 --> 01:14:13.063
(What is Seung Jae doing in the meanwhile?)

1778
01:14:14.422 --> 01:14:16.662
(Swimming)

1779
01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:21.233
(He's swimming in flower petals.)

1780
01:14:21.903 --> 01:14:22.903
Hey!

1781
01:14:24.302 --> 01:14:26.743
(It's ruined...)

1782
01:14:28.773 --> 01:14:30.372
(Running)

1783
01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:32.342
Come here.

1784
01:14:33.082 --> 01:14:34.683
I'll let it go since it's your birthday.

1785
01:14:37.252 --> 01:14:39.153
Seung Jae, you have to sit here.

1786
01:14:39.153 --> 01:14:40.752
When Mom gets home,

1787
01:14:40.752 --> 01:14:43.993
- give her these flowers. - Okay.

1788
01:14:44.052 --> 01:14:46.662
Then you can tell me to go.

1789
01:14:46.662 --> 01:14:47.722
Watch it carefully.

1790
01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:51.063
You drive me crazy.

1791
01:14:51.762 --> 01:14:54.502
He's rushing to fix the flower path.

1792
01:14:54.962 --> 01:14:57.573
It's not easy to do a surprise.

1793
01:14:58.502 --> 01:15:00.143
I feel like I went through a drill.

1794
01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:01.903
Dad!

1795
01:15:02.703 --> 01:15:03.712
Dad!

1796
01:15:04.573 --> 01:15:07.512
Dad, I love you!

1797
01:15:07.512 --> 01:15:09.113
(He must feel sorry.)

1798
01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:11.912
I love you too. I love you, Seung Jae.

1799
01:15:12.082 --> 01:15:13.783
I love you more!

1800
01:15:14.353 --> 01:15:15.853
I love you more.

1801
01:15:16.622 --> 01:15:18.092
(Kissing)

1802
01:15:18.092 --> 01:15:19.292
Dad...

1803
01:15:19.292 --> 01:15:20.292
What?

1804
01:15:20.563 --> 01:15:23.033
Dad, buy me a lot of chocolates!

1805
01:15:23.533 --> 01:15:24.792
(No wonder he was being sweet.)

1806
01:15:24.792 --> 01:15:26.962
Ask Mom for that. Over.

1807
01:15:27.433 --> 01:15:29.533
When is Mom coming? Over.

1808
01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:31.172
Let's see.

1809
01:15:32.703 --> 01:15:34.042
(Focused)

1810
01:15:35.203 --> 01:15:37.172
Yang Im is back just in time.

1811
01:15:37.613 --> 01:15:40.243
They should get ready.

1812
01:15:43.412 --> 01:15:45.483
(Confused)

1813
01:15:45.483 --> 01:15:46.752
What is this all of a sudden?

1814
01:15:48.023 --> 01:15:49.752
(He doesn't know she's back.)

1815
01:15:49.922 --> 01:15:51.993
- Seung Jae, talk. - What is this?

1816
01:15:54.393 --> 01:15:56.393
- Seung Jae, talk. - What is this?

1817
01:15:56.393 --> 01:15:57.693
Dad, go!

1818
01:15:58.132 --> 01:16:00.033
- Seung Jae, talk. - What is this?

1819
01:16:00.162 --> 01:16:01.363
Dad, go!

1820
01:16:02.162 --> 01:16:06.243
(The surprise party ended in 5 seconds.)

1821
01:16:07.273 --> 01:16:08.672
(He's just excited to see his mom.)

1822
01:16:08.672 --> 01:16:10.613
- What's this? - They're flowers.

1823
01:16:11.273 --> 01:16:12.542
- Flowers? - Yes.

1824
01:16:13.313 --> 01:16:15.582
(Seung Jae, what's wrong with you?)

1825
01:16:17.412 --> 01:16:20.222
(The candles are not cooperating.)

1826
01:16:21.353 --> 01:16:23.252
(Rushing)

1827
01:16:24.393 --> 01:16:26.222
- What is this? - Ta-da.

1828
01:16:27.863 --> 01:16:29.363
You have no idea why we're doing this.

1829
01:16:30.363 --> 01:16:32.092
- Blow it. - It's his birthday.

1830
01:16:32.563 --> 01:16:33.563
Just blow it.

1831
01:16:33.563 --> 01:16:34.632
(I want to blow too.)

1832
01:16:35.162 --> 01:16:36.533
I should have done three.

1833
01:16:37.233 --> 01:16:39.203
(Blowing)

1834
01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:41.372
- It's his birthday, - I know.

1835
01:16:41.872 --> 01:16:45.073
but it's also your fourth year as a mom.

1836
01:16:45.972 --> 01:16:48.882
No, keep it on. Keep it on.

1837
01:16:49.113 --> 01:16:52.313
I'm thankful. He knows.

1838
01:16:53.283 --> 01:16:54.552
I'm glad he knows.

1839
01:16:55.222 --> 01:16:57.993
He's not very good at expressing himself.

1840
01:16:57.993 --> 01:16:59.153
I was thankful.

1841
01:17:00.363 --> 01:17:03.332
I'm giving you a flower because I love you.

1842
01:17:03.332 --> 01:17:04.592
Thank you.

1843
01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.632
It's because you like purple.

1844
01:17:06.632 --> 01:17:08.462
Did you know I like purple?

1845
01:17:08.533 --> 01:17:10.103
What's the name of this flower?

1846
01:17:10.172 --> 01:17:11.172
Purple.

1847
01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:15.403
- Look. - What is that?

1848
01:17:15.943 --> 01:17:17.943
It's a letter for you.

1849
01:17:18.512 --> 01:17:19.783
What did you write?

1850
01:17:19.783 --> 01:17:21.483
- It says "Mom". - Did you write it?

1851
01:17:21.683 --> 01:17:23.153
Did you write that?

1852
01:17:23.252 --> 01:17:25.483
Yes, like this. I can just do it.

1853
01:17:25.512 --> 01:17:28.023
Then I'll give you a thumb up.

1854
01:17:28.153 --> 01:17:29.752
- Thank you. - Yes.

1855
01:17:30.052 --> 01:17:31.323
There's so many.

1856
01:17:32.422 --> 01:17:33.523
What is that, Seung Jae?

1857
01:17:34.262 --> 01:17:36.162
(It's a candy ring.)

1858
01:17:37.792 --> 01:17:39.092
It's over here.

1859
01:17:40.233 --> 01:17:41.233
One.

1860
01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:43.132
- Seven. - Seven.

1861
01:17:43.302 --> 01:17:45.233
- Buy. Green. - Buy.

1862
01:17:45.233 --> 01:17:46.972
It's coming out.

1863
01:17:46.972 --> 01:17:48.042
(They bought a candy ring.)

1864
01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:50.842
- It's Mom's ring. - It's a ring.

1865
01:17:50.842 --> 01:17:53.643
Mom will be happy.

1866
01:17:55.042 --> 01:17:58.212
It's a ring on this side and a candy on this side.

1867
01:17:58.552 --> 01:17:59.552
(It fits perfectly.)

1868
01:17:59.552 --> 01:18:00.752
Thank you.

1869
01:18:00.752 --> 01:18:03.222
- It's a huge ring. - It's a huge ring.

1870
01:18:04.493 --> 01:18:06.122
Hold on, Mom.

1871
01:18:06.122 --> 01:18:07.823
After trying it,

1872
01:18:07.823 --> 01:18:10.193
are you giving it to me to eat?

1873
01:18:10.733 --> 01:18:12.363
(He really took it right away.)

1874
01:18:12.363 --> 01:18:13.832
Can you take it a little later?

1875
01:18:14.033 --> 01:18:16.472
Mom, I'll buy you a real ring later.

1876
01:18:17.033 --> 01:18:20.103
You already have a ring. How can I buy more?

1877
01:18:20.143 --> 01:18:21.842
I have 10 fingers.

1878
01:18:22.672 --> 01:18:24.912
(There are 10?)

1879
01:18:25.042 --> 01:18:27.042
Mom, take this later.

1880
01:18:27.443 --> 01:18:28.842
Where should I take it to?

1881
01:18:28.983 --> 01:18:30.582
To the department store, of course.

1882
01:18:30.653 --> 01:18:31.653
What for?

1883
01:18:31.653 --> 01:18:33.582
What can I do with this at the department store?

1884
01:18:34.023 --> 01:18:35.483
You can eat food...

1885
01:18:36.653 --> 01:18:38.493
and buy toys too.

1886
01:18:39.762 --> 01:18:42.993
Did you think this card was a credit card?

1887
01:18:42.993 --> 01:18:46.502
If you write us cards, we'd never starve.

1888
01:18:46.502 --> 01:18:47.802
(It's a magical card.)

1889
01:18:47.802 --> 01:18:48.802
Thank you.

1890
01:18:48.802 --> 01:18:49.802
This is...

1891
01:18:50.733 --> 01:18:52.273
- something I prepared. - Mom.

1892
01:18:52.273 --> 01:18:53.903
I was wondering what this was.

1893
01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:54.943
Is that Seung Jae?

1894
01:18:56.313 --> 01:18:58.212
What do you think of when you think of Mom?

1895
01:18:58.472 --> 01:18:59.743
Mom? A princess.

1896
01:19:00.683 --> 01:19:02.313
- Am I a princess? - Why?

1897
01:19:02.953 --> 01:19:04.212
Because she's pretty.

1898
01:19:04.613 --> 01:19:05.813
Do you love Mom?

1899
01:19:05.813 --> 01:19:06.882
I love her to the sky, earth,

1900
01:19:06.882 --> 01:19:08.653
and as much as animals.

1901
01:19:09.523 --> 01:19:10.653
My goodness.

1902
01:19:11.292 --> 01:19:12.922
As much as the earth and dinosaurs.

1903
01:19:13.762 --> 01:19:15.122
I like dinosaurs.

1904
01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.292
Dinosaurs?

1905
01:19:16.563 --> 01:19:17.563
He loves you as much as dinosaurs.

1906
01:19:18.233 --> 01:19:19.363
It's the biggest compliment.

1907
01:19:20.262 --> 01:19:22.933
I like dinosaurs and Mom.

1908
01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:26.103
- Do you like her working? - Yes.

1909
01:19:26.472 --> 01:19:27.573
Really? Why?

1910
01:19:28.073 --> 01:19:30.012
- She's cool. - Does she look cool?

1911
01:19:30.712 --> 01:19:31.773
She's super cool.

1912
01:19:32.172 --> 01:19:33.582
What does she do?

1913
01:19:34.012 --> 01:19:36.412
My mom works at a hospital!

1914
01:19:36.582 --> 01:19:38.953
My mom cured three people!

1915
01:19:39.082 --> 01:19:41.323
- Did I cure three people? - How do you know that?

1916
01:19:42.082 --> 01:19:43.592
Do you have anything to say to her?

1917
01:19:43.752 --> 01:19:46.052
Mom! I love you!

1918
01:19:46.462 --> 01:19:49.762
Thank you for loving me!

1919
01:19:50.893 --> 01:19:52.233
I love Mom!

1920
01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:57.172
Thank you. When did you film this?

1921
01:19:57.172 --> 01:19:58.703
Good job, Seung Jae.

1922
01:19:59.502 --> 01:20:00.842
I love you, Mom.

1923
01:20:00.972 --> 01:20:02.743
Leaving him when he's sick,

1924
01:20:02.813 --> 01:20:06.113
or when he asks me if I'm working tomorrow...

1925
01:20:06.643 --> 01:20:08.183
before he goes to sleep.

1926
01:20:08.783 --> 01:20:11.052
I feel a little bad when I go to work.

1927
01:20:11.052 --> 01:20:12.382
(It's what working moms always worry about.)

1928
01:20:12.712 --> 01:20:16.552
I was thankful. My child understands.

1929
01:20:17.122 --> 01:20:19.252
He understands...

1930
01:20:19.592 --> 01:20:21.962
why I have to go.

1931
01:20:22.323 --> 01:20:23.393
I'm thankful.

1932
01:20:25.792 --> 01:20:29.332
(What is this noise?)

1933
01:20:29.332 --> 01:20:31.903
Jane's family wakes up to a noisy sound.

1934
01:20:32.132 --> 01:20:34.372
(Blowing raspberries)

1935
01:20:35.302 --> 01:20:39.273
(It's Jane's way of waking everyone up.)

1936
01:20:41.943 --> 01:20:44.512
(Jane found something.)

1937
01:20:46.622 --> 01:20:49.052
(It's her dad's phone.)

1938
01:20:49.323 --> 01:20:52.052
(She's copying the button sounds.)

1939
01:20:53.193 --> 01:20:56.162
(Buzzing)

1940
01:20:57.693 --> 01:20:59.533
(It's suddenly vibrating.)

1941
01:21:00.433 --> 01:21:01.433
Mom.

1942
01:21:03.573 --> 01:21:05.372
Mom! Mom!

1943
01:21:06.943 --> 01:21:08.403
Jane.

1944
01:21:10.672 --> 01:21:12.743
Honey, she woke up so early.

1945
01:21:13.643 --> 01:21:15.412
You should get up. It's 8am.

1946
01:21:16.252 --> 01:21:19.012
Jane, ask Daddy to give you breakfast.

1947
01:21:19.113 --> 01:21:20.122
Okay.

1948
01:21:20.622 --> 01:21:22.153
I love you.

1949
01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:23.953
Yes.

1950
01:21:24.222 --> 01:21:26.323
Yes, I love you.

1951
01:21:30.233 --> 01:21:31.462
Be careful.

1952
01:21:31.462 --> 01:21:32.733
(She's an expert at coming down.)

1953
01:21:32.733 --> 01:21:33.832
Good job.

1954
01:21:34.533 --> 01:21:35.832
(Let's go eat, Dad.)

1955
01:21:35.832 --> 01:21:37.233
Let's go.

1956
01:21:39.472 --> 01:21:41.203
I'll give you juice.

1957
01:21:43.372 --> 01:21:45.012
I'll open it for you.

1958
01:21:46.113 --> 01:21:47.183
(Poking)

1959
01:21:48.212 --> 01:21:49.752
(She's imitating the straw.)

1960
01:21:49.752 --> 01:21:51.052
Here, drink it.

1961
01:21:55.052 --> 01:21:57.922
(It's so sour.)

1962
01:21:57.922 --> 01:21:59.863
Is it sour? Is it sour?

1963
01:22:01.922 --> 01:22:04.662
(She's looking cute early in the morning.)

1964
01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:05.733
Is it sour?

1965
01:22:09.533 --> 01:22:11.502
(Shivering)

1966
01:22:12.002 --> 01:22:14.872
Since you like shrimp,

1967
01:22:15.403 --> 01:22:17.412
I'll make you shrimp fried rice.

1968
01:22:19.542 --> 01:22:20.743
What else do we have?

1969
01:22:21.412 --> 01:22:22.983
Do you want me to play music?

1970
01:22:25.752 --> 01:22:26.882
Here. Sit down.

1971
01:22:28.453 --> 01:22:31.023
(I don't like this music.)

1972
01:22:31.792 --> 01:22:33.363
(She's skipping the song.)

1973
01:22:35.262 --> 01:22:36.493
Did you change the song?

1974
01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:38.792
(She's starting to get into the groove.)

1975
01:22:38.792 --> 01:22:40.632
Are you dancing? Are you dancing?

1976
01:22:41.662 --> 01:22:42.733
Great.

1977
01:22:43.933 --> 01:22:45.033
Do you want to come down?

1978
01:22:46.172 --> 01:22:47.802
Do you want to come down? No?

1979
01:22:50.113 --> 01:22:51.643
Keep dancing.

1980
01:22:53.113 --> 01:22:56.012
(Shall I have some fun?)

1981
01:22:57.813 --> 01:23:01.853
(Dancing)

1982
01:23:02.582 --> 01:23:04.193
(Surprised)

1983
01:23:06.662 --> 01:23:08.823
(Slamming)

1984
01:23:09.363 --> 01:23:12.363
(You broke my mood.)

1985
01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:15.832
He's busy making breakfast for Jane.

1986
01:23:17.472 --> 01:23:19.672
He looks pretty skilled.

1987
01:23:19.672 --> 01:23:20.802
(Victor's fried rice is ready.)

1988
01:23:21.802 --> 01:23:23.113
This is shrimp.

1989
01:23:23.113 --> 01:23:25.042
(He's emphasizing that it's shrimp.)

1990
01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:26.783
Try the shrimp.

1991
01:23:26.983 --> 01:23:28.943
(Let's see how well Dad cooks.)

1992
01:23:29.512 --> 01:23:30.853
How is it? Is it yummy?

1993
01:23:31.512 --> 01:23:32.853
Is it good?

1994
01:23:33.382 --> 01:23:34.523
Good.

1995
01:23:36.353 --> 01:23:38.122
(This is hot.)

1996
01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:40.092
Great.

1997
01:23:41.122 --> 01:23:42.893
(Her appetite is bursting.)

1998
01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:44.792
Eat this too.

1999
01:23:46.033 --> 01:23:47.262
Don't be greedy.

2000
01:23:50.273 --> 01:23:51.872
Thank you.

2001
01:23:51.872 --> 01:23:52.872
(Dad, it's really good.)

2002
01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:56.172
Tell Mom that you ate well.

2003
01:23:56.712 --> 01:23:57.712
Okay!

2004
01:24:00.143 --> 01:24:02.542
Where did they go after breakfast?

2005
01:24:03.783 --> 01:24:06.122
It's a gym for rhythmic gymnastics.

2006
01:24:06.453 --> 01:24:08.552
(Rhythmic gymnastics?)

2007
01:24:08.622 --> 01:24:11.052
Wow. What is that? Let's go.

2008
01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:13.023
What is that? Let's go.

2009
01:24:13.993 --> 01:24:16.962
In Korea, people teach piano or taekwondo...

2010
01:24:17.262 --> 01:24:20.802
to their children. It's similar to that.

2011
01:24:20.802 --> 01:24:22.802
Most kids here get...

2012
01:24:22.872 --> 01:24:25.632
exposed to rhythmic gymnastics.

2013
01:24:25.903 --> 01:24:28.743
Rhythmic gymnastics is Russia's national sport.

2014
01:24:29.143 --> 01:24:31.712
Jane came to experience it.

2015
01:24:32.243 --> 01:24:34.113
(Genna, rhythmic gymnastics coach)

2016
01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:39.523
(She looks familiar.)

2017
01:24:42.523 --> 01:24:44.393
(She's good.)

2018
01:24:44.893 --> 01:24:46.323
- Say hello. - Hello.

2019
01:24:46.823 --> 01:24:47.823
Say hello.

2020
01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:50.632
(Nice to meet you.)

2021
01:24:52.292 --> 01:24:54.363
Hello, I'm Jane.

2022
01:24:56.533 --> 01:24:59.672
It's a familiar face. It's Kim Chae Woon.

2023
01:25:00.542 --> 01:25:03.472
She was chosen 1st to be on the national team.

2024
01:25:03.743 --> 01:25:06.542
She's a talented rising star and athlete.

2025
01:25:06.542 --> 01:25:08.643
(She's currently studying in Moscow.)

2026
01:25:11.012 --> 01:25:12.113
- Jane. - Jane.

2027
01:25:12.113 --> 01:25:13.353
Jane, look.

2028
01:25:13.653 --> 01:25:16.082
How do you do that? Watch her.

2029
01:25:17.422 --> 01:25:18.422
Look.

2030
01:25:21.222 --> 01:25:23.363
(Should I lie down too?)

2031
01:25:23.363 --> 01:25:24.363
Down.

2032
01:25:24.962 --> 01:25:28.233
Down. Put that down like this.

2033
01:25:29.773 --> 01:25:31.233
(Lifting)

2034
01:25:33.502 --> 01:25:37.512
(Struggling)

2035
01:25:39.012 --> 01:25:41.613
(She's giving her all.)

2036
01:25:45.783 --> 01:25:47.283
(Lifting)

2037
01:25:48.853 --> 01:25:49.953
How do they do that?

2038
01:25:50.592 --> 01:25:54.363
(She's trying so hard.)

2039
01:25:56.262 --> 01:25:58.063
(This is a difficult pose.)

2040
01:25:59.433 --> 01:26:02.632
(That's easy.)

2041
01:26:03.203 --> 01:26:05.903
(She's too ambitious.)

2042
01:26:09.273 --> 01:26:10.273
Copy her.

2043
01:26:10.972 --> 01:26:11.972
Come on.

2044
01:26:13.582 --> 01:26:16.082
Good. No, don't go down.

2045
01:26:17.353 --> 01:26:20.853
(She's throwing herself for rhythmic gymnastics.)

2046
01:26:23.592 --> 01:26:26.262
(I really tried.)

2047
01:26:26.792 --> 01:26:28.523
After warming up,

2048
01:26:28.693 --> 01:26:31.092
they're having a dance lesson for Jane.

2049
01:26:33.262 --> 01:26:36.372
(She's reacting to the children's music.)

2050
01:26:37.002 --> 01:26:40.743
(She's excited.)

2051
01:26:43.743 --> 01:26:46.483
(She's so cute.)

2052
01:26:48.342 --> 01:26:49.752
(Hey!)

2053
01:26:52.453 --> 01:26:54.252
(Dancing)

2054
01:26:55.283 --> 01:26:57.393
Great job today.

2055
01:26:57.922 --> 01:26:58.922
Milk!

2056
01:26:59.292 --> 01:27:02.863
She followed the poses very well.

2057
01:27:03.332 --> 01:27:06.302
I'll bring her back...

2058
01:27:06.563 --> 01:27:08.903
- if she like it. - Okay.

2059
01:27:09.203 --> 01:27:10.433
- Bye. - Bye.

2060
01:27:11.302 --> 01:27:13.172
Give her a heart, Jane. Give her a heart.

2061
01:27:15.342 --> 01:27:16.342
What does it mean?

2062
01:27:17.412 --> 01:27:18.542
(He's teaching her how to make a heart.)

2063
01:27:18.542 --> 01:27:20.683
Jane. Give her a heart.

2064
01:27:21.012 --> 01:27:22.012
I love you.

2065
01:27:22.342 --> 01:27:24.353
Bye, bye.

2066
01:27:26.153 --> 01:27:27.153
Bye.

2067
01:27:31.092 --> 01:27:33.622
Where are Jane and Victor going to next?

2068
01:27:34.122 --> 01:27:36.462
It represents the history and culture of Russia.

2069
01:27:36.792 --> 01:27:39.433
It's heart of Moscow, Red Square.

2070
01:27:39.433 --> 01:27:41.203
(This landmark is busy all year round.)

2071
01:27:41.233 --> 01:27:44.703
It's a place to visit if you're in Moscow.

2072
01:27:44.703 --> 01:27:45.733
(This landmark is busy all year round.)

2073
01:27:47.403 --> 01:27:50.243
Jane is wearing a beautiful hanbok.

2074
01:27:50.912 --> 01:27:53.712
Gosh, she's like a doll.

2075
01:27:54.443 --> 01:27:57.783
(She's getting all the attention.)

2076
01:27:58.912 --> 01:28:00.622
What country is that clothing from?

2077
01:28:00.622 --> 01:28:02.353
- Korea. - Korea?

2078
01:28:03.422 --> 01:28:05.922
(Why are they here?)

2079
01:28:07.622 --> 01:28:10.632
Red Square is the first place...

2080
01:28:10.962 --> 01:28:12.802
people think of when we talk about Moscow.

2081
01:28:12.962 --> 01:28:15.962
I thought she should take a picture in hanbok.

2082
01:28:16.203 --> 01:28:17.703
It would be a nice present for her.

2083
01:28:19.073 --> 01:28:22.042
(There is one person being adorable.)

2084
01:28:22.042 --> 01:28:24.113
(It's Lady Jane.)

2085
01:28:25.443 --> 01:28:26.443
Let's go.

2086
01:28:27.042 --> 01:28:28.643
(Rushing)

2087
01:28:33.323 --> 01:28:34.552
Do you want to throw a coin?

2088
01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:36.523
Do you want to try?

2089
01:28:36.953 --> 01:28:40.023
This is the middle of Moscow.

2090
01:28:40.592 --> 01:28:42.462
If you throw a coin in the middle,

2091
01:28:42.462 --> 01:28:43.933
your wish will come true.

2092
01:28:46.203 --> 01:28:47.962
- I like it! - Goodness.

2093
01:28:48.462 --> 01:28:49.903
Do you want to try it?

2094
01:28:50.433 --> 01:28:52.233
We can throw together. Throw it.

2095
01:28:53.302 --> 01:28:55.243
(Hold this, will you?)

2096
01:28:55.243 --> 01:28:56.243
Try it.

2097
01:28:57.073 --> 01:28:59.113
(Throwing)

2098
01:28:59.113 --> 01:29:00.643
(She's faking it.)

2099
01:29:00.643 --> 01:29:01.743
It's in your hand.

2100
01:29:05.052 --> 01:29:06.082
Great.

2101
01:29:06.082 --> 01:29:08.653
(Please make my wish come true.)

2102
01:29:10.292 --> 01:29:11.393
Let's go.

2103
01:29:11.653 --> 01:29:15.863
(She's catching everyone's attention.)

2104
01:29:18.433 --> 01:29:20.733
Could I take a picture with her?

2105
01:29:21.832 --> 01:29:23.073
- With my daughter? - Yes.

2106
01:29:26.073 --> 01:29:27.143
Let's take a picture.

2107
01:29:28.672 --> 01:29:31.372
Gosh, Jane is so popular.

2108
01:29:32.472 --> 01:29:34.912
Thank you. You're so cute.

2109
01:29:34.912 --> 01:29:36.042
Bye.

2110
01:29:36.113 --> 01:29:38.813
- Bye. - Bye.

2111
01:29:40.183 --> 01:29:44.393
(Jane's popularity doesn't stop.)

2112
01:29:46.863 --> 01:29:47.863
Take a picture.

2113
01:29:48.493 --> 01:29:51.162
Come here. Let's go.

2114
01:29:51.162 --> 01:29:53.703
(Moscow is a fan of Jane.)

2115
01:29:55.933 --> 01:29:59.842
Gosh. Jane is so popular today.

2116
01:30:02.573 --> 01:30:04.313
(She's in a good mood.)

2117
01:30:04.643 --> 01:30:06.743
- Where are you from? - Korea.

2118
01:30:07.813 --> 01:30:09.453
Why is she dressed like that?

2119
01:30:09.453 --> 01:30:12.882
That's our traditional clothing.

2120
01:30:13.722 --> 01:30:15.283
Hold her if she's okay.

2121
01:30:20.523 --> 01:30:22.162
(Lifting)

2122
01:30:23.292 --> 01:30:25.193
(You're strong.)

2123
01:30:27.502 --> 01:30:30.233
(Wait, he's...)

2124
01:30:30.403 --> 01:30:33.203
You can take a picture with him.

2125
01:30:33.203 --> 01:30:35.273
He's a short track skating champion.

2126
01:30:35.603 --> 01:30:36.613
Jane, come here.

2127
01:30:36.643 --> 01:30:39.483
(She recognized him a little later.)

2128
01:30:39.483 --> 01:30:42.113
I just remembered. You won gold...

2129
01:30:42.113 --> 01:30:44.783
- at Sochi. - Thank you.

2130
01:30:46.012 --> 01:30:48.823
Can she talk yet?

2131
01:30:50.453 --> 01:30:51.453
A tiny bit.

2132
01:30:51.453 --> 01:30:53.222
You have a really famous father.

2133
01:30:56.162 --> 01:30:57.993
Thank you.

2134
01:30:57.993 --> 01:30:59.533
(Thank you.)

2135
01:31:02.002 --> 01:31:04.533
Jane. Let's take a picture over there.

2136
01:31:05.703 --> 01:31:07.643
Stay there, I'll take your picture!

2137
01:31:11.743 --> 01:31:14.342
(Rushing)

2138
01:31:17.853 --> 01:31:19.922
It's not easy to get a good shot.

2139
01:31:21.222 --> 01:31:23.792
Victor decided to change locations.

2140
01:31:24.153 --> 01:31:26.092
Some call this the Tetris palace.

2141
01:31:26.092 --> 01:31:27.792
It's Saint Basil's Cathedral.

2142
01:31:28.393 --> 01:31:30.693
It looks exactly the same as the game.

2143
01:31:31.863 --> 01:31:34.002
Don't tell Mom, okay?

2144
01:31:34.563 --> 01:31:36.703
(It's ice cream.)

2145
01:31:38.302 --> 01:31:41.042
(She's having her very first ice cream.)

2146
01:31:42.672 --> 01:31:45.412
(What is this I'm tasting?)

2147
01:31:45.672 --> 01:31:46.683
Gosh.

2148
01:31:48.283 --> 01:31:51.353
(She can't stop eating it.)

2149
01:31:51.353 --> 01:31:52.353
Is it good?

2150
01:31:55.382 --> 01:31:57.853
It's good. Let's go there so we can take a picture.

2151
01:31:58.993 --> 01:32:00.292
Let's go over there.

2152
01:32:01.523 --> 01:32:04.493
Sit down here. Sit.

2153
01:32:06.433 --> 01:32:09.203
(He's putting on a headpiece on her.)

2154
01:32:09.203 --> 01:32:10.533
Look at that. What is that?

2155
01:32:10.603 --> 01:32:12.573
Can I take that?

2156
01:32:15.103 --> 01:32:17.472
(Will he succeed this time?)

2157
01:32:17.472 --> 01:32:19.212
The ice cream strategy worked.

2158
01:32:20.212 --> 01:32:22.643
It's like a photo zone.

2159
01:32:23.752 --> 01:32:25.613
Where is her dad?

2160
01:32:29.552 --> 01:32:30.653
(Ice cream allowed him to get good shots.)

2161
01:32:30.653 --> 01:32:32.722
He succeeded in getting a good shot.

2162
01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:39.193
You must be tired from going around,

2163
01:32:39.393 --> 01:32:41.632
but you didn't fuss. Thank you.

2164
01:32:42.832 --> 01:32:44.033
I love you, honey.

2165
01:32:44.033 --> 01:32:45.773
(Good job, Dad.)

2166
01:32:47.372 --> 01:32:50.573
(They're so sweet together.)

2167
01:32:52.212 --> 01:32:53.613
Let's go see Mom.

2168
01:32:53.813 --> 01:32:55.183
- Mom. - Yes.

2169
01:32:55.183 --> 01:32:56.683
(The 48 hours will be over soon.)

2170
01:32:56.683 --> 01:32:58.353
Mom is waiting for you.

2171
01:32:58.853 --> 01:33:01.683
- Mom. - Mom. Where are you?

2172
01:33:01.683 --> 01:33:02.993
Mom.

2173
01:33:03.052 --> 01:33:04.622
Where is she?

2174
01:33:05.052 --> 01:33:06.962
- Mom. - Yes.

2175
01:33:10.693 --> 01:33:11.792
Mom!

2176
01:33:14.132 --> 01:33:16.002
(She's looking around.)

2177
01:33:18.403 --> 01:33:20.703
(Her skirt is flying in the air.)

2178
01:33:20.703 --> 01:33:22.243
Let's go find Mom.

2179
01:33:22.243 --> 01:33:24.443
(They're on a search.)

2180
01:33:24.443 --> 01:33:25.512
Where could she be?

2181
01:33:26.683 --> 01:33:28.743
(Where is Mom?)

2182
01:33:28.743 --> 01:33:29.912
Mom.

2183
01:33:32.382 --> 01:33:35.023
(Is that Mom?)

2184
01:33:35.323 --> 01:33:36.953
(No!)

2185
01:33:38.292 --> 01:33:40.122
(This is not her either.)

2186
01:33:40.122 --> 01:33:41.563
(That's not Mom.)

2187
01:33:42.363 --> 01:33:44.563
(What about this person?)

2188
01:33:44.832 --> 01:33:46.403
Mom. Over there.

2189
01:33:47.132 --> 01:33:50.372
Over there. It's Mom. Go to Mom. Hurry.

2190
01:33:51.433 --> 01:33:54.603
It's 30 seconds to finding her mom.

2191
01:33:55.342 --> 01:33:57.943
It was their first time being apart.

2192
01:33:58.542 --> 01:34:02.953
Both Jane and her mom missed each other.

2193
01:34:05.683 --> 01:34:06.722
There you are.

2194
01:34:06.722 --> 01:34:10.292
(They're meeting again after 48 hours.)

2195
01:34:13.563 --> 01:34:15.023
Did you miss me?

2196
01:34:18.132 --> 01:34:21.802
(The 2 days felt like 2 years.)

2197
01:34:22.302 --> 01:34:23.372
Who is that?

2198
01:34:24.073 --> 01:34:25.203
Who is that?

2199
01:34:25.372 --> 01:34:26.943
It's Mom.

2200
01:34:27.103 --> 01:34:28.472
It's Mom.

2201
01:34:29.273 --> 01:34:31.842
I missed you, Jane.

2202
01:34:32.212 --> 01:34:33.912
I was getting a portrait drawn.

2203
01:34:33.912 --> 01:34:36.153
(Jane is stuck on her mom.)

2204
01:34:38.613 --> 01:34:40.023
Did you get some rest?

2205
01:34:41.052 --> 01:34:42.582
Why do you look so skinny?

2206
01:34:42.582 --> 01:34:44.153
Me? Really?

2207
01:34:44.353 --> 01:34:46.262
It must have been difficult. You're skinny.

2208
01:34:46.262 --> 01:34:48.762
- I didn't lose weight... - Was it that hard?

2209
01:34:52.332 --> 01:34:54.063
Mom. Mom.

2210
01:34:54.802 --> 01:34:56.132
After getting off my flight,

2211
01:34:56.132 --> 01:34:58.033
it was as if...

2212
01:34:58.033 --> 01:35:01.542
I was seeing him. My heart was racing.

2213
01:35:01.903 --> 01:35:03.143
It was just for two days.

2214
01:35:05.012 --> 01:35:07.012
Jane, do you know where we are?

2215
01:35:07.743 --> 01:35:09.243
Where are we?

2216
01:35:09.613 --> 01:35:11.512
This is where the picture is.

2217
01:35:11.512 --> 01:35:16.023
(A mural dedicated to musician Viktor Tsoi)

2218
01:35:19.292 --> 01:35:20.523
Who is that?

2219
01:35:23.132 --> 01:35:24.693
My name is Victor too.

2220
01:35:24.832 --> 01:35:26.762
This man's name is Victor too.

2221
01:35:26.863 --> 01:35:28.033
It's the same.

2222
01:35:28.262 --> 01:35:29.363
He's Viktor Tsoi.

2223
01:35:31.033 --> 01:35:33.802
He was a famous singer in Russia.

2224
01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:36.743
When I was choosing my name,

2225
01:35:36.943 --> 01:35:39.813
he was an influence too.

2226
01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:41.813
Victor also means winner.

2227
01:35:42.643 --> 01:35:44.953
- We want your dad to win. - That's the meaning too.

2228
01:35:44.953 --> 01:35:46.453
It's the same.

2229
01:35:47.153 --> 01:35:49.283
- Yes? - It's the same.

2230
01:35:49.353 --> 01:35:50.552
Is it?

2231
01:35:50.853 --> 01:35:53.122
How was it staying alone with Dad?

2232
01:35:53.122 --> 01:35:54.162
Were you happy?

2233
01:35:55.393 --> 01:35:57.662
You were?

2234
01:35:57.662 --> 01:36:00.002
- It was hard, right? - But it was fun.

2235
01:36:00.233 --> 01:36:01.233
- Really? - Yes.

2236
01:36:02.002 --> 01:36:06.302
Then you can do it for a week next time.

2237
01:36:06.342 --> 01:36:07.903
I like it!

2238
01:36:07.903 --> 01:36:09.613
(I'd like that!)

2239
01:36:10.512 --> 01:36:12.813
Give Daddy a kiss for a job well done.

2240
01:36:13.243 --> 01:36:15.712
Dad. Gosh. What about me?

2241
01:36:15.943 --> 01:36:17.382
- Gosh. Dad. - Mom and Dad.

2242
01:36:19.212 --> 01:36:20.382
Good job.

2243
01:36:20.983 --> 01:36:22.582
Gosh.

2244
01:36:23.493 --> 01:36:26.493
I'm not sure how much longer...

2245
01:36:26.493 --> 01:36:29.832
she'll live as an athlete's wife,

2246
01:36:29.832 --> 01:36:32.662
but I hope we can cheer up and do well.

2247
01:36:32.962 --> 01:36:34.233
I hope Jane will...

2248
01:36:34.233 --> 01:36:37.502
grow bright. Let's do our best.

2249
01:36:37.903 --> 01:36:39.542
Thank you and I love you.

2250
01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:41.573
(Thank you and I love you.)
