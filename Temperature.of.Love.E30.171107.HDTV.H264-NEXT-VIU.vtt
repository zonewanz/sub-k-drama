1
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.410
Gosh, I'm bored.

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.950
I can't have a conversation with these guys.

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.949
What's wrong with Won Joon? He's making me mad.

4
00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:17.859
Why doesn't he call me?

5
00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.659
What's a fricassee?

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.670
Sauteed and braised meat is called a fricassee.

7
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.970
(Hong Ah)

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.010
Hi, Hong Ah.

9
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.150
What are you doing?

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.709
Are you cooking?

11
00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.620
Isn't today your day off?

12
00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:47.650
Yes, but I'm here to eat with Soo Jung.

13
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.860
I have to go, Hong Ah.

14
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.400
You didn't even ask me why I called.

15
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.400
Why did you call me? What's up?

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.509
I'll tell you in person.

17
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.709
- Is it good? - Yes.

18
00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.890
This wine goes well with it.

19
00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:26.390
It's my expertise.

20
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.530
Who could that be?

21
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.830
I'll go.

22
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.709
- Hi, Won Joon. - Hong Ah.

23
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.950
Hi, Soo Jung.

24
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.319
Hi.

25
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.759
I came here because I was bored.

26
00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.360
I called Won Joon, and he said he was having lunch.

27
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.899
Am I bothering you?

28
00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.399
You can join us. I'll bring you a fork.

29
00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.439
Soo Jung.

30
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.140
It's okay.

31
00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.839
Unless we take care of Hong Ah,

32
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.980
we can't date.

33
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.080
Soo Jung, am I something to be taken care of?

34
00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:22.380
Hong Ah.

35
00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:24.350
This isn't right.

36
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.950
What isn't?

37
00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.950
I told you I came here to eat with her.

38
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.420
So this is Soo Jung and my time. You barged in on us.

39
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.899
Did you bring your car?

40
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.600
- Yes. - I'll walk you to your car.

41
00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.869
(Closed)

42
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.540
At least you walked me out today.

43
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.649
Drive home safe.

44
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.850
Are you really the same Won Joon I know?

45
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.880
How can love change?

46
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.890
Love might change, but old habits die hard.

47
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.860
What's the use of rebelling like this?

48
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.989
I know you ask for me when you're bored.

49
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.230
But this time it's different.

50
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.230
I think you're jealous.

51
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.300
As you know, I have strong...

52
00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.439
emotional ups and downs.

53
00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.410
I liked Jung Sun for four years.

54
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.709
That's because I felt competitive with Hyun Soo.

55
00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.850
I liked him more because I couldn't have him.

56
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.850
You're being competitive again.

57
00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.050
Because Soo Jung likes me.

58
00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.820
You quickly forgot about Jung Sun, the one you liked habitually.

59
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.589
- You'll forget me too. - But you're different than me.

60
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.089
Why are you trying to be like me?

61
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.630
Do you want to be someone like me?

62
00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.130
Don't live like that.

63
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.450
Hi.

64
00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:08.790
This one here is a fighter.

65
00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.459
What a beautiful flower.

66
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.959
Every year around this time,

67
00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.429
it says hello and asks me, "Are you doing well like me?"

68
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.730
And then this is what I say.

69
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.770
"Yes."

70
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.800
"I'm alive and well."

71
00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.739
You should try to do the same.

72
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.239
Then you'll find out.

73
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.679
You'll find out if it was real or fake.

74
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.629
Aren't you going home?

75
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.629
I'll sleep here tonight.

76
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.999
What is...

77
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.670
the surgery called exactly?

78
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.009
Do they have to open up her head?

79
00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:06.239
Yes.

80
00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.449
They'll cut out the aneurysm and reconnect the ends.

81
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.660
I want her to get surgery soon.

82
00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:21.059
Why do we have to wait three months for her surgery?

83
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.530
We want the best surgeon because it's a difficult surgery.

84
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.160
What if...

85
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.139
it bursts while we wait.

86
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.309
Dad.

87
00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.040
We can't just sit and wait.

88
00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:05.939
I'll look into it.

89
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.379
There's a surgeon I interviewed before.

90
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.150
You do? That's great.

91
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.210
Thank you, Hyun Soo.

92
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.579
Don't thank me yet.

93
00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.980
(Jung Sun)

94
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.389
Dad, excuse me for a minute.

95
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.420
Hi, Jung Sun.

96
00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.090
Is your mom okay?

97
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.129
She's not okay.

98
00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:33.429
Is it really bad?

99
00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.199
I'll tell you later. I'm with my dad right now.

100
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.400
Okay. Please tell me later.

101
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.369
Okay.

102
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.809
Good night.

103
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.179
Good night.

104
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.119
Yes, thank you.

105
00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:01.129
Dad, I'll do it.

106
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.829
It's okay. I got it.

107
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.869
What did they say? Can they schedule her surgery?

108
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.369
He's not in Korea right now.

109
00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:13.670
He's in the States for training.

110
00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:17.340
What now?

111
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.280
My life revolves around your mom,

112
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.910
so I have no connections.

113
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.449
It feels weird to be home during the day...

114
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.249
on a sick leave.

115
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.720
Have some breakfast.

116
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.530
What's wrong?

117
00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:43.900
Shouldn't you eat rice if you need to take your medication?

118
00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:46.910
I always eat bread for breakfast. I don't want rice.

119
00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:48.569
Shouldn't you go?

120
00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:49.809
I'll stay a bit longer.

121
00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:52.280
You should go and work.

122
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.509
Being here won't solve the problem.

123
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.619
Mom.

124
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.550
Why are you so calm?

125
00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:02.150
What should I do...

126
00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:06.360
about your dad?

127
00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:12.230
Our plans completely fell through.

128
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.679
Michelin inspectors showed up...

129
00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:32.050
in other restaurants.

130
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.459
I sent the bass and vegetables back because they weren't fresh.

131
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.160
I'll go buy them. Please be in charge of the kitchen.

132
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:46.359
Okay.

133
00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:56.740
Would you like some wine or drinks?

134
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.349
Yes. Show me your wine menu, and give me sparking water.

135
00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.290
What do you think?

136
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.870
Get another one.

137
00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:28.109
Here's a new one.

138
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.510
Thank you.

139
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.770
I think table 10 is from Michelin.

140
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.439
No. They don't usually make it obvious.

141
00:09:57.439 --> 00:09:58.800
This time it's for real.

142
00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:01.140
He dropped his knife.

143
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.540
He also asked for the wine menu and sparkling water.

144
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:06.339
There's a rumor that Michelin inspectors do that.

145
00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.380
Really?

146
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.380
I heard that too.

147
00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:11.179
Anyway, it doesn't hurt to try.

148
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.270
Thanks for coming out to see me.

149
00:10:28.969 --> 00:10:32.740
No problem. I had to come out for a casting meeting anyway.

150
00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:35.339
I asked my dad,

151
00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:38.280
and it seems he's close with the director of Gookil Hospital.

152
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.479
Do you want to transfer your mom there?

153
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.020
I'll have to discuss that with my dad.

154
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.990
Talk to Mr. Park.

155
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.719
How can I?

156
00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:52.120
Why not?

157
00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:54.589
Are you just going to sit and wait for three months?

158
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.429
Doesn't Won Joon come from a family of doctors?

159
00:10:57.429 --> 00:10:59.130
Do you think every doctor has good connections?

160
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.599
You really don't know anything.

161
00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:05.069
Is it because of Jung Sun that you can't talk to Mr. Park?

162
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.510
No.

163
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.939
I feel bad about asking personal favors.

164
00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:13.280
Don't feel bad.

165
00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:15.849
It's something difficult for you to do,

166
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:18.650
but for Mr. Park, it's really easy.

167
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:20.349
Snap out of it, Hyun Soo.

168
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.189
I really don't understand.

169
00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:24.459
Why are you dating Jung Sun,

170
00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:26.020
when you have Mr. Park?

171
00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:32.959
Here's your drink.

172
00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:52.250
Are we done here?

173
00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:54.520
Would you like me to bring out the next course?

174
00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:57.120
Yes, please.

175
00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:06.870
What's the next course?

176
00:12:12.469 --> 00:12:13.609
They barely ate it.

177
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.890
You heat it up too quickly.

178
00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:32.620
Tell them we'll make it again for them.

179
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.089
He asked for the next course.

180
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.000
Didn't you say he seemed like he was from Michelin?

181
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.699
You made a mistake by trying too hard.

182
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.740
Michelin judges your usual skills.

183
00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:51.479
How did you like your meal?

184
00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.750
Thank you.

185
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.160
Were they really from Michelin?

186
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.630
I'm not sure.

187
00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:09.729
There's 50 percent chance.

188
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.400
50 percent is a high probability.

189
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:17.370
It means there's 50 percent chance that they weren't.

190
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.339
Let's get to work.

191
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.870
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

192
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.620
Mr. Park, I'm here.

193
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.359
How is it going?

194
00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:44.030
I still haven't heard back yet.

195
00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.900
You're coming here every day.

196
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.270
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

197
00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:51.939
I met with Hyun Soo on the way here.

198
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.880
Why are you quiet all of a sudden?

199
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.910
Because I have nothing to say.

200
00:14:00.579 --> 00:14:02.250
Her mom is sick.

201
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.650
She needs surgery as soon as possible,

202
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.849
but she has to wait.

203
00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:08.189
Hyun Soo asked me,

204
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:10.819
but my family has no connections with Seowoo Hospital.

205
00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:14.990
I'm here.

206
00:14:16.059 --> 00:14:17.260
Long time no see, Ms. Ji.

207
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.500
How much did you write?

208
00:14:21.729 --> 00:14:23.130
I finished five episodes.

209
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.069
Then send them to me right away.

210
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.170
Goodness.

211
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.510
Mr. Park. Doesn't she annoy you?

212
00:14:29.609 --> 00:14:32.140
Mr. Park. Doesn't he bore you?

213
00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:34.949
You two make me happy.

214
00:15:03.973 --> 00:15:07.205
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E30 Temperature of Love "I Think You're Jealous"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

215
00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:39.979
- Chef. - Ms. Hwangbo.

216
00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:43.920
Eat this. Is Hyun Soo inside?

217
00:15:45.349 --> 00:15:48.020
She went out to see a friend.

218
00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:50.689
She's looking to see if she can get help for her mom.

219
00:15:57.459 --> 00:15:59.199
There are a lot of people on the waitlist...

220
00:15:59.729 --> 00:16:00.929
for the surgery your mother needs.

221
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.359
Goodness.

222
00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:45.740
Does it taste bad?

223
00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:48.579
No.

224
00:16:49.479 --> 00:16:50.620
I don't have an appetite.

225
00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:52.819
Thank you, but I'll have it later.

226
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.089
Why didn't you tell me?

227
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.829
I didn't know your mother needed a surgery.

228
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.430
You have a lot on your plate. I didn't want to burden you.

229
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.169
You're upsetting me.

230
00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.210
You don't tell me a lot of things too.

231
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040
Do you want tea?

232
00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:20.710
Yes, please.

233
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.550
I wish Mom could get her surgery soon.

234
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.460
I don't know anyone at Seowoo Hospital.

235
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.470
Welcome, Mr. Park.

236
00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:43.639
You're finally letting me see you since you have business.

237
00:17:43.639 --> 00:17:44.669
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:46.540
Don't be.

239
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.169
I looked into what you asked me.

240
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.139
Is there anyone that could operate on her soon?

241
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.680
I happen to know a doctor that just came back...

242
00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:56.980
from a sabbatical in the States.

243
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.349
She's very lucky.

244
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.669
I wish Mom could get her surgery soon.

245
00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:19.000
I don't know anyone at Seowoo Hospital.

246
00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:45.599
Take this to your mother.

247
00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:49.300
Onions are supposed to be good for brain aneurysms. Onion soup.

248
00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:54.809
Thank you. Do you want to come in?

249
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.409
No, I have to meet someone.

250
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.559
(Medi On Plus)

251
00:19:47.629 --> 00:19:48.659
What brings you here?

252
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.300
I have a favor to ask you.

253
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:54.669
What is it?

254
00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:57.839
Do you know any neurosurgeons at Seowoo Hospital?

255
00:19:58.369 --> 00:20:00.109
Of course I know some.

256
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.109
My university friends became professors. Why?

257
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:04.909
Is someone sick?

258
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:08.780
I was hoping to help my girlfriend's mother with an earlier surgery date.

259
00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:12.579
Your girlfriend?

260
00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:17.990
Are you going to marry her?

261
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.730
You're too young to get married.

262
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.500
I didn't say I was going to marry now.

263
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.069
I'm asking you if you can help arrange it.

264
00:20:27.069 --> 00:20:30.500
Why bother helping if you're not going to marry her? It's useless.

265
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:31.669
Father.

266
00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:43.680
(Neurology)

267
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.050
(Neurosurgery)

268
00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:55.990
Thank you, Mr. Park.

269
00:20:56.859 --> 00:20:57.899
Thank you.

270
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.300
The general wards are full,

271
00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:02.669
so I prepared a room you can admit to right away.

272
00:21:03.569 --> 00:21:04.569
(Get well soon. From, Park Jung Woo.)

273
00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:06.270
You have to fast starting tonight.

274
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:09.440
We'll start your surgery at 10am tomorrow.

275
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.280
- Thank you. - No problem.

276
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.050
How is it?

277
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.290
It's great.

278
00:21:21.889 --> 00:21:23.720
Let me know if you need anything.

279
00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.730
We're indebted to you.

280
00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.859
I'm enjoying your citron tea.

281
00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:31.000
I won't catch a cold thanks to you.

282
00:21:31.629 --> 00:21:32.930
Make me some more later.

283
00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:35.700
I can make as much as you want.

284
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.109
- Why is she in the VIP room? - Exactly my point.

285
00:21:47.649 --> 00:21:49.010
Are you here?

286
00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:54.389
I'll get going now.

287
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.559
So soon?

288
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.059
Who are you?

289
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.089
The CEO at Hyun Soo's work.

290
00:22:02.129 --> 00:22:04.859
I'm Lee Hyun Yi. I'm her sister.

291
00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:07.629
Rest well.

292
00:22:07.629 --> 00:22:08.669
- Thank you. - Thank you.

293
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.770
One second.

294
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.280
Mr. Park.

295
00:22:20.579 --> 00:22:21.649
Long time no see.

296
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.619
Thank you.

297
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.750
Sure.

298
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.619
My parents are important to me. Thank you.

299
00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:30.960
Stop thanking me.

300
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.230
I'll move rooms, though.

301
00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:37.800
If you're uncomfortable, go ahead.

302
00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:41.399
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:46.470
Why do you only say...

304
00:22:46.639 --> 00:22:48.510
"Sorry" or "Thank you" to me?

305
00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:50.109
That's true.

306
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.010
There's no surgery that's easy. Take good care of her.

307
00:22:55.109 --> 00:22:56.149
Bye.

308
00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:12.700
Did he go?

309
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.069
Watch how you address him.

310
00:23:15.069 --> 00:23:16.940
He doesn't look that old anyway.

311
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.599
Dad,

312
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.109
we should switch rooms.

313
00:23:22.369 --> 00:23:24.540
Mr. Park will be upset.

314
00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:28.950
It wouldn't be nice to reject his kindness.

315
00:23:29.349 --> 00:23:32.849
I don't deserve this much from Mr. Park.

316
00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:35.919
We can...

317
00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:38.460
pay for the room ourselves.

318
00:23:39.829 --> 00:23:42.530
It'll be really expensive. Do you have money?

319
00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:45.930
I do.

320
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.270
How can you talk about money at this time?

321
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.639
I'm sorry.

322
00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:55.240
I have the money we saved for the cruise.

323
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.440
When we retire,

324
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.280
we can use the money we get for retirement.

325
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.190
I'm going to give your mom...

326
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.260
the best service she can get.

327
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.990
Honey.

328
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.030
Without her,

329
00:24:20.069 --> 00:24:21.569
I'll die too.

330
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.849
Is this for Hyun Soo's family?

331
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.760
You're so devoted.

332
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:47.589
This is the least I can do.

333
00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:50.359
This is the best someone can do.

334
00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:57.669
Hyun Soo.

335
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.069
Hey.

336
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.309
Here.

337
00:25:10.879 --> 00:25:12.680
Is she in a VIP room?

338
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.589
It's going to cost a fortune.

339
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.659
Hello.

340
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:19.389
Hello.

341
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.859
Are you here?

342
00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:22.859
She's sleeping right now.

343
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.960
Jung Sun brought onion soup for Mom.

344
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.099
She enjoyed it earlier. Thank you.

345
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.409
Thank you for coming.

346
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.040
Of course I should come.

347
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.250
You should have told me if she got scheduled for surgery.

348
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.050
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.220
What time is the surgery?

350
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720
10am.

351
00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:52.119
Okay. Go in, and rest.

352
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.829
Let's go.

353
00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:30.659
Come in.

354
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.530
Mr. Park.

355
00:26:42.139 --> 00:26:43.210
I'm here.

356
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.010
- Hello. - Are you here?

357
00:26:47.379 --> 00:26:48.450
Welcome.

358
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.720
Is it all right if I come?

359
00:26:51.379 --> 00:26:53.419
Don't say such a thing.

360
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.760
I agree. We like you, Mr. Park.

361
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.639
I woke up early...

362
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.540
to make lunch boxes for five people...

363
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.680
to eat together.

364
00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:24.319
But today,

365
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.050
we won't be able to eat together.
