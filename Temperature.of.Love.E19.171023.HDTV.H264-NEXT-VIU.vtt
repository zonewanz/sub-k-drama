(Episode 19)

2
00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:10.835
I want to kiss you.

3
00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:14.775
You can dodge me if you don't want to.

4
00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:24.545
Come on!

5
00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:27.486
Did you think I wouldn't dodge you? You can't laugh after crying.

6
00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.056
You're so mean.

7
00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:32.225
We can start kissing now.

8
00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:35.156
Then I won't let you just do it.

9
00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:37.826
Fine. You can choose.

10
00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:41.836
The teenage version, the 20s version, or the 30s version?

11
00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.465
I'll take all, and add a refrigerator kiss on top.

12
00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:11.925
(Lee Hyun Soo)

13
00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:24.335
The person you have called can't come to the phone...

14
00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:04.476
Love is so interesting.

15
00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:09.846
Remember when I met your mother?

16
00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:13.085
I was curious of how it went, but I didn't ask.

17
00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.256
Why?

18
00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.326
I thought I might make you feel uncomfortable.

19
00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.596
You're bad at lying.

20
00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:31.205
My mom's a very difficult person.

21
00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:36.705
She has a very complicated family history.

22
00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:41.576
If I had met her before I fell in love with you,

23
00:03:42.816 --> 00:03:44.145
I would've run away.

24
00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:46.986
But?

25
00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:49.486
But now that I've met her after having fallen for you,

26
00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:52.386
it made me love you even more.

27
00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:56.995
I felt sympathetic.

28
00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:03.435
Do you dislike the fact that I feel sympathy?

29
00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:07.236
No, I like it.

30
00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:10.546
It's love plus sympathy.

31
00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:14.516
It's something that's been added to love.

32
00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:28.796
I love you.

33
00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:32.995
I'm in love with you.

34
00:04:35.396 --> 00:04:36.666
I know.

35
00:04:57.086 --> 00:04:58.086
You can pick it up.

36
00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:01.755
No. I'm not going to let anyone bother this moment.

37
00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:19.245
I can go by myself.

38
00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:26.546
What time are you going to come tomorrow?

39
00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:30.156
I'll be here in the morning with Kyung.

40
00:05:30.456 --> 00:05:32.156
Be careful not to catch a cold.

41
00:05:32.956 --> 00:05:35.656
You're nagging me again. You're such a nagger.

42
00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:36.796
You'll fall.

43
00:05:36.796 --> 00:05:38.666
I'm not going to fall. Oh, my gosh.

44
00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:41.995
What did I tell you?

45
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:44.906
Are you okay?

46
00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:46.236
I'm okay.

47
00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:49.836
Do you want me to hold your hand?

48
00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:20.065
(Temperature of Love)

49
00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:27.175
Hyun Soo, should I get off?

50
00:06:27.175 --> 00:06:29.476
- No, I can do it. - It'd be faster to just run.

51
00:06:29.476 --> 00:06:30.546
We're almost here.

52
00:06:30.546 --> 00:06:31.716
Hyun Soo, let me get off.

53
00:06:33.315 --> 00:06:34.586
My gosh.

54
00:06:34.656 --> 00:06:36.916
I didn't know this when I was riding in the back,

55
00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:38.425
but it's hard to ride this thing.

56
00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:40.825
It wasn't easy riding in the back.

57
00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:42.226
My bottom hurts.

58
00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:45.195
Yes, it was the same for me. It wasn't that comfortable.

59
00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:47.026
It'd be better to ride a tandem bicycle.

60
00:06:47.026 --> 00:06:49.466
This is a bad idea. It's uncomfortable for both people.

61
00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:52.065
But back then, I didn't really think it was that uncomfortable.

62
00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:55.075
When was that?

63
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:57.575
You don't need to know.

64
00:06:58.476 --> 00:07:00.476
You can take your time. I'll go inside first.

65
00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:04.216
Okay. By the way, did you choose who you're going to interview first?

66
00:07:04.346 --> 00:07:05.916
Yes. It's Ms. Lim Soo Jung, the sommelier.

67
00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:07.416
- See you. - Okay.

68
00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:11.885
I'm going to interview the youngest chef in the kitchen.

69
00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:13.755
The youngest chef!

70
00:07:16.495 --> 00:07:18.466
When I first started doing this job,

71
00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:20.596
I made very little money.

72
00:07:20.966 --> 00:07:22.195
Was the pay very low?

73
00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:25.536
No. I spent most of my earnings on drinking wine.

74
00:07:26.206 --> 00:07:28.536
Aren't there a lot of customers who don't finish their wine?

75
00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:30.206
Yes, there are.

76
00:07:30.505 --> 00:07:32.945
I guess it could feel unhygienic to drink what others leave behind.

77
00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:35.546
I have a strong stomach.

78
00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:38.986
I drank whatever was left and wrote notes of what I thought of them.

79
00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:41.315
That helped me gain a lot of knowledge.

80
00:07:41.956 --> 00:07:43.055
You're incredible.

81
00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:45.456
It's not incredible.

82
00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:48.255
It's what everyone does to achieve their dream.

83
00:07:48.956 --> 00:07:50.726
Then what was the hardest thing for you?

84
00:07:50.726 --> 00:07:52.365
The hardest thing?

85
00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.865
The fact that I couldn't eat Korean food whenever I wanted to.

86
00:07:56.065 --> 00:07:59.666
My foreign friends, whom I lived with, didn't like the smell of...

87
00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:01.906
garlic, kimchi, and doenjang.

88
00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:04.005
I even made...

89
00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:10.445
kimchi stew in the middle of the night and ate it under the covers.

90
00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:17.325
My gosh, he's so talkative.

91
00:08:17.486 --> 00:08:18.925
I should just listen to the recording.

92
00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:22.026
Do you know how hard it is to peel 1,000 shrimps?

93
00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:24.195
But your hands look so soft.

94
00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:26.365
That's because I take care of them.

95
00:08:27.296 --> 00:08:30.236
Back when I used to work at a buffet, I applied ointment...

96
00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:32.505
and wore gloves to sleep every night because I had eczema.

97
00:08:32.665 --> 00:08:35.405
Why are you working at a fine dining restaurant now?

98
00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:36.736
It's quite different from what you used to do.

99
00:08:37.035 --> 00:08:39.606
I figured it would be helpful for when I open up my own restaurant.

100
00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:42.545
I personally think any menu is fine as long as it tastes good.

101
00:08:43.846 --> 00:08:46.785
Who do you like best among all of your current colleagues?

102
00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:48.056
I like everyone...

103
00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:50.926
except for Ha Sung.

104
00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:53.426
He kind of looks down on me.

105
00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:58.125
He's enemies with Ha Sung.

106
00:09:02.535 --> 00:09:03.566
What are you doing?

107
00:09:03.865 --> 00:09:05.535
I'm thinking about developing a new menu.

108
00:09:06.466 --> 00:09:07.836
Did you finish your interview?

109
00:09:08.176 --> 00:09:09.775
We still have to interview Min Ho.

110
00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:13.346
It seemed like he'd have a lot to say, so we saved him for last.

111
00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:14.846
In every organization,

112
00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.846
the newest employees always have the most to say.

113
00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:18.385
They're the most helpful when it comes to writing a drama script.

114
00:09:24.025 --> 00:09:25.686
(Mr. Park)

115
00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:27.995
Hey, Mr. Park.

116
00:09:28.726 --> 00:09:29.726
What are you doing?

117
00:09:30.295 --> 00:09:31.295
I'm doing interviews.

118
00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:33.995
I need to see you. I have something to tell you.

119
00:09:34.535 --> 00:09:36.936
Okay. Where should I meet you?

120
00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:38.836
Thank you.

121
00:09:44.706 --> 00:09:45.706
Thank you.

122
00:09:59.426 --> 00:10:01.495
I'm surprised that you asked me to meet you at a place like this.

123
00:10:01.995 --> 00:10:03.556
You normally like to go to fancy places.

124
00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:06.765
You really don't know much about me.

125
00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:09.035
I like places like this too.

126
00:10:10.905 --> 00:10:11.905
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:13.875
What is it that you need to tell me?

128
00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:19.206
I should just get straight to the point.

129
00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:25.515
You know the famous celebrity, Yoo Hye Jung, right?

130
00:10:25.716 --> 00:10:27.316
Of course, I do. I'm a fan of hers.

131
00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:31.155
I sent her the synopsis and the script.

132
00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:41.066
She won't star in my drama because I'm a nobody.

133
00:10:41.736 --> 00:10:42.995
She wants to see you in person.

134
00:10:42.995 --> 00:10:44.566
- Really? - Really.

135
00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:47.635
She can't star in due to her schedule,

136
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.946
but she likes the story so much that she wants to see you.

137
00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:55.115
- You don't have to. - I want to.

138
00:10:56.915 --> 00:10:58.115
Thank you so much.

139
00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:05.686
Let's go out for a walk.

140
00:11:09.226 --> 00:11:11.826
Do you know Hye Jung personally?

141
00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:13.936
Or was it your first time meeting her?

142
00:11:15.236 --> 00:11:16.696
I met her a few times before.

143
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.236
She appeared in one of our movies.

144
00:11:18.236 --> 00:11:19.836
I see. Isn't she so pretty?

145
00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:23.035
Do you like her that much? I mean, she won't star in your drama.

146
00:11:23.606 --> 00:11:26.645
But she likes my story. I'll aim for another chance.

147
00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:33.716
We need to change our relationship like we met for the first time.

148
00:11:36.755 --> 00:11:38.255
From now on, you must come to see me whenever I need you.

149
00:11:38.986 --> 00:11:40.385
No excuse is allowed.

150
00:11:42.255 --> 00:11:43.255
All right.

151
00:11:44.025 --> 00:11:45.826
I don't think I'll have excuses...

152
00:11:45.826 --> 00:11:47.336
because I work at home most of the time.

153
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.592

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

154
00:12:19.165 --> 00:12:20.196
What are you doing?

155
00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:22.365
You came at a perfect timing.

156
00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:24.306
What?

157
00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:27.066
I developed this for our new menu.

158
00:12:27.405 --> 00:12:28.736
Try it.

159
00:12:40.816 --> 00:12:42.356
It tastes like something's missing.

160
00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:44.285
What could it be?

161
00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:47.196
What brings you here? You aren't in the list of our lunch reservations.

162
00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:49.895
I met someone around here and stopped by.

163
00:12:50.495 --> 00:12:51.566
I want to know...

164
00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:53.936
more about you these days.

165
00:12:54.936 --> 00:12:56.395
Don't like me too much.

166
00:12:56.836 --> 00:12:58.265
I have a girlfriend now.

167
00:12:59.606 --> 00:13:02.375
I told you this when I met you in Paris.

168
00:13:02.676 --> 00:13:04.745
That I was dumped by a girl before I came to Paris.

169
00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:06.576
I met her again.

170
00:13:07.816 --> 00:13:09.576
Didn't you say she was engaged?

171
00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:12.186
There was a misunderstanding. I was told the wrong information.

172
00:13:13.216 --> 00:13:16.515
I'd like to introduce her to you. You'll be surprised.

173
00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:20.285
All right.

174
00:13:20.556 --> 00:13:24.125
Then tell her to join this weekend when I'll propose to my girl.

175
00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:25.326
Let's meet together.

176
00:13:25.865 --> 00:13:27.736
That'll be perfect.

177
00:13:28.135 --> 00:13:29.165
Great.

178
00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:32.405
I should try adding some popping sugar to it.

179
00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:42.846
Hello, this is Good Soup.

180
00:13:44.216 --> 00:13:45.785
When will you make a reservation?

181
00:13:46.086 --> 00:13:48.586
Is it true that one of your customers almost died...

182
00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:50.415
due to the allergic reaction?

183
00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:54.655
It's been settled well. We won't let it happen again.

184
00:13:55.926 --> 00:13:56.995
So it's true.

185
00:13:57.495 --> 00:13:58.895
I won't go there ever again.

186
00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:02.966
Is it because of the allergy incident?

187
00:14:03.466 --> 00:14:05.206
I think someone posted it on the Internet.

188
00:14:05.736 --> 00:14:07.476
(Is this the place you talked about?)

189
00:14:07.476 --> 00:14:09.236
The full story of the allergy incident in Good Soup.

190
00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:11.505
It serves the worst food for its price.

191
00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.076
My comments after visiting Good Soup.

192
00:14:13.706 --> 00:14:15.645
I went there...

193
00:14:15.645 --> 00:14:17.216
- and it was too expensive. - It's too expensive.

194
00:14:17.216 --> 00:14:19.846
I expected a lot since it came out on TV, but it wasn't that great.

195
00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:21.316
Click on that one.

196
00:14:22.186 --> 00:14:23.926
(The full story of the allergy accident in Good Soup)

197
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:26.856
"I knew it'd be fake."

198
00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:29.525
"Their service was so poor compared to its expensive price."

199
00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:32.795
I heard they didn't check on their customer's allergy...

200
00:14:32.795 --> 00:14:34.696
and almost killed the customer.

201
00:14:35.236 --> 00:14:38.765
"The chef was so young, and he only showed off his looks."

202
00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:43.875
I guess we won't have as many reservations for the time being.

203
00:14:44.275 --> 00:14:45.676
It's not the problem.

204
00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:48.676
We might go back to how things were before the broadcast.

205
00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:49.915
It's okay.

206
00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:53.015
Many customers have visited our restaurant so far,

207
00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:54.316
so I'm sure some of them will visit us again.

208
00:15:02.326 --> 00:15:03.696
I thought I came in the wrong office.

209
00:15:04.826 --> 00:15:06.096
I love this place.

210
00:15:07.436 --> 00:15:08.436
What brings you here?

211
00:15:08.736 --> 00:15:10.836
I don't want to work at Hyun Soo's old studio.

212
00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:14.135
Her career was ruined while she worked there.

213
00:15:14.606 --> 00:15:16.576
It might jinx me, so I won't.

214
00:15:19.806 --> 00:15:21.476
How is the casting going?

215
00:15:22.015 --> 00:15:23.275
We're drawing up a list.

216
00:15:23.415 --> 00:15:24.446
What about the air time?

217
00:15:25.385 --> 00:15:29.186
It's your debut drama, so it'll depend on which actors star in.

218
00:15:29.316 --> 00:15:32.625
You'll have to play an important role in casting those actors.

219
00:15:33.255 --> 00:15:35.056
The script is most important these days.

220
00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:38.025
That's what people say, but I know it's not true.

221
00:15:38.466 --> 00:15:40.665
Actors will star in the drama if their interests are satisfied.

222
00:15:41.096 --> 00:15:42.596
And it's your job...

223
00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:44.535
to satisfy their interests.

224
00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:48.035
Let's check the script first and talk. The airtime comes after.

225
00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:50.306
We have an interview with Min Ho tomorrow,

226
00:15:50.306 --> 00:15:51.875
and I'll catch up with Jung Sun.

227
00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:53.976
Then I'll go interview Min Ho.

228
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:57.015
Enjoy your time with Chef On.

229
00:15:58.885 --> 00:15:59.946
That's...

230
00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:02.186
necessary.

231
00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:04.086
Indeed.

232
00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:10.125
- It must be Hong Ah. - She's coming today?

233
00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:12.165
Yes.

234
00:16:19.365 --> 00:16:22.206
Ta-da. Look what I bought for you.

235
00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:23.476
What is it?

236
00:16:23.476 --> 00:16:25.346
Guess what? I'm making a debut.

237
00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:26.346
(She'll make a debut with her script.)

238
00:16:26.346 --> 00:16:29.245
I just gave Mr. Park my revised script.

239
00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:30.816
Congratulations.

240
00:16:31.045 --> 00:16:33.045
Now that you won the competition, everything's going so well for you.

241
00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:36.255
How is it going for you?

242
00:16:37.285 --> 00:16:38.686
I have to prepare for my drama too.

243
00:16:39.285 --> 00:16:41.426
It's impressive how you keep working instead of taking a rest.

244
00:16:42.596 --> 00:16:44.125
What is all of this?

245
00:16:45.096 --> 00:16:46.196
That's only a preview.

246
00:16:47.795 --> 00:16:49.365
Ta-da. This is the real.

247
00:16:50.295 --> 00:16:52.606
- Is this for me? - Yes.

248
00:16:53.135 --> 00:16:54.836
You feel better whenever you wear pretty clothes.

249
00:16:56.976 --> 00:16:59.176
Gosh, it's so pretty.

250
00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:01.015
You're the best.

251
00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:02.115
Enjoy your time.

252
00:17:17.696 --> 00:17:18.696
Hyun Soo.

253
00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:20.795
Are you still mad at me?

254
00:17:32.706 --> 00:17:34.245
I thought about it,

255
00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:38.015
and you said you didn't like Jung Sun first.

256
00:17:38.886 --> 00:17:41.515
So I didn't do anything wrong...

257
00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:43.555
when it comes to your relationship with him.

258
00:17:44.325 --> 00:17:45.855
What's the use in bringing that out now?

259
00:17:46.686 --> 00:17:49.995
You said I hurt your feelings because of that,

260
00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:51.666
so I thought about it.

261
00:17:53.226 --> 00:17:56.495
I really thought you were getting married to Mr. Park.

262
00:17:57.065 --> 00:17:58.936
Let's not talk about it. It's all in the past.

263
00:17:59.636 --> 00:18:03.275
You say it's in the past, and why are you so cold to me?

264
00:18:06.245 --> 00:18:08.176
I need time to clear up my feelings.

265
00:18:08.745 --> 00:18:10.616
I'm not going to work in your studio.

266
00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:13.585
I decided not to join "Unruly Detectives" either.

267
00:18:14.186 --> 00:18:17.456
I'm trying my best not to bother your feelings too.

268
00:18:18.785 --> 00:18:20.696
You were close with me before you became close with Kyung.

269
00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.255
Think of the time we spent together.

270
00:18:24.196 --> 00:18:25.726
You shouldn't forget that.

271
00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:51.085
I thought you'd go out with Hyun Soo and eventually marry her.

272
00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:53.486
What did you do for the past five years?

273
00:18:53.755 --> 00:18:55.755
That I was dumped by a girl before I came to Paris.

274
00:18:56.196 --> 00:18:57.595
I met her again.

275
00:18:58.166 --> 00:18:59.866
Didn't you say she was engaged?

276
00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:02.565
There was a misunderstanding. I was told the wrong information.

277
00:19:03.535 --> 00:19:06.666
I'd like to introduce her to you. You'll be surprised.

278
00:19:36.666 --> 00:19:37.706
Goodness.

279
00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:47.976
The first planning intention.

280
00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:50.545
Temperature is important in cooking.

281
00:19:51.116 --> 00:19:53.186
A soup dish is most delicious...

282
00:19:53.585 --> 00:19:55.616
when it's at 60 to 70°C for hot soups.

283
00:19:58.686 --> 00:20:00.085
What are you doing?

284
00:20:02.295 --> 00:20:04.426
I miss you.

285
00:20:06.196 --> 00:20:07.736
(What are you doing?)

286
00:20:08.095 --> 00:20:09.095
(What are you doing?)

287
00:20:09.095 --> 00:20:10.906
I miss you.

288
00:20:12.005 --> 00:20:14.176
You want to meet up? I'll go to where you are.

289
00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:15.176
(You want to meet up? I'll go to where you are.)

290
00:20:15.676 --> 00:20:16.676
I'll go.

291
00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:19.646
You worked all day long today. I know you're tired.

292
00:20:33.186 --> 00:20:34.196
Aren't you tired?

293
00:20:34.595 --> 00:20:35.595
Should I be?

294
00:20:35.595 --> 00:20:37.565
I mean, I'm just worried you might be.

295
00:20:38.166 --> 00:20:41.035
Being a chef is tough. You have to work from dawn to night.

296
00:20:41.196 --> 00:20:42.696
Thanks for knowing.

297
00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.706
It's good to ride a bike in this neighborhood.

298
00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:48.805
Especially at night alone with someone.

299
00:20:50.176 --> 00:20:51.176
Alone with someone?

300
00:20:52.345 --> 00:20:53.775
Whom did you ride a bike with?

301
00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:56.876
I'm going to. With Hyun Soo.

302
00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:47.196
Aren't you hungry now that you've exercised?

303
00:21:47.295 --> 00:21:49.095
- Come here. - What is it?

304
00:21:49.795 --> 00:21:51.035
- Wait here. - Okay.

305
00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:07.146
It's a new menu which I developed.

306
00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:09.616
Please be a tester in a while.

307
00:22:09.616 --> 00:22:10.986
It looks amazing.

308
00:22:13.156 --> 00:22:15.025
It's called Oyster Pop Champagne Granita.

309
00:22:15.325 --> 00:22:18.065
Granita means Italian ice sherbet.

310
00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:27.936
It tastes like champagne is bubbling in my mouth.

311
00:22:28.075 --> 00:22:30.406
They usually have oyster with champagne,

312
00:22:30.476 --> 00:22:32.146
but I combined the two in one dish.

313
00:22:32.245 --> 00:22:35.015
It's delicious. You're brilliant.

314
00:22:35.045 --> 00:22:36.045
What do you mean?

315
00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:37.646
How did you think of such an idea?

316
00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:39.686
It goes the same for writers too.

317
00:22:41.755 --> 00:22:43.085
I have something to brag about too.

318
00:22:43.855 --> 00:22:45.025
Do you know who Yoo Hye Jung is?

319
00:22:45.025 --> 00:22:46.726
She's the most famous Korean Wave actress.

320
00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:49.656
I'm not sure. Shall I look it up on the internet?

321
00:22:49.656 --> 00:22:51.325
- Yes. - Okay.

322
00:22:55.265 --> 00:22:58.505
(Yoo Hye Jung)

323
00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:00.166
It's her.

324
00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:02.736
Mr. Park sent her my piece,

325
00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.745
and she loved it so much that she wanted to see me.

326
00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:06.976
I told you, your writing is good.

327
00:23:06.976 --> 00:23:08.916
"The Man Who Eats Rare Steak" was fun too.

328
00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:10.075
Did you watch it?

329
00:23:10.075 --> 00:23:11.616
Yes, I watched it.

330
00:23:11.845 --> 00:23:14.085
Hong Ah told me that you won the competition.

331
00:23:15.656 --> 00:23:17.325
I'm so happy to hear that.

332
00:23:17.726 --> 00:23:20.255
I'm regaining my confidence.

333
00:23:22.456 --> 00:23:25.426
In that sense, let's toast.

334
00:23:28.236 --> 00:23:29.436
- Cheers. - Cheers.

335
00:23:34.876 --> 00:23:35.876
It's good.

336
00:23:43.646 --> 00:23:44.646
What was that?

337
00:23:45.186 --> 00:23:46.186
Do I still have it on my lips?

338
00:23:46.186 --> 00:23:47.815
("Noir")

339
00:23:47.815 --> 00:23:50.525
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

340

("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

341
00:24:05.265 --> 00:24:06.835
Kind Soup...

342
00:24:09.575 --> 00:24:10.775
Good Soup...

("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

344
00:24:17.186 --> 00:24:18.515
(Mr. Park)

345
00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:20.986
Hello?

346
00:24:21.585 --> 00:24:22.585
What are you doing?

347
00:24:23.456 --> 00:24:24.626
I'm at home.

348
00:24:25.926 --> 00:24:27.025
Come to my office.

349
00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:30.025
What? At this hour?

350
00:24:32.065 --> 00:24:33.095
Why?

351
00:24:33.795 --> 00:24:36.196
Didn't I tell you to make a change in our relationship?

352
00:24:37.265 --> 00:24:38.335
I need to talk to you.

353
00:24:59.525 --> 00:25:02.196
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

354
00:25:04.926 --> 00:25:06.025
How did you come here?

355
00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:08.295
I came by my car.

356
00:25:09.095 --> 00:25:10.706
Did something happen to your company?

357
00:25:22.575 --> 00:25:24.116
You look worried.

358
00:25:24.815 --> 00:25:25.815
Am I right?

359
00:25:26.315 --> 00:25:27.785
Yes, a little.

360
00:25:31.025 --> 00:25:32.855
You seem different lately.

361
00:25:34.226 --> 00:25:36.956
So you're not completely indifferent to me.

362
00:25:38.396 --> 00:25:39.866
I'm grateful to you.

363
00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:44.565
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

364
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:46.535
How is your writing going?

365
00:25:47.835 --> 00:25:49.136
I'm working hard.

366
00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:50.946
What about the interviews?

367
00:25:51.376 --> 00:25:52.946
We're doing it at Good Soup.

368
00:25:54.376 --> 00:25:56.476
Does Chef On help you a lot?

369
00:25:57.845 --> 00:25:59.486
Yes, he does.

370
00:26:06.355 --> 00:26:07.396
Okay.

371
00:26:08.055 --> 00:26:10.226
I'm drunk, so I can't take you home.

372
00:26:10.325 --> 00:26:12.295
Tell me if you're going through anything.

373
00:26:13.065 --> 00:26:15.065
I'll help if I can.

374
00:26:19.236 --> 00:26:20.466
Not today.

375
00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:23.236
I don't think I can control my emotions today.

376
00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:28.045
Aren't you going home?

377
00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:31.216
I won't. I'm going to sleep here tonight.

378
00:26:49.495 --> 00:26:50.805
Thanks for today.

379
00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:56.976
Don't try to bear everything by yourself.

380
00:27:00.075 --> 00:27:01.976
I can be someone you can talk to.

381
00:27:16.795 --> 00:27:19.366
Get in. I'll walk you to the parking lot.

382
00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:34.515
When I proposed to you a long time ago,

383
00:27:37.116 --> 00:27:38.285
did you think it was weird?

384
00:27:39.545 --> 00:27:42.916
We weren't even seeing each other, but I proposed to you.

385
00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:47.825
I don't think there's a right answer to such a matter.

386
00:27:49.095 --> 00:27:51.595
When I was young, I thought love was based on trust,

387
00:27:52.626 --> 00:27:54.035
but I don't think that anymore.

388
00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:57.736
Love and trust are two different words.

389
00:27:58.966 --> 00:28:00.505
You can love someone...

390
00:28:01.406 --> 00:28:03.035
even if you don't trust them.

391
00:28:05.706 --> 00:28:07.515
You can marry someone only when there's trust.

392
00:28:08.315 --> 00:28:10.075
It's difficult even if you love the other.

393
00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:14.486
I hope you meet someone nice.

394
00:28:15.755 --> 00:28:17.226
Because you're a good man.

395
00:28:29.535 --> 00:28:31.466
Don't come out. I'll go alone from here.

396
00:28:33.406 --> 00:28:35.206
Go home and sleep.

397
00:28:35.835 --> 00:28:37.646
Why would you sleep in that cold office?

398
00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:07.835
Why do you always pick grass whenever I come up here?

399
00:29:07.835 --> 00:29:08.936
You're like an old man.

400
00:29:12.545 --> 00:29:13.946
You come here often lately.

401
00:29:14.176 --> 00:29:16.646
Is it because Professor Min started a new semester?

402
00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:18.646
Daniel doesn't have any lecture today.

403
00:29:18.745 --> 00:29:20.486
I came to Seoul with him because we have business to take care of.

404
00:29:20.785 --> 00:29:22.616
I want to have breakfast here before then.

405
00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:25.855
Good Soup can't give you breakfast now. Go buy it yourself.

406
00:29:26.025 --> 00:29:27.525
I know you have many ingredients in the kitchen.

407
00:29:27.525 --> 00:29:29.196
I'll go make it myself.

408
00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:30.495
What's the password?

409
00:29:30.495 --> 00:29:32.825
Of course, you won't let me know.

410
00:29:36.166 --> 00:29:38.605
I'll ask Daniel to buy breakfast on his way here, okay?

411
00:29:42.376 --> 00:29:43.575
The third planning intention.

412
00:29:43.706 --> 00:29:46.176
The professional cooking field is a men's world.

413
00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:48.075
There's a strict hierarchy.

414
00:29:48.216 --> 00:29:50.376
It consists of chefs who are in charge...

415
00:29:50.376 --> 00:29:52.146
of each part of the cooking.

416
00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:53.345
(Mother)

417
00:29:56.855 --> 00:29:58.085
(Mother)

418
00:30:01.255 --> 00:30:02.355
Hello?

419
00:30:02.755 --> 00:30:03.795
Hello?

420
00:30:04.926 --> 00:30:06.795
Yes, Mother. Please go ahead.

421
00:30:07.295 --> 00:30:08.466
So your phone is working.

422
00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:11.505
I thought your phone broke because you didn't call me.

423
00:30:13.105 --> 00:30:14.206
I see.

424
00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:17.946
I'm having brunch at Good Soup now.

425
00:30:18.676 --> 00:30:20.676
I will be going to Good Soup today too.

426
00:30:20.676 --> 00:30:23.015
I'm doing my research there for my new drama these days.

427
00:30:23.515 --> 00:30:25.686
Oh, really? Then that's great.

428
00:30:25.686 --> 00:30:26.886
I'll see you later.

429
00:30:28.656 --> 00:30:30.825
Okay, then I'll see you there.

430
00:30:32.126 --> 00:30:33.186
Okay.

431
00:30:39.595 --> 00:30:41.065
I couldn't find a donut shop nearby.

432
00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:43.366
So I had to walk a long way from here.

433
00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:44.436
Thank you.

434
00:30:45.236 --> 00:30:46.565
I also told your son to come.

435
00:30:48.105 --> 00:30:49.176
He's here.

436
00:30:49.605 --> 00:30:50.646
Sit down.

437
00:30:50.946 --> 00:30:52.005
Daniel...

438
00:30:52.345 --> 00:30:55.245
No. Professor Min really cares a lot for you.

439
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.085
I have to get back to work, so I can't stay for long.

440
00:30:59.116 --> 00:31:00.245
I added two espresso shots.

441
00:31:01.855 --> 00:31:04.055
I called Hyun Soo. I did well, right?

442
00:31:04.325 --> 00:31:05.656
When are you going to get married with her?

443
00:31:05.886 --> 00:31:08.025
She's not that young. You guys should hurry up.

444
00:31:10.226 --> 00:31:11.565
What does age have to do with marriage?

445
00:31:12.025 --> 00:31:14.366
You should either get married late or not get married at all.

446
00:31:15.035 --> 00:31:17.065
You first got married when you were 25.

447
00:31:17.335 --> 00:31:18.835
Then you got remarried when you were 41.

448
00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:22.436
Why are you forcing your opinion on marriage on him?

449
00:31:22.636 --> 00:31:23.845
I never forced anything.

450
00:31:24.305 --> 00:31:25.706
I was just telling him my personal thoughts.

451
00:31:25.706 --> 00:31:28.775
You sounded a bit too firm. That's the same thing as forcing it on him.

452
00:31:30.986 --> 00:31:33.585
She might not be able to say it, but I'm sure she wants to get married.

453
00:31:34.916 --> 00:31:37.486
You're the younger one, so you should be more considerate.

454
00:31:39.656 --> 00:31:40.956
I'll go downstairs now.

455
00:31:46.626 --> 00:31:48.295
You were just talking to me, right?

456
00:31:49.035 --> 00:31:50.035
No.

457
00:31:50.565 --> 00:31:53.636
We may not have had a wedding or registered our marriage,

458
00:31:53.876 --> 00:31:55.005
but we still love each other.

459
00:31:55.605 --> 00:31:56.636
That's all that matters.

460
00:31:56.906 --> 00:31:59.646
But it sounds like you want to go through a marriage registration.

461
00:32:00.446 --> 00:32:02.976
You're really quick-witted when it comes to things like this.

462
00:32:07.515 --> 00:32:08.585
Gosh.

463
00:32:13.755 --> 00:32:14.755
Hello?

464
00:32:15.426 --> 00:32:17.265
I was just about to leave my house.

465
00:32:17.795 --> 00:32:19.325
Did my mom call you?

466
00:32:19.926 --> 00:32:22.535
Yes, I'm on my way out because she asked me to come.

467
00:32:23.196 --> 00:32:24.736
You don't need to come. I'll make up an excuse.

468
00:32:25.505 --> 00:32:27.065
I'm not a kid.

469
00:32:27.976 --> 00:32:30.505
I can talk to her myself. Am I not allowed to do that?

470
00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:33.075
No, you can do that.

471
00:32:35.416 --> 00:32:38.015
I feel like getting to know your mother...

472
00:32:39.545 --> 00:32:41.156
will help me get to know you...

473
00:32:41.716 --> 00:32:44.055
and love you even more.

474
00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:48.095
(Episode 20 will air shortly.)
