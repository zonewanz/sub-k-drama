00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:07.668
(Episode 20)

2
00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:09.037
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:14.338 --> 00:00:16.107
Is Chef On's mother here today?

4
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:19.207
I think she's at the terrace on the second floor.

5
00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:27.817
There seem to be less customers than usual today.

6
00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:30.657
Is it because of the allergy incident by any chance?

7
00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:32.987
How did you know?

8
00:00:35.057 --> 00:00:36.898
I found it out while researching data.

9
00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:39.797
You know, Good Soup is the background of my drama.

10
00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.708
Does this kind of incidents really affect your business?

11
00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:46.977
Rumors spread fast in this field.

12
00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:48.837
And fine dining restaurants like us...

13
00:00:48.837 --> 00:00:50.977
usually have fixed customers.

14
00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:55.877
When can we interview Min Ho, the youngest chef here?

15
00:00:58.447 --> 00:00:59.748
The work isn't tough.

16
00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.957
Or I tell myself it isn't hard.

17
00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:08.498
Are there any couples here?

18
00:01:08.858 --> 00:01:10.828
I'm fast to know in that kind of stuff.

19
00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:14.297
I think Soo Jung likes someone.

20
00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:16.668
And who is that?

21
00:01:22.338 --> 00:01:23.407
Here.

22
00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:25.377
Now, you ask me...

23
00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.677
to make cake for your interview?

24
00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:29.017
I need to win his favor.

25
00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:32.248
If he doesn't cooperate, I'll have a hard time writing my drama.

26
00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:34.618
I'll put your name on the list if it gets aired.

27
00:01:35.317 --> 00:01:37.888
"A cooking advisor, Choi Won Joon."

28
00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:38.927
Whatever.

29
00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:40.528
I just hope you become successful.

30
00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:42.998
You'll be at ease if you do well.

31
00:01:43.127 --> 00:01:46.097
Please go back to how you were in college.

32
00:01:46.868 --> 00:01:48.638
I won't go to you even if I change.

33
00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:50.537
I never told you to come to me.

34
00:01:51.468 --> 00:01:53.877
You think you have the lead in our relationship? You're wrong.

35
00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:56.237
It's going to be you who will feel bad if we don't date each other.

36
00:01:56.338 --> 00:01:58.507
Fix that short temper of yours.

37
00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:02.017
Look who's talking.

38
00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:03.847
Sometimes I laugh out of astonishment...

39
00:02:04.547 --> 00:02:06.017
whenever I talk with you.

40
00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:07.118
Laugh like that.

41
00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:10.428
Laugh no matter how much I throw a fit.

42
00:02:13.827 --> 00:02:14.928
I'll be going now.

43
00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:18.667
Excuse me.

44
00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:21.298
What do you do during your break time?

45
00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:25.007
We're free until we start preparing for dinnertime.

46
00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:27.838
What are you doing here?

47
00:02:28.338 --> 00:02:29.338
I'm covering this restaurant.

48
00:02:29.977 --> 00:02:31.947
- Is her story about cooking? - Yes.

49
00:02:31.947 --> 00:02:34.018
It might get filmed around next year since you're covering it now.

50
00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:37.648
Kyung, my drama is getting filmed this year.

51
00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:39.917
Her drama might as well get filmed.

52
00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:41.718
She has the synopsis and scripts for the first two episodes.

53
00:02:41.718 --> 00:02:42.988
When did she write all those?

54
00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:45.257
I heard she wrote it a few years ago.

55
00:02:46.757 --> 00:02:47.898
I should go.

56
00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:50.768
- Goodbye. - Bye.

57
00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:53.898
She's so diligent.

58
00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:56.268
No wonder why she's doing so well in her career.

59
00:02:57.067 --> 00:02:58.838
It's fine for her to be doing well,

60
00:02:59.407 --> 00:03:01.808
but I don't want her to be so rude to Chef Choi.

61
00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:10.887
Hello.

62
00:03:10.988 --> 00:03:13.118
- Hi. Have a seat. - Okay.

63
00:03:15.757 --> 00:03:18.088
- Did you see this? - No, I haven't.

64
00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:21.157
Gosh, he looks so handsome.

65
00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:23.227
Right?

66
00:03:24.398 --> 00:03:25.498
I gave birth to him.

67
00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:28.338
It's the best thing I've done in my entire life.

68
00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:30.768
The second best thing is getting divorced.

69
00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:36.708
I could finally live like a human after I got divorced.

70
00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:39.748
I don't know why I resisted so much not to divorce him then.

71
00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:42.447
Jung Sun suffered the most from it.

72
00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:46.447
I heard it was when he was 15.

73
00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:48.988
And he protected me at that age.

74
00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:52.287
I feel bad that he matured so early,

75
00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:54.257
but what can we do about it?

76
00:03:55.157 --> 00:03:57.868
Everyone is born with their own fate.

77
00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:00.798
He grew up so well.

78
00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:02.498
I have so many things to learn from him.

79
00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:07.907
I need to go shopping. You want to join me?

80
00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:11.308
Professor Min went for his special lecture, and Jung Sun has to work.

81
00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:14.317
Do you accompany with someone whenever you go shopping?

82
00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:15.548
Not always.

83
00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:18.817
You need to do something together to get closer with one another.

84
00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:23.158
Can I ask you something by the way?

85
00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:25.158
Sure. Ask away.

86
00:04:26.688 --> 00:04:28.598
Why do you want to get closer with me?

87
00:04:31.798 --> 00:04:34.238
You and I both date a younger man.

88
00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:36.337
You're dating my son too.

89
00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:38.507
It'd be great if we go on a double date.

90
00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:41.337
It might help my relationship with Professor Min.

91
00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:46.707
He makes me so happy.

92
00:04:47.717 --> 00:04:49.678
Jung Sun works every day,

93
00:04:50.447 --> 00:04:53.587
and I feel bad about it as his mom.

94
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:58.928
I hope someone makes my son happy too.

95
00:04:59.387 --> 00:05:00.658
That's my wish.

96
00:05:02.957 --> 00:05:05.527
His face brightens whenever he talks about you.

97
00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:07.368
Really?

98
00:05:09.137 --> 00:05:11.408
You just made it so obvious that you're glad to hear that.

99
00:05:11.408 --> 00:05:12.438
I like it.

100
00:05:14.178 --> 00:05:16.108
I hate pretentious people.

101
00:05:16.877 --> 00:05:18.748
I can't go shopping with your because I have to work.

102
00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:20.748
I'm working on my drama at the moment.

103
00:05:21.147 --> 00:05:23.918
Now, you're being way too honest.

104
00:05:25.548 --> 00:05:28.788
I was a little intimidated by you when I first saw you.

105
00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:30.757
But now that I see you again,

106
00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:32.928
you're like a girl.

107
00:05:34.228 --> 00:05:35.327
I hear that often.

108
00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:50.038
- It's done. - Thank you.

109
00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:52.548
Please move to the chest X-ray room.

110
00:05:52.548 --> 00:05:53.647
- Okay. - Thank you.

111
00:05:54.678 --> 00:05:55.848
(Chest X-ray)

112
00:06:01.558 --> 00:06:03.658
Please move to the endoscopy room.

113
00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:04.688
- Okay. - Okay.

114
00:06:04.688 --> 00:06:05.728
We have an endoscopy next.

115
00:06:05.988 --> 00:06:07.998
- Lee Min Jae and Park Min Ah. - Here.

116
00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:09.257
Please wait here.

117
00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:10.267
- Okay. - Okay.

118
00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:17.368
You often have a headache these days.

119
00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:20.108
Should we have chosen to get a brain CT too?

120
00:06:20.507 --> 00:06:21.908
There's no need.

121
00:06:22.577 --> 00:06:24.548
Everyone has a slight headache in daily life.

122
00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:27.877
Still, it's good to get it checked while you're at it.

123
00:06:30.817 --> 00:06:33.288
All right, I'll listen to you.

124
00:06:34.217 --> 00:06:35.517
That makes me happy.

125
00:06:45.897 --> 00:06:47.637
What can I help you with, Mr. Park?

126
00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:51.067
I don't need anything fancy. Just show me bands.

127
00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.098
Are you developing a cake?

128
00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:21.767
It looks like a path in a forest.

129
00:07:22.298 --> 00:07:25.238
I'm sketching the cake Jung Woo will use for his proposal.

130
00:07:25.337 --> 00:07:26.567
Is Mr. Park getting married?

131
00:07:26.668 --> 00:07:29.577
Yes. I think there is someone he had on his mind for a while.

132
00:07:30.038 --> 00:07:31.348
It's a forest path concept.

133
00:07:31.348 --> 00:07:33.848
I want him and the woman he likes to walk on a flower path.

134
00:07:33.848 --> 00:07:35.048
I'm cheering for him.

135
00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:37.147
I'm so curious who it is.

136
00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:39.947
Don't worry, you'll see her on Saturday.

137
00:07:39.947 --> 00:07:41.158
It'll be here at Good Soup.

138
00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:46.587
- Hyun Soo. - Hello.

139
00:07:46.728 --> 00:07:49.498
- Are you here? - Yes. What are you doing?

140
00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:51.798
I'm sketching for a cake that will be used...

141
00:07:51.798 --> 00:07:52.897
for a proposal.

142
00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:55.397
Do you normally draw first before making it?

143
00:07:55.397 --> 00:07:57.608
Yes. The visuals are a part of the dish.

144
00:07:57.967 --> 00:07:59.007
What does it look like?

145
00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:03.178
It looks like a forest.

146
00:08:03.277 --> 00:08:04.308
I'll leave.

147
00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:06.108
- I'll go, Hyun Soo. - Okay.

148
00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:08.418
You should put in more flowers since it's a forest.

149
00:08:08.418 --> 00:08:09.918
I can make that happen.

150
00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:15.688
Can I try it too?

151
00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:17.228
Sure.

152
00:08:20.897 --> 00:08:21.928
Here?

153
00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:27.798
Again.

154
00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:29.168
(Son, kimchi, smell, Korean food)

155
00:08:29.168 --> 00:08:32.567
I made Kimchi soup at night by myself,

156
00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:35.138
and they somehow knew. They told me it smells.

157
00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:36.538
They knocked on my door...

158
00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:40.817
Are you serious?

159
00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:42.947
Why is he back?

160
00:08:49.418 --> 00:08:50.928
Gosh, I'm so tired.

161
00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:52.688
What is it again?

162
00:08:53.327 --> 00:08:55.258
I'll leave after napping for an hour.

163
00:08:55.258 --> 00:08:56.997
You can work continue doing your work.

164
00:08:57.097 --> 00:08:59.028
This isn't your home.

165
00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:00.898
Why do you always come here?

166
00:09:02.737 --> 00:09:05.367
Is Hyun Soo dating Chef On?

167
00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:08.138
Why do you care about someone else's personal life?

168
00:09:08.837 --> 00:09:11.447
Hyun Soo and I go way back.

169
00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:14.278
What will happen to Jung Woo, then?

170
00:09:16.778 --> 00:09:18.388
(Listen to the recording.)

171
00:09:20.317 --> 00:09:23.827
Does Mr. Park like Hyun Soo?

172
00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:26.128
It's been a long time.

173
00:09:28.398 --> 00:09:29.528
You woke me up.

174
00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:32.597
Can you make me ramyeon?

175
00:09:33.938 --> 00:09:35.538
Make it yourself.

176
00:09:36.398 --> 00:09:37.467
All right.

177
00:09:47.518 --> 00:09:49.778
Are you kidding me?

178
00:09:50.018 --> 00:09:51.648
Are you a child?

179
00:09:52.148 --> 00:09:53.418
Go away!

180
00:09:53.717 --> 00:09:55.357
My hands slipped.

181
00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:58.327
Go over there. Just sit down. I'll make it for you.

182
00:10:01.827 --> 00:10:04.168
Writer Kyung Ah, you're so kind.

183
00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.438
It's Kyung, not Kyung Ah.

184
00:10:09.538 --> 00:10:11.837
I hate it when people call me a writer.

185
00:10:11.837 --> 00:10:14.577
I also hate people that always say the things I hate.

186
00:10:15.378 --> 00:10:18.347
You're so mean. You're cruel.

187
00:10:20.107 --> 00:10:21.247
Do you like me now?

188
00:10:21.918 --> 00:10:23.648
Just don't talk to me.

189
00:10:24.648 --> 00:10:27.518
Don't I have pretty eyes?

190
00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:31.158
I'll tell you who has pretty eyes.

191
00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:33.628
If you go to Good Soup,

192
00:10:33.628 --> 00:10:36.058
there is a chef named On Jung Sun.

193
00:10:36.697 --> 00:10:38.268
I don't like him.

194
00:10:38.628 --> 00:10:40.737
He's my enemy as well as Jung Woo's.

195
00:10:41.237 --> 00:10:43.867
Gosh. What an embarrassment.

196
00:10:43.867 --> 00:10:45.638
You're embarrassing.

197
00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:49.477
You're friends with Ji Hong Ah, right?

198
00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.077
She's going to debut.

199
00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:53.717
Don't compare me to her!

200
00:10:53.918 --> 00:10:55.878
She stole my pride.

201
00:11:16.067 --> 00:11:18.408
Hello. It's been a while.

202
00:11:18.508 --> 00:11:19.967
I went on a business trip.

203
00:11:20.308 --> 00:11:21.737
Do you plan on going on TV again?

204
00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:23.138
No, I don't.

205
00:11:24.008 --> 00:11:25.008
How is it?

206
00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:26.447
It's delicious.

207
00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:28.847
It's a little different from when I had...

208
00:11:28.847 --> 00:11:30.987
oysters and champagne separately in the Mediterranean.

209
00:11:32.548 --> 00:11:33.888
It tastes completely different.

210
00:11:35.058 --> 00:11:36.117
Enjoy.

211
00:11:37.357 --> 00:11:38.428
Enjoy.

212
00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:44.067
You came alone?

213
00:11:44.428 --> 00:11:46.327
It's rare for you to not have a meeting.

214
00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:48.898
I'm trying not to take meetings.

215
00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:50.737
You fixed it.

216
00:11:51.107 --> 00:11:53.067
It tastes so much better than the first time.

217
00:11:54.038 --> 00:11:55.808
It's all thanks to a good taster.

218
00:11:57.648 --> 00:11:58.908
Let's have tea when you're done.

219
00:12:03.178 --> 00:12:04.487
Your restaurant is getting empty.

220
00:12:05.817 --> 00:12:08.617
I think I'll try changing the main dish next month.

221
00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:10.758
I don't think it's because of your cooking.

222
00:12:11.487 --> 00:12:12.888
Are you turning a blind eye to reality?

223
00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:17.528
I'm skeptical about solving problems in a realistic way.

224
00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:20.097
I have a feeling that's not where the essence is.

225
00:12:21.298 --> 00:12:24.168
Even after all that, I feel like I'm back where I began.

226
00:12:28.178 --> 00:12:29.508
About the restaurant...

227
00:12:30.138 --> 00:12:31.148
Yes?

228
00:12:31.908 --> 00:12:33.378
Why did you call it Good Soup?

229
00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.217
There's On Jung Sun.

230
00:12:35.477 --> 00:12:37.617
Sincerity and Love Line.

231
00:12:38.018 --> 00:12:39.288
You have so many options.

232
00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:41.617
My online nickname is Kind Soup.

233
00:12:41.617 --> 00:12:42.817
I got it from that.

234
00:12:43.058 --> 00:12:44.388
How can a soup be kind?

235
00:12:45.028 --> 00:12:47.258
There's soup...

236
00:12:47.258 --> 00:12:48.658
in Korean food too.

237
00:12:49.097 --> 00:12:50.567
You can have a meal with just a soup.

238
00:12:51.268 --> 00:12:52.467
I like being kind.

239
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.398
I wanted to cook.

240
00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:58.438
"Good" to mean kind, and "soup" is from abroad.

241
00:12:58.438 --> 00:13:00.067
It's a meeting between the east and the west.

242
00:13:00.707 --> 00:13:03.477
You went through such a complicated process for the name.

243
00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:05.408
I didn't come up with it easily.

244
00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:18.664
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E20 Temperature of Love "Tell Her to Come Too"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

245
00:13:27.867 --> 00:13:30.268
This is the proposal ring.

246
00:13:35.737 --> 00:13:37.707
Keep it with you, then serve it with the food.

247
00:13:38.548 --> 00:13:40.977
It's simple and nice. It's not superfluous.

248
00:13:41.747 --> 00:13:45.087
I wanted to choose a ring like this for my proposal too.

249
00:13:45.518 --> 00:13:46.717
I guess you beat me to it.

250
00:13:48.087 --> 00:13:49.918
- Jung Sun. - Yes?

251
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:53.857
Do you know that I like you?

252
00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:55.658
Do you know that I like you?

253
00:13:56.097 --> 00:13:57.128
I do.

254
00:13:57.398 --> 00:13:58.467
Me too.

255
00:14:00.197 --> 00:14:01.298
However,

256
00:14:02.768 --> 00:14:05.367
we all have different priorities in our lives.

257
00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:09.438
I've seen many relationships break...

258
00:14:09.737 --> 00:14:10.747
in my time.

259
00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:13.778
Same with me.

260
00:14:14.648 --> 00:14:15.918
How will it be for us?

261
00:14:18.788 --> 00:14:20.518
If things break between us...

262
00:14:20.518 --> 00:14:22.717
Why would you think about that? It's good right now.

263
00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:24.827
We can worry about that if the time comes.

264
00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:31.528
Jung Woo. I don't think it'll ever change between us.

265
00:14:33.097 --> 00:14:34.097
Why not?

266
00:14:35.337 --> 00:14:36.467
Because you're you.

267
00:14:41.008 --> 00:14:42.237
Did I just move you?

268
00:14:45.648 --> 00:14:47.477
I still can't stop myself.

269
00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:50.817
I must go until the end and find out.

270
00:14:52.148 --> 00:14:53.317
What do you mean?

271
00:15:21.018 --> 00:15:22.247
Hello, Honey.

272
00:15:23.018 --> 00:15:24.918
I woke up early to work.

273
00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:28.357
Good luck!

274
00:15:36.327 --> 00:15:38.997
(Please close the door.)

275
00:15:39.798 --> 00:15:41.268
We still have a lot of puree left, right?

276
00:15:41.268 --> 00:15:43.097
- Yes, Chef. - Keep checking on it.

277
00:15:43.367 --> 00:15:45.237
Ha Sung, check on the seafood.

278
00:15:45.337 --> 00:15:46.607
Throw them out if you think they're not fresh.

279
00:15:46.607 --> 00:15:47.638
Okay.

280
00:15:53.617 --> 00:15:55.018
I'm here, Mr. Park.

281
00:15:58.117 --> 00:15:59.418
You look well.

282
00:15:59.617 --> 00:16:01.258
It's because I'm doing what I love.

283
00:16:01.717 --> 00:16:03.018
I went did some research yesterday.

284
00:16:03.217 --> 00:16:05.258
I plan on writing all day today.

285
00:16:05.658 --> 00:16:06.928
Why did you want to see me?

286
00:16:07.628 --> 00:16:08.928
I read your script.

287
00:16:11.067 --> 00:16:12.097
It was good.

288
00:16:13.697 --> 00:16:15.097
I told you.

289
00:16:15.337 --> 00:16:16.597
I'll contact the actors.

290
00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:20.237
I know you need stars as it's your debut drama.

291
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:21.707
I'll make sure of it.

292
00:16:21.707 --> 00:16:22.808
Thank you.

293
00:16:24.308 --> 00:16:25.477
What about the director?

294
00:16:26.878 --> 00:16:28.947
The director?

295
00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:31.217
Direction is very important.

296
00:16:31.747 --> 00:16:34.487
The actors won't choose to sign just from looking at the writer.

297
00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:36.518
Not unless you're famous.

298
00:16:36.928 --> 00:16:38.327
So who will it be?

299
00:16:38.327 --> 00:16:39.827
I found someone fitting for you.

300
00:16:40.327 --> 00:16:42.827
I can't tell you right now. I'll tell you later.

301
00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:46.367
Is Hyun Soo's drama starting soon?

302
00:16:46.938 --> 00:16:49.638
She's editing right now. We'll have to talk after that.

303
00:16:50.168 --> 00:16:51.908
I trust you.

304
00:16:52.938 --> 00:16:54.408
Don't break the rules.

305
00:16:54.607 --> 00:16:57.207
If you neglect my drama because of Hyun Soo's,

306
00:16:57.207 --> 00:16:58.447
I won't sit still.

307
00:16:58.548 --> 00:16:59.908
You don't have to tell me.

308
00:17:03.018 --> 00:17:04.547
Hyun Soo and Jung Sun...

309
00:17:05.447 --> 00:17:06.648
are in love.

310
00:17:07.787 --> 00:17:11.527
There won't be any room for you in between them.

311
00:17:13.128 --> 00:17:14.257
Why are you telling me that?

312
00:17:15.957 --> 00:17:17.428
Because I like you.

313
00:17:19.197 --> 00:17:20.568
Even if you get hurt,

314
00:17:21.467 --> 00:17:22.967
it'd be good to know in advance.

315
00:17:39.088 --> 00:17:40.388
What are you doing here?

316
00:17:40.888 --> 00:17:42.487
Aren't you almost finished with shooting?

317
00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:44.727
Yes. See you.

318
00:17:56.767 --> 00:17:57.838
It must be tough.

319
00:17:58.338 --> 00:17:59.368
Sure, I guess.

320
00:17:59.737 --> 00:18:01.207
What would you like to drink?

321
00:18:02.408 --> 00:18:05.507
I don't need anything. Let's hear why you wanted to see me.

322
00:18:10.217 --> 00:18:12.918
I heard you're leaving the company.

323
00:18:13.487 --> 00:18:15.118
You're in talks with a couple of people.

324
00:18:15.118 --> 00:18:16.158
And?

325
00:18:16.487 --> 00:18:17.987
I want to scout you.

326
00:18:19.388 --> 00:18:20.797
I thought you didn't like me.

327
00:18:21.328 --> 00:18:24.098
That's separate. I admit that you're talented.

328
00:18:24.868 --> 00:18:27.967
I think we could be good partners if we can agree.

329
00:18:31.737 --> 00:18:32.737
I'd like some tea.

330
00:18:33.707 --> 00:18:34.737
Sure.

331
00:18:40.178 --> 00:18:42.047
Do you work on a Saturday?

332
00:18:43.477 --> 00:18:44.547
Yes.

333
00:18:45.017 --> 00:18:48.918
I have to do something very important today.

334
00:19:21.257 --> 00:19:22.287
It's so pretty.

335
00:19:22.717 --> 00:19:25.388
Mr. Park's proposal will succeed thanks to this cake.

336
00:19:27.257 --> 00:19:28.297
Right.

337
00:19:31.797 --> 00:19:34.098
(Lee Hyun Soo)

338
00:19:37.408 --> 00:19:38.467
Hello?

339
00:19:39.507 --> 00:19:40.578
What are you doing?

340
00:19:41.277 --> 00:19:42.338
I'm in a meeting.

341
00:19:42.537 --> 00:19:46.108
The synopsis is finished, so I was talking to Joon Ha and Kyung.

342
00:19:46.918 --> 00:19:47.977
Are you busy tonight?

343
00:19:48.747 --> 00:19:50.217
No, I'll be home all day.

344
00:19:51.088 --> 00:19:52.947
Then do you want to have dinner tonight?

345
00:19:53.247 --> 00:19:54.318
Are you free?

346
00:19:54.858 --> 00:19:57.727
I'll make myself free if it's you asking me.

347
00:19:58.388 --> 00:19:59.388
See you later.

348
00:20:01.557 --> 00:20:02.828
Are you asking Hyun Soo to come too?

349
00:20:03.358 --> 00:20:05.128
I'll introduce her officially to him.

350
00:20:05.428 --> 00:20:06.967
He'll be so surprised.

351
00:20:20.878 --> 00:20:21.977
(Lee Hyun Soo)

352
00:20:29.787 --> 00:20:30.787
Yes, Mr. Park.

353
00:20:31.957 --> 00:20:33.027
Come out right now.

354
00:20:33.828 --> 00:20:35.828
Pardon? Right now?

355
00:20:36.398 --> 00:20:38.697
Come out. Let's have dinner.

356
00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:43.608
Does it have to be tonight?

357
00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:45.307
I have plans.

358
00:20:46.007 --> 00:20:47.237
It has to be tonight.

359
00:20:48.037 --> 00:20:49.307
Let me add on that.

360
00:20:50.277 --> 00:20:51.777
You don't have a choice.

361
00:20:52.777 --> 00:20:53.818
I know.

362
00:20:55.477 --> 00:20:56.517
All right.

363
00:20:57.118 --> 00:20:59.088
Do whatever you want...

364
00:20:59.388 --> 00:21:01.057
until "Unruly Detectives" is finished.

365
00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:17.237
(Lee Hyun Soo)

366
00:21:19.838 --> 00:21:21.037
Why are you calling me?

367
00:21:21.408 --> 00:21:23.108
I don't think I can go tonight.

368
00:21:23.108 --> 00:21:24.878
Something came up. I'm sorry.

369
00:21:25.977 --> 00:21:27.217
It's okay.

370
00:21:27.648 --> 00:21:29.378
You and I can see each other any day.

371
00:21:29.848 --> 00:21:30.848
Thank you.

372
00:21:31.588 --> 00:21:34.017
Jung Sun, you're so warm like the sun.

373
00:21:35.358 --> 00:21:38.257
Don't make fun of me because you're sorry.

374
00:22:38.348 --> 00:22:41.318
You wanted to go to Good Soup?

375
00:22:42.457 --> 00:22:43.517
Yes.

376
00:22:44.688 --> 00:22:45.688
Are you happy?

377
00:22:46.727 --> 00:22:47.727
Yes.

378
00:22:52.628 --> 00:22:56.168
I told you I have something to tell you, right?

379
00:22:57.138 --> 00:22:58.338
Something personal...

380
00:22:59.908 --> 00:23:01.037
Let's talk inside.

381
00:23:21.457 --> 00:23:23.428
Hello, Mr. Park. Ms. Lee.

382
00:23:24.928 --> 00:23:27.398
Chef On was waiting. I'll lead you in.

383
00:23:41.717 --> 00:23:43.947
We'll seat ourselves. You can go.

384
00:23:44.017 --> 00:23:45.588
- We're not real customers anyway. - Okay.

385
00:23:51.557 --> 00:23:52.858
Why is it so pretty?

386
00:23:55.227 --> 00:23:56.557
Is it a special day?

387
00:24:06.737 --> 00:24:08.408
- Min Ho, bring that over. - Okay.

388
00:24:08.408 --> 00:24:10.507
- Ha Sung, taste the puree. - Yes, Chef.

389
00:24:10.507 --> 00:24:11.578
(Steak)

390
00:24:13.108 --> 00:24:14.848
There are 2 dinner courses for table 3.

391
00:24:14.848 --> 00:24:16.348
Medium rare for the steaks.

392
00:24:16.348 --> 00:24:17.418
- Yes, Chef. - Yes, Chef.

393
00:24:20.318 --> 00:24:22.318
Chef, Mr. Park is here.

394
00:24:22.618 --> 00:24:23.658
Okay.

395
00:25:05.928 --> 00:25:06.997
Jung Sun.

396
00:25:13.838 --> 00:25:17.547
If the woman you like likes another man,

397
00:25:18.247 --> 00:25:19.277
will you give up?

398
00:25:20.517 --> 00:25:22.818
I might give up, but not before I give it my all.

399
00:25:24.547 --> 00:25:26.447
Then what if that man was me?

400
00:25:27.918 --> 00:25:28.918
Would you still go all the way?

401
00:25:30.688 --> 00:25:31.928
Of course.

402
00:25:32.358 --> 00:25:33.428
Wouldn't you do the same?

403
00:25:36.497 --> 00:25:38.027
Let me introduce you two properly.

404
00:25:41.598 --> 00:25:43.138
He's the man I like the most.

405
00:25:53.747 --> 00:25:55.447
This is the woman I like the most.

406
00:26:18.237 --> 00:26:20.608
(Temperature of Love)

407
00:26:21.477 --> 00:26:22.608
Did you see Mr. Park's girlfriend?

408
00:26:22.608 --> 00:26:24.707
Did you know that I was dating Hyun Soo?

409
00:26:24.707 --> 00:26:26.608
- I did. - You knew,

410
00:26:26.648 --> 00:26:28.418
yet you asked me to help you with your proposal?

411
00:26:28.418 --> 00:26:30.717
I know it won't change anything no matter who gets involved.

412
00:26:30.717 --> 00:26:32.547
Hello, I'm Yoo Hye Jung.

413
00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:33.957
Let's have dinner since we're out.

414
00:26:33.957 --> 00:26:36.017
Did Mr. Park and Hyun Soo come together?

415
00:26:36.017 --> 00:26:38.358
I didn't do anything wrong, but I feel guilty.

416
00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:40.128
Let me have him.

417
00:26:40.128 --> 00:26:41.457
You won't keep him anyway.

418
00:26:41.457 --> 00:26:42.928
Hyun Soo and I are in love.

419
00:26:42.928 --> 00:26:45.628
I already know. Are you telling me because you're insecure?

420
00:26:45.727 --> 00:26:48.368
Isn't it childish? This is how it's like to fight for blind love.

421
00:26:48.697 --> 00:26:49.967
Can you handle it?
