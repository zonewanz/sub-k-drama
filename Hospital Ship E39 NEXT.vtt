00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:11.607
(Episode 39)

2
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.280
What's wrong?

3
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.280
Does your leg hurt again? You said it got better.

4
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:43.021
It's not that this time.

5
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.421
I sprained my ankle when I was getting off the car.

6
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.661
- Let me see. - I'm okay.

7
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:51.231
I said I'm okay.

8
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.030
Are you really okay? Do you think you can operate?

9
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.470
What if I can't? Can you do it for me?

10
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:02.841
My gosh.

11
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.671
Don't worry. It's just a little sore.

12
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.720
Scalpel.

13
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:25.461
Irrigation. Suction.

14
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:27.360
(Suction: Sucking out blended gas or fluid)

15
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.571
Retractor.

16
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.401
(Retractor: Tools used to widen the incision)

17
00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:06.571
How did it go?

18
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.970
Her surgery went well.

19
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.270
The patient is stable now, so you can move her right away.

20
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.411
Okay, we will.

21
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:15.740
- Thank you. - You can go in.

22
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.971
I brought you coffee.

23
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.971
What is it? Does your leg still hurt?

24
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.770
A little.

25
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:48.911
Ask Dr. Kim to give you acupuncture. He says it's effective.

26
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.180
Don't you want to?

27
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.751
Could you bring me some medicinal patches?

28
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:59.791
How about you get an x-ray first?

29
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:02.761
Your knee looks a bit swollen.

30
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.261
I don't think so.

31
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.860
Get an x-ray. What if there's a hairline fracture?

32
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.400
What if it gets worse and you need a cast?

33
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:13.640
Who will operate on our patients?

34
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.110
Shall I, then?

35
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.210
You just love to operate.

36
00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:24.150
Just one mention of operating, and you immediately changed...

37
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.481
Nurse Yoo.

38
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.481
- Do you need help? - No.

39
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Shall I...

40
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.791
get Doctor Kwak for you?

41
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.921
Why would you do that?

42
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:40.161
I wonder. Why would I do that?

43
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.800
Doctor.

44
00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:49.441
A hairline fracture?

45
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.680
You'd be in much worse shape if that were the case.

46
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.610
Your leg would've swollen incredibly.

47
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.810
Right?

48
00:03:57.481 --> 00:03:59.580
- Forget it, then. - Stay.

49
00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:02.381
Let's just do it.

50
00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:04.691
It's best to be safe than sorry.

51
00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:06.351
Lie down.

52
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:10.890
Let's have a look.

53
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.831
Don't you move.

54
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.940
(X-ray room)

55
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.981
Don't do this.

56
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:34.320
Nurse Yoo seems to know about us.

57
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.680
What about her?

58
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:37.450
What did she say?

59
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.351
You can't break the first rule.

60
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.820
What was the first rule?

61
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.391
"Do not hold my wrist on the hospital ship."

62
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.800
- Can I hold your ankle, then? - What?

63
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:57.070
- I'll do it. - Stay still.

64
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.860
Let's have a look.

65
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.930
Is Doctor Song's bone fractured or not?

66
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:29.870
Wait.

67
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:33.110
What's this?

68
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.081
This is...

69
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:47.820
Do you have the results?

70
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.190
Send them to me.

71
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.161
Doctor Song.

72
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.430
Come and sit down.

73
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.531
Why? Does it look bad?

74
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:00.031
Sit down.

75
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.021
Is this...

76
00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:23.490
mine?

77
00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:30.031
Is it mine?

78
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.200
Let's take another x-ray.

79
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.151
That's done.

80
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.130
Tie it nice and tight. The wind's picking up.

81
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.130
Sure.

82
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:07.740
- Great job. - Bye.

83
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:13.440
Why haven't you changed yet? Aren't you going home?

84
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.641
You can go ahead.

85
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.450
Doctor Song and I have some things to do.

86
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:24.690
I think you can do that back at the dorm.

87
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:26.490
I told you to go ahead.

88
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.461
If I may remind you both,

89
00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:33.930
you two are in charge of dinner tonight.

90
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.531
Yes. What do we eat if you both stay?

91
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:38.331
Figure something out.

92
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:40.130
Or starve.

93
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.300
Skipping one meal won't kill you.

94
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.271
Let's go, Mr. Chu.

95
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:46.110
We're not done talking.

96
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.281
- Mr. Chu. - You heard me.

97
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.921
Why won't you just listen?

98
00:07:58.921 --> 00:07:59.950
Hyun.

99
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.721
- Did you get caught? - What do you mean?

100
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:05.391
Did he catch you and Doctor Song getting up to no good?

101
00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:06.791
Hey.

102
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.601
So,

103
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.271
what do you think they're so serious about?

104
00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:26.510
It's osteosarcoma, isn't it?

105
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.351
(Osteosarcoma: A malignant bone growth)

106
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.690
You'll need a biopsy to be sure.

107
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.960
Get up. You're coming with me.

108
00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:42.230
Let's get a biopsy right away.

109
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.830
Go and get changed.

110
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:50.641
- Mr. Chu. - Or go in that.

111
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:52.741
I will...

112
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.411
deal with it.

113
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.611
What do you mean?

114
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.881
I don't want...

115
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.190
the others...

116
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:08.161
to know I'm sick.

117
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:10.361
Why?

118
00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:12.891
Are you afraid of being a nuisance?

119
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.901
Who cares? We're family.

120
00:09:16.161 --> 00:09:19.001
I'm not asking for a favor as a colleague.

121
00:09:24.111 --> 00:09:25.771
I'm not asking as Doctor Song.

122
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:28.611
I'm just a patient...

123
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:31.550
asking a medical professional...

124
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.550
to keep her medical records a secret.

125
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:43.391
Please...

126
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.700
keep my secret, Mr. Chu.

127
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.810
I will.

128
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.810
- What about the biopsy? - I'll get it done.

129
00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:03.440
Are you sure?

130
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.401
Is there a bump here?

131
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.611
Doctor, are you hurt?

132
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:06.940
It's quite cold.

133
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.940
Hey, hey, what do you think you're doing?

134
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.310
- Stop it. - Come here.

135
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.050
- Come here. - Oh dear.

136
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.621
What have you done?

137
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:17.590
I guess the mailman just tossed it over.

138
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.921
What's wrong with you? Why are you always eating paper?

139
00:11:20.921 --> 00:11:22.460
You can't be a dog. You're a goat, aren't you?

140
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.891
- Who is it? - Who's what?

141
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:25.891
Whose mail did he chew up?

142
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:29.730
Only he will know. The name's in his stomach.

143
00:11:30.131 --> 00:11:32.131
- He ate the address? - Yes.

144
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:41.041
- Whose is it? - I don't know.

145
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:44.781
"The Royal London Hospital"?

146
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.810
It must be from the UK.

147
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.151
Is it for Doctor Song?

148
00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:52.891
What is?

149
00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:56.320
- What's all this? - Did Doctor Song...

150
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.291
apply to an emergency hospital in England?

151
00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:01.800
- What? - It looks like it.

152
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.100
You didn't know?

153
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.340
- This was it. - What is it?

154
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.271
The reason Mr. Chu was upset.

155
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.041
He's upset she wants to leave just when...

156
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:16.611
we got a working surgery on board.

157
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:17.850
That makes sense.

158
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:24.921
It looks so good.

159
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.891
Pork is the best.

160
00:14:36.915 --> 00:14:43.379
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 39 Hospital Ship "Ominous Sign"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

161
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.781
You're working hard until late.

162
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.521
What brings you here?

163
00:16:47.521 --> 00:16:49.820
The patient shows signs of osteosarcoma.

164
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:52.090
I want to ask for biopsy.

165
00:16:52.621 --> 00:16:55.590
"Patient X"? What kind of name is it?

166
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.661
It's a candidate for a clinical trial.

167
00:16:57.661 --> 00:16:59.391
The patient asked for anonymity.

168
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:01.501
I see. Okay.

169
00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:03.830
- How long will it take? - Maybe one day.

170
00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:06.200
It can be quicker if you're in a hurry.

171
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.240
- By tomorrow morning? - I'll try.

172
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:10.710
I'll buy you coffee.

173
00:18:01.421 --> 00:18:03.861
(Kwak Hyun)

174
00:18:20.841 --> 00:18:22.940
The test result came out.

175
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.151
It's osteosarcoma as you expected.

176
00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:29.551
It's one of the most virulent types of cancer.

177
00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:32.121
If it had spread to the lungs,

178
00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:34.490
the patient's survival rate drops by half.

179
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.891
I gave you the result much earlier than you asked.

180
00:18:38.891 --> 00:18:42.631
Aren't you thankful? You'd better buy me that coffee.

181
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.250
Where were you?

182
00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:06.520
- I was at the ER. - Did you get a call?

183
00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:09.990
Why didn't you answer the phone?

184
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.260
Let me go. I'm tired.

185
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.631
- Dr. Song. - I'm tired.

186
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.321
Have you talked to Dr. Song?

187
00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.490
What did she say? Will she go to England?

188
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:50.470
- Hyun. - Hey.

189
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.871
Why do you talk so much?

190
00:19:52.871 --> 00:19:55.470
Stay out of their business.

191
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.040
- Don't forget to take the medicine. - Okay.

192
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.940
- It'll be provided outside. - Okay.

193
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.510
- Please take care. - Goodbye.

194
00:20:07.851 --> 00:20:10.520
Everything looks good. I'll see you next week.

195
00:20:11.351 --> 00:20:13.290
Please take care.

196
00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:08.210
(Kwak Hyun)

197
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.881
Are you looking for treasure or something?

198
00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:43.280
You startled me.

199
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.480
Were you only startled?

200
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.290
You smell good.

201
00:22:03.901 --> 00:22:05.200
Do you want to...

202
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.301
- go somewhere tomorrow? - Where?

203
00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:10.540
A nice place.

204
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.970
A nice place?

205
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.411
That sounds good.

206
00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:28.851
Shall we take a picture together too?

207
00:23:30.051 --> 00:23:31.091
That doesn't sound like you.

208
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:34.321
I told you. A person can change.

209
00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:39.131
All right.

210
00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:42.430
No, let's use my cellphone today.

211
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:55.581
1, 2, 3.

212
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.801
You're hiding something, right?

213
00:24:18.871 --> 00:24:19.930
What is it?

214
00:24:24.071 --> 00:24:25.141
Tell me.

215
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.081
Just say it.

216
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.851
If you don't want to, shall I?

217
00:24:39.821 --> 00:24:41.061
You want to leave, right?

218
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.030
To the UK.

219
00:24:53.071 --> 00:24:56.571
You want to get training at the trauma center in London.

220
00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.010
Isn't that right?

221
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:02.210
How did you know that?

222
00:25:04.411 --> 00:25:06.651
Is that what you've been thinking about for the last few days?

223
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:12.720
You look drawn.

224
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.661
I'm disappointed.

225
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:26.901
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

226
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.540
Did you think I'd stop you?

227
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.710
Did you think I was that stubborn to stop you...

228
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.111
from doing what you want?

229
00:25:36.311 --> 00:25:38.411
- No. - What then?

230
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:40.881
Did you think I'd cheat on you...

231
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:42.780
if we have a long-distance relationship?

232
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:45.450
It's not that.

233
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.490
Why are you hesitating then?

234
00:25:48.061 --> 00:25:49.720
You can just go without worrying.

235
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.571
Are you...

236
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.940
really okay with that?

237
00:26:07.841 --> 00:26:09.341
Can I go?

238
00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:14.051
If you promise me we'll video chat every day.

239
00:26:17.891 --> 00:26:21.460
From now on, don't worry yourself about how I would feel.

240
00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:23.930
I want you to feel free to talk to me about anything.

241
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.901
I want to help you and support you.

242
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:30.871
I don't want to tie you down.

243
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.811
You're getting teary again.

244
00:26:45.081 --> 00:26:46.250
You know what?

245
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:50.020
You act like you're a very strong person,

246
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.621
but you're actually a crybaby.

247
00:28:00.821 --> 00:28:02.220
Listen.

248
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:10.061
If I tell you I don't want to go back...

249
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.470
If I tell you I don't want to go back to the dormitory...

250
00:28:19.341 --> 00:28:21.240
and just be with you tonight,

251
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.720
would that make me a shallow woman?

252
00:30:10.744 --> 00:30:15.944
(Episode 40 will air shortly.)
