<i>[Episode 22]</i>
Give...

3
00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:10.119
this man to me.

4
00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:13.534
Ms. Soo Jung?

5
00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.304
I've liked the sous chef
for all the time.

6
00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.525
I can't stand to watch you treat
him like this anymore.

7
00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:23.161
You like a man who says
that he likes another woman?

8
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.553
Yes, I like the sous chef.

9
00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:29.042
You don't want him anyway,
so give him to me.

10
00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:30.896
You can have him.

11
00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:35.239
But you know, this guy has
liked me for eight years.

12
00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.952
It won't be easy for you
to win him over.

13
00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:41.166
It won't be difficult, Ms. Soo Jung.

14
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:44.498
I've fallen for you because of your
reaction just now, Ms. Soo Jung.

15
00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:46.309
Won Joon!

16
00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:48.626
What?

17
00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:52.018
I belong to Ms. Soo Jung as of now, so
get her permission before saying my name.

18
00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:55.573
Won Joon!

19
00:00:55.573 --> 00:00:56.589
Bye.

20
00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:02.434
Fine, bye.

21
00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:09.780
Let's go, Ms. Soo Jung.

22
00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.236
Sure.

23
00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:26.417
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:31.128
Did I seem that pathetic to you?

25
00:01:33.587 --> 00:01:37.421
Well, Ms. Hong Ah seems to
be the competitive type

26
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:42.435
so I thought she might be nicer to you
if I said that I liked you, Sous Chef.

27
00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:45.521
Sorry for overstepping.

28
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:47.834
I went along with it
because I agree with you.

29
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.882
I can't maintain this kind of
relationship with her forever.

30
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:55.349
Are you forgiving me, then?

31
00:01:56.848 --> 00:01:58.745
Thank you for the lie.

32
00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:03.134
It made my heart skip a beat to know that
there's a woman who wants me that much

33
00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:04.661
if only for a moment.

34
00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.403
I wasn't lying.

35
00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:13.070
I'll head out and get to work, then.

36
00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:28.552
It must be nice to get a paycheck
even when you're so lazy.

37
00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:30.768
No, I'm working right now!

38
00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:33.730
A director and a writer need to be
close for them to produce good work.

39
00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:38.140
Do you know how important
a project like "Good Soup" is to me?

40
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.400
Oh, whatever!

41
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.500
Stop shooting people's faces so
that they look so big and jiggly!

42
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.445
Why do you do that?

43
00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:47.358
Haven't you ever heard of
explor... I mean, adventurousness?

44
00:02:47.358 --> 00:02:48.457
Exactly!

45
00:02:48.457 --> 00:02:50.781
Don't experiment with this project!

46
00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:54.515
Wow, that smells amazing.

47
00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.486
I thought you said that
you're not having any!

48
00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.360
I said that because you always
make me feel so self-conscious!

49
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.433
Well, you have to be
a man of your word.

50
00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:01.410
Wait, what should I do?

51
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.444
People can say what they want.

52
00:03:02.444 --> 00:03:04.866
It doesn't mean that you're
committed to it, Writer Hwangbo.

53
00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.095
Don't say anything. Keep your word, or
don't even start a conversation with me!

54
00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:09.184
Geez.

55
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.812
Oh, looks like Hyun Soo is back!
Hyun Soo met Yoo Hye Jung!

56
00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:19.917
Huh?

57
00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:27.743
What brings you here, Director?

58
00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:29.348
What brings you here, Writer Ji?

59
00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:32.358
I was in the area and came by
because I'm hungry.

60
00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.023
Kyung, give me some food.

61
00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:37.821
Oh, did you make ramen?

62
00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.808
You really have an astute sense of smell.

63
00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:43.838
Hey, you can't give it to just Writer Ji
and not me! That's not fair!

64
00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:45.731
I told you not to talk to me!

65
00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:50.873
Did you see her off?

66
00:03:50.873 --> 00:03:52.438
Yeah.

67
00:03:54.243 --> 00:03:57.243
I chatted with her as if
she were an old friend.

68
00:03:57.243 --> 00:04:01.290
I'm happy that both of you like
each other more now that you've met.

69
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.922
She likes me?

70
00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:04.519
Yeah.

71
00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.798
If she didn't, she wouldn't have
stayed here this long.

72
00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:08.297
She's really busy.

73
00:04:08.297 --> 00:04:10.244
That makes me so happy.

74
00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:13.016
I like her even more now
that I've met her, too.

75
00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.669
Since you're already here,
let's have dinner together.

76
00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:23.444
I'm... just going to head home.

77
00:04:23.444 --> 00:04:26.251
Let's not drag our personal
feelings into work.

78
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:28.199
Both of us have to eat
to survive, after all.

79
00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.754
Do I need to say this twice?

80
00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:37.052
Let's go to Good Soup.
Business has been bad for them lately.

81
00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:38.607
We have to help them
make sales.

82
00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:43.090
He'll be even more annoyed if we
meet where he can't see us.

83
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.605
We have to meet anyway,
since we work together.

84
00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:50.749
Fine, let's go.

85
00:04:57.312 --> 00:04:59.473
When did you two start dating?

86
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:02.410
Who are you talking about?

87
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:04.852
Why are you playing coy?

88
00:05:04.852 --> 00:05:07.004
I'm talking about you
and Director Kim.

89
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.739
You have really peculiar taste in men.

90
00:05:10.674 --> 00:05:13.713
I'm right in front of you,
you know, Writer Ji.

91
00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:14.759
Hey!

92
00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.600
You told me that you
were hungry, so I fed you

93
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.261
so why are you saying crazy things now?

94
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:21.465
Why would I date Director Kim?

95
00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:23.066
You two aren't dating?

96
00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:25.136
It seems like you two
are dating to me.

97
00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:28.129
Are you two flirting?

98
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.403
Figures, this isn't the time for
you to be dating right now.

99
00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:33.237
You'll be 30 soon.

100
00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:35.369
How long are you going to
mooch off Hyun Soo?

101
00:05:35.975 --> 00:05:37.134
Hey!

102
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.696
I'm only saying this
because I'm your friend.

103
00:05:40.696 --> 00:05:43.345
Men are useless. There's no
need to depend on one!

104
00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:46.903
Have some more ambition, Kyung!

105
00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:49.730
You have to win a script-writing
competition and make your debut!

106
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.122
Wow.

107
00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:55.165
How can you say such harsh things
as if they're nothing?

108
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.619
I know you said that
you two aren't dating

109
00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.434
but why did you wear
that dress today, then?

110
00:06:00.434 --> 00:06:02.235
And at home, at that?

111
00:06:02.235 --> 00:06:03.439
Well, of course she'd wear it at home.

112
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.600
She wouldn't wear that outside.
She barely ever goes out.

113
00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:15.857
But Ms. Kyung is so nice!
Do you know how hard it is to be nice?

114
00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:18.545
Writers don't become nice, especially
after they make their debut!

115
00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:22.775
I'll be going now! Tell Hyun Soo
to call me when she gets here.

116
00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:28.917
What's gotten into him?

117
00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:32.035
I don't know!
What's with him?

118
00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.989
I'll head inside.

119
00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:43.412
Please write a wine list that
pairs well with sea bass.

120
00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:44.968
I'm going to put it
on my next menu.

121
00:06:44.968 --> 00:06:46.083
Yes, Chef.

122
00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:52.658
You didn't tell me that
you'd be coming!

123
00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:55.189
But we have such a relationship that
I can drop by unannounced.

124
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.538
We're here to have dinner together
after meeting with Ms. Yoo Hye Jung.

125
00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:09.669
Oh.

126
00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.141
Please show them to a table.

127
00:07:12.706 --> 00:07:13.941
Yes, Chef.

128
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.439
This way, please.

129
00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:25.347
You come over too, Mr. Jung Seon.

130
00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:27.785
Later.

131
00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:48.033
Did CEO Park and Hyun Soo
come here together?

132
00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:49.103
Yeah.

133
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.749
Hey, Kyung Soo.
Are you done cooking that?

134
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:54.189
Yes, Sir!

135
00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:12.576
Are you uncomfortable?

136
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.583
Yes.

137
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.696
I feel guilty even though
I did nothing wrong. I wonder why.

138
00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:24.151
You're so funny.

139
00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:26.352
What do you mean?

140
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.717
You're always so honest
about how you feel.

141
00:08:50.598 --> 00:08:52.109
Wow.

142
00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:57.234
I've fallen for you because of your
reaction just now, Ms. Soo Jung.

143
00:08:58.054 --> 00:08:59.279
Won Joon!

144
00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:02.490
I belong to Ms. Soo Jung as of now, so
get her permission before saying my name.

145
00:09:05.747 --> 00:09:07.921
<i>I've liked the sous chef
this entire time.</i>

146
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.876
I can't stand to watch you treat
him like this anymore.

147
00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:14.362
Give this man to me.

148
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.700
Is this real life?

149
00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:29.631
<i>[Hong Ah]</i>

150
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.112
<i>This caller cannot be reached.</i>

151
00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:50.895
<i>[High Society]</i>

152
00:09:53.962 --> 00:09:56.348
Love really sucks.

153
00:09:56.348 --> 00:09:59.157
He's acting like he's a hot item
by doing things like this?

154
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:06.445
Let's leave now.
I need to work.

155
00:10:08.227 --> 00:10:09.482
All right.

156
00:10:10.094 --> 00:10:12.198
I'm going to go see
Mr. Jung Seon before I go.

157
00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:14.372
All right.

158
00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:20.811
I can see you for a bit before
I leave, right, Mr. Jung Seon?

159
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:23.824
Let's see each other later.
I'll call you.

160
00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:25.521
I have something to
discuss with Jung Woo.

161
00:10:45.794 --> 00:10:47.885
Ms. Hyun Soo and I love one another.

162
00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:49.429
I know that.

163
00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:51.838
Do you keep telling me that
because I make you nervous?

164
00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:53.894
Or, are you saying it to yourself?

165
00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:56.266
I know it'll be difficult
for you to get over her

166
00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:58.473
but shouldn't you
stop all of this now?

167
00:10:58.473 --> 00:11:01.088
I'll be the one to decide
whether or not I'll stop.

168
00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:04.425
Does it piss you off that
I'm acting this way?

169
00:11:04.425 --> 00:11:06.059
Yeah, quite a bit.

170
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:08.760
I kept thinking...

171
00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:12.131
about why you were mad at me,
when I didn't do anything to you.

172
00:11:14.238 --> 00:11:15.597
I thought about it

173
00:11:15.597 --> 00:11:17.867
and you weren't exactly
completely innocent, either.

174
00:11:18.727 --> 00:11:23.952
The woman you were telling me about
in Paris was Hyun Soo, after all.

175
00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:27.425
You said that you'd meet her again,
and that you'd introduce me to her.

176
00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:29.474
So, why didn't you tell me?

177
00:11:29.474 --> 00:11:32.286
My emotions were too intense for me
to be able to tell anyone about them.

178
00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:34.649
When you asked me to
let you cameo on "Foul Detective"

179
00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:37.010
you said you did it, knowing
that Hyun Soo was the writer.

180
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.732
You didn't tell me then, either.

181
00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:41.496
For the same reason.
Why do I need to explain myself to you?

182
00:11:41.496 --> 00:11:44.646
You said you'd hang out with me,
then you cancelled on me.

183
00:11:44.646 --> 00:11:47.045
Because you went to Yeosu with Hyun Soo.

184
00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:52.330
Immature, isn't it?

185
00:11:53.859 --> 00:11:56.343
This is what it looks like when
two men fight over a woman.

186
00:11:56.343 --> 00:11:58.025
Can you stand it?

187
00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:01.014
I can.

188
00:12:01.014 --> 00:12:04.337
Because my entire life has been
me fighting, and winning.

189
00:12:04.337 --> 00:12:06.541
And I've always gotten
what I wanted.

190
00:12:07.054 --> 00:12:08.938
If you're going to be like this,
I can play this game too.

191
00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:12.107
But love takes two.
You can't do it alone.

192
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.040
No matter how much we fight,
neither of us will truly win.

193
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.199
So why should I have to
engage in this sort of fight?

194
00:12:18.589 --> 00:12:21.061
You don't need to fight since
you already have what you want

195
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:22.584
but that's not the case for me.

196
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.582
Do you think nothing will change
even when I'm rocking the boat?

197
00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:28.699
No, nothing will change.

198
00:12:30.022 --> 00:12:32.704
We loved each other even
while we were apart.

199
00:12:32.704 --> 00:12:34.467
Then enjoy your
unchanging love.

200
00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:38.939
I'm going to keep
rocking the boat, though.

201
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.430
This is my way of being kind to myself

202
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.065
for loving one woman for four years
without making a single move.

203
00:12:46.957 --> 00:12:48.419
What about our friendship?

204
00:12:53.838 --> 00:12:56.352
Our true friendship begins now.

205
00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:02.338
Let's both give it our all,
Ohn Jung Seon.

206
00:13:39.054 --> 00:13:41.592
<i>Let's see each other later.
I'll call you.</i>

207
00:13:41.592 --> 00:13:43.074
I have to talk to Jung Woo.

208
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.698
<i>We're here to eat dinner together
after meeting Ms. Yoo Hye Jung.</i>

209
00:13:48.449 --> 00:13:49.906
Oh.

210
00:13:49.906 --> 00:13:52.343
Please show them to their seats.

211
00:13:55.742 --> 00:13:57.963
I can't stop thinking about this.

212
00:13:57.963 --> 00:13:59.473
<i>I thought about it...</i>

213
00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:03.511
and it's most important that
nothing changes between us.

214
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:05.882
No matter who tries to test our love.

215
00:14:07.282 --> 00:14:08.463
But...

216
00:14:08.463 --> 00:14:11.074
you might get shaken up
if someone is rocking the boat.

217
00:14:13.371 --> 00:14:15.021
Why isn't he contacting me?

218
00:14:23.377 --> 00:14:25.189
<i>Then enjoy your
unchanging love.</i>

219
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:27.487
<i>I'm going to keep
rocking the boat, though.</i>

220
00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:58.643
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E22 Temperature of Love "Let Me Have Him"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

221
00:15:21.396 --> 00:15:22.862
Did you wash your hair?

222
00:15:22.862 --> 00:15:25.900
No. I usually wash
my hair in the morning.

223
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.598
I took a shower.

224
00:15:27.598 --> 00:15:29.439
You came out after
you took a shower?

225
00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:31.038
Yeah.

226
00:15:31.038 --> 00:15:34.025
I usually don't go out for anyone
after taking a shower, but I'm here.

227
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:37.175
You must really like me.

228
00:15:37.175 --> 00:15:40.216
Yeah, I like you a whole lot.

229
00:15:43.016 --> 00:15:44.539
What can I get you?

230
00:15:44.539 --> 00:15:45.939
Hm.

231
00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:48.795
Some expensive Blue Mountain coffee.

232
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.011
Is this a new dish
you're working on?

233
00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:56.894
Yeah, I'm going to switch
out the entrée.

234
00:15:56.894 --> 00:15:59.059
Is your restaurant suffering
from a huge deficit?

235
00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:01.380
You're being nosy again!

236
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.707
Sorry.

237
00:16:02.707 --> 00:16:05.053
But after I started doing
research at Good Soup

238
00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:07.530
I ended up hearing about
a lot of different things.

239
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.794
Will you be able to sleep
if you drink coffee now?

240
00:16:09.794 --> 00:16:11.583
It doesn't matter.

241
00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:15.593
I'm well-acquainted with caffeine.

242
00:16:15.593 --> 00:16:17.352
You're not having any?

243
00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:18.995
I won't be able to sleep if I do.

244
00:16:26.572 --> 00:16:29.870
Here, I'll hear you out now.

245
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.370
I can't give you a solution.

246
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.742
That's up to you to find,
since it's your problem.

247
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:39.718
I chose to go on the show to
get the restaurant out of the red.

248
00:16:39.718 --> 00:16:41.293
But that kind of thing
doesn't suit me.

249
00:16:41.293 --> 00:16:43.665
I don't like competing to win something.

250
00:16:43.665 --> 00:16:46.406
Didn't you go into debt when
you opened Good Soup?

251
00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:48.597
Are you checking up on
my debts now, too?

252
00:16:48.597 --> 00:16:50.865
No, I'm just asking!

253
00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:53.030
There aren't many people who
could open a place like this

254
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.414
with their own money, after all.

255
00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.886
Jung Woo was my investor.

256
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.329
Oh.

257
00:17:05.488 --> 00:17:07.155
I see.

258
00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:13.873
Does that make you uncomfortable?

259
00:17:13.873 --> 00:17:15.057
What do you mean?

260
00:17:15.644 --> 00:17:17.842
Are you afraid that your
feelings for me might waver?

261
00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:21.088
Isn't that why you ran over here
at this hour of the night?

262
00:17:21.751 --> 00:17:25.405
No, Mr. Ohn Jung Seon.
You're getting ahead of yourself.

263
00:17:28.153 --> 00:17:31.676
It's true that I am uneasy
because of you, though.

264
00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:37.921
I'm afraid that you'll doubt me and
think that I was leading him on.

265
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.945
You were with Jung Woo
the entire time that I was gone.

266
00:17:42.945 --> 00:17:45.598
I won't try to get that
time back for myself.

267
00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:47.177
So don't worry about that.

268
00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:49.555
Thanks.

269
00:17:53.587 --> 00:17:55.568
- But you know...
- Yeah?

270
00:17:55.568 --> 00:17:58.579
In my opinion, if Good Soup
is going to get out of the red

271
00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:01.751
the best way to make that happen
is to get a Michelin star.

272
00:18:01.751 --> 00:18:04.325
That's not "competing to win," per se.

273
00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:06.761
What?

274
00:18:06.761 --> 00:18:09.815
You said you'd only listen, but now
you're giving me solutions, too?

275
00:18:09.815 --> 00:18:12.326
- Did I do good?
- Yeah, you did.

276
00:18:13.617 --> 00:18:16.398
I've always been good
at repaying people for feeding me.

277
00:18:16.398 --> 00:18:18.394
And you're still acting like
you're amazing, as always, I see.

278
00:18:18.394 --> 00:18:20.151
Surely by now you can
just say that I'm amazing

279
00:18:20.151 --> 00:18:21.507
instead of saying that I'm acting.

280
00:18:21.507 --> 00:18:22.608
No.

281
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.068
- I'm going home!
- No, you can't!

282
00:18:25.446 --> 00:18:26.995
I'm going to go home!

283
00:18:29.146 --> 00:18:30.980
I rode my bike here.

284
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.780
I'll bring it over to you
tomorrow. Let's just walk.

285
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.155
All right.

286
00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:37.334
Want to hold hands?

287
00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:03.341
Hello.

288
00:19:03.341 --> 00:19:04.725
Oh, hey.

289
00:19:04.725 --> 00:19:06.423
CEO Park is waiting for you.

290
00:19:19.328 --> 00:19:20.870
It's been a while.

291
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.735
No news is still news.

292
00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:26.979
But I'm here to see you again
because I need a favor.

293
00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:29.041
What is it?

294
00:19:29.857 --> 00:19:32.345
I have nobody I can rely on
but you, CEO Park.

295
00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:34.898
My Jung Seon is going
through a rough time.

296
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.715
He's so innocent that
he can't understand his mother.

297
00:19:37.715 --> 00:19:40.270
Sometimes, being family
makes things easier

298
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.780
but sometimes it
makes things harder.

299
00:19:42.918 --> 00:19:44.482
It's so difficult to understand.

300
00:19:44.482 --> 00:19:46.615
I know that I've messed up.

301
00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:51.425
But I can't help that things
keep going wrong.

302
00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:55.761
I told you that I used
some of his inheritance

303
00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:59.403
because I got involved in
some money trouble, right?

304
00:20:00.022 --> 00:20:02.915
And you told me that Jung Seon
took your economic freedom, too.

305
00:20:02.915 --> 00:20:06.790
Exactly! He was a force to be
reckoned with, even as a kid!

306
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.463
He has all this money, but I never see
it again once he gets his hands on it.

307
00:20:09.463 --> 00:20:12.787
I'm sure he'll help me if I get in
trouble, though, since I'm his mom.

308
00:20:14.482 --> 00:20:16.156
How much do you need, exactly?

309
00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:20.916
Well, the thing is...

310
00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:24.084
old habits really are
hard to break.

311
00:20:24.084 --> 00:20:25.683
I can't stop spending so much.

312
00:20:26.132 --> 00:20:27.780
I'll pay you back.

313
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.863
Everything will be solved

314
00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:31.519
as soon as Professor Min
sells just one expensive painting.

315
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.723
Come on in!

316
00:20:37.511 --> 00:20:38.952
Oh, you're here too, Kyung?

317
00:20:38.952 --> 00:20:40.011
Yes!

318
00:20:40.011 --> 00:20:42.337
- Welcome!
- Hello!

319
00:20:42.337 --> 00:20:43.422
Hey.

320
00:20:43.422 --> 00:20:45.338
Are you sure we're not getting
in the way of your work?

321
00:20:45.338 --> 00:20:46.769
But still, they need to eat.

322
00:20:46.769 --> 00:20:48.414
Yeah, we need to eat.

323
00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:50.879
Unfortunately, we don't have
much food here, though.

324
00:20:50.879 --> 00:20:53.389
You think we'd tell you
to give us food?

325
00:20:53.389 --> 00:20:54.925
We came to buy you food, of course!

326
00:20:54.925 --> 00:20:56.512
- Right, Honey?
- Yay!

327
00:20:56.512 --> 00:20:58.848
Yeah, of course!

328
00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:01.292
Where do you want to go?

329
00:21:01.292 --> 00:21:03.921
Oh, do you want to go to that place
that was closed last time?

330
00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:05.800
They're probably open today, right?

331
00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:08.472
And where is that, exactly?

332
00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:21.348
<i>[Lee Hyun Soo]</i>

333
00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:23.716
Hello?

334
00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:25.037
What are you up to?

335
00:21:25.037 --> 00:21:26.951
Getting some ingredients.

336
00:21:27.896 --> 00:21:30.434
I'm thinking about coming to
Good Soup for lunch.

337
00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:33.019
All right.
Who are you coming with?

338
00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:34.300
Or are you coming alone?

339
00:21:35.011 --> 00:21:36.870
My mom, my dad, and Kyung.

340
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.291
What?

341
00:21:40.434 --> 00:21:44.069
Um... oh. So a reservation
for four, then, right?

342
00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:46.225
I've already made the reservation.

343
00:21:46.225 --> 00:21:50.550
Do you want to introduce yourself
to my parents, Mr. Jung Seon?

344
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.291
If that's too much, we'll just
eat and leave.

345
00:21:55.291 --> 00:21:56.541
I want to introduce myself.

346
00:21:58.328 --> 00:22:00.176
Okay.
See you later!

347
00:22:16.772 --> 00:22:18.780
- You're here, Ma'am?
- Hey.

348
00:22:19.206 --> 00:22:20.759
You get more and more beautiful
every time I see you.

349
00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:23.311
Those types of greetings
are inappropriate.

350
00:22:23.311 --> 00:22:24.955
- They are?
- They are.

351
00:22:24.955 --> 00:22:26.279
Right?

352
00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:27.578
I'll show you to your seats.

353
00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:30.369
Why are you changing the subject?
Is it because you're uncomfortable?

354
00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:32.536
Yes, a bit.

355
00:22:32.536 --> 00:22:34.876
I don't want Professor Min
to feel insulted.

356
00:22:34.876 --> 00:22:37.040
See? This means that
she doesn't want to hear such things.

357
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.177
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

358
00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:47.838
You don't have any
customers today, either?

359
00:22:47.838 --> 00:22:49.426
We have one reservation.

360
00:22:51.115 --> 00:22:53.107
So we're finally getting
to try this place!

361
00:22:53.107 --> 00:22:57.792
Who cares about the food right now,
when Hyun Soo's boyfriend is the chef?

362
00:22:57.792 --> 00:22:59.366
I'm just so happy!

363
00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:01.393
Chef Ohn is really amazing!

364
00:23:01.393 --> 00:23:04.788
He's handsome, cool, and sweet!

365
00:23:04.788 --> 00:23:06.864
Oh Kyung, you're just so honest.

366
00:23:06.864 --> 00:23:09.415
Oh goodness, look at these two!

367
00:23:10.117 --> 00:23:12.209
Ah, what a load off my shoulders.

368
00:23:12.209 --> 00:23:13.907
- All right, let's go in.
- Okay.

369
00:23:13.907 --> 00:23:15.158
- Let's go.
- All right.

370
00:23:15.158 --> 00:23:16.158
All right.

371
00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:23.762
Hello, Writer Lee.

372
00:23:23.762 --> 00:23:25.748
These are my parents.

373
00:23:27.658 --> 00:23:30.157
Excuse me, where's the bathroom?

374
00:23:30.157 --> 00:23:32.826
Oh, it's that way.
Allow me to escort you.

375
00:23:32.826 --> 00:23:35.081
I'll escort her, since I
know this place pretty well.

376
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:36.276
This way, Mom.

377
00:23:36.276 --> 00:23:37.495
- Go on!
- Yeah.

378
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.530
My parents are here.

379
00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:06.166
Let's go downstairs.

380
00:24:06.482 --> 00:24:09.868
Later! My mom
went to the bathroom.

381
00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:37.921
Why are you stealing glances at me?
Feel free to just stare instead.

382
00:24:39.386 --> 00:24:40.882
I'm sorry.

383
00:25:01.443 --> 00:25:02.646
Here you go.

384
00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:07.493
I think Hyun Soo went to
go get her boyfriend.

385
00:25:07.493 --> 00:25:08.729
Oh.

386
00:25:08.729 --> 00:25:10.581
What's so funny?

387
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:12.998
Don't use your phone so much.
You'll ruin your eyesight.

388
00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:17.978
Looks like you're really
getting old now, Honey.

389
00:25:17.978 --> 00:25:20.482
Yeah, maybe I should get Lasik, like you.

390
00:25:20.482 --> 00:25:23.272
I was able to get Lasik
because I have good eyes

391
00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:24.875
but that's not the case for you, Honey!

392
00:25:24.875 --> 00:25:27.562
Well, yeah. People say
that I have a baby face

393
00:25:27.562 --> 00:25:29.367
but you're the one
who really looks young.

394
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:31.682
What do you want to eat?

395
00:25:31.682 --> 00:25:34.010
They only have one set menu.

396
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.538
Oh yeah.

397
00:25:38.394 --> 00:25:40.049
- Honey.
- Yeah?

398
00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:42.447
Don't those people seem
a bit weird to you?

399
00:25:42.447 --> 00:25:43.719
Who?

400
00:25:43.719 --> 00:25:46.126
- What? What is it?
- Look.

401
00:25:47.386 --> 00:25:48.578
Don't stare!

402
00:25:51.376 --> 00:25:53.577
They don't look like
they're married, right, Kyung?

403
00:25:53.577 --> 00:25:56.662
Yes. They don't look like average folks.

404
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.936
But they do seem like lovers.

405
00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:04.292
I bet that there's a huge age
difference between them.

406
00:26:08.453 --> 00:26:10.306
Ugh, seriously?

407
00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:12.430
She's been stealing glances
at me since I saw her in the bathroom.

408
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:13.513
How annoying.

409
00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:15.454
Who?

410
00:26:18.926 --> 00:26:20.290
She's not looking at me anymore.

411
00:26:23.009 --> 00:26:25.104
I guess it's a family lunch.

412
00:26:25.104 --> 00:26:27.011
We do stand out compared to other people.

413
00:26:27.011 --> 00:26:28.942
Don't take it so personally.

414
00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:32.426
You're so reliable at
times like these, Honey.

415
00:26:37.827 --> 00:26:39.771
Why isn't Hyun Soo coming?

416
00:26:58.651 --> 00:26:59.961
Ugh.

417
00:27:06.386 --> 00:27:07.655
Shall we head downstairs now?

418
00:27:08.985 --> 00:27:10.049
Shall we?

419
00:27:12.492 --> 00:27:13.798
Are you nervous?

420
00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.417
A little.

421
00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:19.050
I'll do my best, so that
your parents like me.

422
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.955
You don't need to do anything.

423
00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:23.061
They'll probably like you even if
all you do is stand still.

424
00:27:23.061 --> 00:27:24.931
Because you're handsome.

425
00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:26.983
Okay.

426
00:27:50.584 --> 00:27:51.654
Oh, Honey!

427
00:27:52.223 --> 00:27:53.367
Hey!

428
00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:57.791
Hyun Soo!
