Ms. Kim.

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:21.234
What brings you here all of a sudden?

7
00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:22.563
I don't see Nurse Kim around.

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:30.343
Honey.

What brings you here all of a sudden?

10
00:00:32.513 --> 00:00:33.784
Hello, Ms. Kim.

11
00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:34.943
You may leave.

12
00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:36.183
Oh, right.

13
00:00:36.183 --> 00:00:38.214
Can you bring some hydrangea tea, my wife's favourite?

14
00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:39.314
Of course.

15
00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:43.553
I'm so glad you're here.

16
00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:46.494
I've had such a tough day.

17
00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.494
We must've communicated telepathically.

18
00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:50.894
What?

19
00:00:51.263 --> 00:00:52.693
Oh, really?

20
00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:53.863
Of course.

21
00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.034
I was having such a tough day that I really wanted to see you.

22
00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:58.674
How did you know?

23
00:00:59.973 --> 00:01:01.674
I'm glad I'm here.

24
00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:04.274
I missed you so much, honey.

25
00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:13.354
You should stay longer.

26
00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:16.324
No, get back to work.

27
00:01:16.554 --> 00:01:17.793
Okay, then. Bye.

Once you feel confident that the person is completely fooled,

30
00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:25.334
it is most likely...

31
00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:27.964
that the person is deeply in love with you.

32
00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:45.114
Can you bring some hydrangea tea, my wife's favourite?

33
00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:46.513
Of course.

34
00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:49.983
I missed you so much, honey.

35
00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:55.194
They didn't get fooled because they couldn't see the truth,

36
00:01:55.494 --> 00:01:56.964
it might be that...

37
00:01:57.093 --> 00:01:59.364
they refused to see it because they're in love with you.

Darn it, we might grow fond of each other.

I'm her...

00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:29.583
friend.

57
00:04:29.744 --> 00:04:30.884
Yes, we're friends.

Who are you?

59
00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:37.294
You aren't my friend.

60
00:04:38.093 --> 00:04:39.353
Move aside.

61
00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:40.694
I have to get changed.

62
00:04:40.893 --> 00:04:41.963
What?

63
00:04:42.263 --> 00:04:43.564
You have to get changed?

65
00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:49.304
Are you insane?

66

00:04:53.134 --> 00:04:55.403
Nam Gil, you should step outside too.

68
00:04:56.044 --> 00:04:57.713
You're both distracting me.

69
00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:06.853
She's gone insane. She's completely crazy.

70
00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:09.824
Does she really think she's still 20 or something?

71
00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:11.153
Hey.

72
00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:18.763
Hey?

73
00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:22.033
Did you just say, "Hey" to me?

74
00:05:23.064 --> 00:05:25.574
Jin Joo, you heard him.

75
00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:28.944
This little kid whose dog tag is still shiny...

76
00:05:29.103 --> 00:05:30.114
just said,

77
00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:31.973
"Hey" to me. "Hey."

78
00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:37.283
Wow, Ban Do, you really learned to control your temper.

Aren't you a freshman?

80
00:05:40.684 --> 00:05:41.783
Did it take you five tries to get into college?

81
00:05:42.824 --> 00:05:44.093
That's not the case.

82
00:05:44.593 --> 00:05:45.593
But...

83
00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:48.663
I pooped at least 10 million times more than you did.

84
00:05:49.794 --> 00:05:51.564
You're gross.

85
00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:53.463
Goodness.

86
00:05:54.234 --> 00:05:56.333
Forget about him, and take this.

87
00:05:57.304 --> 00:06:00.244
Put it back in your car so that your sister doesn't notice.

88
00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:01.874
The price tags were still on them too.

89
00:06:02.044 --> 00:06:04.213
He doesn't have a sister.

90
00:06:04.314 --> 00:06:05.314
Hey.

91
00:06:05.314 --> 00:06:08.244
What kind of a brother carries his sister's clothes in his car?

92
00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:11.653
He bought it to give it to a girl.

93
00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:13.684
You're right.

94
00:06:17.824 --> 00:06:18.953
I bought it for you.

95
00:06:20.124 --> 00:06:21.163
What?

96
00:06:22.393 --> 00:06:23.434
Me?

97
00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:25.533
Yes.

98
00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:41.314
I hope you like it. Bye.

99
00:06:58.864 --> 00:06:59.963
What was that face?

100
00:07:00.434 --> 00:07:01.763
Did he just laugh at me?

101
00:07:03.134 --> 00:07:04.874
That little idiot...

102
00:07:06.304 --> 00:07:08.703
- Hey. - What?

103
00:07:08.843 --> 00:07:10.574
You're much smaller than he is.

104
00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:12.044
Don't you look in a mirror?

105
00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:15.013
Fine.

106
00:07:15.114 --> 00:07:17.653
You must be really happy to begin a new life with...

107
00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:18.754
such a tall and handsome guy.

108
00:07:30.864 --> 00:07:31.893
Hey...

109
00:07:43.874 --> 00:07:45.013
Hey, little one.

110
00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:47.413
Why do you still cry even as you eat expensive food?

111
00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:51.913
I got you the most expensive one.

112
00:07:57.653 --> 00:07:58.754
You have to stop crying now.

113
00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:09.603
Darn it, Choi Ban Do. That jerk. That horrible jerk.

114
00:08:16.343 --> 00:08:19.273
Choi Ban Do. That jerk. That horrible jerk.

115
00:08:19.273 --> 00:08:21.013
I'll do away with him!

116
00:08:21.283 --> 00:08:23.583
She does have a bad drinking habit.

117
00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.384
She talks behind people's back.

118
00:08:27.484 --> 00:08:29.184
Sul, you should stop.

119
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.393
Bo Reum.

120
00:08:31.453 --> 00:08:35.694
I can't stop myself from drinking.

121
00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:37.034
Why?

122
00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:38.363
Because I feel...

123
00:08:39.233 --> 00:08:40.603
so bad for Jin Joo.

124
00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:45.973
You have great taste.

125
00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:50.574
Oh, this?

126
00:08:51.613 --> 00:08:52.674
You know your fashion.

127
00:08:53.314 --> 00:08:54.583
This is leather from Italy.

128
00:08:55.213 --> 00:08:57.883
There are only a few of these in Korea.

129
00:08:58.483 --> 00:09:00.883
Most women never notice.

130
00:09:01.353 --> 00:09:03.024
I'm not most women.

131
00:09:03.493 --> 00:09:05.253
I probably know more things about male fashion than you.

132
00:09:06.123 --> 00:09:08.794
Oh, so you are keen about that. You must date a lot of men.

133
00:09:09.223 --> 00:09:10.394
You're pretty rich, aren't you?

134
00:09:13.394 --> 00:09:14.503
Can you tell?

135
00:09:14.733 --> 00:09:16.304
I try to hide that I'm rich,

136
00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:17.373
but does it show?

137
00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:19.733
Goodness, I knew I shouldn't have complimented you.

138
00:09:22.174 --> 00:09:23.274
What is this?

139
00:09:23.274 --> 00:09:24.713
Where is it?

140
00:09:24.973 --> 00:09:27.883
My food... Where's my food?

141
00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:30.353
Everything is in your stomach.

142
00:09:31.284 --> 00:09:32.914
Did... Did I eat it all?

143
00:09:34.184 --> 00:09:35.184
Really?

144
00:09:35.184 --> 00:09:36.353
Goodness.

145
00:09:37.024 --> 00:09:40.093
Anyway, did Jae Woo run away? Where on earth is he?

146
00:09:49.904 --> 00:09:52.804
Why are you going out with Jae Woo?

147
00:09:53.133 --> 00:09:54.243
Because he's easy.

148
00:09:55.544 --> 00:09:57.544
Jae Woo is easy.

149
00:10:01.944 --> 00:10:04.983
Are you crying because of love?

150

It's a solution for you who's crying and laughing over love.

151

"He's not that into you." He is...

Lee Sang Min is here today. Hello.

155
00:10:16.794 --> 00:10:18.233
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Lee Sang Min.

156
00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:20.233
- It's mid-May. - Yes.

157
00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:21.833
But you're wearing a fur coat.

158
00:10:21.963 --> 00:10:24.473
It's because I follow the East Coast fashion.

159
00:10:24.473 --> 00:10:26.103
- Where? - The east side.

160
00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:27.174
East side, I see.

161
00:10:27.174 --> 00:10:28.274
It looks really warm.

162
00:10:28.274 --> 00:10:31.213
Love makes you worry whether you're in love or not.

Hello?

00:10:35.444 --> 00:10:39.113
Hi. I'm Tinkerbell from Seoul.

166
00:10:39.314 --> 00:10:42.684
You're a fairy. Hello, Tinkerbell.

167
00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.353
Please tell us your problem.

168

169
00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:50.833
loves physical affection.

they kiss me,

172
00:10:56.264 --> 00:10:57.434
touch me,

173
00:10:57.434 --> 00:10:59.274
and kiss me again.

174
00:10:59.873 --> 00:11:03.613
Sometimes I wonder if that's why they're dating me.

175
00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:07.743
You kiss someone when you like the person.

176
00:11:07.743 --> 00:11:10.483
But does your partner touch a certain body part?

177
00:11:10.483 --> 00:11:12.083
That's very important.

178
00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:15.424
They usually touches my butt.

179
00:11:16.383 --> 00:11:17.453
Your butt?

180
00:11:17.753 --> 00:11:20.463
That's quite serious.

181
00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:21.993
They touch your butt.

182
00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:24.894
Why don't you have a talk with your partner?

183
00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:26.963
I'm sure this person's not dating you for that reason.

184
00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:28.564
I already asked.

185
00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:31.733
My partner said that they're dating me because I'm easy.

186
00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:38.713
- Gosh. - How can one say that to your face?

187
00:11:38.713 --> 00:11:42.113
Well, they didn't say it to my face.

188
00:11:42.113 --> 00:11:45.713
So to summarize, your partner...

189
00:11:45.713 --> 00:11:47.883
touches your butt every day.

190
00:11:47.883 --> 00:11:51.054
And the reason they're dating you is because you're easy. Right?

191
00:11:51.054 --> 00:11:52.093
Yes.

192
00:11:52.353 --> 00:11:54.924
This is really serious.

193
00:11:54.924 --> 00:11:57.564
I think you should break up right away.

194
00:11:57.564 --> 00:12:00.833
Well... I... I don't think that's right.

195
00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:03.674
The world is a dangerous place. He's a bad guy.

196
00:12:03.674 --> 00:12:04.904
How can he say you're easy?

197
00:12:04.904 --> 00:12:06.233
He's so backward.

198
00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:08.044
You might think he's charming now,

199
00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:10.144
but it's going to cause a bigger heartache later on.

200
00:12:10.343 --> 00:12:11.473
Yes.

201
00:12:15.544 --> 00:12:17.713
Does he like to drink?

202
00:12:18.983 --> 00:12:20.623
How did you know?

203
00:12:20.623 --> 00:12:22.824
They're like that. People like that...

204
00:12:22.824 --> 00:12:24.593
I mean...

205
00:12:24.593 --> 00:12:27.394
They love women and stuff.

206
00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:30.394
He's right. He's probably seeing multiple women.

207
00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:33.564
Tinkerbell, you might be one of them.

208
00:12:33.904 --> 00:12:35.963
No way.

209
00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:37.534
I'm an expert in that area.

210
00:12:37.534 --> 00:12:39.333
Just trust me, and break up with him.

211
00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:41.044
Good luck, Ms. Tinkerbell.

212
00:12:42.843 --> 00:12:43.973
What?

213
00:12:44.243 --> 00:12:45.373
I'm a man.

214
00:12:45.444 --> 00:12:47.784
Hello?

215
00:12:52.213 --> 00:12:55.383
How can a person say such a thing so blatantly?

216
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.483
Gosh.

217
00:12:56.483 --> 00:12:58.394
Hwi Jae, you should worry about yourself.

218
00:12:58.394 --> 00:13:00.463
At this rate, you'll end up alone.

219
00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:01.924
You should get married and have kids already.

220
00:13:01.924 --> 00:13:03.434
You aren't Superman, you know.

221
00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:05.733
I bet I'll get married before you do.

222
00:13:05.733 --> 00:13:07.034
- Before I do? - Of course.

223
00:13:07.034 --> 00:13:09.264
- Do you want to bet? - Sure!

224
00:13:09.264 --> 00:13:11.804
But if you get a divorce, that doesn't count.

225
00:13:13.203 --> 00:13:14.973
- I think it should count. - Why?

226
00:13:14.973 --> 00:13:17.274
You never know what will happen after getting married.

227
00:13:17.274 --> 00:13:18.613
The start is important.

228
00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:20.243
Conclusion isn't important.

229
00:13:20.243 --> 00:13:21.713
You say it like you're already divorced.

230
00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:24.883
All right. Anyway, Tinkerbell...

231
00:13:25.213 --> 00:13:27.784
shouldn't date someone like that.

232
00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:34.164
(My favourite)

233
00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:36.564
Hi.

234
00:13:37.493 --> 00:13:38.493
Next week?

235
00:13:39.863 --> 00:13:40.904
Okay. Let's meet up.

236
00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:51.014
Hi, I'm Park Hyun Seok. We met at the night club.

237
00:13:51.544 --> 00:13:52.674
Do you have time today?

238
00:13:56.983 --> 00:13:58.154
(Park Hyun Seok)

239
00:13:58.453 --> 00:13:59.453
See you again.

240
00:13:59.453 --> 00:14:01.284
You must be excited...

241
00:14:01.284 --> 00:14:03.284
that a guy gave you a number,

242
00:14:03.284 --> 00:14:05.993
but that jerk, Doctor Park, is just toying with you.

243
00:14:05.993 --> 00:14:07.223
She's mine.

244
00:14:07.223 --> 00:14:08.424
Don't lay your eyes on her.

245
00:14:08.424 --> 00:14:10.233
I'll give her to you when I get bored with her.

246
00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:11.233
Just wait.

247
00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:24.473
Other people enter competition maybe once a year.

248
00:14:24.473 --> 00:14:26.983
But I already did three this year, Mom.

249
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:29.144
I can have a slump too.

250
00:14:29.144 --> 00:14:31.654
How can I only think about ballet without any break?

251
00:14:31.983 --> 00:14:33.753
This is hard for me too!

252
00:14:39.294 --> 00:14:40.623
Gosh.

253
00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:42.824
Life is hard...

254
00:14:42.824 --> 00:14:44.833
for both kids and adults.

255
00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:47.564
Isn't it?

256
00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:48.963
Did you hear?

257
00:14:52.203 --> 00:14:53.574
Just run away.

258
00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:56.674
"I'll be gone with the wind."

259
00:14:56.914 --> 00:14:59.174
Run away from home. What do you think?

260
00:14:59.174 --> 00:15:01.044
What? I'm not in high school.

261
00:15:01.044 --> 00:15:02.843
Why would I run away like a kid?

262
00:15:02.843 --> 00:15:03.953
You are a kid.

263
00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.383
You're at an age to hit a growth spurt.

264
00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:07.623
Goodness.

265
00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:12.154
Now you're smiling.

266
00:15:12.824 --> 00:15:14.764
I said it to make you laugh.

267
00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:16.093
All right.

268
00:15:16.363 --> 00:15:17.863
Thanks for making me laugh.

269
00:15:19.363 --> 00:15:20.363
Excuse me for a second.

270
00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:22.463
Hello?

271
00:15:22.804 --> 00:15:24.003
Where are you?

272
00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.434
Jin Joo?

273
00:15:28.774 --> 00:15:30.213
Where are you?

274
00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:33.444
Who is this Park Hyun Seok?

275
00:15:34.514 --> 00:15:36.144
Did he do something to you?

276
00:15:36.444 --> 00:15:37.453
Where are you?

277
00:15:37.453 --> 00:15:38.953
Stay there. I'll be right over.

278
00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:42.453
Something urgent came up.

279
00:15:42.453 --> 00:15:43.554
I have to go.

280
00:15:43.723 --> 00:15:45.593
What? Okay.

281
00:15:46.253 --> 00:15:47.264
Where are you?

282
00:15:52.363 --> 00:15:53.863
Are you really not going?

283
00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:56.934
- What? - "Medical Student's Night".

284
00:15:56.934 --> 00:15:59.833
That's when people introduce their girlfriends.

285
00:16:00.144 --> 00:16:01.843
You never attend it.

286
00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:03.044
I should study.

287
00:16:03.174 --> 00:16:05.544
I don't care about showing off.

288
00:16:06.044 --> 00:16:07.383
I want to graduate quickly...

289
00:16:07.684 --> 00:16:09.644
and stand before your family.

290
00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:12.983
How can I take you there?

291
00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:14.284
Don't you look at yourself in the mirror?

292
00:16:14.284 --> 00:16:16.483
Don't worry about my family.

293
00:16:16.723 --> 00:16:18.123
What matters is that I like you.

294
00:16:18.223 --> 00:16:20.493
My dad doesn't need a son-in-law that's a doctor.

295
00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:22.863
I need your dad.

296
00:16:22.863 --> 00:16:26.034
I'll ask Dad to buy me another car.

297
00:16:26.463 --> 00:16:27.534
Because...

298
00:16:27.534 --> 00:16:29.833
it's hard for you to commute without a car.

299
00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:31.203
Don't do that.

300
00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:33.873
I already feel bad that you're paying my rent.

301
00:16:34.003 --> 00:16:36.503
I can't date you if you keep doing that.

302
00:16:37.144 --> 00:16:39.314
I'm not dating you for a car.

303
00:16:41.113 --> 00:16:42.843
A car isn't enough.

304
00:16:44.684 --> 00:16:46.824
You're too nice.

305
00:16:54.463 --> 00:16:56.123
That scumbag.

306
00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:02.833
So he seduced and married a rich girl,

307
00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:03.934
got a hospital,

308
00:17:03.934 --> 00:17:05.103
and then he slept around...

309
00:17:05.103 --> 00:17:06.943
and cheated on her?

310
00:17:07.004 --> 00:17:08.774
Slept around...

311
00:17:09.943 --> 00:17:12.544
Hey, watch your language.

312
00:17:12.544 --> 00:17:14.014
I didn't say anything wrong.

313
00:17:14.214 --> 00:17:17.113
Anyway, his wife is now his girlfriend.

314
00:17:17.113 --> 00:17:18.683
Then why did he approach me?

315
00:17:18.754 --> 00:17:20.484
I'll give her to you when I get bored with her.

316
00:17:20.484 --> 00:17:21.524
Just wait.

317
00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:22.984
Am I the second girlfriend?

318
00:17:22.984 --> 00:17:24.193
Did you think you were the first then?

319
00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:27.123
I'm sure he hit on a ton of girls.

320
00:17:27.123 --> 00:17:29.593
That's why I told you not to get involved with him.

321
00:17:29.593 --> 00:17:32.264
How do you know him so well?

322
00:17:32.264 --> 00:17:34.534
You were just a salesperson, and he was just a doctor.

323
00:17:35.064 --> 00:17:37.873
What? Well... You know...

324
00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:39.274
Were you...

325
00:17:39.734 --> 00:17:41.204
his underling?

326
00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:43.873
Underling?

327
00:17:44.044 --> 00:17:46.143
That's harsh. Underling?

328
00:17:46.143 --> 00:17:47.913
Sales is like that.

329
00:17:47.913 --> 00:17:49.984
You help your client...

330
00:17:49.984 --> 00:17:51.984
and take care of his mistress...

331
00:17:57.193 --> 00:17:59.294
You've done too much.

332
00:18:01.193 --> 00:18:02.393
Too much.

333
00:18:13.373 --> 00:18:14.474
Have you eaten?

334
00:18:15.403 --> 00:18:17.974
- No. - You haven't eaten anything yet?

335
00:18:17.974 --> 00:18:19.274
I was busy.

336
00:18:22.044 --> 00:18:23.044
Yes, sir.

337
00:18:24.113 --> 00:18:25.913
Tomorrow morning? Three boxes?

338
00:18:26.353 --> 00:18:28.423
Yes, sir. Good night!

339
00:18:33.123 --> 00:18:34.423
What?

340
00:18:41.603 --> 00:18:43.833
How much did I drink last night?

341
00:18:46.304 --> 00:18:48.943
That punk.

342
00:18:49.574 --> 00:18:51.373
Hey.

343
00:18:51.514 --> 00:18:53.443
Hey. You...

344
00:18:53.744 --> 00:18:56.214
left me with those two scary women...

345
00:18:56.214 --> 00:18:58.984
and ran away.

346
00:18:58.984 --> 00:19:00.423
Get up!

347
00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:03.083
Get up!

348
00:19:05.393 --> 00:19:06.593
Face me.

349
00:19:07.423 --> 00:19:08.724
What the!

350
00:19:09.324 --> 00:19:11.794
Is he a Jiangshi or something?

351
00:19:30.353 --> 00:19:32.413
Snacks.

352
00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:46.433
I'll cut it up and eat it.

353
00:19:51.074 --> 00:19:53.704
This beef jerky just won't do.

354
00:19:55.774 --> 00:19:57.514
Chun Sul!

355
00:20:03.214 --> 00:20:05.284
What is this? Is this a glove?

356
00:20:06.383 --> 00:20:08.324
Oh, my. Who did this?

357
00:20:08.683 --> 00:20:09.724
Who?

358
00:20:10.054 --> 00:20:11.254
Don't you remember?

359
00:20:11.653 --> 00:20:13.964
She says she doesn't remember.

360
00:20:14.824 --> 00:20:17.064
Where should I go to complain about this now?

361
00:20:17.794 --> 00:20:19.833
Gosh, yesterday...

362
00:20:22.464 --> 00:20:25.234
Yes, you were drunk yesterday, and you...

363
00:20:29.704 --> 00:20:31.014
Sul,

364
00:20:31.913 --> 00:20:34.183
I'm not here to blame you.

365
00:20:34.183 --> 00:20:35.314
But whenever you drink, you...

366
00:20:35.643 --> 00:20:37.353
Yes, you must have a drinking habit.

367
00:20:37.353 --> 00:20:39.214
I heard you can fix that.

368
00:20:40.653 --> 00:20:41.653
Good luck.

369
00:20:41.784 --> 00:20:43.554
What? Where are you going? Hey!

370
00:20:43.554 --> 00:20:45.353
Hey! Hey!

371
00:20:46.353 --> 00:20:48.163
You did this when you were drunk!

372
00:20:50.593 --> 00:20:52.034
She knows. She definitely knows.

373
00:20:53.234 --> 00:20:54.903
She knows, but she's acting again.

374
00:20:54.903 --> 00:20:56.433
I'm the fool for falling for it.

375
00:20:58.373 --> 00:20:59.704
(Women's Dormitory)

376
00:21:01.403 --> 00:21:03.074
Gosh, you're out of your mind.

377
00:21:04.913 --> 00:21:06.544
It must be really expensive.

378
00:21:18.454 --> 00:21:19.794
I'm sorry, Go Dok Jae.

379
00:21:20.524 --> 00:21:22.193
I'll repay you later.

380
00:21:25.093 --> 00:21:26.264
You're going to get...

381
00:21:26.804 --> 00:21:27.833
revenge on him?

382
00:21:28.234 --> 00:21:29.333
Is it because of me?

383
00:21:30.133 --> 00:21:31.333
You don't need to.

384
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:32.704
I had my revenge on him already.

385
00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:35.673
And I may have taken revenge...

386
00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.643
for you too.

387
00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:39.244
What did you do?

388
00:21:41.613 --> 00:21:42.784
Gosh, I'm sorry.

389
00:21:42.913 --> 00:21:44.083
You can have this.

390
00:21:52.423 --> 00:21:53.494
Oh, my.

391
00:21:53.564 --> 00:21:54.764
I thought you were my friend.

392
00:21:56.693 --> 00:21:58.663
That's so like you.

393
00:21:58.663 --> 00:21:59.863
These are so petty.

394
00:22:00.363 --> 00:22:02.103
You should get a proper revenge.

395
00:22:02.103 --> 00:22:04.734
You can just try not to get involved with him. You don't need to help.

396
00:22:05.034 --> 00:22:06.034
And...

397
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.244
every minute here as youth is so precious to me.

398
00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:09.903
We don't have time to waste on him.

399
00:22:10.143 --> 00:22:11.413
Don't you even feel angry?

400
00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:13.214
Don't you feel bad after how he treated you?

401
00:22:13.214 --> 00:22:14.413
Why are you acting like this?

402
00:22:14.413 --> 00:22:15.583
Are you doing this...

403
00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:18.653
because you're upset at how he treated me over the years?

404
00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:20.824
Am I right?

405
00:22:21.024 --> 00:22:22.484
That's why you want to get revenge, right?

406
00:22:22.683 --> 00:22:24.593
That's not the only reason.

407
00:22:25.923 --> 00:22:28.464
He's been using women for their money.

408
00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:31.133
He has also cheated and hurt women.

409
00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:32.264
And...

410
00:22:32.764 --> 00:22:34.204
he treated me like a mistress.

411
00:22:34.433 --> 00:22:35.504
I need to pay him back.

412
00:22:35.504 --> 00:22:37.734
All right. What do you want to do?

413
00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:41.274
You always teased me about watching trashy dramas, right?

414
00:22:41.704 --> 00:22:43.814
I'll show you what that's like in real life.

415
00:22:53.353 --> 00:22:55.383
Yes, see you this afternoon.

416
00:22:55.653 --> 00:22:57.724
If I want to take him down,

417
00:22:57.824 --> 00:22:59.153
I need to get close to him.

418
00:23:01.064 --> 00:23:02.294
You have something to do for me.

419
00:23:02.564 --> 00:23:04.333
Let's just not get involved with him.

420
00:23:05.333 --> 00:23:06.433
Okay?

421
00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:12.633
What should I do?

422
00:23:12.833 --> 00:23:15.373
I can't get close to him empty-handed.

423
00:23:15.443 --> 00:23:17.343
I need to bring him something that he might like.

424
00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:18.744
Something he might like?

425
00:23:19.974 --> 00:23:21.083
He likes money.

426
00:23:24.514 --> 00:23:26.383
Where are you taking me? Gosh, you're bothering me.

427
00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:29.923
- Did you hear the rumor? - What rumor?

428
00:23:30.824 --> 00:23:33.663
I heard that the granddaughter of Samsong Group goes to our school.

429
00:23:33.764 --> 00:23:34.863
Samsong Group?

430
00:23:35.193 --> 00:23:38.064
Don't lie to me. Why would she come here?

431
00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:39.964
It's true.

432
00:23:40.204 --> 00:23:42.633
I heard that she comes to school secretly so that she can learn...

433
00:23:42.633 --> 00:23:43.903
management for the company.

434
00:23:44.873 --> 00:23:46.433
Who is she? Do you know her?

435
00:23:47.304 --> 00:23:51.014
I heard from the student council that it's...

436
00:23:51.474 --> 00:23:53.173
Ma Jin Joo from history major.

437
00:23:55.183 --> 00:23:57.113
Ma Jin Joo in history major that I know?

438
00:23:58.714 --> 00:23:59.853
- Be quiet. - All right.

439
00:24:04.554 --> 00:24:06.593
Good job. He bought it.

440
00:24:07.163 --> 00:24:08.994
I'm going to get close to him now.

441
00:24:12.363 --> 00:24:14.204
I'm sorry I was late.

442
00:24:14.633 --> 00:24:16.064
You should have ordered first.

443
00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:18.373
No, it's all right.

444
00:24:18.873 --> 00:24:20.004
I'll take your orders.

445
00:24:21.403 --> 00:24:22.903
I'd like a cool lemonade.

446
00:24:23.044 --> 00:24:25.774
I'd like an espresso.

447
00:24:38.294 --> 00:24:39.454
It must taste bitter.

448
00:24:41.423 --> 00:24:44.163
I travel abroad a lot, so I've had this several times.

449
00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:47.504
You must travel abroad often.

450
00:24:48.504 --> 00:24:49.933
When I graduate,

451
00:24:50.103 --> 00:24:52.074
I'm going to travel abroad often.

452
00:24:52.204 --> 00:24:55.274
You'd go out to cheat, you scum.

453
00:24:56.544 --> 00:24:58.373
I wanted to call you sooner and meet,

454
00:24:58.643 --> 00:25:00.544
but I'm in medical school, which means I have a lot of assignments.

455
00:25:01.484 --> 00:25:02.843
If you're in medical school,

456
00:25:02.843 --> 00:25:05.183
don't you have the "Medical Student's Night?"

457
00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:07.784
Yes. How do you know about it?

458
00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:10.324
My friend's boyfriend is a medical student, and she was invited.

459
00:25:10.353 --> 00:25:12.294
She's been boasting nonstop.

460
00:25:16.994 --> 00:25:18.093
Do you want to go...

461
00:25:18.863 --> 00:25:19.994
with me?

462
00:25:20.133 --> 00:25:21.264
Really?

463
00:25:24.004 --> 00:25:25.103
No, it's fine.

464
00:25:25.974 --> 00:25:29.143
You have a girlfriend. I can't go there with you.

465
00:25:29.443 --> 00:25:31.113
I heard from friends...

466
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:33.613
that Kim Ye Rim is your girlfriend.

467
00:25:34.544 --> 00:25:36.714
What? Where did she hear that?

468
00:25:36.853 --> 00:25:38.014
Gosh.

469
00:25:38.383 --> 00:25:39.514
She's not my girlfriend.

470
00:25:39.514 --> 00:25:41.153
We used to date for a while,

471
00:25:42.284 --> 00:25:43.593
but she keeps following me around.

472
00:25:45.724 --> 00:25:47.863
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

473
00:25:48.093 --> 00:25:49.294
Anyhow,

474
00:25:49.294 --> 00:25:51.433
you haven't dealt with her completely.

475
00:25:51.534 --> 00:25:53.064
I couldn't go there with you.

476
00:25:53.393 --> 00:25:54.603
I will finish the relationship soon.

477
00:25:55.064 --> 00:25:56.304
I mean, it's already finished.

478
00:25:58.534 --> 00:25:59.633
Don't worry.

479
00:26:02.544 --> 00:26:03.913
Oh, my. Ma Jin Joo,

480
00:26:04.373 --> 00:26:06.514
you're going to make him dump her rich girlfriend by himself?

481
00:26:07.383 --> 00:26:08.643
He's going to dig his own grave.

482
00:26:09.183 --> 00:26:11.583
What did you just say?

483
00:26:12.314 --> 00:26:13.423
I...

484
00:26:15.754 --> 00:26:17.254
like you a lot.

485
00:26:18.623 --> 00:26:20.294
That's why you're a novice.

486
00:26:20.623 --> 00:26:22.564
He would've spent a lot of effort to get her.

487
00:26:22.564 --> 00:26:24.333
A smart man like him wouldn't just dump her right away.

488
00:26:24.464 --> 00:26:27.034
If someone has done something wrong, they tend to act nicer.

489
00:26:27.363 --> 00:26:28.833
He'll give him presents.

490
00:26:29.103 --> 00:26:31.804
We go for the big one.

491
00:26:31.804 --> 00:26:34.004
Are you going to go with him to the "Medical Student's Night"?

492
00:26:34.544 --> 00:26:37.074
What do you need to look for to find out about an affair?

493
00:26:38.074 --> 00:26:39.643
I know that one. He needs to get caught in the act.

494
00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:51.494
- Excuse me. - Yes?

495
00:26:52.494 --> 00:26:53.663
Have you seen Ahn Jae Woo?

496
00:26:54.064 --> 00:26:55.264
He didn't come here today.

497
00:26:56.794 --> 00:26:58.964
What's going on? He's not even answering my calls.

498
00:27:20.883 --> 00:27:21.923
Did you drop something?

499
00:27:21.923 --> 00:27:23.054
Money?

500
00:27:23.123 --> 00:27:24.193
Do you want me to help you find it?

501
00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:26.054
No.

502
00:27:33.363 --> 00:27:35.103
- Let's go. - Where?

503
00:27:35.534 --> 00:27:36.603
Let's have a drink.

504
00:27:36.603 --> 00:27:39.074
No, I don't feel like drinking. Wait!

505
00:27:39.974 --> 00:27:42.574
Should I ask her directly?

506
00:27:43.403 --> 00:27:44.443
Are you praying or something?

507
00:27:44.443 --> 00:27:46.014
What are you doing with head bowed down?

508
00:27:47.714 --> 00:27:48.913
Something must be bothering you.

509
00:27:49.613 --> 00:27:51.913
Tell me. I'll listen.

510
00:27:58.454 --> 00:27:59.454
I...

511
00:27:59.454 --> 00:28:00.524
Wait.

512
00:28:00.994 --> 00:28:02.163
I need to go to the bathroom.

513
00:28:02.363 --> 00:28:03.393
Just wait here.

514
00:28:13.103 --> 00:28:14.173
All right.

515
00:28:14.974 --> 00:28:16.544
Let's ask her directly.

516
00:28:17.714 --> 00:28:19.714
I won't know if I don't ask her directly.

We're going on a trip next month. You know that, right?

519
00:28:46.274 --> 00:28:48.443
She must be seeing a lot of men.

520
00:28:48.574 --> 00:28:50.574
You could just be one of them.

521
00:28:52.343 --> 00:28:53.373
She saved this man's number...

522

as number one.

523

I'm sorry.

00:29:17.903 --> 00:29:19.074

Hey.

00:29:24.074 --> 00:29:25.814
Am I the first to you?

533
00:29:26.314 --> 00:29:28.613
What are you talking about? What's going on?

534
00:29:31.314 --> 00:29:34.784
Is my number saved in the 200th?

Am I a maths question to you?

Why am I easy for you?

539
00:29:43.863 --> 00:29:44.994
I'm...

540
00:29:45.464 --> 00:29:47.034
really complicated!

541
00:29:58.943 --> 00:29:59.943
Right,

542
00:29:59.943 --> 00:30:03.014
let me know if something happens before we go on the trip, my baby.

What?

544
00:30:04.353 --> 00:30:05.583
Did he...

see this?

I'll stick next to him...

00:30:19.633 --> 00:30:21.163
and pretend like I'm his girlfriend.

549
00:30:21.163 --> 00:30:22.833
Bring her to the event.

550
00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:25.173
She can only end the relationship...

551
00:30:25.173 --> 00:30:26.633
after she sees his affair with her eyes.

552

Do you think you're Park Hyun Seok's wind screen?

Ms. Kim, that really hurts.

Excuse me, Ms. Kim.

Oh, are you Ms. Kim Ye Rim?

Yes?

Doctor Park...

561
00:30:58.403 --> 00:31:01.873
Hyun Seok asked me to bring you somewhere.

562
00:31:02.074 --> 00:31:03.544
Oh, really?

563
00:31:04.544 --> 00:31:06.143
Oh, wait.

564
00:31:06.143 --> 00:31:07.784
His phone is broken,

565
00:31:07.913 --> 00:31:09.343
so he asked me to bring you...

566
00:31:09.343 --> 00:31:11.014
to an event called "Medical Student's Night".

567
00:31:11.014 --> 00:31:12.014
Really?

568
00:31:12.883 --> 00:31:14.054
I thought he wasn't going.

569
00:31:14.054 --> 00:31:15.284
He suddenly had to...

570
00:31:15.284 --> 00:31:16.623
because his senior called him.

571
00:31:17.893 --> 00:31:18.994
Let's go.

It's been a while.

This is a huge event.

577
00:31:30.274 --> 00:31:33.004
All of the professors are here too.

578
00:31:33.504 --> 00:31:35.643
Oh, my.

579
00:31:35.643 --> 00:31:36.643
Are you amazed?

580
00:31:37.574 --> 00:31:38.943
Of course.

581
00:31:39.343 --> 00:31:41.613

00:31:46.653 --> 00:31:47.754
Shall we?

584
00:31:48.054 --> 00:31:49.484
Oh, wait.

585
00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:50.853
I have to talk to you.

586
00:31:51.324 --> 00:31:52.393
Pardon?

587
00:31:57.764 --> 00:31:58.964
Hey, wait.

588
00:31:58.964 --> 00:32:03.004
I hope you don't have a weak heart or any heart conditions.

589
00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:04.004
What?

590
00:32:05.074 --> 00:32:06.873
It's nothing. Let's go.

591
00:32:07.903 --> 00:32:09.943
Should I have gotten some medicine?

592
00:32:13.214 --> 00:32:15.544
Aren't we going inside?

593
00:32:19.984 --> 00:32:21.083
Do you want to go inside?

594
00:32:21.524 --> 00:32:22.524
Pardon?

595
00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:24.123
Of course.

596
00:32:24.254 --> 00:32:25.693
They'll be there soon.

597
00:32:26.224 --> 00:32:27.324
Who are you?

598
00:32:28.093 --> 00:32:29.623
Why do you keep approaching me?

599
00:32:30.994 --> 00:32:32.933
What are you saying?

600
00:32:33.764 --> 00:32:35.964
You called me first.

601
00:32:35.964 --> 00:32:37.173
At first, yes.

602
00:32:42.143 --> 00:32:43.373
By any chance,

603
00:32:44.173 --> 00:32:46.314
do you know the granddaughter of Samsong Group?

604
00:32:46.613 --> 00:32:48.314
I don't think they have a granddaughter.

605
00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:50.153
They only have grandsons.

606
00:32:50.153 --> 00:32:52.083
We went to the same kindergarten, so I know them.

607
00:32:54.224 --> 00:32:56.324
- Oh, really? - Why?

608
00:32:56.623 --> 00:32:57.853
Do you know them?

609
00:32:58.254 --> 00:32:59.254
What?

610
00:32:59.794 --> 00:33:00.964
Oh, no. Just because.

611
00:33:02.294 --> 00:33:03.393
I think someone...

612
00:33:04.034 --> 00:33:05.093
is messing around with me.

613
00:33:05.363 --> 00:33:06.363
Who?

614
00:33:06.534 --> 00:33:07.863
Who would dare to mess around with you?

615
00:33:11.704 --> 00:33:14.274
Samsong Group doesn't have any granddaughters.

616
00:33:14.343 --> 00:33:15.373
Are you a guy?

617
00:33:17.014 --> 00:33:18.244
Should I check?

618
00:33:18.244 --> 00:33:19.544
Samsong Group?

619
00:33:20.044 --> 00:33:22.343
Who said that I was their granddaughter?

620
00:33:22.383 --> 00:33:23.413
Your friend did.

621
00:33:25.413 --> 00:33:27.324
I recently fell into a pool...

622
00:33:27.324 --> 00:33:28.484
because he pushed me.

623
00:33:28.484 --> 00:33:30.853
Come to think about it,

624
00:33:31.324 --> 00:33:32.524
I remembered that...

625
00:33:35.193 --> 00:33:36.494
I talked about you right before.

626
00:33:38.794 --> 00:33:40.504
- What are you two doing? - Hey.

627
00:33:40.504 --> 00:33:42.603
You must be mistaken. That's not me.

628
00:33:43.163 --> 00:33:44.234
Come.

629
00:33:47.173 --> 00:33:48.744
What are you two doing?

630
00:33:49.474 --> 00:33:51.474
How did you know I was dating Kim Ye Rim?

631
00:33:54.183 --> 00:33:55.514
I don't look like the type,

632
00:33:55.643 --> 00:33:57.014
but I beat up women.

633
00:33:58.113 --> 00:34:00.153
- Who are you? - Park Hyun Seok!

634
00:34:03.183 --> 00:34:04.254
You...

635
00:34:05.893 --> 00:34:07.923
- What are you guys doing here? - My goodness.

636
00:34:10.994 --> 00:34:14.003
Do you want me to bring all of his girlfriends there?

637
00:34:14.463 --> 00:34:17.233
Yes, you said he has many women on the side.

638
00:34:17.304 --> 00:34:18.773
To let her walk in on him,

639
00:34:18.773 --> 00:34:20.943
we can't take any chance for him to get out of it.

640
00:34:20.943 --> 00:34:21.943
Hey.

641
00:34:30.684 --> 00:34:32.284
- I don't want to go. - Me either.

642
00:34:32.284 --> 00:34:33.883
- Do you have to go? - Yes.

643
00:34:33.983 --> 00:34:35.084
Okay, then.

644
00:34:35.084 --> 00:34:36.454
- Call me later. - Okay.

645
00:34:36.454 --> 00:34:37.523
Bye.

646
00:34:37.554 --> 00:34:39.023
- Go. - Okay.

647
00:34:43.664 --> 00:34:45.093
That jerk.

648
00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:49.764
You were hiding here.

649
00:34:49.764 --> 00:34:51.304
We've been looking everywhere for you.

650
00:34:51.304 --> 00:34:53.974
Darn it, you little rat.

651
00:34:53.974 --> 00:34:55.304
We need to talk.

652
00:34:57.014 --> 00:34:58.744
What's going on?

653
00:34:58.744 --> 00:35:00.943
- Goodness. - What's he doing?

654
00:35:00.943 --> 00:35:02.543
How dare you run away?

655
00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:04.184
How dare you three-time us...

656
00:35:04.184 --> 00:35:05.883
with that innocent face of yours?

657
00:35:05.883 --> 00:35:09.554
Gosh, medical students must have a lot of time.

658
00:35:09.554 --> 00:35:11.153
How can you date three women at once?

659
00:35:11.153 --> 00:35:14.193
When you were with us, you put on an innocent smile,

660
00:35:14.324 --> 00:35:16.193
but behind our back,

661
00:35:16.423 --> 00:35:17.894
you were seeing other women.

662
00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:19.633
No, it's a misunderstanding.

663
00:35:19.633 --> 00:35:21.503
Oh, a misunderstanding?

664
00:35:21.503 --> 00:35:23.834
All three witnesses are here. Is this a misunderstanding?

665
00:35:23.834 --> 00:35:24.974
- What's wrong? - What's with him?

666
00:35:24.974 --> 00:35:26.974
No, it's not the case.

667
00:35:26.974 --> 00:35:28.244
- No. - Really?

668
00:35:28.244 --> 00:35:30.173
- Why does he do that? - It's a misunderstanding.

669
00:35:30.173 --> 00:35:32.113
- Unbelievable. - What a jerk.

670
00:35:32.113 --> 00:35:33.443
It's not the case!

671
00:35:33.443 --> 00:35:35.113
Why does he live like that?

672
00:35:35.113 --> 00:35:36.684
- What a jerk. - Goodness.

673
00:35:36.684 --> 00:35:37.684
Ye Rim.

674
00:35:37.954 --> 00:35:39.684
- Is this true? - I can't believe him.

675
00:35:41.653 --> 00:35:42.923
He's a jerk.

676
00:35:43.494 --> 00:35:44.724
Nice timing.

677
00:35:45.753 --> 00:35:49.494
(A plan to take out Park Hyun Seok, the rat)

678
00:35:49.494 --> 00:35:50.994
(Rat, Park Hyun Seok, the victim, Kim Ye Rim)

679
00:35:50.994 --> 00:35:52.563
(Victim 1, victim, 2, victim 3)

680
00:35:52.563 --> 00:35:53.733
(Rat catcher, Ma Jin Joo)

681
00:35:53.733 --> 00:35:54.733
(Medical Student's Night)

682
00:35:57.334 --> 00:35:58.474
When I have him...

683
00:35:58.474 --> 00:36:00.874
completely trapped so that he can't run away,

684
00:36:00.874 --> 00:36:02.204
you need to let her see him at the scene.

685
00:36:02.204 --> 00:36:04.014
Wow, that's very detailed.

686
00:36:04.014 --> 00:36:07.713
Did you really plan all this based on the drama you've seen?

687
00:36:07.713 --> 00:36:09.483
Of course, soap operas are not a joke.

688
00:36:09.483 --> 00:36:11.354
It's probably much better than most private detectives.

689
00:36:13.483 --> 00:36:14.483
I agree.

690
00:36:17.494 --> 00:36:19.894
This is wrong. It's a misunderstanding.

691
00:36:19.894 --> 00:36:21.293
Was there another woman?

692
00:36:21.293 --> 00:36:22.494
Were you four-timing us?

693
00:36:22.494 --> 00:36:24.463
You have so many layers. Are you an onion?

694
00:36:24.463 --> 00:36:26.164
No, no. I mean it.

695
00:36:26.164 --> 00:36:27.563
It's not the case.

696
00:36:27.563 --> 00:36:30.374
Don't listen to them. I was only toying with them.

697
00:36:31.673 --> 00:36:33.804
You're the only one for me.

698
00:36:34.903 --> 00:36:36.304
You jerk.

699
00:36:36.574 --> 00:36:38.043
Ye Rim, come on.

700
00:36:42.414 --> 00:36:43.414
Who are you?

701
00:36:44.054 --> 00:36:45.054
Me?

702
00:36:49.954 --> 00:36:51.554
Did you two plan this?

703
00:36:52.324 --> 00:36:53.563
Who are you two?

704
00:36:54.664 --> 00:36:57.034
Me? I'm Ye Rim's boyfriend.

705
00:36:58.664 --> 00:37:02.164
Honey, is this him? The guy you were playing with.

706
00:37:02.164 --> 00:37:03.164
What?

707
00:37:03.534 --> 00:37:04.673
He's nothing much.

708
00:37:08.804 --> 00:37:09.804
Yes.

709
00:37:15.014 --> 00:37:16.014
Hey.

710
00:37:20.084 --> 00:37:21.653
I think you're mistaken.

711
00:37:21.653 --> 00:37:22.854
Don't hang out with people like him.

712
00:37:22.854 --> 00:37:25.423
They're after your money, you fool.

713
00:37:25.423 --> 00:37:27.124
You're rich.

714
00:37:27.124 --> 00:37:29.164
Why would he date you?

715
00:37:29.793 --> 00:37:31.394
That's you.

716
00:37:31.664 --> 00:37:33.063
Listen to yourself.

717
00:37:33.063 --> 00:37:34.363
You are so low.

718
00:37:36.063 --> 00:37:37.074
What?

719
00:37:37.804 --> 00:37:39.173
Darn you.

720
00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:40.273
You.

721
00:37:40.273 --> 00:37:41.673
How dare you touch him?

722
00:37:50.084 --> 00:37:51.084
Oh, goodness.

723
00:38:03.534 --> 00:38:05.563
Stop crying.

724
00:38:05.563 --> 00:38:07.264
Why are you crying?

725
00:38:08.034 --> 00:38:09.863
That jerk was nothing.

726
00:38:10.334 --> 00:38:11.773
Just let her cry.

727
00:38:12.534 --> 00:38:13.543
Yes.

728
00:38:13.704 --> 00:38:15.474
Just cry today, and forget about him.

729
00:38:15.673 --> 00:38:17.644
Without today's incident, you would've married him...

730
00:38:17.644 --> 00:38:19.374
and had a miserable marriage, crying your heart out for life.

731
00:38:19.874 --> 00:38:21.043
And how do I know that?

732
00:38:22.144 --> 00:38:23.584
I've seen it all.

733
00:38:23.883 --> 00:38:25.313
I've lived for some time,

734
00:38:25.514 --> 00:38:27.784
and there are plenty of other fish out there.

735
00:38:28.483 --> 00:38:30.894
A woman has to meet a good man to live well.

736
00:38:31.054 --> 00:38:32.253
Not a successful man.

737
00:38:32.923 --> 00:38:33.994
A good man.

738
00:38:35.523 --> 00:38:36.523
Well,

739
00:38:37.593 --> 00:38:39.733
there are guys like me, who can't be either one.

740
00:38:48.744 --> 00:38:49.943
He's right.

741
00:38:49.943 --> 00:38:51.773
You should cry now and let it go.

742
00:38:53.043 --> 00:38:54.843
I know you probably want to die right now,

743
00:38:55.543 --> 00:38:57.054
but you still have...

744
00:38:57.054 --> 00:38:59.054
much more days to live.

745
00:39:00.483 --> 00:39:01.584
Who are you guys?

746
00:39:02.584 --> 00:39:04.693
I'm your senior.

747
00:39:07.363 --> 00:39:09.023
Oh, you're right.

748
00:39:10.963 --> 00:39:12.293
You're right.

749
00:39:12.534 --> 00:39:13.534
Hey...

750
00:39:14.903 --> 00:39:17.673
You should get some rest.

751
00:39:17.974 --> 00:39:19.074
And don't cry.

752
00:39:21.443 --> 00:39:22.503
Hey.

753
00:39:26.374 --> 00:39:29.383
I already knew he was dating other women.

754
00:39:31.854 --> 00:39:34.023
I didn't know he was dating so many of them though.

755
00:39:34.983 --> 00:39:37.394
I was afraid of breaking up with him,

756
00:39:37.854 --> 00:39:40.093
so I always spent my days crying.

757
00:39:41.863 --> 00:39:43.363
I'm actually relieved...

758
00:39:43.793 --> 00:39:45.293
after what happened today.

759
00:39:51.104 --> 00:39:52.173
Thank you...

760
00:39:53.503 --> 00:39:54.673
for hitting him.

761
00:40:16.764 --> 00:40:18.334
You're home.

762
00:40:18.733 --> 00:40:19.764
I hear you're moving out?

763
00:40:20.403 --> 00:40:21.503
Pardon?

764
00:40:22.403 --> 00:40:23.934
No, I'm not moving out.

765
00:40:23.934 --> 00:40:25.034
No.

766
00:40:25.034 --> 00:40:27.744
The girl who signed the lease called earlier,

767
00:40:27.744 --> 00:40:30.043
and asked for the deposit back.

768
00:40:30.043 --> 00:40:31.173
Didn't you know?

769
00:40:31.974 --> 00:40:34.383
I'll return the key money by the end of the week,

770
00:40:34.383 --> 00:40:35.644
so move out, okay?

771
00:40:35.644 --> 00:40:36.684
Good night.

772
00:40:37.584 --> 00:40:39.454
Wait. Ma'am.

773
00:40:41.324 --> 00:40:42.483
Darn it!

774
00:40:53.503 --> 00:40:55.063
How dare you play me?

775
00:40:57.874 --> 00:40:58.974
My goodness.

776
00:41:01.604 --> 00:41:03.273
- Hey. - Oh, my stomach.

777
00:41:04.313 --> 00:41:08.113
Hey, that's like attempted murder.

778
00:41:09.284 --> 00:41:11.383
Where did you learn that?

779
00:41:11.813 --> 00:41:12.883
Bo Reum.

780
00:41:14.423 --> 00:41:16.383
Yoon Bo Reum's Aerobics?

781
00:41:16.854 --> 00:41:18.454
Did you learn aerobics from her?

782
00:41:19.293 --> 00:41:20.324
To beat me up?

783
00:41:20.324 --> 00:41:22.824
Of course not.

784
00:41:22.824 --> 00:41:25.834
She teaches moves to hit husband.

785
00:41:26.063 --> 00:41:27.264
Kicking...

786
00:41:27.264 --> 00:41:29.133
like this.

787
00:41:30.673 --> 00:41:32.403
You guys are scary women.

788
00:41:33.673 --> 00:41:36.003
I got to use those moves here.

789
00:41:36.574 --> 00:41:37.874
I should give Bo Reum an award.

790
00:41:39.713 --> 00:41:40.883
You don't think he died, do you?

791
00:41:42.184 --> 00:41:44.084
I don't think so,

792
00:41:44.554 --> 00:41:46.983
but he probably almost did.

793
00:41:47.584 --> 00:41:49.584
Hitting that spot is attempted murder.

794
00:41:49.584 --> 00:41:51.093
You old ladies have no fear.

795
00:41:51.753 --> 00:41:53.863
Don't call me an old lady.

796
00:41:55.363 --> 00:41:56.463
Hey.

797
00:41:57.063 --> 00:41:58.133
What happened here?

798
00:42:00.104 --> 00:42:02.764
I must've scraped it when Dr. Park pushed me.

799
00:42:03.633 --> 00:42:05.273
I should kill that little punk.

800
00:42:05.574 --> 00:42:07.003
I told you it was dangerous.

801
00:42:15.943 --> 00:42:17.554
I told you he wouldn't be easy.

802
00:42:17.983 --> 00:42:20.224
Why did you involve yourself and follow him there?

803
00:42:20.224 --> 00:42:21.253
Look at what happened.

804
00:42:21.253 --> 00:42:23.793
This is nothing. I'm not a kid.

805
00:42:24.054 --> 00:42:25.153
Gosh.

806
00:42:25.354 --> 00:42:27.764
Why are you getting irritated? I'm the one who's hurt.

807
00:42:29.494 --> 00:42:30.834
I'm not irritated.

808
00:42:31.193 --> 00:42:32.334
Goodness.

809
00:42:33.034 --> 00:42:34.764
Are you like this to Seo Young?

810
00:42:35.034 --> 00:42:36.304
Just to me, right?

811
00:42:37.574 --> 00:42:38.633
Give me your arm.

812
00:42:59.224 --> 00:43:00.994
Do you feel better?

813
00:43:01.724 --> 00:43:02.764
About what?

814
00:43:03.063 --> 00:43:04.193
Dr. Park.

815
00:43:07.104 --> 00:43:09.104
He made you to look after his mistress.

816
00:43:10.003 --> 00:43:11.934
He must've been mean to you.

817
00:43:12.304 --> 00:43:13.644
Are you an idiot?

818
00:43:14.574 --> 00:43:17.543
You shouldn't have let him walk all over you.

819
00:43:20.144 --> 00:43:21.784
I let him because I needed to make a living.

820
00:43:23.084 --> 00:43:24.753
It's not just me who does that.

821
00:43:26.084 --> 00:43:28.923
You meet all sorts of people when you're doing business.

822
00:43:33.224 --> 00:43:34.324
Hey.

823
00:43:35.963 --> 00:43:38.293
Do you know what I like?

824
00:43:39.764 --> 00:43:41.363
Someone asked me,

825
00:43:41.503 --> 00:43:43.773
but I couldn't give an answer.

826
00:43:45.874 --> 00:43:46.943
Don't I like anything?

827
00:43:46.943 --> 00:43:48.104
Chicken stew.

828
00:43:49.604 --> 00:43:50.744
Chicken stew!

829
00:43:51.043 --> 00:43:52.374
That's right.

830
00:43:52.943 --> 00:43:55.084
I love chicken stew the most.

831
00:43:55.084 --> 00:43:57.354
Tangerine. UFC.

832
00:43:57.354 --> 00:43:58.653
Collecting DVDs.

833
00:43:59.184 --> 00:44:00.423
DVDs. That's right.

834
00:44:01.724 --> 00:44:03.284
I was a movie mania.

835
00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:09.463
Why did you throw all my DVDs out when you knew I loved movies?

836
00:44:09.593 --> 00:44:10.693
What about you?

837
00:44:11.764 --> 00:44:13.334
Did you think I hated jewelries?

838
00:44:13.334 --> 00:44:15.164
Is that why you sold all the wedding presents?

839
00:44:16.733 --> 00:44:17.834
That's because...

840
00:44:18.334 --> 00:44:20.843
we weren't making enough then.

841
00:44:21.503 --> 00:44:22.673
We didn't have much money.

842
00:44:25.514 --> 00:44:27.613
What's so important about liking something?

843
00:44:29.284 --> 00:44:31.414
It's hard just to make a living every day.

844
00:44:33.284 --> 00:44:34.454
You're right.

845
00:46:06.014 --> 00:46:07.313
It's late. Let's go home.

846
00:46:08.213 --> 00:46:09.744
What? Okay.

847
00:46:18.394 --> 00:46:20.963
How can a 20-year-old girl go on a trip with a guy?

848
00:46:21.664 --> 00:46:22.923
She's such a floozy.

849
00:46:24.193 --> 00:46:25.363
That wench.

850
00:46:25.394 --> 00:46:26.903
You're no different.

851
00:46:26.903 --> 00:46:28.463
She has...

852
00:46:29.633 --> 00:46:30.974
one...

853
00:46:31.104 --> 00:46:33.673
2, 3, 4 guys.

854
00:46:34.744 --> 00:46:35.903
Four guys?

855
00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:37.374
Four including you?

856
00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:40.684
Five including me.

857
00:46:41.244 --> 00:46:42.414
Five?

858
00:46:43.014 --> 00:46:45.383
There could be more.

859
00:46:45.514 --> 00:46:46.584
More?

860
00:46:46.584 --> 00:46:48.954
Gosh. That's a skill, isn't it?

861
00:46:49.354 --> 00:46:50.523
And...

862
00:46:51.293 --> 00:46:53.093
She's easy, not me.

863
00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:55.193
You know me.

864
00:46:55.423 --> 00:46:57.264
I've never been in a relationship before.

865
00:46:58.034 --> 00:47:00.304
How can I be easy?

866
00:47:01.233 --> 00:47:02.834
Wait. Easy...

867
00:47:05.434 --> 00:47:07.273
Did you hear us talk?

868
00:47:07.304 --> 00:47:09.204
Yes, I heard it all.

869
00:47:09.974 --> 00:47:11.943
She's dating me because I'm...

870
00:47:12.843 --> 00:47:15.514
Hey, what Bo Reum was talking about was...

871
00:47:15.684 --> 00:47:17.483
Don't say her name!

872
00:47:17.784 --> 00:47:20.454
Don't say I'm easy. Don't say anything!

873
00:47:20.523 --> 00:47:22.153
Why are you mad at me?

874
00:47:22.983 --> 00:47:24.293
I won't say it!

875
00:47:25.093 --> 00:47:27.063
Hope you never know! Until you die!

876
00:47:32.233 --> 00:47:33.863
It's okay as long as you like her.

877
00:47:34.604 --> 00:47:35.834
Those four guys?

878
00:47:36.133 --> 00:47:37.974
You can knock them down.

879
00:47:38.304 --> 00:47:40.374
Hey, just tell them Bo Reum is yours,

880
00:47:40.874 --> 00:47:43.144
and take her away from them.

881
00:47:43.474 --> 00:47:44.543
Just do it.

882
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:46.644
Wait.

883
00:47:47.343 --> 00:47:48.483
Who's that?

884
00:47:50.883 --> 00:47:52.354
Isn't that 1 of the 4 guys?

885
00:47:53.824 --> 00:47:54.923
That son of...

886
00:47:56.923 --> 00:47:58.454
You should've just called.

887
00:47:59.354 --> 00:48:00.963
Why did you come all the way here?

888
00:48:00.963 --> 00:48:02.093
So...

889
00:48:02.523 --> 00:48:03.764
why are you avoiding me?

890
00:48:04.963 --> 00:48:06.233
You promised that you'd go.

891
00:48:07.834 --> 00:48:08.863
Are you...

892
00:48:09.733 --> 00:48:10.934
dating someone?

893
00:48:12.434 --> 00:48:14.574
No! Gosh.

894
00:48:14.843 --> 00:48:16.773
No, I'm not. Gosh.

895
00:48:20.514 --> 00:48:21.684
Hey.

896
00:48:21.943 --> 00:48:23.383
What? Why are you leaving?

897
00:48:23.813 --> 00:48:24.914
Won't you stay and watch?

898
00:48:25.284 --> 00:48:26.454
It's interesting.

899
00:48:28.423 --> 00:48:29.523
Stop it.

900
00:48:29.523 --> 00:48:30.653
Why?

901
00:48:40.863 --> 00:48:42.264
Take that dirty hand off her!

902
00:48:46.133 --> 00:48:47.773
Hey, Jae Woo!

903
00:48:48.244 --> 00:48:49.574
You idiot.

904
00:48:49.773 --> 00:48:51.113
You can't take him on.

905
00:48:51.113 --> 00:48:52.374
Are you blind?

906
00:48:52.914 --> 00:48:54.084
What's going on?

907
00:48:54.784 --> 00:48:55.883
Who is that?

908
00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:57.483
Who are you?

909
00:48:57.854 --> 00:48:59.153
Who are you?

910
00:49:00.624 --> 00:49:01.724
Don't do it.

911
00:49:01.784 --> 00:49:03.023
Jae Woo.

912
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:04.894
Go inside! Hurry up!

913
00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:06.764
Hey.

914
00:49:08.224 --> 00:49:09.563
Darn it.

915
00:49:09.963 --> 00:49:12.264
What?

916
00:49:12.834 --> 00:49:13.934
I...

917
00:49:15.834 --> 00:49:17.574
I am...

918
00:49:21.804 --> 00:49:23.773
I am Bo Reum's boyfriend!

919
00:49:25.644 --> 00:49:26.784
What?

920
00:49:27.443 --> 00:49:28.514
Who is?

921
00:49:29.313 --> 00:49:30.383
Is it you?

922
00:49:30.554 --> 00:49:31.713
No. It's him.

923
00:49:42.724 --> 00:49:43.863
It's late.

924
00:49:44.863 --> 00:49:45.994
Are you really going alone?

925
00:49:46.363 --> 00:49:49.233
Well... I have a lot on my mind.

926
00:49:49.664 --> 00:49:51.374
I want to think while I walk.

927
00:49:52.403 --> 00:49:54.173
Who's going to take me?

928
00:49:55.104 --> 00:49:56.104
That's true.

929
00:49:56.704 --> 00:49:58.474
You look like a 20-year-old,

930
00:49:58.974 --> 00:50:01.284
but once they abduct you, they'd be scared to take you.

931
00:50:01.483 --> 00:50:02.483
Gosh.

932
00:50:04.914 --> 00:50:05.914
Go.

933
00:50:09.983 --> 00:50:12.054
Hey, Jin Joo.

934
00:50:19.063 --> 00:50:20.264
I thought you looked nice...

935
00:50:21.704 --> 00:50:22.764
on the May Queen stage.

936
00:50:25.434 --> 00:50:26.733
Come to think of it,

937
00:50:27.273 --> 00:50:29.304
you used to love singing.

938
00:50:30.313 --> 00:50:31.813
I had forgotten about it.

939
00:50:35.483 --> 00:50:38.213
Why are you saying this to me so suddenly?

940
00:50:39.753 --> 00:50:42.023
Well, I...

941
00:50:43.324 --> 00:50:44.653
I said something nice.

942
00:50:44.653 --> 00:50:46.764
You should say something nice too.

943
00:50:48.224 --> 00:50:49.494
You're just changing the subject.

944
00:51:01.744 --> 00:51:03.273
Gosh, I shouldn't have told her that.

945
00:51:35.343 --> 00:51:37.414
I wonder if she got home already.

946
00:51:58.133 --> 00:51:59.534
What is this?

947
00:52:00.903 --> 00:52:03.304
Who is she calling at this hour?

948
00:52:04.374 --> 00:52:05.834
Why won't he answer the phone?

949
00:52:17.784 --> 00:52:18.784
Hello?

950
00:52:24.054 --> 00:52:25.093
Where are you?

951
00:52:29.523 --> 00:52:30.793
You must be out of your mind.

952
00:52:32.463 --> 00:52:33.463
Wait, no.

953
00:52:33.863 --> 00:52:35.804
I'm out of my mind.

954
00:52:36.704 --> 00:52:38.074
What are you doing?

955
00:52:38.534 --> 00:52:40.074
Go away before I scream.

956
00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:41.074
Go on.

957
00:52:41.474 --> 00:52:43.343
Scream all you want.

958
00:52:44.673 --> 00:52:46.414
Scream if you want.

959
00:52:51.213 --> 00:52:52.483
You ruined everything.

960
00:52:53.454 --> 00:52:55.253
Do you know how hard it was...

961
00:52:55.684 --> 00:52:58.093
for me to stay next to that ugly Kim Ye Rim?

962
00:52:59.023 --> 00:53:00.293
I don't know about that,

963
00:53:01.693 --> 00:53:03.894
but I can see how pathetic you are.

964
00:53:04.994 --> 00:53:07.164
Does your mom know what you are really like?

965
00:53:11.704 --> 00:53:12.934
Are you a teacher?

966
00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:14.773
Are you crazy?

967
00:53:15.543 --> 00:53:17.213
My goodness.

968
00:53:18.144 --> 00:53:19.213
I told you...

969
00:53:21.584 --> 00:53:22.784
that I hit women too, right?

970
00:53:23.983 --> 00:53:25.354
I'll beat you up...

971
00:53:25.584 --> 00:53:26.713
and go to prison.

972
00:53:27.084 --> 00:53:28.724
I'll go to prison!

973
00:53:38.793 --> 00:53:40.963
Kim Ye Rim knew that...

974
00:53:41.834 --> 00:53:44.304
Doctor Park was cheating on her.

975
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:45.334
It was so unexpected.

976
00:53:48.273 --> 00:53:49.574
She must have liked him so much...

977
00:53:49.574 --> 00:53:51.974
to have married him despite him cheating on her.

978
00:53:52.213 --> 00:53:53.843
He just lost a woman like that.

979
00:53:53.943 --> 00:53:56.213
He's so pathetic.

980
00:53:56.343 --> 00:53:58.584
Did we separate them too harshly?

981
00:53:59.454 --> 00:54:01.954
A love that hurts too much isn't love.

982
00:54:03.224 --> 00:54:05.124
Having an affair is not love.

983
00:54:05.354 --> 00:54:06.724
It's just violence.

984
00:54:08.063 --> 00:54:11.063
It's the worst and the most painful violence.

985
00:54:11.063 --> 00:54:13.664
But if she gets used to...

986
00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:16.403
him cheating,

987
00:54:16.633 --> 00:54:17.934
it could get better.

988
00:54:17.934 --> 00:54:19.273
That doesn't make sense.

989
00:54:19.604 --> 00:54:22.104
If a man cheats with a hundred women,

990
00:54:22.104 --> 00:54:24.113
a woman would remember...

991
00:54:24.113 --> 00:54:25.744
all of their names.

992
00:54:25.914 --> 00:54:29.014
It won't get blunt as knives do.

993
00:54:30.014 --> 00:54:31.653
The trust,

994
00:54:31.653 --> 00:54:34.224
affection, and the value I had...

995
00:54:34.983 --> 00:54:37.093
all hit rock bottom.

996
00:54:39.394 --> 00:54:41.593
Gosh, that scum.

997
00:54:44.693 --> 00:54:45.693
Hey.

998
00:54:47.003 --> 00:54:49.664
- What? - You're not talking to me, right?

999
00:54:51.633 --> 00:54:52.733
I...

1000
00:54:54.204 --> 00:54:55.543
didn't have an affair then.

1001
00:55:10.494 --> 00:55:11.653
Motel.

1002
00:55:12.394 --> 00:55:13.494
Hotel.

1003
00:55:15.523 --> 00:55:18.334
(Hotel)

1004
00:55:24.204 --> 00:55:26.403
How can I go home in this state?

1005
00:55:30.543 --> 00:55:32.014
I can't go home today.

1006
00:55:36.784 --> 00:55:37.784
Yes?

1007
00:55:38.054 --> 00:55:40.454
How can you do this to me?

1008
00:55:41.084 --> 00:55:42.554
How can you?

1009
00:55:43.793 --> 00:55:44.824
Let's get a divorce.

1010
00:55:46.354 --> 00:55:47.363
What?

1011
00:55:47.363 --> 00:55:48.963
We're so unhappy.

1012
00:55:49.863 --> 00:55:51.834
I'm so unhappy.

1013
00:55:54.434 --> 00:55:55.503
Let's get divorced.

1014
00:55:56.434 --> 00:55:57.604
Let's get divorced!

1015
00:56:02.804 --> 00:56:04.113
Maybe it...

1016
00:56:04.474 --> 00:56:06.414
wasn't our love that was over.

1017
00:56:07.313 --> 00:56:08.983
We couldn't afford to...

1018
00:56:09.313 --> 00:56:12.784
look into our heart that lies somewhere between lies and truths.

1019

(Go Back Couple)

1020
00:56:33.503 --> 00:56:34.874
Sul is missing.

1021
00:56:34.874 --> 00:56:36.704
Should I report this to the police?

1022
00:56:37.343 --> 00:56:38.443
She's acting...

1023
00:56:38.644 --> 00:56:40.213
a little strange recently.

1024
00:56:41.144 --> 00:56:42.213
Where are you going, Dok Jae?

You've been holding onto it for 18 years.

1027
00:56:45.253 --> 00:56:47.554
You must have been worried about Chun Sul.

You should to find her this time.

1029
00:56:49.054 --> 00:56:51.054
You seem like an adult.

1030
00:56:51.054 --> 00:56:53.423
You've changed so much in just a few weeks.

I don't want a man that makes my daughter cry.

1032
00:56:56.624 --> 00:56:57.994
What do you mean?

1033
00:56:57.994 --> 00:56:59.633
Tell me honestly.

1034
00:56:59.633 --> 00:57:00.963
Who is Seo Jin?
