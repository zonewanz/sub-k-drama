1
00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:18.569
which they'll find likeable...

2
00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:20.869
when we go down there to get them.

3
00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:23.838
Picking a face that will be perceived as likeable by humans...

4
00:00:23.838 --> 00:00:25.509
is very tricky.

5
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.249
My job is collecting humans' souls.

6
00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:31.549
Humans call us...

7
00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.189
the Grim Reapers.

8
00:00:36.018 --> 00:00:38.758
They should just come with us because they have to leave anyway.

9
00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:41.229
Why do they have so much to talk about? Goodness.

10
00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.898
You cold-blooded, shameless woman.

11
00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:47.529
That's why you haven't been able to ascend to the upper world.

12
00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:49.999
Shut it, baldy.

13
00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.738
You're in no position to talk.

14
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.639
We, the Grim Reapers, are divided into two categories.

15
00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.279
The pure descents of the upper world who were born as the Grim Reapers.

16
00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.779
And...

17
00:01:05.818 --> 00:01:09.288
these idiotic, pathetic ones who used to be humans.

18
00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:11.919
You idiot! I told you to be careful.

19
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:13.589
Do you know who he is?

20
00:01:13.589 --> 00:01:15.288
They're here because they committed suicide.

21
00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:17.529
They took their own lives.

22
00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:21.268
Working as the Grim Reapers is a punishment they must carry out.

23
00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.098
The lives they gave up thoughtlessly can be so precious to other humans.

24
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.408
He wants them to learn the lesson on their own.

25
00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.408
Now, I'm on my way to collect a dead...

26
00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:35.908
No, let me correct myself.

27
00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:38.079
I'm on my way...

28
00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.118
to collect the soul of someone who is about to die.

29
00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.359
(Black)

30
00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.398
The ones who committed suicide still have their human bodies...

31
00:03:05.398 --> 00:03:06.938
and memories intact.

32
00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.708
That's why they get themselves in trouble at times while on duty.

33
00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:15.109
For example, they let the soul which they have to collect run away,

34
00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.549
or they hide in human bodies because they want to live again.

35
00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.718
And that's why we say...

36
00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.419
that partnering up with those ex-humans is the worst thing...

37
00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:27.859
that can happen to us, the pure descents.

38
00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:30.329
A month ago,

39
00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.058
that man who killed himself,

40
00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:37.539
the worst of the worst, was assigned to me as my partner.

41
00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.609
Yes, I'm a rap star, a hip-hop loving Grim Reaper

42
00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.109
My mom told me, "Life is nothing special, Son"

43
00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.719
Life never goes according to plan even after you die

44
00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.078
Does he have that many regrets? Was he a devoted son?

45
00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:55.089
What's that loser's tragic story?

46
00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.589
He's bogging down our master

47
00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.089
Loser, baby

48
00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.318
Shut it.

49
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.628
By the way, how much of a loser is he, actually?

50
00:04:03.628 --> 00:04:04.928
Don't even get me started.

51
00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:06.959
When we went to collect an old lady's soul,

52
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.868
he hung out with her, saying that she reminds him of his grandmother.

53
00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:12.099
When we had to collect a woman who died from an illness,

54
00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.938
he hit on her, saying that she looks like his first love.

55
00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.409
When we went to pick up a kid's soul,

56
00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.609
he tried to let the soul flee, saying that he feels horrible.

57
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.948
That clueless loser is making my life so difficult.

58
00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:24.149
My gosh!

59
00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:28.388
You should just request to have your partner changed.

60
00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.118
He's the most competent Grim Reaper...

61
00:04:31.118 --> 00:04:32.988
in the whole universe.

62
00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:35.428
444 will never make such a request.

63
00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:38.758
He should know himself. He has way too much ego.

64
00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:41.299
007, what are you talking about?

65
00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:44.039
Don't you think you're being too disrespectful to him?

66
00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.409
Be quiet, 416. How dare you.

67
00:04:47.938 --> 00:04:50.339
I'm old enough to be your ancestor.

68
00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:53.479
I was there when General Yi Sun Shin passed away.

69
00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.618
Humans think that he died because he got hit by an arrow in his underarm.

70
00:04:57.618 --> 00:04:58.878
That's not what happened.

71
00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:00.178
I was there.

72
00:05:00.178 --> 00:05:01.849
My mom told me

73
00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.058
- That you're a total liar - Shut it!

74
00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.118
Why are you crazy about such ridiculous music?

75
00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:09.159
Anyway, what are you going to do?

76
00:05:09.328 --> 00:05:12.859
Working with that idiot will keep stressing you out.

77
00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.128
This can't continue.

78
00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:16.928
I need to sort this out.

79
00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:19.938
What are you doing?

80
00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:21.669
Let go!

81
00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.508
Please let go of me!

82
00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:26.008
Let go of me, and we'll talk!

83
00:05:26.508 --> 00:05:27.609
Goodness.

84
00:05:33.178 --> 00:05:34.248
Move.

85
00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:36.219
Get out of our way!

86
00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:55.508
What? You want me to collect a soul by myself?

87
00:05:55.508 --> 00:05:58.279
That's right. Open this capsule as soon as you arrive there.

88
00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:01.008
The first thing you need to do is checking the face of the person.

89
00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:03.508
We don't know when, where, and how the person will die.

90
00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:06.748
The process begins when the form starts to disappear,

91
00:06:06.878 --> 00:06:10.959
so watch him at all times and drag him here as soon as he dies. Got it?

92
00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:12.318
I don't want to do it.

93
00:06:13.258 --> 00:06:14.659
I can't do it alone.

94
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.328
Listen to me carefully.

95
00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.498
If the soul runs away because you get distracted,

96
00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.539
you'll never be able to ascend to the upper world.

97
00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.868
Instead, you'll fall into the fiery pit.

98
00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:56.698
Don't forget. From the second the form in the capsule disappears,

99
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:59.769
keep your eye on him at all times and bring him here.

100
00:07:00.498 --> 00:07:01.508
Go now.

101
00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:03.269
Go on!

102
00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:13.748
He won't be able to do the job alone.

103
00:07:13.748 --> 00:07:16.519
Of course not. If the soul runs away,

104
00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:19.459
that loser will fall into the fiery pit.

105
00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:23.659
Then I'll get a new partner.

106
00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:30.868
What? Why is there another one?

107
00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.308
444, 444!

108
00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:40.178
Look. I found another capsule.

109
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.078
"444". This is yours.

110
00:07:43.078 --> 00:07:44.948
Didn't that loser take yours?

111
00:07:44.948 --> 00:07:49.219
Gosh, it looks like those up there got confused and sent another one.

112
00:07:50.448 --> 00:07:53.058
He must be going senile. I'm telling you.

113
00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:56.459
Gosh, that old man.

114
00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:58.399
He just can't let me take it easy.

115
00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:10.779
Gosh, who's the human that didn't even lock the locker...

116
00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:12.509
and make me come out of here?

117
00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:14.978
- 444. - What's going on?

118
00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:16.279
We have a big problem.

119
00:08:17.578 --> 00:08:20.448
I went to the collection spot and found this.

120
00:08:22.688 --> 00:08:24.688
- This is... - Isn't this the one the loser took?

121
00:08:24.688 --> 00:08:27.728
He threw out this empty capsule. It means that he ran away, right?

122
00:08:27.728 --> 00:08:30.029
If the Grim Reaper runs away in the human world...

123
00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:33.259
It means that he's hiding in a dead human body somewhere.

124
00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.228
Gosh, we must report this to the Death Squad now.

125
00:08:35.228 --> 00:08:36.299
Hold on a second.

126
00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.598
He may not have actually entered a body yet.

127
00:08:38.598 --> 00:08:39.799
Let's try to find him first.

128
00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:54.049
It was here. Hurry up!

129
00:08:55.889 --> 00:08:57.889
Here. It was right here.

130
00:09:03.558 --> 00:09:05.659
I'll go this way and look for him. You go that way.

131
00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:08.629
If you see any dead human, look around the body first. Got it?

132
00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:09.928
Okay.

133
00:09:10.198 --> 00:09:11.838
- Get moving already! - All right.

134
00:10:05.318 --> 00:10:07.588
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

135
00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:12.558
What if that idiot has gotten inside of someone's body already?

136
00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:14.968
I've heard.

137
00:10:16.568 --> 00:10:18.169
Have you not found him yet?

138
00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:21.808
Gosh, stop it.

139
00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:24.039
Just report it to the Death Squad now.

140
00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:27.108
If they find out about this, it'll cause him trouble too.

141
00:10:27.108 --> 00:10:28.909
What? Why?

142
00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:31.978
He will be punished as well for not properly managing his partner.

143
00:10:31.978 --> 00:10:33.649
He will be punished?

144
00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:37.818
What are you talking about?

145
00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:38.989
Are you saying he will be...

146
00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:41.759
eaten by that dog with three heads because his partner deserted?

147
00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:45.129
That would actually be better.

148
00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:46.328
What?

149
00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:47.928
Do you remember...

150
00:10:47.928 --> 00:10:50.899
the posters Death Squad put up on the wall?

151
00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:51.899
Posters?

152
00:10:57.779 --> 00:10:58.838
I remember.

153
00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:01.108
The Death Squad with that monstrous dog.

154
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:05.078
That is not a dog.

155
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.448
What?

156
00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:11.659
They are grim reapers who are hunting down...

157
00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:13.558
their partners who ran away.

158
00:11:17.598 --> 00:11:21.428
Does that mean that dog with a human face is...

159
00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:23.369
444's near future?

160
00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:26.739
Will he look like a dog forever if he can't catch his partner?

161
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.108
That darn idiot.

162
00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:36.779
Don't come near me.

163
00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:39.019
I will really kill this guy.

164
00:11:39.348 --> 00:11:42.218
I will really kill him!

165
00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:44.989
I'm going to kill this guy!

166
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:46.588
Move!

167
00:12:01.838 --> 00:12:03.438
Which of them is it?

168
00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:11.119
It's the detective.

169
00:12:11.119 --> 00:12:12.348
Detective?

170
00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:18.958
Clear!

171
00:12:21.688 --> 00:12:23.328
I'm sure my partner...

172
00:12:23.328 --> 00:12:25.928
has gotten into someone's body already.

173
00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:29.098
I need a human's body as well in order to catch him.

174
00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:31.999
It'd be easier if it's the body of a detective.

175
00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:33.869
I'd be able to carry around a gun.

176
00:12:33.869 --> 00:12:37.279
No. You will get us punished as accomplices.

177
00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:42.948
I can't just watch 444 become a dog.

178
00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:45.578
I will...

179
00:12:46.178 --> 00:12:48.519
catch that idiot myself no matter what.

180
00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:01.669
No!

181
00:13:08.938 --> 00:13:10.009
You're saying...

182
00:13:10.678 --> 00:13:12.108
I'm dead?

183
00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:15.009
No...

184
00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:16.978
No.

185
00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:20.249
I can't die yet. No.

186
00:13:22.348 --> 00:13:24.318
Everyone says that.

187
00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.889
I have to go.

188
00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:28.259
I have to go and ask her...

189
00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.289
how she could do that to to me...

190
00:13:31.098 --> 00:13:32.899
and why!

191
00:13:33.968 --> 00:13:35.629
I can't die like this.

192
00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:43.509
I still have things to do.

193
00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:45.009
No.

194
00:13:45.578 --> 00:13:46.739
No.

195
00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:48.879
No!

196
00:13:49.608 --> 00:13:52.879
It's amazing how every human says the same thing.

197
00:13:58.119 --> 00:14:00.659
Where is that idiot hiding?

198
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.629
Could he be there?

199
00:14:09.198 --> 00:14:11.098
Sir.

200
00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:16.239
Miss, that was dangerous.

201
00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:18.879
Sir, please go to this address.

202
00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:39.259
If you're a decent human being,

203
00:14:39.259 --> 00:14:41.899
you shouldn't have stolen my girlfriend!

204
00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:45.799
Did you think I was such a big pushover?

205
00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:50.938
Goodness, he won't stop talking.

206
00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:52.779
Just jump off the bridge already.

207
00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:55.478
I'll become a ghost...

208
00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:58.818
and make you pay for this by haunting you!

209
00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:21.708
I shouldn't have let him go by himself.

210
00:15:23.239 --> 00:15:25.539
You were here. We've been looking for you.

211
00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:27.808
We locked him up very safely.

212
00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:30.718
I told you so many times to lock him up carefully!

213
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:33.078
If Death Squad finds him wandering like that,

214
00:15:33.078 --> 00:15:34.448
it'll be the end of me!

215
00:15:34.448 --> 00:15:37.019
Do you expect us to watch Moo Gang's soul and neglect our work?

216
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.558
The heavy workload is already killing me.

217
00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:44.428
Miss, shouldn't you go to a hospital?

218
00:15:44.428 --> 00:15:46.098
I'm fine, sir.

219
00:15:46.098 --> 00:15:49.198
Could you drive a little bit faster, please?

220
00:15:53.968 --> 00:15:56.308
Joon... Joon?

221
00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:58.279
Joon...

222
00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:01.149
Shadows. Those are shadows.

223
00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:02.208
It's Joon.

224
00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:04.119
Sir, please stop the car.

225
00:16:04.119 --> 00:16:05.119
Please stop the car.

226
00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:07.519
No, I can't stop the car on a bridge.

227
00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.389
Just for a moment. It's urgent.

228
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:11.088
Please stop the car. Please.

229
00:16:17.228 --> 00:16:18.698
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:18.698 --> 00:16:20.728
We locked him up carefully. When did he escape?

231
00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:22.728
I can't believe I trusted these fools with this.

232
00:16:22.728 --> 00:16:23.968
"These fools"?

233
00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:27.568
You brat. How dare you?

234
00:16:28.438 --> 00:16:29.968
Hey.

235
00:16:29.968 --> 00:16:31.279
- What? - You brat.

236
00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:32.678
What?

237
00:16:33.308 --> 00:16:35.378
Who do you think caused all this trouble for us?

238
00:16:35.378 --> 00:16:36.608
Who is it?

239
00:16:37.049 --> 00:16:38.749
It's you two.

240
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:40.479
Move. Move out of the way!

241
00:16:50.358 --> 00:16:51.658
Joon, no!

242
00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:12.078
I'm glad you're alive.

243
00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:13.918
I'm so glad...

244
00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.689
you're alive.

245
00:17:17.858 --> 00:17:18.959
What is this?

246
00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.388
Is her soul the one I need to collect?

247
00:17:23.658 --> 00:17:25.529
Why do you think she'll die?

248
00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:27.098
She's still young.

249
00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:29.429
Who cares?

250
00:17:47.388 --> 00:17:50.049
Look at that. How coldhearted.

251
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:56.229
Find out where she lives.

252
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:58.858
Oh, here it is.

253
00:17:59.128 --> 00:18:02.029
"123-4, Guoh-dong, Guoh-gu".

254
00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:08.868
Where are you going?

255
00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:10.838
Hey.

256
00:18:15.348 --> 00:18:18.049
Don't you know you cannot teleport with a human?

257
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:20.418
I know that. I just forgot.

258
00:18:20.749 --> 00:18:22.818
She's really bothersome.

259
00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:26.588
Be careful.

260
00:18:26.588 --> 00:18:28.789
You can't treat someone sick so roughly.

261
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:31.229
Hey, be careful. Her head... Legs...

262
00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:32.558
My goodness.

263
00:18:38.598 --> 00:18:39.769
What is this?

264
00:18:40.739 --> 00:18:42.068
Is he her boyfriend?

265
00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:53.679
I guess she's having a tough life.

266
00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:55.689
Wait a little longer.

267
00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:59.818
I can't take your soul to the underworld yet.

268
00:19:00.388 --> 00:19:02.489
I'll take you as soon as I catch my idiotic partner.

269
00:19:02.489 --> 00:19:03.929
Hang in there a little longer.

270
00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:08.769
(Seoun Police Station)

271
00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:13.039
Have you found anything?

272
00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.039
(Hope Mental Hospital)

273
00:19:14.668 --> 00:19:17.939
The picture we found. Have you found out who it is?

274
00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:21.308
I've looked into it, but we know nothing about the mental patient.

275
00:19:21.648 --> 00:19:22.979
I don't know how to go about it.

276
00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:24.479
Guys, stop wasting your time.

277
00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:27.418
Get all the documents together and send them to Team One by tomorrow.

278
00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:28.689
The order came from the team manager.

279
00:19:28.689 --> 00:19:29.818
Why?

280
00:19:29.818 --> 00:19:31.459
Do your job well, will you?

281
00:19:31.459 --> 00:19:34.358
Your captain keeps losing hair because of you guys.

282
00:19:36.429 --> 00:19:37.898
Why do we have to do that, Captain?

283
00:19:37.898 --> 00:19:40.058
We haven't worked on a case in so long.

284
00:19:40.499 --> 00:19:43.898
If we get it taken away, we'll have nothing from the last six months.

285
00:19:44.539 --> 00:19:46.199
What? Do you really not know the reason?

286
00:19:46.939 --> 00:19:50.269
What on earth did you guys do at the scene?

287
00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:53.108
You damaged the scene as well as the body.

288
00:19:53.739 --> 00:19:55.408
Do you guys all want to get fired?

289
00:19:55.479 --> 00:19:57.818
Where did all of you idiots come from?

290
00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:00.249
What?

291
00:20:00.318 --> 00:20:04.058
Do you guys think that you work in the Violent Crimes Unit or what?

292
00:20:04.058 --> 00:20:05.489
Wake up already.

293
00:20:05.489 --> 00:20:07.259
We're in the backup team.

294
00:20:07.388 --> 00:20:10.429
We only work on cases that those in the Violent Crimes Unit...

295
00:20:10.429 --> 00:20:12.029
don't want to take on!

296
00:20:13.628 --> 00:20:15.368
I had to flatter and beg the higher-ups...

297
00:20:15.368 --> 00:20:18.668
to back up the investigation of the mental hospital case.

298
00:20:18.668 --> 00:20:21.209
We got it taken away because you guys ruined everything!

299
00:20:23.308 --> 00:20:24.838
Why did you have to tumble right there?

300
00:20:25.179 --> 00:20:27.078
Why did he bite the arm on the dead body?

301
00:20:27.179 --> 00:20:29.209
- Is he a vampire or what? - Gosh.

302
00:20:29.209 --> 00:20:30.348
I don't even know anymore.

303
00:20:30.818 --> 00:20:34.249
You know that we'll get disbanded if we can't show any results, right?

304
00:20:34.888 --> 00:20:36.848
There are only a few months left in the year.

305
00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:39.789
No department will want you losers.

306
00:20:39.959 --> 00:20:42.888
Hey, just start packing up. Pack up your stuff...

307
00:20:42.888 --> 00:20:44.299
and get ready to go home, okay?

308
00:20:44.558 --> 00:20:47.199
Gosh, those pathetic idiots.

309
00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:51.769
For goodness' sake!

310
00:20:52.368 --> 00:20:55.138
We're in this mess because of Moo Gang.

311
00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.308
Don't you think Captain was out of line?

312
00:20:58.378 --> 00:21:00.608
Losers? How can he call us losers?

313
00:21:00.979 --> 00:21:02.148
Aren't I right, Detective Park?

314
00:21:04.618 --> 00:21:07.719
Oh, boy. Let's do some work, or we'll be called losers again.

315
00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:11.519
We're in this team because we're losers. Just get on with it.

316
00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:12.689
Gwang Gyun.

317
00:21:12.888 --> 00:21:14.489
You're out of line.

318
00:21:14.489 --> 00:21:15.828
Why are we losers?

319
00:21:15.828 --> 00:21:16.929
Why?

320
00:21:18.429 --> 00:21:20.868
Detective Park, you can't use any firearm...

321
00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:23.168
because of your hand tremors.

322
00:21:23.568 --> 00:21:25.638
That idiot, Moo Gang, throws up every time he sees a dead body...

323
00:21:25.638 --> 00:21:27.608
because he has such a weak stomach.

324
00:21:28.568 --> 00:21:30.608
So Tae, you have to take a leak so often.

325
00:21:30.608 --> 00:21:32.979
You can't even be on a stake-out because you have to keep...

326
00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:34.378
going to the washroom.

327
00:21:34.378 --> 00:21:36.509
Gosh, hearing that is making me want to take a leak again.

328
00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:38.118
What about you, then?

329
00:21:39.249 --> 00:21:40.348
I'm...

330
00:21:41.088 --> 00:21:43.449
I have anger management issues, you punk!

331
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:45.118
Don't you know?

332
00:21:45.618 --> 00:21:47.289
Because I can't control my nasty temper,

333
00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:49.358
I bite criminals and get myself in trouble all the time.

334
00:21:49.358 --> 00:21:52.328
Look at my gray hair. I haven't gotten any promotion until this age,

335
00:21:52.328 --> 00:21:54.769
and all I do is raid internet cafes to catch minors.

336
00:21:54.769 --> 00:21:56.368
I'm older than most managers.

337
00:21:56.368 --> 00:21:59.098
All team managers in the entire police force avoid me...

338
00:21:59.098 --> 00:22:00.568
because they don't want to work with me!

339
00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:08.009
What's the matter with him?

340
00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:09.108
We are losers, aren't we?

341
00:22:12.719 --> 00:22:14.888
Let's just admit it already.

342
00:22:16.489 --> 00:22:19.289
I can't admit it. And stop looking at that thing.

343
00:22:19.289 --> 00:22:21.088
They want us to hand all document over.

344
00:22:21.088 --> 00:22:22.259
Shut it.

345
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:24.328
Detective Park, give me a cigarette.

346
00:22:24.328 --> 00:22:26.999
Hey, we were told to hand them over by tomorrow.

347
00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:30.098
That means the case is ours until the end of today. You're so dumb.

348
00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.939
Gosh, I have to relieve myself. Goodness.

349
00:22:35.668 --> 00:22:36.868
Moo Gang?

350
00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:39.209
Why is that idiot caught on this footage?

351
00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:41.148
Hang on, this is...

352
00:22:41.878 --> 00:22:43.479
It was a month before the incident.

353
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:52.618
What? Was that a dream?

354
00:23:02.068 --> 00:23:03.469
(To: Joon)

355
00:23:03.469 --> 00:23:04.999
Yes, it wasn't a dream.

356
00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:08.568
I saw the shadow beside Joon. I'm sure of it.

357
00:23:09.668 --> 00:23:10.878
I must check.

358
00:23:16.608 --> 00:23:17.779
It's this house.

359
00:23:20.118 --> 00:23:23.918
My gosh, it still looks exactly like it did 20 years ago.

360
00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:41.709
"19-1, Myeonhee-dong, Mioh-gu".

361
00:23:53.078 --> 00:23:54.289
Who is it?

362
00:23:58.118 --> 00:23:59.358
Who is it?

363
00:24:01.388 --> 00:24:02.658
Who is it, Mom?

364
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:04.628
I don't know. Who was it?

365
00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:07.668
I think it was a prank.

366
00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:10.068
Let's go in and eat.

367
00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:22.509
So the address is correct.

368
00:24:23.148 --> 00:24:25.378
That means he got all the letters I've sent him.

369
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:30.489
He's never written me back or called me.

370
00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:32.459
Has he forgotten about me already?

371
00:24:33.118 --> 00:24:35.189
I hate you, Joon. I hate you.

372
00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:40.128
Hey, who are you?

373
00:24:40.358 --> 00:24:41.828
Why are you crying here?

374
00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:43.368
It's none of your business!

375
00:24:48.638 --> 00:24:50.838
Would he still live here though?

376
00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:54.808
Isn't this his car?

377
00:24:55.378 --> 00:24:57.049
Yes, it is his car.

378
00:24:58.848 --> 00:25:00.689
What if he's passed out alone inside?

379
00:25:01.648 --> 00:25:02.848
My gosh.

380
00:25:16.469 --> 00:25:17.568
Oh, I see Joon.

381
00:25:23.808 --> 00:25:25.479
Thank goodness. The shadow is gone.

382
00:25:26.878 --> 00:25:28.049
Since I'm already here,

383
00:25:28.749 --> 00:25:32.578
I should call him and ask for Lee Jung Bae's number.

384
00:25:48.168 --> 00:25:51.239
The customer you're calling is unavailable at the moment.

385
00:25:51.239 --> 00:25:52.469
Please leave a message after...

386
00:25:52.469 --> 00:25:55.108
What? So he's been ignoring my calls all along?

387
00:25:56.668 --> 00:26:00.338
Unbelievable. I'll never ask you for help again, jerk.

388
00:26:00.949 --> 00:26:02.378
How can he ignore my calls?

389
00:26:11.158 --> 00:26:12.259
Right.

390
00:26:12.888 --> 00:26:14.729
He almost died because of me.

391
00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:19.358
I'd also be sick of me if I were him.

392
00:26:41.318 --> 00:26:42.489
Good.

393
00:26:43.648 --> 00:26:47.189
I've blocked off all passages, so I'll be able to sleep soundly now.

394
00:26:52.398 --> 00:26:53.969
Gosh, I forgot to block that one.

395
00:26:54.229 --> 00:26:57.838
Well, why did you block off all doors?

396
00:26:57.838 --> 00:26:59.969
You locked all doors including the bathroom door.

397
00:26:59.969 --> 00:27:01.068
Hey.

398
00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:03.509
You did that to make sure we can't come in here, right?

399
00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:05.509
Why did I forget to block that one?

400
00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:09.378
Let's just go.

401
00:27:09.749 --> 00:27:12.148
We came all the way here to help you out.

402
00:27:12.449 --> 00:27:14.019
Why did we even want to help you?

403
00:27:14.019 --> 00:27:16.118
All right. What's the matter? What's going on?

404
00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:20.459
You're on the most wanted list now.

405
00:27:20.519 --> 00:27:22.158
- I am? - Yes, you are.

406
00:27:22.358 --> 00:27:23.898
From other Grim Reapers to the Death Squad,

407
00:27:23.898 --> 00:27:26.999
everyone is trying to track you down right now.

408
00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:29.328
You really should've tried to be nicer to others.

409
00:27:29.598 --> 00:27:31.939
You have so many enemies.

410
00:27:31.939 --> 00:27:33.638
I'm sure they're just jealous of me.

411
00:27:33.638 --> 00:27:37.709
Gosh, you make me want to report you to Death Squad right away.

412
00:27:38.439 --> 00:27:40.279
They can try to track me down all they want.

413
00:27:40.439 --> 00:27:43.148
I will not get caught until I find that loser.

414
00:27:43.148 --> 00:27:45.878
It looks like you'll get caught very soon.

415
00:27:46.378 --> 00:27:48.588
Didn't you teleport into a closet...

416
00:27:48.588 --> 00:27:50.289
in the middle of downtown yesterday?

417
00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:51.318
Have you been tailing me?

418
00:27:51.318 --> 00:27:54.128
Someone told the Death Squad that it could've been you.

419
00:27:54.128 --> 00:27:55.429
Be thankful...

420
00:27:55.558 --> 00:27:57.598
that you were seen from behind. That's why you didn't get caught.

421
00:27:58.598 --> 00:28:01.529
The Grim Reapers aren't the problem now.

422
00:28:01.529 --> 00:28:04.168
Don't you know what will happen if humans find out who you are?

423
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:06.668
You know that things will totally get out of hand.

424
00:28:06.668 --> 00:28:08.469
You've dealt with humans for long enough.

425
00:28:08.469 --> 00:28:11.479
Why can't you act like a human?

426
00:28:13.138 --> 00:28:15.479
- Is it that obvious? - Yes, totally. Anyone can tell!

427
00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:18.648
You picked up the receiver upside down and looked like a pervert.

428
00:28:18.648 --> 00:28:21.249
And how much did you think this designer trench coat was?

429
00:28:21.348 --> 00:28:23.249
Three dollars? Gosh, you idiot.

430
00:28:23.388 --> 00:28:25.558
Just watching humans and having to act like one...

431
00:28:26.058 --> 00:28:27.388
are two totally different things.

432
00:28:27.388 --> 00:28:28.429
Please.

433
00:28:28.558 --> 00:28:31.699
Act like that body is really yours until you find that loser.

434
00:28:31.699 --> 00:28:33.529
Try to really look like a detective.

435
00:28:33.759 --> 00:28:36.068
Only then, you'll be able to get your gun back.

436
00:28:36.199 --> 00:28:37.568
You went into that detective's body...

437
00:28:37.898 --> 00:28:40.808
because of the gun.

438
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:43.568
Because of a gun? Why?

439
00:28:43.709 --> 00:28:47.378
To drag a fugitive Grim Reaper out of a human body,

440
00:28:47.378 --> 00:28:49.479
we must put a hole right here.

441
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:51.418
Nothing gets the job done like guns do.

442
00:28:51.418 --> 00:28:54.118
All right, I heard you. Enough, okay?

443
00:28:54.219 --> 00:28:57.358
I'll act like I'm Han Moo Gang until I find the gun and get that loser.

444
00:28:58.318 --> 00:28:59.719
Acting like a detective is easy.

445
00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:01.189
It'll be a piece of cake.

446
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:05.429
I've seen many souls who died after bluffing like that.

447
00:29:07.568 --> 00:29:08.769
Get lost.

448
00:29:10.093 --> 00:29:13.325
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E03 Black "Black"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

449
00:29:14.838 --> 00:29:16.668
It's easy to be a detective.

450
00:29:16.668 --> 00:29:18.779
I just need to catch criminals.

451
00:29:19.908 --> 00:29:21.108
All right.

452
00:29:22.749 --> 00:29:25.019
Gosh, that's not it. It's right next to...

453
00:29:25.219 --> 00:29:26.219
It's right next to...

454
00:29:26.219 --> 00:29:28.918
Goodness, how is a fool like him a detective?

455
00:29:29.189 --> 00:29:30.388
It's right over there.

456
00:29:33.358 --> 00:29:35.229
- You know it. - Get off.

457
00:29:35.229 --> 00:29:36.229
- Wait. - Get off.

458
00:29:36.229 --> 00:29:37.558
- Move it. - Come on.

459
00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:39.459
What are you doing? Go inside,

460
00:29:39.459 --> 00:29:40.828
and take everything we can sell!

461
00:29:40.828 --> 00:29:42.328
- Yes, boss. - What are you doing?

462
00:29:42.328 --> 00:29:43.398
Get off of me.

463
00:29:43.398 --> 00:29:45.499
- Take it all outside! - We don't have time. Move it.

464
00:29:45.499 --> 00:29:47.138
- Take all of these. - Wait.

465
00:29:47.138 --> 00:29:49.769
Do you think we can sell this? Find something better!

466
00:29:49.769 --> 00:29:51.078
Hurry up!

467
00:29:51.078 --> 00:29:52.939
- Find something big! - Let's get it done quickly.

468
00:29:52.939 --> 00:29:54.408
- Hurry! - Darn it!

469
00:29:54.408 --> 00:29:55.779
- What are you doing? - You can't take this!

470
00:29:55.779 --> 00:29:57.318
This is the newest model!

471
00:29:57.318 --> 00:29:59.648
- Let it go, you punk! - I'm still paying installments!

472
00:29:59.648 --> 00:30:01.049
Have you gone crazy?

473
00:30:03.172 --> 00:30:05.243
- Let it go, you punk! - I'm still paying installments!

474
00:30:05.243 --> 00:30:06.743
Have you gone crazy?

475
00:30:12.023 --> 00:30:13.083
What...

476
00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:18.922
No... Jin Sook...

477
00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:25.863
There.

478
00:30:28.372 --> 00:30:31.402
That's right. That's it.

479
00:30:43.283 --> 00:30:46.222
Han Moo Gang, he's a detective. Why are his clothes all so childish?

480
00:30:58.063 --> 00:30:59.132
Hello.

481
00:30:59.863 --> 00:31:01.372
- What is it? - Well...

482
00:31:01.372 --> 00:31:03.573
You had your clothes dry cleaned.

483
00:31:11.712 --> 00:31:12.743
What is this?

484
00:31:12.743 --> 00:31:15.712
You said you often go to funerals because you're a detective.

485
00:31:22.523 --> 00:31:24.392
This is horrible.

486
00:31:25.392 --> 00:31:27.162
Who would beat up a woman like this?

487
00:31:28.192 --> 00:31:29.263
What's the cause of her death?

488
00:31:29.263 --> 00:31:31.333
We'll have to do the autopsy to verify,

489
00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:33.702
but there is a mark of strangulation.

490
00:31:33.702 --> 00:31:35.132
I think someone strangled her.

491
00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:38.603
I've been a gangster for 20 years, and now I'm helping a cop...

492
00:31:38.972 --> 00:31:40.343
Watch what you say!

493
00:31:40.343 --> 00:31:43.513
I mean, now I'm helping a detective.

494
00:31:43.872 --> 00:31:46.113
He said he'd quit being a waiter and open up a restaurant,

495
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:47.882
so I lent him a lot of money.

496
00:31:47.882 --> 00:31:50.283
But we couldn't reach him for a month.

497
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:51.753
He went in hiding.

498
00:31:51.753 --> 00:31:54.793
I told my boys to catch him, and they caught him in Busan.

499
00:31:54.793 --> 00:31:56.823
But that jerk said...

500
00:31:57.192 --> 00:31:59.162
he didn't have money and that we should just kill him.

501
00:31:59.162 --> 00:32:00.323
So I just...

502
00:32:01.063 --> 00:32:03.063
wanted to kill him, but I didn't.

503
00:32:03.093 --> 00:32:04.563
We brought him here instead...

504
00:32:04.563 --> 00:32:07.333
and tried to sell his things.

505
00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:10.003
Excuse me. I'm the owner of the store next to his.

506
00:32:10.003 --> 00:32:12.142
- Oh, yes. - His store was closed for a month.

507
00:32:12.142 --> 00:32:14.972
Also, on the day that he opened up his restaurant,

508
00:32:14.972 --> 00:32:17.442
he and his wife had a big fight even though there were customers.

509
00:32:17.442 --> 00:32:19.942
Hey, have you found the victim's husband yet?

510
00:32:19.942 --> 00:32:22.212
He had run away already when I got here,

511
00:32:22.212 --> 00:32:24.353
but a patrol car came just in time.

512
00:32:24.353 --> 00:32:25.853
They blocked all possible escape routes,

513
00:32:25.853 --> 00:32:27.253
so he must be hiding somewhere around here.

514
00:32:27.253 --> 00:32:29.053
Search every corner, okay?

515
00:32:29.053 --> 00:32:30.593
- Yes, sir. - Okay.

516
00:32:31.622 --> 00:32:32.622
What?

517
00:32:33.023 --> 00:32:35.533
Detective Han. Isn't that Detective Han?

518
00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:48.473
Darn it. Who called him this time?

519
00:32:48.473 --> 00:32:49.913
Hey, stop him.

520
00:32:49.913 --> 00:32:51.113
I'm begging you to leave.

521
00:32:51.113 --> 00:32:53.882
I even had to wet my pants a bit to get this case.

522
00:32:53.882 --> 00:32:56.613
If we lose it again, our team will be dismissed.

523
00:32:56.613 --> 00:32:57.683
Is this the one?

524
00:32:58.022 --> 00:32:59.422
What's wrong with your hair?

525
00:32:59.422 --> 00:33:00.852
Did you starch it?

526
00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:03.053
This is what detectives apparently do.

527
00:33:03.352 --> 00:33:05.123
They catch the culprit after this.

528
00:33:06.093 --> 00:33:07.663
You don't have to find the culprit.

529
00:33:07.663 --> 00:33:10.902
We already know who it is, so just go. Okay?

530
00:33:11.303 --> 00:33:12.402
Oh, right.

531
00:33:12.533 --> 00:33:16.203
I clearly told you that you'd be working in the office from today.

532
00:33:16.402 --> 00:33:17.442
Didn't I?

533
00:33:19.042 --> 00:33:21.873
How dare you ignore me when I'm talking to you?

534
00:33:22.413 --> 00:33:23.473
- Hey. - You'll break his hand.

535
00:33:23.473 --> 00:33:24.882
Hey, what are you doing?

536
00:33:24.882 --> 00:33:25.942
- I'm sorry. - Are you okay?

537
00:33:25.942 --> 00:33:26.982
It hurts. Let it go.

538
00:33:26.982 --> 00:33:28.982
He keeps being rude to his superiors.

539
00:33:29.082 --> 00:33:31.422
- Gosh, my dear Detective Oh. - Captain.

540
00:33:31.422 --> 00:33:34.022
- So Tae, great work. - Sure.

541
00:33:34.022 --> 00:33:36.323
After all, he saved...

542
00:33:36.323 --> 00:33:38.993
our team. Well done.

543
00:33:38.993 --> 00:33:41.632
Wait. What are you guys doing here?

544
00:33:41.632 --> 00:33:43.863
So Tae found this first,

545
00:33:43.863 --> 00:33:45.863
so it's our case. You're aware of that, right?

546
00:33:45.863 --> 00:33:46.863
Get out of here!

547
00:33:46.863 --> 00:33:48.332
- Wait, but... - Sir, that's...

548
00:33:48.332 --> 00:33:50.203
- We've got this, okay? - Gosh.

549
00:33:50.303 --> 00:33:52.473
What happened? Didn't you limit access to the scene?

550
00:33:52.473 --> 00:33:55.413
The picture of the dead body is all over the internet now.

551
00:33:55.413 --> 00:33:57.812
When we got here, the body was completely exposed.

552
00:33:57.812 --> 00:34:00.953
There were people taking pictures of it. I couldn't stop it.

553
00:34:01.183 --> 00:34:02.553
Who did this?

554
00:34:02.553 --> 00:34:03.712
We believe it's her husband.

555
00:34:03.712 --> 00:34:06.022
He's hiding somewhere around here, so we'll find him soon.

556
00:34:06.022 --> 00:34:07.522
We'll finally score big time.

557
00:34:07.522 --> 00:34:09.553
- Let's not mess this up, okay? - Yes, sir.

558
00:34:09.922 --> 00:34:12.692
Help me! Help!

559
00:34:15.132 --> 00:34:16.792
- Do something. - What are you doing?

560
00:34:16.792 --> 00:34:18.602
Go to the back, and secure the access!

561
00:34:18.602 --> 00:34:20.332
- Yes, sir. - Move it, you brats!

562
00:34:22.973 --> 00:34:24.743
Hey, hey!

563
00:34:24.743 --> 00:34:25.803
Hey!

564
00:34:26.843 --> 00:34:29.272
All right. Let's talk this out.

565
00:34:29.272 --> 00:34:31.082
Release the woman, and let's talk.

566
00:34:31.082 --> 00:34:33.413
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

567
00:34:33.413 --> 00:34:35.013
I had a fight with my wife that day,

568
00:34:35.013 --> 00:34:37.323
left home, and came back today!

569
00:34:37.453 --> 00:34:38.482
Stay still.

570
00:34:38.623 --> 00:34:40.723
All right, I hear you. Let her go,

571
00:34:40.723 --> 00:34:42.093
and come on down.

572
00:34:42.223 --> 00:34:43.893
We got access through the back door,

573
00:34:43.893 --> 00:34:45.562
but it's dangerous to approach him because of the hostage.

574
00:34:45.562 --> 00:34:48.232
If you try to do something, I'll kill her!

575
00:34:48.232 --> 00:34:49.393
Gosh, wait.

576
00:34:49.393 --> 00:34:50.902
- Don't! - Be on standby.

577
00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:53.102
It's true! I didn't kill my wife!

578
00:34:53.732 --> 00:34:55.373
- Goodness. - You little...

579
00:34:57.303 --> 00:34:59.143
Darn it. Come here!

580
00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:02.013
No. Hey!

581
00:35:03.672 --> 00:35:05.343
- Goodness. - What was that?

582
00:35:06.643 --> 00:35:07.683
You jerk.

583
00:35:11.152 --> 00:35:12.352
Did he shoot it?

584
00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:14.022
Why does he have a gun?

585
00:35:16.752 --> 00:35:18.593
Send a medical team up to the rooftop.

586
00:35:19.123 --> 00:35:20.263
What...

587
00:35:20.522 --> 00:35:22.393
He took it. He took my gun.

588
00:35:22.393 --> 00:35:25.232
- It's not me. I didn't do it. - Stop it.

589
00:35:25.232 --> 00:35:26.663
- Give me the gun. - It's not me!

590
00:35:26.663 --> 00:35:27.873
My goodness. Hey.

591
00:35:27.873 --> 00:35:29.102
- This is the one. - Is it?

592
00:35:29.102 --> 00:35:30.132
Yes, sir.

593
00:35:30.473 --> 00:35:31.772
That punk.

594
00:35:35.643 --> 00:35:37.513
What's this? It was a banana?

595
00:35:38.743 --> 00:35:40.852
Is he really a man who killed his wife?

596
00:35:46.022 --> 00:35:47.823
- No. - Get off of me!

597
00:35:50.863 --> 00:35:52.493
What are you waiting for? Shoot him now!

598
00:35:52.493 --> 00:35:54.292
What are you doing? Shoot him!

599
00:35:56.732 --> 00:35:58.533
He has never fired a gun,

600
00:35:58.533 --> 00:36:00.303
but he hit it right in the center.

601
00:36:02.703 --> 00:36:05.473
We've caught the killer, and the case is closed now.

602
00:36:05.473 --> 00:36:06.772
He's not the one.

603
00:36:07.102 --> 00:36:09.473
Why did you bring him here?

604
00:36:09.772 --> 00:36:11.542
He's not the one who killed that woman.

605
00:36:11.542 --> 00:36:13.013
What is he saying?

606
00:36:13.082 --> 00:36:15.482
- Did he just speak to me casually? - Hold on.

607
00:36:15.852 --> 00:36:18.323
Why do you think he's not the one who killed her?

608
00:36:20.123 --> 00:36:21.123
Here.

609
00:36:22.093 --> 00:36:23.152
Raise it.

610
00:36:24.123 --> 00:36:25.723
Have you lost your mind?

611
00:36:25.723 --> 00:36:26.922
Look at this carefully.

612
00:36:27.632 --> 00:36:29.562
His middle finger is fine.

613
00:36:30.332 --> 00:36:32.102
So? What about it?

614
00:36:34.332 --> 00:36:35.473
Here.

615
00:36:36.533 --> 00:36:39.143
The mark is particularly faint around the middle finger.

616
00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:41.913
That means the killer is missing...

617
00:36:41.913 --> 00:36:44.143
his middle finger at least.

618
00:36:45.882 --> 00:36:47.652
Here. Raise it.

619
00:36:48.352 --> 00:36:49.783
- Raise it. - Goodness.

620
00:36:49.783 --> 00:36:52.882
That's why the ones with normal middle fingers aren't the killer.

621
00:36:53.582 --> 00:36:55.723
I think he's right.

622
00:36:57.393 --> 00:36:58.593
I really...

623
00:36:59.363 --> 00:37:00.993
had a fight with her,

624
00:37:00.993 --> 00:37:03.232
left home that day, and had a hard time...

625
00:37:03.232 --> 00:37:05.732
until those gangsters brought me here today.

626
00:37:05.933 --> 00:37:07.703
There must've been a robber in our restaurant.

627
00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:10.102
Jin Sook.

628
00:37:10.102 --> 00:37:11.303
Hey, hey!

629
00:37:11.303 --> 00:37:13.243
Jin Sook, I'm sorry.

630
00:37:14.343 --> 00:37:15.973
I'm sorry.

631
00:37:16.743 --> 00:37:18.482
- Honey. - What?

632
00:37:18.942 --> 00:37:21.683
I did something good. Give me my gun back.

633
00:37:23.613 --> 00:37:25.053
Give me my gun. Give it back.

634
00:37:25.053 --> 00:37:26.982
You're not in a good state yet.

635
00:37:26.982 --> 00:37:28.692
I'll give it back to you later.

636
00:37:28.692 --> 00:37:31.062
I'm fine. There is no problem!

637
00:37:31.123 --> 00:37:32.763
You saw how clean my shot was.

638
00:37:32.763 --> 00:37:35.763
You can't decide you're okay yourself! I decide it!

639
00:37:35.763 --> 00:37:36.933
Go!

640
00:37:37.962 --> 00:37:39.132
What's wrong with him?

641
00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:44.442
Moo Gang.

642
00:37:44.442 --> 00:37:46.873
You've been to Hope Mental Hospital, right?

643
00:37:48.772 --> 00:37:49.843
Hope?

644
00:37:50.473 --> 00:37:52.683
I have. Why?

645
00:37:54.082 --> 00:37:55.982
Really? Do you remember it?

646
00:37:55.982 --> 00:37:57.683
Why did you go there?

647
00:37:57.683 --> 00:37:59.283
You told me to, Crazy Dog.

648
00:37:59.283 --> 00:38:00.953
I'm not talking about that, you fool.

649
00:38:00.953 --> 00:38:02.652
It's before the director was murdered.

650
00:38:02.652 --> 00:38:05.062
You were on the security camera.

651
00:38:05.062 --> 00:38:07.663
I don't know. I can't remember.

652
00:38:07.663 --> 00:38:09.692
Is anyone in your family a psychiatrist...

653
00:38:09.692 --> 00:38:11.462
or a mental patient?

654
00:38:11.462 --> 00:38:13.232
What about your friends?

655
00:38:13.232 --> 00:38:14.332
I said I don't know.

656
00:38:14.402 --> 00:38:15.973
I already told you that I can't remember.

657
00:38:17.772 --> 00:38:19.703
Okay, okay.

658
00:38:20.143 --> 00:38:23.212
It's not our jurisdiction anyway. The others will take care of it.

659
00:38:24.582 --> 00:38:27.913
Moo Gang, can you really not remember anything?

660
00:38:28.013 --> 00:38:29.382
No, I can't!

661
00:38:30.312 --> 00:38:31.922
I can't remember anything!

662
00:38:32.922 --> 00:38:36.352
Gosh, okay. I get it. You didn't have to yell at me.

663
00:38:36.953 --> 00:38:38.692
Yes, is this Royeol Hospital?

664
00:38:38.692 --> 00:38:41.593
Do people change that drastically just because of memory loss?

665
00:38:41.593 --> 00:38:44.732
He used to be so nice, but he's so rude now.

666
00:38:44.732 --> 00:38:46.303
And he's even fine with looking at corpses.

667
00:38:46.502 --> 00:38:47.502
It's just so weird.

668
00:38:47.502 --> 00:38:49.703
He has a bullet stuck in his head.

669
00:38:51.143 --> 00:38:53.073
Let's just tell him to take a leave of absence.

670
00:38:53.073 --> 00:38:57.042
I talked to his doctor a while ago.

671
00:38:57.613 --> 00:38:59.442
There's apparently nothing wrong with his brain.

672
00:38:59.442 --> 00:39:02.053
The doctor thinks it's just a temporary phenomenon.

673
00:39:02.053 --> 00:39:04.382
But he said if we treat him differently because of that,

674
00:39:04.382 --> 00:39:06.323
he might go into shock.

675
00:39:06.652 --> 00:39:09.192
That means we need to treat him like we used to.

676
00:39:09.192 --> 00:39:11.062
That's the only thing that'll work on him.

677
00:39:11.263 --> 00:39:15.132
So even if he treats you with disrespect and does weird stuff,

678
00:39:15.763 --> 00:39:18.703
let's just try to understand him by thinking that...

679
00:39:18.863 --> 00:39:21.102
he's not in his normal state right now. Okay?

680
00:39:21.102 --> 00:39:23.272
- Yes, okay. - He makes me so angry.

681
00:39:23.272 --> 00:39:25.942
- What are you guys up to? - Hey.

682
00:39:27.373 --> 00:39:29.712
Why are you guys drinking coffee without me?

683
00:39:30.113 --> 00:39:31.643
Would you like some too?

684
00:39:31.743 --> 00:39:33.613
Give me that, you short-legged grandpa.

685
00:39:34.082 --> 00:39:35.152
What?

686
00:39:36.312 --> 00:39:37.623
Okay, go ahead.

687
00:39:42.652 --> 00:39:44.163
It tastes interesting.

688
00:39:45.623 --> 00:39:47.763
I understand why humans get addicted to this.

689
00:39:51.033 --> 00:39:52.102
Right, short-legged grandpa?

690
00:39:52.102 --> 00:39:54.402
- You piece of... Hey, let me go. - Calm down.

691
00:39:54.402 --> 00:39:56.832
- Sir, breathe. - Sir.

692
00:39:57.132 --> 00:39:59.272
Let's act naturally like we always did.

693
00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:00.942
Relax. Relax.

694
00:40:00.942 --> 00:40:02.843
(I don't think your father died because of an accident.)

695
00:40:06.082 --> 00:40:08.082
Where am I supposed to find the man who wrote this?

696
00:40:08.252 --> 00:40:10.783
An outrageous murder incident happened this morning.

697
00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:14.752
A woman in her 30s was found frozen...

698
00:40:14.752 --> 00:40:16.593
in her restaurant's freezer.

699
00:40:16.852 --> 00:40:19.292
Her husband is suspected of having murdered her.

700
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:20.292
- Move! - My gosh.

701
00:40:20.292 --> 00:40:21.663
I'm so sorry.

702
00:40:22.893 --> 00:40:24.433
The police are currently investigating him.

703
00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:27.163
Her body was found in the middle of the street this morning.

704
00:40:27.163 --> 00:40:28.303
In just 10 minutes,

705
00:40:28.303 --> 00:40:30.533
- No way. Could it be that woman? - many people started...

706
00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:34.643
uploading photos on the internet, and the police are now...

707
00:40:40.013 --> 00:40:42.982
Fine. Let's just put on a thick face...

708
00:40:43.082 --> 00:40:45.183
and ask Moo Gang for one last favor.

709
00:40:54.863 --> 00:40:56.763
What? Where did my shoelaces go?

710
00:41:07.812 --> 00:41:08.942
Wait.

711
00:41:09.073 --> 00:41:11.513
I stole your contact information from the police station.

712
00:41:13.143 --> 00:41:14.152
Yes.

713
00:41:15.212 --> 00:41:16.913
He might agree to help me.

714
00:41:17.082 --> 00:41:19.252
(Freezer Murder Incident)

715
00:41:19.252 --> 00:41:22.422
After they had a huge fight because of their debt,

716
00:41:22.422 --> 00:41:25.123
Lee Yong Sik, the husband, ends up leaving home.

717
00:41:25.723 --> 00:41:27.863
And ever since then,

718
00:41:27.863 --> 00:41:31.263
they haven't opened the restaurant for around a month.

719
00:41:31.433 --> 00:41:34.973
I looked into Lee Yong Sik's alibi.

720
00:41:34.973 --> 00:41:38.002
And like he claimed, I've confirmed that he's been staying at Busan...

721
00:41:38.102 --> 00:41:41.113
while working at a dry sauna there.

722
00:41:44.442 --> 00:41:48.513
Hey, what's Moo Gang doing in someone else's seat?

723
00:41:48.613 --> 00:41:50.152
He's sullen because he hasn't gotten his gun back.

724
00:41:51.252 --> 00:41:53.223
I'll tell you something as someone...

725
00:41:53.223 --> 00:41:55.123
who's been doing this for a very long time.

726
00:41:55.123 --> 00:41:57.863
These kind of murders mostly happen because of revenge.

727
00:41:57.962 --> 00:42:01.132
So look into people who used to have a bad relationship with the victim.

728
00:42:01.132 --> 00:42:03.033
- Okay? - Yes, sir.

729
00:42:03.962 --> 00:42:06.002
I really can't bear to listen to this.

730
00:42:07.473 --> 00:42:08.632
What?

731
00:42:09.073 --> 00:42:11.143
What can't you bear to listen to?

732
00:42:11.303 --> 00:42:13.803
Hey, short-legged grandpa.

733
00:42:14.542 --> 00:42:16.413
This didn't happen because of revenge.

734
00:42:16.942 --> 00:42:18.013
And why do you think so?

735
00:42:19.113 --> 00:42:21.382
Why don't you think she got murdered because of revenge?

736
00:42:21.382 --> 00:42:23.283
Will you give me back my gun if I tell you?

737
00:42:23.283 --> 00:42:25.582
Okay, I'll give it to you if you're able to convince me.

738
00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:27.323
Fine.

739
00:42:27.593 --> 00:42:28.593
What?

740
00:42:28.593 --> 00:42:30.692
Hey, why are you heading over there?

741
00:42:33.522 --> 00:42:36.363
Like I told you before, this person got murdered because of revenge.

742
00:42:38.002 --> 00:42:41.073
The murderer was full of hatred.

743
00:42:44.942 --> 00:42:48.913
But this murder was emotionless.

744
00:42:49.113 --> 00:42:52.312
The murderer just killed her by giving her the utmost pain.

745
00:42:52.312 --> 00:42:53.482
It was a coldhearted murder.

746
00:42:54.683 --> 00:42:56.582
The murderer's emotions were as cold...

747
00:42:57.053 --> 00:42:58.323
as ice.

748
00:42:59.053 --> 00:43:01.993
An emotionless murder?

749
00:43:02.152 --> 00:43:03.223
This victim...

750
00:43:05.263 --> 00:43:07.022
didn't choke to death.

751
00:43:08.393 --> 00:43:09.993
She froze to death.

752
00:43:10.232 --> 00:43:11.763
It's a kind of torture.

753
00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:13.663
Torture?

754
00:43:16.772 --> 00:43:19.703
Why? Did she join the independence movement?

755
00:43:19.703 --> 00:43:21.542
Did she take part in the pro-democracy movement?

756
00:43:22.743 --> 00:43:24.613
What kind of era do you think we're living in?

757
00:43:24.613 --> 00:43:27.082
Just go home, you punk!

758
00:43:27.312 --> 00:43:29.312
My gosh, I listened carefully for nothing.

759
00:43:31.183 --> 00:43:32.252
What?

760
00:43:32.953 --> 00:43:34.123
Okay.

761
00:43:36.192 --> 00:43:37.593
This is crazy.

762
00:43:38.623 --> 00:43:39.763
I can't believe this.

763
00:43:40.163 --> 00:43:41.363
- Why? - What is it?

764
00:43:41.792 --> 00:43:43.632
I just got a call from the NISI.

765
00:43:44.303 --> 00:43:47.732
And they just told me that the victim froze to death.

766
00:43:48.602 --> 00:43:49.933
The murderer froze her when she was still alive.

767
00:43:55.812 --> 00:43:56.812
Moo Gang.

768
00:43:57.113 --> 00:43:58.613
Are you completely sure that...

769
00:43:58.613 --> 00:44:01.712
the victim died because of torture?

770
00:44:02.312 --> 00:44:04.352
Why would anyone torture her?

771
00:44:04.352 --> 00:44:05.382
I don't know.

772
00:44:06.922 --> 00:44:10.022
But don't humans normally torture people when they want information?

773
00:44:10.123 --> 00:44:13.363
What kind of information? What do you think that was?

774
00:44:13.663 --> 00:44:15.263
How am I supposed to know?

775
00:44:15.893 --> 00:44:17.632
Okay, fine.

776
00:44:17.803 --> 00:44:20.803
If that murderer was coldblooded like you told us,

777
00:44:21.332 --> 00:44:23.203
there's no way he would've just...

778
00:44:23.203 --> 00:44:25.803
left her corpse in the restaurant.

779
00:44:26.843 --> 00:44:28.042
Crazy Dog.

780
00:44:28.672 --> 00:44:31.143
You seem to be the smartest one here.

781
00:44:31.143 --> 00:44:33.113
- You little... - Hey, calm down.

782
00:44:33.113 --> 00:44:34.882
Relax. Relax.

783
00:44:34.882 --> 00:44:37.482
- It's a warning. - What? What warning?

784
00:44:38.382 --> 00:44:41.493
The murderer wants to scare someone by showing them the victim's corpse.

785
00:44:42.522 --> 00:44:45.893
I don't get why humans get so scared every time they see a corpse.

786
00:44:46.922 --> 00:44:49.163
Humans are so petty and uncivilized.

787
00:44:50.093 --> 00:44:51.732
So are you saying the murderer...

788
00:44:51.962 --> 00:44:56.033
purposely left the corpse in the freezer to scare someone...

789
00:44:56.732 --> 00:44:59.203
because that murderer knew that the corpse would one day be found?

790
00:44:59.973 --> 00:45:01.143
That's correct.

791
00:45:01.143 --> 00:45:03.913
And the stupid fool who saw the corpse is probably...

792
00:45:03.913 --> 00:45:05.482
hiding somewhere, shaking in fear.

793
00:45:07.042 --> 00:45:08.312
Jin Sook.

794
00:45:09.613 --> 00:45:10.982
Then does that mean that...

795
00:45:11.882 --> 00:45:14.393
this won't be the last murder?

796
00:45:15.093 --> 00:45:18.893
That means the guy who has no middle finger might kill someone again.

797
00:45:19.022 --> 00:45:20.163
Probably.

798
00:45:20.962 --> 00:45:23.033
If his warning doesn't work, that is.

799
00:45:24.763 --> 00:45:26.132
And there's one more thing.

800
00:45:29.433 --> 00:45:31.102
I can see from the corpse that...

801
00:45:31.203 --> 00:45:33.143
it's been around a month since she died.

802
00:45:34.573 --> 00:45:37.913
Look at him talking nonsense after getting one thing right.

803
00:45:37.913 --> 00:45:39.982
Hey, it's impossible for anyone to...

804
00:45:39.982 --> 00:45:43.183
know when someone died just by looking at the corpse.

805
00:45:43.183 --> 00:45:45.022
How dare he try to lie to us?

806
00:45:45.223 --> 00:45:47.593
Do you have the victim's autopsy results?

807
00:45:47.593 --> 00:45:50.763
Yes. She apparently died 3 to 4 weeks ago.

808
00:45:50.763 --> 00:45:52.462
- 3 to 4 weeks ago? - Yes.

809
00:45:54.632 --> 00:45:57.933
I always see human corpses. This is just a piece of cake.

810
00:46:00.533 --> 00:46:01.732
My gosh.

811
00:46:01.973 --> 00:46:03.203
Hey, short-legged grandpa.

812
00:46:05.303 --> 00:46:06.473
Yes?

813
00:46:07.542 --> 00:46:08.913
Give me back my gun.

814
00:46:09.042 --> 00:46:10.272
No, you can't.

815
00:46:10.272 --> 00:46:11.382
Give it back.

816
00:46:11.812 --> 00:46:12.942
Follow me.

817
00:46:12.942 --> 00:46:14.413
No, you can't.

818
00:46:14.553 --> 00:46:15.913
You can't give it to him.

819
00:46:22.352 --> 00:46:23.652
Be careful when you use it.

820
00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:27.893
- Hey, stop it. - Come on. Stop it.

821
00:46:30.132 --> 00:46:31.703
- My gosh. - Put that down.

822
00:46:31.803 --> 00:46:33.263
- Hey! - Stop it!

823
00:46:33.263 --> 00:46:35.632
- That reckless punk. - What's he doing?

824
00:46:35.632 --> 00:46:37.373
- My gosh, stop it. - That's enough.

825
00:46:37.873 --> 00:46:39.442
I'm sorry, Jin Sook.

826
00:46:43.272 --> 00:46:45.042
It's all my fault.

827
00:46:46.582 --> 00:46:48.212
It's all my fault.

828
00:46:54.123 --> 00:46:55.123
No way.

829
00:46:56.752 --> 00:46:59.163
She couldn't have spilled any information about me, right?

830
00:47:01.962 --> 00:47:03.033
No.

831
00:47:05.062 --> 00:47:07.902
He would've come for me if she did.

832
00:47:21.582 --> 00:47:23.113
Don't be scared.

833
00:47:23.482 --> 00:47:25.453
I'm not the one who killed your friend.

834
00:47:31.493 --> 00:47:32.993
Long time no see, Sun Young.

835
00:47:33.223 --> 00:47:34.863
Can you recognize me now?

836
00:47:38.332 --> 00:47:42.102
This jerk uses the same method as he used to 20 years ago.

837
00:47:42.373 --> 00:47:43.672
I just...

838
00:47:44.002 --> 00:47:46.442
escaped from the mental hospital.

839
00:47:47.442 --> 00:47:49.542
So I want you to help me with something.

840

(Royeol Insurance)

841
00:47:54.212 --> 00:47:56.453
Why did he ask me to meet him here?

842
00:48:02.493 --> 00:48:05.022
What's this guy doing here?

843
00:48:06.522 --> 00:48:07.993
Is he a model?

What?

846
00:48:15.303 --> 00:48:16.803
Chunsu Insurance...

847
00:48:17.542 --> 00:48:19.172
became Royeol Insurance?

848
00:48:21.513 --> 00:48:22.542
Excuse me.

849
00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:25.843
Excuse me, is there a man named Lee Jung Bae working here?

850
00:48:32.223 --> 00:48:33.652
Okay.

851
00:48:34.993 --> 00:48:37.323
What? Hey, you're here.

852
00:48:38.462 --> 00:48:40.263

(President, Oh Man Soo)

00:48:41.993 --> 00:48:44.132
(Employee Search, Lee Jung Bae)

855
00:48:44.602 --> 00:48:47.672
He retired right before Chunsu Insurance became Royeol Insurance.

856
00:48:47.672 --> 00:48:49.703
- He quit? - Yes.

857
00:48:49.703 --> 00:48:52.942
Then do you at least have his address?

858
00:48:53.843 --> 00:48:55.812
I don't think this will be of any use.

859
00:48:56.042 --> 00:48:58.513
He quit because he had plans to emigrate abroad.

860
00:48:58.513 --> 00:49:01.812
Then can I check the insurance records of a client...

861
00:49:01.812 --> 00:49:04.382
named Kang Soo Hyuk?

862
00:49:05.152 --> 00:49:08.252
He's my father. He passed away.

863
00:49:08.292 --> 00:49:10.422
Oh, okay. Was it Kang Soo Hyuk?

864
00:49:11.263 --> 00:49:13.062
Kang Soo Hyuk.

865
00:49:14.093 --> 00:49:15.393
(No client information exists under that name.)

866
00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:18.303
Are you sure he used to be a client at Chunsu Insurance?

867
00:49:18.402 --> 00:49:21.203
He must've been. That's probably why...

868
00:49:21.203 --> 00:49:22.873
Lee Jung Bae took part...

869
00:49:22.873 --> 00:49:26.042
in investigating my dad's death.

870
00:49:26.042 --> 00:49:28.212
Yes, it could've been that.

871
00:49:28.212 --> 00:49:31.413
Or it could've been because your dad was involved in...

872
00:49:31.413 --> 00:49:33.843
another client's murder incident.

873
00:49:36.613 --> 00:49:37.683
I see.

874
00:49:38.082 --> 00:49:39.183
Don't be too disappointed.

875
00:49:39.183 --> 00:49:42.393
The company might still have the investigation materials.

876
00:49:42.393 --> 00:49:44.663
Would you like me to look for them?

877
00:49:47.863 --> 00:49:50.093
Thank you. Thank you.

878
00:49:50.093 --> 00:49:51.232
Just a second.

879
00:49:52.902 --> 00:49:55.203
Hey, I'd like you to find a document for me.

880
00:49:55.203 --> 00:49:57.402
It's a document from 20 years ago. It's from 1997...

881
00:49:57.402 --> 00:49:58.803
when it used to be Chunsu Insurance.

882
00:49:59.772 --> 00:50:00.772
What?

883
00:50:02.672 --> 00:50:04.913
Okay, I understand.

884
00:50:05.812 --> 00:50:07.143
What did they say?

885
00:50:07.143 --> 00:50:08.252
That's weird.

886
00:50:08.252 --> 00:50:11.582
Everything from 1997 aren't in the database.

887
00:50:16.223 --> 00:50:18.692
But all the documents from Chunsu Insurance...

888
00:50:18.692 --> 00:50:20.363
are also kept in paper copies.

889
00:50:20.363 --> 00:50:22.993
So the documents from 1997 might still exist.

890
00:50:23.393 --> 00:50:24.462
What do you say?

891
00:50:25.062 --> 00:50:27.203
Should I ask my employee...

892
00:50:27.203 --> 00:50:28.973
to look for it file by file?

893
00:50:28.973 --> 00:50:30.873
Would that be okay?

894
00:50:30.873 --> 00:50:32.243
Don't you know who I am?

895
00:50:32.243 --> 00:50:35.013
I'm the president of this company.

896
00:50:35.712 --> 00:50:38.413
Thank you. Thank you so much.

897
00:50:38.413 --> 00:50:40.613
Her cell phone was turned off.

898
00:50:40.613 --> 00:50:43.513
So when I went to her house because I got worried, but no one was there.

899
00:50:44.382 --> 00:50:47.223
Plus, the restaurant she had opened with her husband wasn't even open.

900
00:50:47.223 --> 00:50:49.652
But are you saying that she died?

901
00:50:49.652 --> 00:50:51.363
Yes, she died.

902
00:50:52.462 --> 00:50:54.292
By any chance, are there any employees...

903
00:50:55.033 --> 00:50:57.462
who have a missing middle finger or a missing joint...

904
00:50:57.462 --> 00:50:59.732
on their right hand?

905
00:50:59.933 --> 00:51:02.533
No, there's no one like that.

906
00:51:02.533 --> 00:51:04.703
Then is there anyone who weren't on good terms...

907
00:51:04.703 --> 00:51:06.473
with Ms. Han Jin Sook?

908
00:51:06.473 --> 00:51:09.312
No. She had a really nice personality.

909
00:51:09.312 --> 00:51:11.482
Even her customer evaluation was always great.

910
00:51:11.482 --> 00:51:13.413
I see. Okay.

911
00:51:14.053 --> 00:51:15.913
May I meet your president before I leave?

912
00:51:15.913 --> 00:51:17.522
Sure, come with me.

913
00:51:17.522 --> 00:51:18.783
Okay.

914
00:51:21.553 --> 00:51:22.723
Moo Gang.

915
00:51:23.192 --> 00:51:25.223
Stay here, and wait for me to come back.

916
00:51:30.962 --> 00:51:32.163
Bye.

917
00:51:37.002 --> 00:51:39.942
Sip Gyeon, my brother. Where did he go?

918
00:51:39.942 --> 00:51:41.212
- Hey. - Hello, sir.

919
00:51:41.212 --> 00:51:42.212
Have you seen Sip Gyeon?

920
00:51:42.212 --> 00:51:44.582
He's playing with the Planning Team's employees.

921
00:51:45.643 --> 00:51:47.852
I wonder if they sterilized their hands before touching him.

922
00:51:47.852 --> 00:51:50.953
Sir, wait. He's the president of our company.

923
00:51:50.953 --> 00:51:51.953
Nice to meet you.

924
00:51:56.652 --> 00:51:57.723
Bang.

925
00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:07.672
What are you doing, you old dog? Go away.

926
00:52:08.203 --> 00:52:09.303
Leave.

927
00:52:09.703 --> 00:52:11.542
Why is there a dog in the company?

928
00:52:16.573 --> 00:52:18.613
Let me go! Let me go!

929
00:52:19.082 --> 00:52:21.113
- Are you okay? - Let me go!

930
00:52:22.183 --> 00:52:24.183
My gosh, are you okay?

931
00:52:26.482 --> 00:52:29.022
How could you bite him?

932
00:52:29.022 --> 00:52:32.323
One of my employees is the victim of that recent freezer murder?

933
00:52:33.723 --> 00:52:34.763
Yes.

934
00:52:35.332 --> 00:52:39.433
Can you tell your employees to cooperate with our investigation?

935
00:52:39.433 --> 00:52:41.832
Yes, of course. I'll announce that to everyone.

936
00:52:41.832 --> 00:52:42.933
We should all cooperate as much as we can.

937
00:52:42.933 --> 00:52:44.102
Okay, thank you.

938
00:52:44.102 --> 00:52:45.442
I'll be off now.

939
00:52:45.442 --> 00:52:46.843
Okay. Bye.

940
00:52:48.343 --> 00:52:49.613
Bye.

941
00:52:50.243 --> 00:52:51.382
Bye.

942
00:52:54.613 --> 00:52:57.013
Who's Han Jin Sook?

943
00:52:59.852 --> 00:53:01.752
Sir, we have a problem.

944
00:53:01.752 --> 00:53:02.823
What?

945
00:53:05.893 --> 00:53:07.292
I'm so sorry.

946
00:53:07.292 --> 00:53:10.732
Sip Gyeon has never bitten anyone in his life.

947
00:53:10.732 --> 00:53:12.303
He's normally a really nice dog.

948
00:53:12.803 --> 00:53:14.232
I wonder why he bit you.

949
00:53:14.232 --> 00:53:16.033
I really can't understand why.

950
00:53:18.743 --> 00:53:20.442
Did you hit him?

951
00:53:23.913 --> 00:53:26.442
What's that dog's identity?

952
00:53:26.442 --> 00:53:27.752
You're quick-witted.

953
00:53:28.882 --> 00:53:30.352
You must know a lot about dogs.

954
00:53:30.352 --> 00:53:32.382
Yes, that's right. Let me tell you a little about my brother.

955
00:53:32.382 --> 00:53:33.652
He's the descendant of a Saint Bernard,

956
00:53:33.652 --> 00:53:34.893
the dog that's good at finding corpses.

957
00:53:34.893 --> 00:53:35.893
What?

958
00:53:36.893 --> 00:53:38.192
The dog that's good at finding corpses?

959
00:53:38.323 --> 00:53:39.323
Yes.

960
00:53:39.422 --> 00:53:41.632
Did he smell the dead Han Moo Gang?

961
00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:45.832
Well, to be exact, he's a descendant of that breed from...

962
00:53:45.832 --> 00:53:49.272
eight generations ago. He's actually mixed with a lot of other dogs.

963
00:53:49.272 --> 00:53:51.002
That's why he kind of looks like a bulldog...

964
00:53:51.002 --> 00:53:53.243
and keeps doing weird stuff like eating his own feces and urine.

965
00:53:53.573 --> 00:53:54.743
But if you go up his family ladder,

966
00:53:54.743 --> 00:53:56.513
he definitely has the blood of a Saint Bernard.

967
00:53:56.513 --> 00:53:58.982
I guess he smelled the dead body of Han Moo Gang.

968
00:53:59.482 --> 00:54:00.953
I should be careful from now on.

969
00:54:01.783 --> 00:54:03.453
It's all done now.

970
00:54:08.953 --> 00:54:10.123
Wait here.

971
00:54:10.123 --> 00:54:11.763
I'll pay for your treatment.

972
00:54:43.202 --> 00:54:44.273
What?

973
00:54:45.372 --> 00:54:46.932
Did you just avoid bumping into me?

974
00:54:49.742 --> 00:54:50.972
Can you see me?

975
00:54:52.943 --> 00:54:55.582
Yes, I'm at the hospital.

976
00:54:57.653 --> 00:54:58.682
Yes.

977
00:55:01.253 --> 00:55:02.323
That's right.

978
00:55:03.452 --> 00:55:05.122
Okay, I'll be right there.

979
00:55:05.593 --> 00:55:06.622
Okay.

980
00:55:07.622 --> 00:55:09.023
Yes, okay.

981
00:55:09.323 --> 00:55:10.492
Maybe not.

982
00:55:17.573 --> 00:55:19.102
Hurry up.

983
00:55:25.543 --> 00:55:27.682
Why did he have to emigrate abroad?

984
00:55:27.943 --> 00:55:29.742
He didn't even leave behind his contact number abroad.

985
00:55:31.483 --> 00:55:33.983
I wish I'd at least be able to find the documents.

986
00:55:36.852 --> 00:55:38.693
I'm going to catch the culprit no matter what,

987
00:55:39.023 --> 00:55:40.823
and make that person pay for my dad's death.

988
00:55:43.323 --> 00:55:45.332
Sip Gyeon, my brother...

989
00:55:48.432 --> 00:55:52.173
My gosh, what are you doing here?

990
00:56:10.222 --> 00:56:11.892
I'm sorry.

991
00:56:16.863 --> 00:56:19.762
It took you 20 beatings to say that today.

992
00:56:20.563 --> 00:56:22.463
You must've become quite resilient.

993
00:56:22.463 --> 00:56:24.403
What do you think you did wrong this time?

994
00:56:27.202 --> 00:56:28.602
(Victim of the Freezer Murder Was an Employee at Royeol Insurance)

995
00:56:28.602 --> 00:56:29.872
(Due to the Freezer Murder, Royeol Insurance's Credibility Plummets)

996
00:56:29.872 --> 00:56:31.872
How long has it been since you started working here?

997
00:56:32.213 --> 00:56:34.142
How could you fail to stop articles like this from getting published?

998
00:56:34.313 --> 00:56:36.543
I now understand why an employee at our company would proudly say...

999
00:56:36.543 --> 00:56:39.713
that he signed up as our competing insurance company's client.

1000
00:56:40.883 --> 00:56:44.523
Countless people are canceling their insurance contract with us.

1001
00:56:44.852 --> 00:56:47.293
I didn't even know about these articles.

1002
00:56:47.293 --> 00:56:49.093
How am I supposed to sell this company to China...

1003
00:56:50.463 --> 00:56:52.363
if these kind of articles just got published?

1004
00:56:52.463 --> 00:56:53.762
I'm sorry.

1005
00:56:54.503 --> 00:56:55.633
I'll...

1006
00:56:56.503 --> 00:56:58.003
do a better job.

1007
00:57:01.102 --> 00:57:02.503
I never told you to do a better job.

1008
00:57:02.742 --> 00:57:04.372
Just don't do anything.

1009
00:57:04.372 --> 00:57:06.972
Don't try to do anything for the company.

1010
00:57:06.972 --> 00:57:08.483
Just keep fooling around...

1011
00:57:08.483 --> 00:57:10.443
with those celebrity friends of yours like you always do.

1012
00:57:11.912 --> 00:57:12.983
Sir.

1013
00:57:14.323 --> 00:57:16.023
I'll be sure to accomplish things...

1014
00:57:16.753 --> 00:57:18.323
so that the company doesn't go under.

1015
00:57:21.423 --> 00:57:22.863
You and your lowborn blood.

1016
00:57:24.032 --> 00:57:27.233
Is that why your brain doesn't work? Do you not understand what I said?

1017
00:57:27.233 --> 00:57:29.032
I don't need you to accomplish anything!

1018
00:57:30.673 --> 00:57:32.832
Just leave things as they are now.

1019
00:57:32.832 --> 00:57:35.242
I need you to report things to me so that we can prevent such articles.

1020
00:57:35.242 --> 00:57:37.242
That's why I gave you this position. You got that?

1021
00:57:38.443 --> 00:57:39.573
Okay.

1022
00:57:40.512 --> 00:57:41.742
I'll do as you say.

1023
00:58:01.963 --> 00:58:05.233
(Resume, Name: Han Jin Sook)

1024
00:58:06.202 --> 00:58:08.543
What? This woman...

1025
00:58:08.543 --> 00:58:10.573
I work as an insurance planner at Royeol Insurance.

1026
00:58:10.573 --> 00:58:12.613
My name is Han Jin Sook.

1027
00:58:13.912 --> 00:58:15.582
It's her. That's right.

1028
00:58:16.213 --> 00:58:17.582
The shadow of death.

1029
00:58:17.813 --> 00:58:19.452
She'll die soon too.

1030
00:58:19.912 --> 00:58:21.052
I'm getting goosebumps.

1031
00:58:23.352 --> 00:58:25.952
That woman must really be a fortune-teller.

1032
00:58:26.492 --> 00:58:27.563
Hang on.

1033
00:58:29.693 --> 00:58:30.832
Miss!

1034
00:58:31.332 --> 00:58:33.563
Where did she go? Goodness. Miss!

1035
00:58:34.133 --> 00:58:36.262
Gosh, this woman is really something.

1036
00:58:36.432 --> 00:58:38.073
She got the rent deposit back.

1037
00:58:38.372 --> 00:58:41.202
Is she moving out or what?

1038
00:58:43.242 --> 00:58:44.573
Miss!

1039
00:58:47.343 --> 00:58:48.582
Miss!

1040
00:58:52.182 --> 00:58:53.512
Hi, Ms. Fortune-teller.

1041
00:58:54.782 --> 00:58:56.052
Miss!

1042
00:58:57.222 --> 00:58:59.193
- What are you doing here? - What?

1043
00:59:01.793 --> 00:59:04.432
- Why is your place so messy? - Did you find the document?

1044
00:59:05.363 --> 00:59:08.832
Well, I'm doing my best to find it.

1045
00:59:09.463 --> 00:59:10.972
I thought you found it already.

1046
00:59:12.102 --> 00:59:14.503
What's up? Why are you here?

1047
00:59:15.372 --> 00:59:18.012
Do you remember that woman you said will die soon?

1048
00:59:18.912 --> 00:59:20.043
She got killed.

1049
00:59:20.313 --> 00:59:21.582
Is she...

1050
00:59:22.282 --> 00:59:24.182
the woman who died in the freezer?

1051
00:59:24.253 --> 00:59:25.452
Did you see it on the news?

1052
00:59:25.613 --> 00:59:29.023
Right, the video of her body is going viral on social media.

1053
00:59:29.323 --> 00:59:30.352
Yes, it is her.

1054
00:59:31.852 --> 00:59:34.463
Gosh, so what? Why are you here?

1055
00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:37.332
I'm just really curious.

1056
00:59:38.293 --> 00:59:39.793
What kind of spirit do you channel?

1057
00:59:39.793 --> 00:59:42.202
An enlightened person? An army general? A kid? An old lady?

1058
00:59:42.863 --> 00:59:44.903
If you keep going on with your nonsense,

1059
00:59:46.602 --> 00:59:49.343
you might experience a whole new level of craziness when I lose it.

1060
00:59:49.472 --> 00:59:51.113
Leave. Get out of my place!

1061
00:59:51.113 --> 00:59:53.372
Gosh, don't get me wrong. Please calm down. Let's sit down.

1062
00:59:53.372 --> 00:59:54.443
Oh, sorry.

1063
00:59:55.912 --> 00:59:58.613
I'd like to make a surprising offer to you.

1064
00:59:58.613 --> 01:00:01.423
That's why I came all the way to this shabby place of yours.

1065
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:04.653
- An offer? - Aren't you about to be evicted...

1066
01:00:04.653 --> 01:00:05.852
because you can't pay your rent deposit?

1067
01:00:07.892 --> 01:00:10.093
How about a six-figure salary? If you join Royeol Insurance,

1068
01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:11.863
you'll make 100,000 dollars a year and get full benefits.

1069
01:00:11.863 --> 01:00:13.162
You'll also get 400 percent bonus.

1070
01:00:13.162 --> 01:00:16.633
What's the job for? Even a newbie gets paid that much?

1071
01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:18.773
It's very simple.

1072
01:00:19.602 --> 01:00:22.742
What we need is your ability, your clairvoyance.

1073
01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.613
- Sorry? - To put it simply,

1074
01:00:26.173 --> 01:00:30.343
insurance investigators investigate into causes of death after the fact.

1075
01:00:30.343 --> 01:00:31.952
But in your case,

1076
01:00:32.182 --> 01:00:36.682
you'll investigate before the deaths occur.

1077
01:00:36.682 --> 01:00:39.122
Why though? Why is such a thing necessary?

1078
01:00:40.552 --> 01:00:41.793
That's...

1079
01:00:44.492 --> 01:00:47.063
To tell you the truth, I'm about to lose my job as the CEO...

1080
01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:49.302
even though I was appointed only a few days ago.

1081
01:00:49.503 --> 01:00:52.633
I must make sure we can show some results,

1082
01:00:52.802 --> 01:00:56.043
but it'll take a long time to get more customers.

1083
01:00:56.872 --> 01:01:00.543
It's practically impossible now because our employee died.

1084
01:01:05.113 --> 01:01:06.952
There's only one way.

1085
01:01:08.153 --> 01:01:10.153
We must reduce the amount of our insurance payouts.

1086
01:01:10.552 --> 01:01:13.823
We pay our VVIP customers a lot because of their life insurances.

1087
01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:14.992
So...

1088
01:01:15.622 --> 01:01:19.563
are you asking me to prevent their expensive deaths?

1089
01:01:20.733 --> 01:01:22.662
You're a piece of trash.

1090
01:01:22.662 --> 01:01:24.472
- Trash? - Hey, get out. Get lost.

1091
01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:25.832
- Gosh, wait. - Get lost!

1092
01:01:25.832 --> 01:01:27.073
If you want more money...

1093
01:01:27.802 --> 01:01:30.173
- How about 200,000 dollars? - Are you deaf?

1094
01:01:30.173 --> 01:01:31.613
I told you I don't want the job. Get out.

1095
01:01:31.613 --> 01:01:32.843
- Get out right now! - Hang on a second.

1096
01:01:32.843 --> 01:01:36.313
- Please consider my offer. - I told you to get out. Get out.

1097
01:01:36.543 --> 01:01:38.483
- Leave. Get out of my place. - Please think about it.

1098
01:01:42.682 --> 01:01:44.552
Ms. Fortune-teller.

1099
01:01:44.923 --> 01:01:46.593
If you want more than 200,000, we can negotiate!

1100
01:01:49.023 --> 01:01:50.563
Joon almost died.

1101
01:01:51.963 --> 01:01:54.233
I won't try to save anyone's life ever again.

1102
01:01:55.602 --> 01:01:58.332
I should visit that loser's sister again at her school.

1103
01:02:01.102 --> 01:02:03.003
Goodness, where do you think you're going?

1104
01:02:06.012 --> 01:02:08.343
It's Han Jin Sook's call history for a month before she died.

1105
01:02:08.343 --> 01:02:11.082
We don't have time, so each of you should call 30 numbers. Start now!

1106
01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:12.552
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

1107
01:02:13.052 --> 01:02:14.753
The youngest one should go first.

1108
01:02:14.753 --> 01:02:15.883
- Okay. - Got it.

1109
01:02:18.323 --> 01:02:20.762
Moo Gang, where are you going? You need to call these numbers!

1110
01:02:24.963 --> 01:02:27.662
Hello? I'm calling from Seoun Police Station.

1111
01:02:28.032 --> 01:02:30.702
At around 5pm on September 4...

1112
01:02:39.912 --> 01:02:41.313
Do you know Han Jin Sook?

1113
01:02:42.113 --> 01:02:43.242
Are you the killer?

1114
01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:55.262
You killed Han Jin Sook, didn't you?

1115
01:02:56.863 --> 01:02:58.432
Tell me the truth. You killed her, right?

1116
01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:02.403
What was that about?

1117
01:03:03.202 --> 01:03:06.432
Why did he swear at me? These uncivilized, crude humans.

1118
01:03:06.673 --> 01:03:09.073
Hey, can you guys do something about that idiot?

1119
01:03:10.813 --> 01:03:12.242
Hey, don't call.

1120
01:03:12.412 --> 01:03:14.412
I'll do it. I'll just do it for you. Don't call anyone else.

1121
01:03:14.412 --> 01:03:15.782
I have to do my job. As a detective...

1122
01:03:15.782 --> 01:03:18.753
I'll do it for you! Forget it, seriously. I'll do it.

1123
01:03:23.782 --> 01:03:24.852
(My darling Soo Wan)

1124
01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:28.162
What's this? "My darling Soo Wan"? Who is this?

1125
01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:31.992
Hey, why are you calling your girlfriend?

1126
01:03:31.992 --> 01:03:33.133
Just hang up.

1127
01:03:33.432 --> 01:03:35.233
This number is on this list.

1128
01:03:35.503 --> 01:03:36.903
My darling Soo Wan...

1129
01:03:42.972 --> 01:03:44.242
You know this woman, right?

1130
01:03:50.983 --> 01:03:55.622
Yes. I bought an insurance plan from her a month ago.

1131
01:03:56.122 --> 01:03:57.253
Why do you ask?

1132
01:03:57.253 --> 01:03:58.423
Insurance?

1133
01:04:03.693 --> 01:04:05.233
How do you know her?

1134
01:04:06.093 --> 01:04:08.302
She came to the hospital due to a collision accident.

1135
01:04:09.162 --> 01:04:11.903
I got a plan from her because I felt bad for her.

1136
01:04:13.972 --> 01:04:16.673
She was murdered a little while ago.

1137
01:04:17.372 --> 01:04:18.472
Pardon me?

1138
01:04:19.813 --> 01:04:21.043
She died?

1139
01:04:22.843 --> 01:04:25.052
You spoke with her on the phone, right?

1140
01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:31.293
She called me to thank me for buying the insurance plan from her.

1141
01:04:31.722 --> 01:04:33.693
She told me that she'd send me a gift.

1142
01:04:33.693 --> 01:04:34.963
Was that all?

1143
01:04:35.823 --> 01:04:39.563
According to the call history, you two spoke for five minutes.

1144
01:04:40.363 --> 01:04:44.702
She asked me a bunch of questions about her delayed symptoms.

1145
01:04:49.073 --> 01:04:50.443
By any chance,

1146
01:04:51.113 --> 01:04:54.483
did you sense anything strange during the phone conversation?

1147
01:04:55.313 --> 01:04:56.613
Anything strange?

1148
01:04:56.713 --> 01:05:00.113
Did she sound overly anxious, sensitive,

1149
01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:01.722
or hyper than usual?

1150
01:05:03.352 --> 01:05:04.492
I'm not sure.

1151
01:05:05.552 --> 01:05:06.693
Not that I recall.

1152
01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:11.963
Thank you for your cooperation. Take care.

1153
01:05:14.133 --> 01:05:15.202
Let's go.

1154
01:05:16.762 --> 01:05:18.032
Moo Gang.

1155
01:05:22.403 --> 01:05:25.273
The call history won't get leaked, right?

1156
01:05:28.582 --> 01:05:29.742
I don't know.

1157
01:05:37.552 --> 01:05:39.593
What is this mess, Sip Gyeon?

1158
01:05:40.823 --> 01:05:42.023
Attention!

1159
01:05:46.363 --> 01:05:48.233
Gosh, these are important documents.

1160
01:05:51.632 --> 01:05:52.733
What?

1161
01:05:54.273 --> 01:05:55.743
I already said no. Why are you here again?

1162
01:05:56.102 --> 01:05:59.243
I found the document you wanted me to find.

1163
01:05:59.243 --> 01:06:00.443
What? Seriously?

1164
01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:02.342
- Give it to me. - Back off!

1165
01:06:02.342 --> 01:06:04.052
Nothing in life comes free.

1166
01:06:04.212 --> 01:06:07.052
I'll give it to you if you accept my offer.

1167
01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:09.783
- Did you actually find it? - Of course!

1168
01:06:10.693 --> 01:06:12.453
Your dad had a tattoo, right?

1169
01:06:12.852 --> 01:06:14.092
About this size.

1170
01:06:14.092 --> 01:06:15.193
What?

1171
01:06:16.063 --> 01:06:18.292
How dare you lie to my face?

1172
01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.333
Leave! I don't want to hear your nonsense.

1173
01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:22.962
I heard that the man had a tattoo on the back of his hand.

1174
01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:26.632
Police officers can't have any tattoos, okay?

1175
01:06:26.632 --> 01:06:27.972
For goodness' sake.

1176
01:06:29.273 --> 01:06:30.573
What is it, then?

1177
01:06:31.012 --> 01:06:32.243
It is him.

1178
01:06:33.943 --> 01:06:35.182
Did I read the wrong document?

1179
01:06:40.483 --> 01:06:41.953
Did you say it's on the back of his hand?

1180
01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:44.623
Yes.

1181
01:06:45.052 --> 01:06:46.392
What does it look like?

1182
01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.092
Oh, the tattoo?

1183
01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:51.733
A spider. It was a spider tattoo.

1184
01:06:54.863 --> 01:06:58.073
- Give me that. Right now! - Gosh, hang on. Then...

1185
01:06:59.002 --> 01:07:02.943
I brought your contract. I even brought a stamp ink pad.

1186
01:07:05.172 --> 01:07:07.042
(Employee: Kang Ha Ram)

1187
01:07:11.453 --> 01:07:13.583
Are you sure you don't want any money?

1188
01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:16.323
How many times do I have to tell you? I just want that document.

1189
01:07:17.653 --> 01:07:20.493
All right. Here's our VVIP list.

1190
01:07:20.493 --> 01:07:23.623
They're our highest-paying clients.

1191
01:07:23.892 --> 01:07:25.792
For us, Royeol Group,

1192
01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:28.502
they must not die in any circumstances...

1193
01:07:28.502 --> 01:07:30.533
because they pay us so much.

1194
01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:33.502
You're just as unimpressive as I thought you'd be.

1195
01:07:33.733 --> 01:07:35.373
You use people's weaknesses.

1196
01:07:36.373 --> 01:07:38.512
Just make sure you keep your word. If you don't,

1197
01:07:38.712 --> 01:07:41.813
I'll crush that face of yours.

1198
01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:43.913
My goodness.

1199
01:07:58.163 --> 01:08:02.163
Right, I am unimpressive indeed.

1200
01:08:02.403 --> 01:08:03.802
I'm so pathetic.

1201
01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:09.142
He'll show up here if he cared about his sister a lot.

1202
01:08:19.512 --> 01:08:20.512
My gosh!

1203
01:08:21.552 --> 01:08:22.983
That guy over there.

1204
01:08:23.623 --> 01:08:25.453
Did he nearly die recently by any chance?

1205
01:08:26.153 --> 01:08:28.663
Oh, how did you know?

1206
01:08:28.962 --> 01:08:31.962
He jumped from the roof recently because his grades went down.

1207
01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:34.863
Thankfully, he fell on a tree before he hit the ground.

1208
01:08:34.863 --> 01:08:36.363
That's why he didn't die.

1209
01:08:37.233 --> 01:08:38.333
Is that right?

1210
01:08:56.153 --> 01:08:59.292
The next one is Cha Min Joo, the daughter of Hwangje Group's owner.

1211
01:08:59.292 --> 01:09:01.892
A grade 10 teacher at Seungri High School?

1212
01:09:15.102 --> 01:09:16.102
(Cha Min Joo)

1213
01:09:23.382 --> 01:09:24.512
What?

1214
01:09:25.382 --> 01:09:27.052
Why is that girl here?

1215
01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:37.663
What is that?

1216
01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:40.632
It's inside his body.

1217
01:09:44.102 --> 01:09:47.943
My gosh, the shadow is inside his body.

1218
01:09:51.642 --> 01:09:52.773
What does that mean?

1219
01:09:56.743 --> 01:09:58.352
What kind of question is that?

1220
01:09:58.852 --> 01:10:01.552
You know everything. Why do you keep acting like you know nothing?

1221
01:10:01.552 --> 01:10:03.323
You know the fact that I see the shadow...

1222
01:10:03.323 --> 01:10:04.892
and that the person with the shadow...

1223
01:10:04.892 --> 01:10:07.693
always dies. You know all of that.

1224
01:10:07.892 --> 01:10:09.023
What?

1225
01:10:12.592 --> 01:10:13.833
Stay for three more minutes.

1226
01:10:13.833 --> 01:10:15.563
What are you saying? Let go.

1227
01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.102
Then wait for just a minute.

1228
01:10:17.233 --> 01:10:18.333
You...

1229
01:10:19.932 --> 01:10:22.342
Do you really see us... I mean,

1230
01:10:23.172 --> 01:10:24.472
can you really see it?

1231
01:10:25.943 --> 01:10:27.012
Gosh.

1232
01:10:30.813 --> 01:10:33.182
I've never seen anything like that before.

1233
01:10:34.083 --> 01:10:36.323
The ones I've seen before were always just beside the bodies.

1234
01:10:37.252 --> 01:10:39.523
I've never seen the shadow inside anyone's body.

1235
01:10:39.523 --> 01:10:41.092
Gosh, it's giving me the creeps.

1236
01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:44.663
Inside the body? You mean, inside a human body?

1237
01:10:45.462 --> 01:10:46.693
- Who? Who is it? - Gosh.

1238
01:10:46.693 --> 01:10:48.602
Over there. The boy at the very back.

1239
01:10:48.602 --> 01:10:50.002
- What? - There.

1240
01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:53.273
The one sitting by the window. That boy over there.

1241
01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:54.342
Where?

1242
01:10:54.642 --> 01:10:56.972
Well... Over there...

1243
01:10:58.512 --> 01:10:59.773
That boy.

1244
01:11:01.342 --> 01:11:02.642
Why are you doing this to me?

1245
01:11:04.953 --> 01:11:06.182
Come out of there, loser.

1246
01:11:07.953 --> 01:11:10.252
Are you 444?

1247
01:11:10.252 --> 01:11:12.092
Did you think I'd never be able to find you?

1248
01:11:12.993 --> 01:11:16.123
Come out of there before I put a hole through that head!

1249
01:11:17.932 --> 01:11:19.993
No, I won't get out of this body.

1250
01:11:20.602 --> 01:11:22.462
I want to live as a human again.

1251
01:11:22.932 --> 01:11:24.533
I regret taking my own life.

1252
01:11:25.002 --> 01:11:27.743
Please. Give me a chance, please.

1253
01:11:28.142 --> 01:11:29.773
I don't want to leave this body!

1254
01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:32.512
Fine.

1255
01:11:33.212 --> 01:11:35.743
Then I have no choice but to drag you out of there.

1256
01:11:44.993 --> 01:11:46.722
You should've done that to save me all this trouble.

1257
01:11:49.592 --> 01:11:50.733
What?

1258
01:11:54.403 --> 01:11:55.462
You're...

1259
01:12:03.243 --> 01:12:04.313
Please let me live.

1260
01:12:05.243 --> 01:12:07.042
Can you just pretend you never saw me?

1261
01:12:08.512 --> 01:12:09.882
Why did you come out of his body?

1262
01:12:10.983 --> 01:12:13.182
Then was the guy who came to the emergency room...

1263
01:12:13.382 --> 01:12:15.153
I was also a 12th grader.

1264
01:12:15.752 --> 01:12:18.523
I took some pills and killed myself because of my poor grades.

1265
01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:21.722
I came down here to collect that boy's soul...

1266
01:12:21.922 --> 01:12:23.493
and kept thinking about my life before death.

1267
01:12:24.693 --> 01:12:26.533
I couldn't stop thinking about my parents, so...

1268
01:12:27.833 --> 01:12:30.833
I want to go back to being a student. I want to study hard...

1269
01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:32.403
and also tell my parents...

1270
01:12:33.333 --> 01:12:36.102
that I'm sorry about leaving them like that.

1271
01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:37.443
So please.

1272
01:12:37.672 --> 01:12:40.142
Could you please pretend you never saw me here?

1273
01:12:41.313 --> 01:12:42.842
Please. I beg you.

1274
01:12:43.342 --> 01:12:44.613
Please.

1275
01:12:55.363 --> 01:12:56.823
Right, I forgot for a second.

1276
01:12:58.193 --> 01:12:59.462
You're 444.

1277
01:13:01.762 --> 01:13:02.762
Hey.

1278
01:13:03.363 --> 01:13:06.172
I heard that you're a fugitive now though.

1279
01:13:08.073 --> 01:13:10.642
If I get dragged back there, I'll tell everyone about you,

1280
01:13:11.073 --> 01:13:12.472
so do whatever you want.

1281
01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:13.573
The Death Squad?

1282
01:13:14.443 --> 01:13:15.682
Call them.

1283
01:13:16.182 --> 01:13:18.613
Go ahead and call them. Call them!

1284
01:13:20.552 --> 01:13:21.653
Calm down.

1285
01:13:22.953 --> 01:13:24.292
I heard you. Go back in there.

1286
01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:29.392
I said, go back in.

1287
01:13:30.762 --> 01:13:32.292
Will you really let it slide?

1288
01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:33.333
Yes.

1289
01:13:43.102 --> 01:13:45.712
I guess all the rumors about you aren't true, 444.

1290
01:13:47.512 --> 01:13:49.783
What? What are you doing right now?

1291
01:13:50.283 --> 01:13:52.483
So you jumped from here, right?

1292
01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:55.083
I told you that I'll tell everyone about you if you do this to me.

1293
01:13:59.592 --> 01:14:01.892
There's one thing you don't know because you're a newbie.

1294
01:14:02.363 --> 01:14:04.632
If the body you're in dies again...

1295
01:14:04.632 --> 01:14:06.392
when you're inside of it,

1296
01:14:07.462 --> 01:14:10.302
you'll forget all the memories you had when you lived as that body.

1297
01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:14.943
You won't remember me.

1298
01:14:22.882 --> 01:14:25.012
007! 007.

1299
01:14:26.682 --> 01:14:28.182
Have you heard?

1300
01:14:28.182 --> 01:14:30.892
Remember that newbie Grim Reaper who ran away a little while ago?

1301
01:14:30.892 --> 01:14:32.352
The Death Squad caught him.

1302
01:14:33.123 --> 01:14:35.623
What will happen to him now?

1303
01:14:38.533 --> 01:14:41.363
So he's her stepbrother.

1304
01:14:43.663 --> 01:14:45.773
That episode has aired three times already.

1305
01:14:46.073 --> 01:14:48.943
In the next episode, they find out that they're not related at all.

1306
01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.273
In the final episode, they get married...

1307
01:14:51.273 --> 01:14:52.842
and have quintuplets.

1308
01:14:53.773 --> 01:14:56.483
Have some manners, will you? Why did you tell me the whole story?

1309
01:14:56.483 --> 01:14:58.483
This isn't important right now!

1310
01:14:58.483 --> 01:15:01.023
How dare you! You little...

1311
01:15:01.653 --> 01:15:02.722
My gosh!

1312
01:15:05.222 --> 01:15:06.953
I totally admire you.

1313
01:15:07.262 --> 01:15:09.563
You make my heart burn, I love you

1314
01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:15.233
You look like Brad in "Meet Joe Black".

1315
01:15:15.233 --> 01:15:16.302
Bread?

1316
01:15:16.703 --> 01:15:19.972
Oh, you know. Angelina Jolie's ex-husband, Brad.

1317
01:15:20.273 --> 01:15:21.342
Anyway,

1318
01:15:21.903 --> 01:15:24.613
where are you going in the middle of the night all dressed up?

1319
01:15:26.472 --> 01:15:28.813
I came up with a brilliant idea to catch that loser.

1320
01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:31.083
A brilliant idea? What is it?

1321
01:15:34.552 --> 01:15:35.653
Eyes.

1322
01:15:51.632 --> 01:15:53.273
You disappeared earlier.

1323
01:15:53.733 --> 01:15:55.403
What brings you here this late?

1324
01:16:03.613 --> 01:16:04.752
Listen.

1325
01:16:07.382 --> 01:16:08.653
Joon is...

1326
01:16:11.453 --> 01:16:13.922
I mean, Han Moo Gang. You said he's your first love, right?

1327
01:16:17.863 --> 01:16:18.932
Sorry?

1328
01:16:19.762 --> 01:16:22.262
I'm talking about Joon, Han Moo Gang.

1329
01:16:23.903 --> 01:16:25.632
In other words, me.

1330
01:16:28.203 --> 01:16:29.302
You like me, don't you?

1331
01:16:29.373 --> 01:16:31.712
That's... Well...

1332
01:16:41.023 --> 01:16:44.023
Then stay right by my side at all times like glue.

1333
01:16:44.892 --> 01:16:46.222
From this moment,

1334
01:16:48.063 --> 01:16:49.722
I need you to be my eyes.

1335
01:17:08.682 --> 01:17:10.243
(Black)

1336
01:17:10.783 --> 01:17:13.413
That means I didn't die because of her.

1337
01:17:14.153 --> 01:17:17.523
I can't believe he lost his memory. This is all because of me.

1338
01:17:17.623 --> 01:17:19.422
Let me go!

1339
01:17:19.422 --> 01:17:21.523
I'm going to save Royeol Insurance no matter what.

1340
01:17:21.523 --> 01:17:23.563
He disguised it into an accident and killed him on purpose.

1341
01:17:23.693 --> 01:17:26.533
Who keeps trying to kill Han Moo Gang?

1342
01:17:26.693 --> 01:17:29.302
As long as that's gone, they won't be able to do anything to me.

1343
01:17:30.002 --> 01:17:31.333
Help me.

1344
01:17:31.733 --> 01:17:33.802
Just do as I say.
