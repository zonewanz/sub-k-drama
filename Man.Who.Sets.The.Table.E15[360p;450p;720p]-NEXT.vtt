00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.940
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.350
I'll register her as my daughter.

3
00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.680
I'll say I had her late.

4
00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:21.850
If you can do that for us,

5
00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:23.990
I'll keep quiet about it.

6
00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:26.290
Raising Han Gyul is a problem in itself,

7
00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:29.290
but if my mom finds out, 
she'll never let us live together.

8
00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:34.060
All right. The solution is...

9
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.130
for me to raise Han Gyul.

10
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.700
My gosh. Young Hye won't listen to me.

11
00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:44.810
How do I convince her?

12
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.550
Han Gyul, let's wash up.

13
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:00.160
What is it? What were you looking at?

14
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.830
It's okay. You can show me.

15
00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:20.140
Do you miss Dad?

16
00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:23.380
When is he coming home?

17
00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:26.550
I understand.

18
00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:29.650
You have to stay together.

19
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.060
Let's see the end of this.

20
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.090
(Share the Love Campaign)

21
00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:46.750
I thought you weren't feeling well, 
Ms. Hong. Are you all right?

22
00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:48.870
Yes.

23
00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:51.590
I heard you were holding a bazaar,

24
00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:54.890
and I also wanted to see So Won. 
That's why I'm here.

25
00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:57.250
It's good to see you here.

26
00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:01.200
You have a daughter now,

27
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.870
so take her around with you.

28
00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:05.100
Don't worry about what other people say,

29
00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:07.070
and you have to be brazen about it.

30
00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:09.840
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

31
00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:12.060
You should be thinking, 
"My husband is still alive."

32
00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.500
It's something to be proud of.

33
00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:18.970
Oh, dear. Hello, baby.

34
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:22.840
Please go in. So Won will be here soon.

35
00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:25.210
Let's go in.

36
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.650
Are you really not going?

37
00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:33.250
I'm not going.

38
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.590
I'm getting a divorce soon. I have no time to help the unfortunates.

39
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:43.760
Yeon Ju, I beg you.

40
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.560
Let's be reasonable about this.

41
00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.900
She's my child, so I have to raise her.

42
00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.970
Please don't let me be more guilty about this.

43
00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:56.270
Do you think it's reasonable to raise a child I don't know...

44
00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:59.770
and whose mother is my husband's first love?

45
00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:03.330
Don't you think this is too cruel?

46
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.380
Then what do you want me to do?

47
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.270
Do you want me to be shameless and abandon my own child?

48
00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.650
I never said that!

49
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.090
Father said he'll raise her.

50
00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.660
Rather than having a delinquent stepmom like me,

51
00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.410
Mother and Father will raise her well since they have experience.

52
00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:21.450
Yeon Ju.

53
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.770
Why do you want to raise her?

54
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.330
Do you even want us to stay together?

55
00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:30.360
If we listen to Father, there'll be nothing wrong with us.

56
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.010
Mom will be okay with it too. Everything will be fine,

57
00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.990
so why are you making a big deal trying to raise her?

58
00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.310
How many times do I have to tell you?

59
00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.080
She's my own child.

60
00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:41.020
Even Han Gyul knows that I'm her dad.

61
00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:44.020
You want me to ignore that and act like her brother?

62
00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.890
Nobody took care of her. She's had a poor life.

63
00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:49.960
Do you want me to abandon her again?

64
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.030
I don't know about that.

65
00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.330
Do you feel sorry for her and not me?

66
00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:58.370
Don't you feel bad that I'm going to become that child's mom?

67
00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:03.220
Whenever you look at her, you'll think about your first love.

68
00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:05.640
How am I supposed to live with that?

69
00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.180
I don't want to delay this anymore.

70
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:14.220
I'll tell Mother once the bazaar is over today.

71
00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.920
I'm going to kill myself then!

72
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.630
Would you be okay with that?

73
00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.060
Please be considerate of me.

74
00:04:28.918 --> 00:04:33.370
If you consider me half as much as your daughter, please...

75
00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.570
please let this one go.

76
00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:40.210
What did I do wrong?

77
00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:45.450
If my mom finds out about this, we have to get a divorce.

78
00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:49.180
We have to get a divorce. Please.

79
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.060
Are you looking for something?

80
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:05.280
Yes. I'm looking for a ring.

81
00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:06.570
Is it for a present?

82
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.770
Yes, it's for my wife.

83
00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:11.570
Which one do you recommend?

84
00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:14.010
Let me see.

85
00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:19.010
This is the most popular design in our store.

86
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.090
It's pretty.

87
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.260
How much is it?

88
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.890
- Is this the price? - Sorry?

89
00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:38.630
It's expensive, but it's a bribe. I guess this will do.

90
00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:40.890
Okay. I'll take this.

91
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.500
Please wrap it up nicely.

92
00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:44.940
What is your wife's ring size?

93
00:05:45.462 --> 00:05:46.640
Ring size?

94
00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:48.940
I didn't know such thing existed.

95
00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.950
Oh, dear. Who should I ask?

96
00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:54.320
Please give me a moment.

97
00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:04.890
The person you are trying to reach is not available.

98
00:06:04.981 --> 00:06:06.900
Please try back later.

99
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.070
My gosh. What is she doing not picking up her phone?

100
00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:17.370
Ms. Hong, what do you think about this color?

101
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:23.630
Your face is light like white flour,

102
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.000
so this will look nice on you.

103
00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:27.580
No, it's okay.

104
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.400
The color is too fancy.

105
00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:32.470
No, no. We have to change...

106
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.470
your body to look young.

107
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.960
You have to attend your daughter's parent nights at school.

108
00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:42.130
Other parents are old enough to be your daughter.

109
00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.580
You have to dress young,

110
00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:46.720
so that you don't look so old.

111
00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:48.090
Get this.

112
00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:50.370
Get this. Listen to me.

113
00:06:53.263 --> 00:06:54.440
Wait...

114
00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.450
Where did she go? Han Gyul.

115
00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:00.570
- Please take this for me. - Sure.

116
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.320
Han Gyul. Han Gyul?

117
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.750
Han Gyul.

118
00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:07.960
Young lady.

119
00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:11.330
Is there a kid here somewhere? The one with big eyes?

120
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.630
Look for her.

121
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:23.200
Han Gyul.

122
00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:27.530
Why are you out here?

123
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.880
I told you to stand by me.

124
00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.010
If you get lost, you'll be in trouble.

125
00:07:33.903 --> 00:07:35.620
Let's go back in, okay?

126
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.950
Why? You don't want to?

127
00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:41.390
You don't want to go in?

128
00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:45.690
Why not?

129
00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:47.500
Tell me. It's okay.

130
00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.670
Dad... My dad.

131
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.700
When is he coming?

132
00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.010
Were you waiting for him here?

133
00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:07.380
Okay. I'll call him and ask when he's coming.

134
00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:12.520
Mom.

135
00:08:14.844 --> 00:08:16.160
So Won.

136
00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:17.760
What are you doing here?

137
00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:22.910
Han Gyul missed you,

138
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.500
so I brought her with me.

139
00:08:26.456 --> 00:08:27.770
How are you, Han Gyul?

140
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.510
You said you wanted to see him. Why are you hiding?

141
00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.710
Mom, shall we go for tea?

142
00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:43.220
Han Gyul, come with me.

143
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:47.660
That's all right. He's your dad.

144
00:09:22.412 --> 00:09:24.060
Hi, Yeon Ju.

145
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:31.070
Somehow, you turned me into the vicious one here.

146
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.100
Mother, we need to talk.

147
00:09:53.443 --> 00:09:55.920
Is there something you want to tell me in private?

148
00:10:00.984 --> 00:10:02.560
It has to do with Han Gyul, doesn't it?

149
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.570
What is it that you really want?

150
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:09.390
What do you mean?

151
00:10:09.392 --> 00:10:13.060
Do you really want us to get a divorce?

152
00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:14.530
Yeon Ju.

153
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.980
If that's not your intention, how could you bring her here?

154
00:10:18.768 --> 00:10:21.270
It hasn't been a week that I've found out...

155
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.800
that So Won has a baby.

156
00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:25.420
I know how you must feel now.

157
00:10:26.275 --> 00:10:28.910
She kept asking for her dad.

158
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:30.610
And I heard he was off today.

159
00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:32.280
I wanted to let her see her dad just for a minute.

160
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.660
Even so! That can't be an excuse for bringing her here!

161
00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:36.730
You know too well...

162
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.390
that my mom will make sure I divorce So Won...

163
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.570
if she finds out that Han Gyul is his daughter.

164
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.410
But there's no way secrets can stay hidden forever.

165
00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:52.350
She's asking for her dad every day.

166
00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.720
I can't separate them...

167
00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:59.870
and make a father and a daughter into a brother and sister.

168
00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:02.110
If that's the best option, then there's nothing I can do.

169
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:03.930
That's the only option we have.

170
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:08.110
Are you implying I should divorce him for the sake of the girl?

171
00:11:08.117 --> 00:11:10.180
Is that what you want, Mother?

172
00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:11.400
Yeon Ju.

173
00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:14.570
I'll answer honestly...

174
00:11:15.358 --> 00:11:17.610
since you asked.

175
00:11:18.628 --> 00:11:19.810
I know...

176
00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:23.850
that I'm asking too much, and I'm so embarrassed to ask you,

177
00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:25.850
but I hope...

178
00:11:27.003 --> 00:11:30.420
you can accept her as your daughter.

179
00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:35.510
What... Do you think that makes sense?

180
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:38.140
Even you passed out, and said that you couldn't raise her.

181
00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:40.030
How could you expect me to raise her?

182
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:43.050
I see. Since I'm not your daughter,

183
00:11:43.052 --> 00:11:46.270
and she's related to you by blood, you're only looking out for her, no?

184
00:11:46.322 --> 00:11:48.420
How could you force me to do something...

185
00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:50.810
that even you couldn't do yourself?

186
00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:54.940
You're right. I can't do it.

187
00:11:55.398 --> 00:11:57.030
But you can.

188
00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.280
Do you know why?

189
00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:00.580
Because you love So Won.

190
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.140
Even though Han Gyul isn't my daughter,

191
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.820
I can raise her as long as I put my mind to it.

192
00:12:08.377 --> 00:12:09.590
But if I do,

193
00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:12.560
So Won will live his entire life in guilt.

194
00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:15.980
And what about that poor girl's life?

195
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.200
So Won...

196
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.330
isn't someone who can...

197
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:22.400
live happily after abandoning his own daughter.

198
00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:25.570
If he lives with a guilty conscience,

199
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.680
do you think you and he can form a healthy family together?

200
00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:34.280
Yeon Ju.

201
00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:38.950
Right now, it will be very hard,

202
00:12:39.776 --> 00:12:43.460
but if you have any desire to continue living with So Won,

203
00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:45.690
I hope...

204
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.460
you can accept her as your daughter.

205
00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:50.730
Please, Yeon Ju.

206
00:12:51.921 --> 00:12:53.100
I...

207
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:57.470
will help you with the hard and difficult parts of raising her.

208
00:12:59.796 --> 00:13:02.980
No. I am not following you at all.

209
00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:04.680
The only thing I know is...

210
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.860
that I will neither divorce him...

211
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:08.720
nor raise that kid.

212
00:13:09.272 --> 00:13:11.670
Whatever it takes, I will get pregnant as soon as possible...

213
00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:15.190
with a baby who is more beautiful than that kid there.

214
00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.880
When that happens, So Won will change his mind.

215
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.930
You should just raise that kid.

216
00:13:21.017 --> 00:13:22.830
That's the only thing I'll ask of you.

217
00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:44.690
Hi, Yeon Ju.

218
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.190
I was about to call you.

219
00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:51.930
Do you happen to know your mother-in-law's ring size?

220
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.150
I need to know her size to bribe her.

221
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:57.230
You should come and measure her finger yourself.

222
00:13:57.286 --> 00:13:59.300
She's with me right now.

223
00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:03.240
She is? Okay. Then are you in Mok-dong now?

224
00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:06.940
No, she came to my mom's bazaar.

225
00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.080
And she brought Han Gyul with her.

226
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.480
What?

227
00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:12.710
Where is the bazaar?

228
00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:19.990
Is it good?

229
00:14:25.248 --> 00:14:26.460
I'll give you some.

230
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.300
You should eat. I'm full.

231
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.740
What is it?

232
00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:42.780
Dad. When are you leaving?

233
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:47.320
Why?

234
00:14:48.437 --> 00:14:51.150
Do you not want me to leave?

235
00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:56.820
Come here, Han Gyul.

236
00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:07.300
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:11.440
Wait a bit longer, and we'll be able to live together soon.

238
00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:13.810
You can wait until then, right?

239
00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:33.960
This is so heavy.

240
00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:36.530
That witch. How dare she?

241
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.870
She wants me to buy a plant to keep her skin moisturized?

242
00:15:41.257 --> 00:15:44.210
Gosh, my life is a series of tearjerking events.

243
00:15:44.393 --> 00:15:47.580
I've only had contract jobs.

244
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.480
I knew that the fate of my career would be complicated,

245
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:52.850
but this job is one of the most extreme jobs. Darn it.

246
00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:56.720
Gosh, my fingers. This is so heavy.

247
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.960
What?

248
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.090
What is he doing?

249
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.600
Gosh, I almost had a miscarriage even though I'm not even pregnant.

250
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.960
He's unbelievable!

251
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.180
(Proposal for development of a new dish)

252
00:16:12.188 --> 00:16:14.240
(Jung Tae Yang and Lee Ru Ri)

253
00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:22.190
Chef No,

254
00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:24.710
do you think this could get selected as the new menu?

255
00:16:26.102 --> 00:16:28.220
You should take a look at Chef Jung's and get prepared.

256
00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:31.090
Gosh, this is a catch-22 situation.

257
00:16:31.374 --> 00:16:34.060
Should I, an amazing chef, copy this lousy proposal?

258
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.060
This is embarrassing.

259
00:16:43.052 --> 00:16:45.020
Why are you doing busywork?

260
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:48.300
Well, Chef No, this wasn't my task.

261
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:52.960
Excuse me. What do you think you're doing?

262
00:16:52.962 --> 00:16:54.430
You stole my cleaning task yesterday too.

263
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.930
Do you want me to get fired?

264
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:57.800
No, that wasn't my intention.

265
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.430
From the look of it,

266
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:02.150
it looks like you're here on a contract too.

267
00:17:02.405 --> 00:17:04.140
Let's not go after each other's job.

268
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.990
We should help each other out.

269
00:17:06.642 --> 00:17:09.320
You're stealing my tasks to make a good impression on Manager Joo.

270
00:17:15.751 --> 00:17:17.030
She's pretty.

271
00:17:30.332 --> 00:17:32.750
What is it? Do you think you can you do it?

272
00:17:32.902 --> 00:17:35.220
Yes. I'd like to try.

273
00:17:35.671 --> 00:17:36.720
Are you sure?

274
00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:39.070
Okay. Give it a try.

275
00:17:39.075 --> 00:17:40.190
Yes!

276
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:50.970
Don't try to overachieve from the beginning.

277
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.420
You might hurt your finger.

278
00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:53.470
Okay.

279
00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:01.110
That's quite an improvement.

280
00:18:01.397 --> 00:18:04.550
I improved, didn't I? This is all thanks to you, Chef Jung.

281
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:05.800
I wanted to use this knife,

282
00:18:05.801 --> 00:18:07.900
so I stayed late every night and practiced in secret.

283
00:18:07.903 --> 00:18:09.250
I'm proud of you.

284
00:18:26.722 --> 00:18:28.090
Can you do this too?

285
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.100
Yes. Leave it to me, Chef Jung.

286
00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:34.340
Here.

287
00:18:41.437 --> 00:18:44.670
It's going to be the side-dish, so make it as pretty as you can.

288
00:18:44.673 --> 00:18:46.920
Of course. Don't worry, Chef Jung.

289
00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:55.600
- Are you done? - What?

290
00:18:58.988 --> 00:19:00.120
Let me see.

291
00:19:00.122 --> 00:19:01.440
But...

292
00:19:01.657 --> 00:19:02.940
Show me.

293
00:19:03.159 --> 00:19:05.710
You use the knife so well. Rice balls are nothing.

294
00:19:05.861 --> 00:19:07.540
- It's not... - Let me see.

295
00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.150
It's not done yet.

296
00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:13.610
What can this be?

297
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.150
Ru Ri, I beg you. Please don't have daughters.

298
00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:21.740
- Why not? - If you can't make this pretty,

299
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:23.460
I heard you'll have ugly daughters.

300
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.690
Why are you worried about how my daughter would look like?

301
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.460
She won't be just your daughter.

302
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.710
Dad, can you buy me lunch?

303
00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.560
I have something to report to you,

304
00:19:44.567 --> 00:19:46.480
and I want to go on a date with you.

305
00:19:46.635 --> 00:19:49.220
Oh, dear. I already made plans.

306
00:19:49.838 --> 00:19:51.450
Let's go on a date next time.

307
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:53.950
Who are you meeting?

308
00:19:53.976 --> 00:19:55.160
My friend.

309
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.000
A friend?

310
00:20:04.386 --> 00:20:05.630
My dad has a friend?

311
00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.440
Get in.

312
00:20:13.162 --> 00:20:14.710
We can go with my car.

313
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.440
I thought we were friends.

314
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.780
Don't feel uncomfortable. Get in.

315
00:20:39.855 --> 00:20:42.470
What? It's Tae Yang again?

316
00:20:49.632 --> 00:20:52.750
Hey, the side-dish is rice balls.

317
00:20:53.135 --> 00:20:55.020
- Did you note it down? - Yes, I did.

318
00:20:55.604 --> 00:20:57.520
But what we're doing is so trashy.

319
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.950
Stop acting up.

320
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:03.540
How is it going?

321
00:21:03.545 --> 00:21:05.710
Did you copy Tae Yang's proposal?

322
00:21:05.714 --> 00:21:07.230
Don't worry.

323
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.080
I'm making plans in my head to upgrade it.

324
00:21:11.086 --> 00:21:13.070
Who told you to upgrade it?

325
00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:16.890
Copy the sauce and side-menu as it is.

326
00:21:16.892 --> 00:21:18.440
Stop acting up.

327
00:21:18.661 --> 00:21:21.990
People will talk about it for copying his recipe exactly.

328
00:21:21.997 --> 00:21:23.180
I told you already.

329
00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:25.280
I'll take care of the rest.

330
00:21:26.435 --> 00:21:27.680
Watch and learn.

331
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.950
I'll make sure he gets humiliated during this evaluation.

332
00:21:38.113 --> 00:21:41.160
How is the preparation going for your first evaluation tomorrow?

333
00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:43.250
It's going great. I'm finished with the main dish,

334
00:21:43.252 --> 00:21:44.430
and I'm working on the sauce.

335
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.000
You can look forward to it, Chairman Kevin.

336
00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:50.370
He's an incredible chef whom I can learn a lot from.

337
00:21:50.492 --> 00:21:51.610
Is he?

338
00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:56.140
This is our trio's first meeting, so we can't let it end like this.

339
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:58.900
You two should have beer without me.

340
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.250
It's okay.

341
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.950
She's allergic to alcohol, so she can't even have a glass.

342
00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:04.180
Really?

343
00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.460
You know each other so well. Are you...

344
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:10.440
guys dating?

345
00:22:10.446 --> 00:22:11.690
- Yes. - No.

346
00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:14.180
It's not like that at all.

347
00:22:14.183 --> 00:22:16.450
He's my mentor.

348
00:22:16.452 --> 00:22:17.630
Is that it?

349
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.670
Aren't you seeing anybody?

350
00:22:21.156 --> 00:22:23.490
Chairman Kevin, she is actually...

351
00:22:23.492 --> 00:22:27.010
He has many friends,

352
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.730
but he doesn't have a girlfriend.

353
00:22:29.732 --> 00:22:32.480
He doesn't have one.

354
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:38.340
Then can I introduce you to a nice young lady?

355
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.490
- You can't. - Yes.

356
00:22:40.642 --> 00:22:41.790
Never.

357
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:45.460
You can't do that.

358
00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:51.200
Why are you so against it?

359
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.430
Sorry?

360
00:22:54.656 --> 00:22:55.800
Well...

361
00:22:57.226 --> 00:22:59.370
I'm going to focus on work for now.

362
00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:01.590
Sure.

363
00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:04.510
But don't become a workaholic. You'll turn into me.

364
00:23:04.833 --> 00:23:06.550
You need to find love too.

365
00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:11.190
Chairman Kevin, may I ask a question?

366
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.450
Of course.

367
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:16.090
To be true friends, you have to know each other well.

368
00:23:16.412 --> 00:23:19.230
I heard that you live on your own.

369
00:23:19.615 --> 00:23:20.930
Is that true?

370
00:23:22.418 --> 00:23:23.930
Is that what people say?

371
00:23:24.052 --> 00:23:28.200
Yes, I heard you're really fussy, so you don't even look at women.

372
00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:33.010
Do I look like that to you?

373
00:23:33.061 --> 00:23:35.440
Like I've never fallen in love?

374
00:23:35.564 --> 00:23:36.710
No.

375
00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:39.150
It's just my thought, but I think...

376
00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:42.820
you had a heartache in the past.

377
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:48.020
I think it was really heartbreaking that you got hurt by it.

378
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:55.400
Is that true?

379
00:23:56.752 --> 00:23:59.400
I regret every morning when I open my eyes.

380
00:23:59.755 --> 00:24:01.440
I want to go back to that time.

381
00:24:02.157 --> 00:24:03.940
And if I go back,

382
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.740
I want to meet her again and live happily with her.

383
00:24:09.932 --> 00:24:11.680
You must have loved her a lot.

384
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.880
Did I?

385
00:24:22.411 --> 00:24:24.960
I did everything for you.

386
00:24:25.914 --> 00:24:27.960
Why are you trying to leave me?

387
00:24:28.417 --> 00:24:29.600
Why?

388
00:24:30.652 --> 00:24:32.180
Why?

389
00:24:32.187 --> 00:24:35.140
Why are you trying to leave me?

390
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.370
If I did, I wouldn't have regrets.

391
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:45.210
I think I can't forget about her because I didn't do that.

392
00:24:51.673 --> 00:24:54.790
It's so quiet now because of me.

393
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:59.030
Right. Tell me about your family.

394
00:24:59.414 --> 00:25:02.030
We're a large, happy family.

395
00:25:02.551 --> 00:25:04.460
I live with my parents and two younger siblings.

396
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.670
I'm envious of your blessings.

397
00:25:07.055 --> 00:25:10.720
Yes, but before we got to this stage,

398
00:25:10.726 --> 00:25:12.370
my mom went through so much.

399
00:25:12.895 --> 00:25:16.380
She went through many failures before she became happy.

400
00:25:16.398 --> 00:25:17.480
Is that right?

401
00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:19.980
Your mom is incredible.

402
00:25:37.152 --> 00:25:38.700
Bravo.

403
00:25:40.122 --> 00:25:42.440
Your steps are not ordinary.

404
00:25:42.858 --> 00:25:45.010
Shall we dance, madam?

405
00:25:45.827 --> 00:25:47.010
No thanks.

406
00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:49.110
I don't like a man like weasels.

407
00:25:49.364 --> 00:25:52.950
How does a magpie sound then?

408
00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:58.620
Goodness.

409
00:26:03.412 --> 00:26:05.840
It's been a while since I laughed like this.

410
00:26:05.847 --> 00:26:09.400
I know. It's finally peaceful at home.

411
00:26:09.885 --> 00:26:12.100
My mom stirred it up,

412
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:13.700
and Woo Joo made it worse.

413
00:26:13.922 --> 00:26:15.100
That's not the end.

414
00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:18.940
I lived as a criminal for 30 years,

415
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:23.280
thinking that Tae Yang's dad is dead. But he's alive,

416
00:26:23.532 --> 00:26:25.380
so I feel much relieved.

417
00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:30.400
You know that you're a lucky woman, right?

418
00:26:30.405 --> 00:26:31.790
Of course.

419
00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:38.490
I have something to discuss with you about.

420
00:26:38.914 --> 00:26:40.030
What is it?

421
00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:41.930
I want to look for my sister.

422
00:26:42.484 --> 00:26:43.660
Your sister?

423
00:26:45.754 --> 00:26:48.300
Your sister who's in Seattle?

424
00:26:48.457 --> 00:26:51.340
We got separated when I ran away to Korea.

425
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.490
Since then, she doesn't know what happened to me.

426
00:26:55.497 --> 00:26:57.440
I never even sent her a letter.

427
00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:00.450
She must be worried about me.

428
00:27:02.104 --> 00:27:03.550
Is there a way to find her?

429
00:27:03.672 --> 00:27:05.750
Mi Joo was her favorite student,

430
00:27:06.642 --> 00:27:08.920
so they might still be in contact.

431
00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:14.960
We should be careful about this.

432
00:27:15.917 --> 00:27:18.700
It feels like you're digging up your past...

433
00:27:19.388 --> 00:27:21.500
from the grave.

434
00:27:22.691 --> 00:27:24.240
Nothing will happen.

435
00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:29.180
If Tae Yang's dad, whom I thought was dead, is alive,

436
00:27:30.232 --> 00:27:32.050
I'm not a criminal anymore.

437
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.390
Sure. I must be acting too sensitively.

438
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:41.150
Let's meet up with Mi Joo.

439
00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:45.390
Ta-da.

440
00:27:46.314 --> 00:27:47.530
Where did you get this?

441
00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:50.000
Dad registered me for the beauty class and got this for me.

442
00:27:53.622 --> 00:27:56.470
This is so cool.

443
00:27:57.926 --> 00:28:00.370
This is your first task. Transform me into a new person.

444
00:28:01.063 --> 00:28:03.560
Move it. Pumpkins don't become watermelons...

445
00:28:03.565 --> 00:28:04.850
no matter how hard I try.

446
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.200
Are you saying I'm a pumpkin?

447
00:28:06.201 --> 00:28:07.780
- Transform me. - It hurts.

448
00:28:09.971 --> 00:28:11.120
(Witch Grandma)

449
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.990
This is driving me crazy.

450
00:28:13.442 --> 00:28:14.620
What do I do?

451
00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:19.880
I told you never to. show her the necklace.

452
00:28:19.881 --> 00:28:23.650
She calls me several times a day to ask us to meet again.

453
00:28:23.652 --> 00:28:26.470
That witch. She's obsessed.

454
00:28:26.922 --> 00:28:28.400
Should I just show it to her?

455
00:28:29.091 --> 00:28:31.940
Nothing will happen to it. She said she'll help Tae Yang.

456
00:28:32.494 --> 00:28:34.910
I don't know. I don't have a good feeling.

457
00:28:35.197 --> 00:28:37.940
She's going to come to school then.

458
00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:40.710
Let's just show her quickly and come back.

459
00:28:40.902 --> 00:28:42.550
Woo Joo, let's do that.

460
00:28:45.874 --> 00:28:48.870
(Chief of Food Laboratory, Choi Sun Young)

461
00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:50.620
Why is she being so hesitant?

462
00:28:51.947 --> 00:28:54.390
Did her mom find out about it?

463
00:29:00.422 --> 00:29:02.500
Grandma, we'll go there right now.

464
00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:05.270
You need to give it back to me right away after seeing it.

465
00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:09.140
She's naive like her dad.

466
00:29:21.076 --> 00:29:22.440
Did you hear anything from Seattle?

467
00:29:22.444 --> 00:29:25.110
They will send us Anna Kang's file soon.

468
00:29:25.113 --> 00:29:27.640
Do you have any news about her husband or sister?

469
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:30.110
Fortunately, they found a man named "Jay" that owned...

470
00:29:30.118 --> 00:29:32.380
a restaurant in Seattle 30 years ago.

471
00:29:32.387 --> 00:29:33.550
Really?

472
00:29:33.555 --> 00:29:36.990
Then what is the real name of Jung Hwa Young's ex-husband?

473
00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:39.240
They said it was "Jay Young".

474
00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:41.440
Jay Young?

475
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.360
Where is he right now?

476
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:46.210
They're looking for him, so they'll tell us as soon as they find out.

477
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:49.750
He's a second-generation Korean named Jay Young.

478
00:29:51.072 --> 00:29:53.390
It will be easy to find him...

479
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:56.090
if Eun Byul shows me his picture.

480
00:30:02.617 --> 00:30:04.930
Mi Joo, welcome to our house.

481
00:30:06.421 --> 00:30:08.640
You really married well.

482
00:30:09.691 --> 00:30:11.710
Are you complimenting him before even tasting them?

483
00:30:12.194 --> 00:30:15.210
I'm happy to see that you're living happily.

484
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:17.910
Are those your children?

485
00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:20.350
Yes, they're my treasures.

486
00:30:21.002 --> 00:30:23.680
You must have had a hard time to live happily like this.

487
00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:25.940
Forget about the past,

488
00:30:25.941 --> 00:30:27.290
and be happy.

489
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:29.710
Since you brought up the subject,

490
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:31.860
I have a favor to ask you.

491
00:30:32.147 --> 00:30:33.460
What favor?

492
00:30:33.615 --> 00:30:35.960
Hwa Young wants to find her sister.

493
00:30:36.384 --> 00:30:38.670
Have you heard anything about her?

494
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:40.930
Professor Sarah Kang?

495
00:30:41.056 --> 00:30:43.440
It's been 30 years since I've seen her.

496
00:30:43.825 --> 00:30:45.690
I want to know if she's alive or not, at least.

497
00:30:45.694 --> 00:30:48.940
I'm still in touch with some classmates from the academy.

498
00:30:48.964 --> 00:30:50.710
I'll ask around about her.

499
00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:53.680
Thank you.

500
00:30:53.735 --> 00:30:57.150
I won't forget to thank you if I can only find my sister.

501
00:30:59.641 --> 00:31:01.350
Let's eat.

502
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.130
I lost hope, but you made me have hope now.

503
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:07.730
Hwa Young.

504
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.300
I have...

505
00:31:10.585 --> 00:31:12.430
something to apologize to you.

506
00:31:13.521 --> 00:31:14.700
What is it?

507
00:31:15.323 --> 00:31:16.540
Do you remember...

508
00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:20.540
that woman you told me about before?

509
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:22.710
Choi Sun Young?

510
00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:24.610
Did she visit you again?

511
00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:26.150
Did you tell...

512
00:31:26.568 --> 00:31:28.450
her about me?

513
00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:32.190
I had no choice.

514
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:35.920
She blackmailed me that she would report my business to discontinue.

515
00:31:37.379 --> 00:31:39.960
But I didn't tell her much.

516
00:31:40.615 --> 00:31:42.200
I just told her your real name...

517
00:31:43.585 --> 00:31:46.000
and that Jay was the name of your ex-husband.

518
00:31:46.588 --> 00:31:47.800
That's it.

519
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.170
We need to stop her.

520
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:56.840
Let's finish this in any means possible.

521
00:32:02.237 --> 00:32:04.670
Please come here and take Mother.

522
00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:07.390
She's here with Han Gyul.

523
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.520
Darn it. That woman.

524
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.050
She's about to ruin her son's life.

525
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.200
Why would she take the kid there?

526
00:32:18.453 --> 00:32:20.930
I can't believe this.

527
00:32:22.057 --> 00:32:23.200
So Won.

528
00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:26.410
Is Han Gyul asleep? Give her to me.

529
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:27.740
Oh, my.

530
00:32:28.897 --> 00:32:30.210
Okay.

531
00:32:33.501 --> 00:32:35.350
She was asking for you so much.

532
00:32:35.737 --> 00:32:37.680
She must really like being with you.

533
00:32:38.406 --> 00:32:39.790
Mom, I'm sorry.

534
00:32:39.908 --> 00:32:42.120
You don't have to be sorry to me.

535
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.290
You need to be sorry to your wife and Han Gyul.

536
00:32:46.147 --> 00:32:48.190
I don't know what I should do.

537
00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.130
This is the mistake I made.

538
00:32:53.088 --> 00:32:54.450
It's hard to handle this.

539
00:32:54.456 --> 00:32:57.340
Don't say anything weak like that, and keep it together.

540
00:32:58.059 --> 00:32:59.460
As you said,

541
00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:01.440
it's your life, and it's your mistake.

542
00:33:02.197 --> 00:33:04.660
Don't make your father take responsibility for this.

543
00:33:04.666 --> 00:33:08.010
You need to be responsible for this from now on.

544
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.720
I want to, but things are going against my will.

545
00:33:11.973 --> 00:33:13.920
How can I persuade Yeon Ju?

546
00:33:14.342 --> 00:33:15.870
How will I persuade Mother,

547
00:33:15.877 --> 00:33:18.020
let alone Yeon Ju?

548
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.800
So will you neglect her again?

549
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:24.130
She knows everything.

550
00:33:24.452 --> 00:33:26.020
How will you raise her as your sister?

551
00:33:26.021 --> 00:33:28.540
Things are complicated because I want to raise her as my daughter.

552
00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:33.010
So Won.

553
00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:36.410
People will do...

554
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:38.880
everything for their children.

555
00:33:39.701 --> 00:33:41.650
That's how precious children are.

556
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.120
Do you think you can live well after abandoning her?

557
00:33:45.974 --> 00:33:48.190
Don't think about any other ways.

558
00:33:49.144 --> 00:33:50.290
I'm happy...

559
00:33:50.745 --> 00:33:53.460
that you're rich and successful.

560
00:33:54.349 --> 00:33:56.630
But no matter how hard it is,

561
00:33:57.585 --> 00:33:59.630
I wish you would do your duties as a human being.

562
00:34:01.156 --> 00:34:02.200
Mom.

563
00:34:03.825 --> 00:34:06.410
You're all here.

564
00:34:06.795 --> 00:34:08.430
Come in.

565
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:11.230
It's okay. Han Gyul's asleep,

566
00:34:11.232 --> 00:34:13.100
so I need to go.

567
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:16.570
You can't do that. The bazaar is almost over.

568
00:34:16.571 --> 00:34:19.600
Since the whole family is here,

569
00:34:19.607 --> 00:34:21.040
let's have a dinner together.

570
00:34:21.042 --> 00:34:22.270
Please come in.

571
00:34:22.277 --> 00:34:24.490
So Won, hurry and come in.

572
00:34:56.444 --> 00:34:57.990
You're here.

573
00:34:58.046 --> 00:34:59.460
Why are you crying?

574
00:34:59.814 --> 00:35:01.580
Did your Mother-in-law say something to you?

575
00:35:01.583 --> 00:35:03.000
Please go in.

576
00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:05.970
I think I'll get a divorce.

577
00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:09.140
That's ridiculous.

578
00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:13.470
I told you this before. I'll persuade your mother-in-law for you.

579
00:35:13.661 --> 00:35:15.840
So don't worry about anything.

580
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.880
Just be careful in front of your mom.

581
00:35:19.734 --> 00:35:20.880
Okay.

582
00:35:21.336 --> 00:35:23.550
You're the only person on my side.

583
00:35:23.671 --> 00:35:27.090
Yes, there's nothing to worry about.

584
00:35:27.242 --> 00:35:31.860
I'll handle So Won and your mother-in-law today for you.

585
00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:33.730
Trust me.

586
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:35.960
Okay.

587
00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.500
Goodness.

588
00:35:47.428 --> 00:35:50.830
Ms. Hong, cover the baby with this.

589
00:35:50.832 --> 00:35:53.330
It's okay. You don't have to do this.

590
00:35:53.334 --> 00:35:55.830
What are you talking about?

591
00:35:55.837 --> 00:36:01.500
She's the precious sister of So Won.

592
00:36:01.509 --> 00:36:03.710
Cover her with this.

593
00:36:03.711 --> 00:36:05.860
Our precious child.

594
00:36:09.651 --> 00:36:11.900
Let's raise the temperature of the air conditioner.

595
00:36:12.153 --> 00:36:13.350
Chairwoman Yang?

596
00:36:13.354 --> 00:36:14.620
Yes?

597
00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:15.740
You promised...

598
00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:19.190
to find a bigger size for my pants.

599
00:36:19.194 --> 00:36:22.330
Oh, my goodness.

600
00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.460
I forgot about it for a moment.

601
00:36:25.466 --> 00:36:27.830
The larger sizes...

602
00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:30.230
are in the warehouse.

603
00:36:30.238 --> 00:36:31.770
Wait outside for a minute.

604
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:34.100
- Okay. - Just a moment, please.

605
00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:35.590
Wait a minute.

606
00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:38.490
Hey.

607
00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:41.840
So Won, I'm going to leave.

608
00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:44.530
Tell her later.

609
00:36:50.525 --> 00:36:51.800
Oh, my. Honey?

610
00:36:52.794 --> 00:36:55.330
- Why are you here? - Father.

611
00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.710
You're so eager to ruin your son's life.

612
00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:01.600
Honey, calm down.

613
00:37:01.603 --> 00:37:02.870
Let's talk outside.

614
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.150
How can I calm down?

615
00:37:06.007 --> 00:37:09.220
Why is it so loud out there?

616
00:37:10.278 --> 00:37:13.080
How could you bring the child here?

617
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:14.690
Are you out of your mind?

618
00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.250
Okay, it's my fault.

619
00:37:17.252 --> 00:37:19.400
Let's talk outside.

620
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.420
So Won, leave with Han Gyul.

621
00:37:21.422 --> 00:37:22.520
Leave first.

622
00:37:22.523 --> 00:37:23.570
Okay.

623
00:37:27.762 --> 00:37:30.960
Honey, let's talk outside.

624
00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:33.230
Are you winding me up?

625
00:37:33.234 --> 00:37:35.820
Why did you do this if you're so scared right now?

626
00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:37.770
Do you think I would change my mind...

627
00:37:37.772 --> 00:37:39.600
if you keep provoking me?

628
00:37:39.607 --> 00:37:41.090
Oh, my.

629
00:37:41.442 --> 00:37:44.410
Or are you trying to blackmail me?

630
00:37:44.412 --> 00:37:47.040
Are you blackmailing me by being around Mrs. Yang...

631
00:37:47.048 --> 00:37:49.530
to tell her the truth if you're angry?

632
00:37:49.751 --> 00:37:51.400
What are they talking about?

633
00:37:51.819 --> 00:37:54.570
What truth is there to tell me?

634
00:37:54.822 --> 00:37:58.790
Honey, calm down. Mrs. Yang will hear you.

635
00:37:58.793 --> 00:38:04.110
Why did you do this when you're so scared like this?

636
00:38:04.465 --> 00:38:06.600
I'm going to tell you one more time.

637
00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:08.720
Don't be confused and listen well.

638
00:38:09.337 --> 00:38:11.980
Han Gyul is...

639
00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:14.820
clearly my child.

640
00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:17.490
She's not So Won's child.

641
00:38:17.945 --> 00:38:21.130
She is Lee Shin Mo's daughter.

642
00:38:21.316 --> 00:38:22.950
Daughter.

643
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.030
What are they talking about?

644
00:38:25.853 --> 00:38:28.030
Han Gyul is...

645
00:38:30.124 --> 00:38:32.810
not So Won's child.

646
00:38:34.028 --> 00:38:36.380
She is...

647
00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:38.780
Mr. Lee's daughter?

648
00:38:41.002 --> 00:38:45.220
I asked her to bring your dad. Why did she bring you out here?

649
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.090
No, he's my dad.

650
00:38:55.817 --> 00:38:57.500
Mrs. Yang.

651
00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:01.900
What...

652
00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:06.670
What did you just say?

653
00:39:07.195 --> 00:39:09.210
I...

654
00:39:11.232 --> 00:39:15.160
Han Gyul's not Lee So Won's kid,

655
00:39:15.169 --> 00:39:17.050
but your daughter?

656
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:21.390
Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.

657
00:39:21.676 --> 00:39:24.970
Because she's so young,

658
00:39:24.979 --> 00:39:27.910
she wants to call her granddaughter.

659
00:39:27.915 --> 00:39:29.900
My gosh.

660
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:33.020
I may not be educated,

661
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.190
but I understand words fast.

662
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.970
My senses are faster than the light.

663
00:39:39.026 --> 00:39:40.310
Look.

664
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:44.340
If she's your daughter, she's your daughter.

665
00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:48.000
Why would So Won interfere...

666
00:39:48.002 --> 00:39:50.100
when he has nothing to do with it?

667
00:39:50.104 --> 00:39:52.870
This is very suspicious.

668
00:39:52.874 --> 00:39:55.670
Mrs. Yang. Don't be.

669
00:39:55.676 --> 00:39:57.310
There's nothing to be suspicious of.

670
00:39:57.311 --> 00:40:00.980
I'll explain everything. Don't misunderstand.

671
00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:03.100
Let me explain.

672
00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:08.570
She said she's ashamed to raise such a young child,

673
00:40:08.623 --> 00:40:09.970
so out of anger,

674
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:13.010
I told her to give the child to So Won.

675
00:40:13.895 --> 00:40:16.930
Since Yeon Ju has a trouble getting pregnant,

676
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:18.900
we were going to make them raise the child,

677
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.670
but she kept going on about it.

678
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:26.190
That's what happened. My gosh.

679
00:40:31.546 --> 00:40:34.810
Do you get it now?

680
00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:37.080
I said it out of anger.

681
00:40:37.084 --> 00:40:39.080
Don't take it wrong.

682
00:40:39.086 --> 00:40:42.970
No matter what other people say, Han Gyul's my daughter,

683
00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:45.020
so I'll raise her...

684
00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:46.110
Mr. Lee.

685
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:50.340
You know how much I like you, right?

686
00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:54.010
Although you're stubborn as a bull,

687
00:40:54.235 --> 00:40:57.000
you're tough, loyal, and cool.

688
00:40:57.004 --> 00:41:00.590
Out of all, you don't deceive others.

689
00:41:00.741 --> 00:41:03.990
That's what I like about you. You know that, right?

690
00:41:06.948 --> 00:41:09.530
Stop making me a fool,

691
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.850
and tell me the truth.

692
00:41:10.852 --> 00:41:13.650
Mrs. Yang. That's not it.

693
00:41:13.654 --> 00:41:17.400
- What I told you is the truth... - Stop it!

694
00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:19.440
Tell me!

695
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.190
What is the truth?

696
00:41:21.195 --> 00:41:24.510
What are you hiding from me? Tell me the truth.

697
00:41:27.802 --> 00:41:28.920
Now!

698
00:41:29.971 --> 00:41:31.150
Now!

699
00:41:31.405 --> 00:41:34.090
Tell me! What is it?

700
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.260
I'll tell you the truth.

701
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.820
- Honey. No. - Hey, So Won.

702
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.970
- So Won. - Hey. Stop, everyone.

703
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:49.800
Be quiet.

704
00:41:54.195 --> 00:41:55.370
Go on.

705
00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:18.200
Han Gyul... That kid...

706
00:42:20.521 --> 00:42:21.800
is my daughter.

707
00:42:24.358 --> 00:42:25.470
My gosh.

708
00:42:28.262 --> 00:42:29.380
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:32.280
I'm really sorry, Mother.

710
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.260
- Mrs. Yang. - Mom.

711
00:42:35.269 --> 00:42:37.830
Mrs. Yang. Mrs. Yang. Are you okay?

712
00:42:37.838 --> 00:42:39.820
- Mrs. Yang. - My gosh.

713
00:42:44.412 --> 00:42:47.130
- Mom. - How dare you...

714
00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:48.890
My poor daughter.

715
00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:50.860
Mom.

716
00:42:51.052 --> 00:42:52.470
- My poor daughter. - Mom.

717
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.300
- My dear daughter. - Mom.

718
00:42:57.024 --> 00:42:58.440
Mom.

719
00:42:58.626 --> 00:43:01.210
Mom. Mom.

720
00:43:11.606 --> 00:43:12.820
Here you are, Chairman Kevin.

721
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:18.720
It's good.

722
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:21.960
- Is this rose tea? - Yes, it is.

723
00:43:22.149 --> 00:43:24.200
You must be a tea expert.

724
00:43:25.419 --> 00:43:26.900
Do you remember that day?

725
00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:30.570
The day I embarrassed myself in front of you.

726
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.210
Are you okay, Chairman Kevin?

727
00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:37.780
Help me, please.

728
00:43:38.799 --> 00:43:41.110
Yes. As you expected,

729
00:43:41.402 --> 00:43:44.050
I was an alcoholic in the past.

730
00:43:47.108 --> 00:43:49.170
I never drank...

731
00:43:49.176 --> 00:43:51.490
after I quit drinking 17 years ago.

732
00:43:52.213 --> 00:43:53.930
Every time I felt like drinking,

733
00:43:54.148 --> 00:43:56.960
I ran a marathon or went out to a countryside.

734
00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:00.120
I drank so many different kinds of tea instead.

735
00:44:00.121 --> 00:44:02.070
That made me become a tea expert.

736
00:44:03.424 --> 00:44:04.970
It must've been hard.

737
00:44:05.693 --> 00:44:08.210
Is that why you often visited Bali?

738
00:44:08.696 --> 00:44:10.210
That's right.

739
00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:14.150
Every time I was stressed, I had to stop myself from craving for drinks.

740
00:44:14.835 --> 00:44:16.780
Every time that happened,

741
00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:19.320
I stayed in Bali to recover myself and hid my identity.

742
00:44:21.442 --> 00:44:23.490
Are you cured now?

743
00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:27.260
There's no cure for an alcoholic.

744
00:44:27.648 --> 00:44:29.860
It's like having a bomb inside me.

745
00:44:31.352 --> 00:44:34.900
Even just a drop can ruin everything.

746
00:44:39.126 --> 00:44:41.170
Alcohol ruined my life.

747
00:44:42.163 --> 00:44:44.240
It made the person I love leave me.

748
00:44:45.066 --> 00:44:47.110
It made my life lonely.

749
00:44:51.405 --> 00:44:55.190
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

750
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:59.090
It might be because you're like my son.

751
00:45:03.417 --> 00:45:06.800
From time to time, I think if the person who left me gave birth,

752
00:45:07.088 --> 00:45:08.970
the child would be like you.

753
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.300
It's of course a sad imagination.

754
00:45:12.927 --> 00:45:16.240
A child only causes a headache.

755
00:45:17.198 --> 00:45:19.850
When you get old, friends are better than your child.

756
00:45:20.501 --> 00:45:21.900
We'll be your friends.

757
00:45:21.902 --> 00:45:23.270
Me too, Chairman Kevin.

758
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.040
If you ever get stressed, call me anytime.

759
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.820
We'll make you laugh.

760
00:45:28.542 --> 00:45:31.090
Okay. I'll look forward to our next meeting.

761
00:45:31.412 --> 00:45:34.080
Only if you don't disappoint me...

762
00:45:34.081 --> 00:45:37.130
in the new menu development.

763
00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:39.670
- Sure. - Sure.

764
00:45:45.426 --> 00:45:48.410
I had no choice but to tell Choi Sun Young when she came back.

765
00:45:49.063 --> 00:45:51.580
I told her Hwa Young's real name and her life in the US.

766
00:46:04.378 --> 00:46:06.710
Come out right after you show her the picture.

767
00:46:06.714 --> 00:46:09.090
What if Grandma gives me the money for your beauty classes?

768
00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:11.150
Can I take it?

769
00:46:11.152 --> 00:46:14.300
Whatever. It's up to you.

770
00:46:14.755 --> 00:46:16.170
I know you want it.

771
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.590
Let's share it evenly without Dad knowing.

772
00:46:18.592 --> 00:46:19.670
Let's go.

773
00:46:23.564 --> 00:46:24.710
Dad.

774
00:46:25.833 --> 00:46:27.450
What are you doing here?

775
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:29.220
That's what I want to ask you.

776
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:30.950
What are you two doing here?

777
00:46:35.943 --> 00:46:37.090
Give it to me.

778
00:46:44.752 --> 00:46:47.620
Grandma said she needs it to help Tae Yang.

779
00:46:47.621 --> 00:46:50.520
She said she needs to know his real father to protect him.

780
00:46:50.524 --> 00:46:51.740
You guys!

781
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:55.740
What did I tell you?

782
00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:58.210
I told you to stay away from her.

783
00:47:04.171 --> 00:47:05.720
Stay in the car.

784
00:47:08.375 --> 00:47:09.920
I'll deal with you two when we get home.

785
00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:11.860
Let's go.

786
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.570
This is the money for the beauty classes.

787
00:47:54.822 --> 00:47:56.570
Put more money in it.

788
00:47:56.991 --> 00:47:58.670
They're only students.

789
00:47:58.759 --> 00:48:00.510
Are students aliens?

790
00:48:01.862 --> 00:48:04.580
There's something I learned from life.

791
00:48:05.165 --> 00:48:07.000
You can buy everything with money,

792
00:48:07.001 --> 00:48:08.380
even their hearts.

793
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.920
I need to feed them enough to keep them beside me.

794
00:48:18.946 --> 00:48:21.830
Are you disappointed because it's not the kids?

795
00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:24.400
I guess they're kids after all.

796
00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:29.740
They just had to tell you because they couldn't handle it.

797
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.510
Is this what you wanted?

798
00:48:40.601 --> 00:48:41.830
What are you doing?

799
00:48:41.835 --> 00:48:43.650
Are you using the kids now?

800
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.820
Let me give you an advice for the last time because I feel bad...

801
00:48:49.143 --> 00:48:50.760
that you're becoming despicable.

802
00:48:52.579 --> 00:48:55.690
I don't know why you're digging up Hwa Young's past,

803
00:48:56.216 --> 00:48:58.410
but you will not gain anything.

804
00:48:58.419 --> 00:48:59.470
Not at all.

805
00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:02.570
I'm sure that she's a criminal.

806
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.290
That's why she ran away to Korea and lived unregistered...

807
00:49:06.293 --> 00:49:09.330
when she could live normally as Anna Kang.

808
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.340
Then dig her past harder.

809
00:49:11.799 --> 00:49:14.210
We have nothing to fear even if you do.

810
00:49:14.335 --> 00:49:15.550
Do you know why?

811
00:49:15.836 --> 00:49:18.220
Whatever happened in her past...

812
00:49:18.605 --> 00:49:20.170
is all over now.

813
00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:21.220
Really?

814
00:49:21.675 --> 00:49:24.260
Then let us go to the end,

815
00:49:24.378 --> 00:49:26.260
and find out who's telling the truth.

816
00:49:40.427 --> 00:49:43.240
Where did I see him from? He looks familiar.

817
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:45.610
Is he...?

818
00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:24.120
Gosh.

819
00:50:54.334 --> 00:50:55.550
That's right.

820
00:50:55.769 --> 00:50:58.420
I was right. He's definitely Go Jung Do.

821
00:51:00.374 --> 00:51:03.490
What is he doing here?

822
00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:06.330
Does he know...

823
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:09.630
someone from my company?

824
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:24.740
It's that man.

825
00:51:38.779 --> 00:51:40.040
Are you done with the sauce?

826
00:51:40.047 --> 00:51:42.630
Yes, it's done.

827
00:51:52.126 --> 00:51:53.310
It's not bad.

828
00:51:54.428 --> 00:51:55.460
Is the meat cooked?

829
00:51:55.462 --> 00:51:57.380
I know that.

830
00:51:57.564 --> 00:51:58.840
I'll try it.

831
00:52:01.401 --> 00:52:04.500
It's cooked if it's hot when you put...

832
00:52:04.505 --> 00:52:07.320
this chopstick on your face after poking the meat.

833
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:11.360
Really? I didn't know that.

834
00:52:11.812 --> 00:52:12.990
That's interesting.

835
00:52:14.314 --> 00:52:15.430
Try it on my face.

836
00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:18.700
Gosh.

837
00:52:19.253 --> 00:52:21.670
Is it overcooked?

838
00:52:24.625 --> 00:52:25.950
Did I burn you?

839
00:52:25.959 --> 00:52:28.010
It stings so much.

840
00:52:28.362 --> 00:52:29.830
- What should I do? - Blow on me.

841
00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:31.580
- What? - Hurry up and blow.

842
00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:37.380
You had onions and ginger.

843
00:52:42.943 --> 00:52:46.120
Seriously, why do you always tease me?

844
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.810
Because it's fun.

845
00:52:47.814 --> 00:52:49.750
Who will I tease if it's not you?

846
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.800
You're not going to fool me again.

847
00:52:59.193 --> 00:53:00.260
Here.

848
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.210
It's okay. I'm not going to try it.

849
00:53:03.964 --> 00:53:06.110
It's bossam that will melt in your mouth.

850
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:18.320
Do you still think you don't eat a lot?

851
00:53:21.548 --> 00:53:24.360
It's really melting and disappearing from my mouth.

852
00:53:24.918 --> 00:53:26.300
How is the sauce?

853
00:53:28.255 --> 00:53:30.240
Honestly, it could be better.

854
00:53:30.524 --> 00:53:31.940
It's a little ordinary.

855
00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.910
Tomorrow's the first evaluation.

856
00:53:35.696 --> 00:53:37.380
Do you mean that we have to start all over again?

857
00:53:38.398 --> 00:53:40.280
We still have 12 hours left.

858
00:53:51.178 --> 00:53:52.460
The sauce is...

859
00:53:59.987 --> 00:54:01.570
They're having the time of their lives.

860
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:04.340
Are they there to have fun?

861
00:54:04.791 --> 00:54:07.210
Will they make the sauce again for the rest of the night?

862
00:54:07.694 --> 00:54:11.280
Do we have to stay up all night here?

863
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.650
We can wait...

864
00:54:15.402 --> 00:54:18.900
and just see the results. Just the results.

865
00:54:18.905 --> 00:54:22.320
Copy the project proposal and bring it to me tomorrow.

866
00:54:22.542 --> 00:54:23.760
Are you sure...

867
00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:27.280
that this won't affect me at all?

868
00:54:27.281 --> 00:54:28.830
Trust me.

869
00:54:29.583 --> 00:54:32.300
It won't, but if something goes wrong,

870
00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:34.300
I'll compensate you for everything.

871
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:50.780
How is it?

872
00:54:57.544 --> 00:54:58.660
It's a success.

873
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.630
That's good.

874
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:58.020
Han Gyul is...

875
00:55:58.271 --> 00:55:59.550
my daughter.

876
00:56:00.874 --> 00:56:02.050
My poor Yeon Ju.

877
00:56:03.777 --> 00:56:06.630
Goodness. That idiot.

878
00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.690
He was always good at obeying me.

879
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.600
He's intent on ruining his life after so long.

880
00:56:15.088 --> 00:56:18.940
Mrs. Yang probably want to divorce them.

881
00:56:19.526 --> 00:56:21.910
How should I handle this?

882
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:46.470
Mother, how are you feeling?

883
00:56:59.232 --> 00:57:02.910
Get out of here. I don't want to see your handsome face.

884
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:05.220
I'm sorry, Mother.

885
00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:07.490
How long were you having an affair with...

886
00:57:08.041 --> 00:57:10.260
the child's mother?

887
00:57:11.445 --> 00:57:13.070
I was in a relationship with her for three years in college,

888
00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:14.830
and broke up with her while I was in the military.

889
00:57:15.949 --> 00:57:17.900
We lost contact after that.

890
00:57:18.485 --> 00:57:20.070
But the child appeared out of the blue...

891
00:57:21.721 --> 00:57:23.020
a while ago.

892
00:57:23.023 --> 00:57:25.740
So you...

893
00:57:26.059 --> 00:57:31.010
already had a flaw of having a child before you married my daughter.

894
00:57:31.431 --> 00:57:34.830
This is a fraudulent marriage.

895
00:57:34.835 --> 00:57:38.100
I know that this sounds like an excuse,

896
00:57:38.104 --> 00:57:40.100
but I wouldn't have married Yeon Ju if I knew I had a child.

897
00:57:40.106 --> 00:57:43.770
Why did that woman give birth to that child secretly...

898
00:57:43.777 --> 00:57:46.070
if she couldn't raise her?

899
00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:48.280
If she gave birth,

900
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:51.650
she should've been responsible for the child.

901
00:57:51.651 --> 00:57:54.350
How could she abandon...

902
00:57:54.354 --> 00:57:57.900
her child to a perfectly happy family?

903
00:57:58.525 --> 00:58:00.110
I'm really sorry.

904
00:58:01.461 --> 00:58:04.630
I will take responsibility for this issue regarding the child.

905
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:07.400
Take responsibility, my foot.

906
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.170
You have nothing to say for yourself.

907
00:58:11.171 --> 00:58:13.290
Just wait for my decision.

908
00:58:14.174 --> 00:58:18.160
I just want you to divorce my daughter right now.

909
00:58:18.678 --> 00:58:20.210
I don't want to see you right now.

910
00:58:20.213 --> 00:58:22.760
Get out of here, you two-faced jerk.

911
00:58:35.629 --> 00:58:39.540
The old sayings are never wrong.

912
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.020
Handsome people make you pay for their beauty.

913
00:58:44.971 --> 00:58:46.320
This means divorce.

914
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.990
This mean divorce 100 percent.

915
00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:59.100
Why did you call me?

916
00:59:00.921 --> 00:59:01.970
Really?

917
00:59:03.123 --> 00:59:06.740
Fine. There's something I want to say. Let's meet.

918
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:11.880
What are you doing, Han Gyul?

919
00:59:12.599 --> 00:59:15.160
Are you going to work, Sister?

920
00:59:15.168 --> 00:59:18.280
I'm not your sister anymore. I'm your aunt.

921
00:59:18.572 --> 00:59:19.990
Say Aunt.

922
00:59:20.273 --> 00:59:21.550
Aunt.

923
00:59:22.175 --> 00:59:24.920
It's so awkward. Is it awkward for you too?

924
00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:29.530
I got you a gift, Han Gyul. Do you want to see it?

925
00:59:31.217 --> 00:59:32.400
Close your eyes.

926
00:59:45.932 --> 00:59:47.110
Open your eyes.

927
00:59:49.169 --> 00:59:50.730
What's this?

928
00:59:50.737 --> 00:59:52.620
This goes on your head.

929
00:59:53.106 --> 00:59:54.920
You never tried it before?

930
00:59:56.443 --> 00:59:57.820
Do you want me to help you?

931
00:59:59.946 --> 01:00:01.090
Here.

932
01:00:05.585 --> 01:00:07.470
You're so beautiful.

933
01:00:07.721 --> 01:00:08.900
Do you want to look in the mirror?

934
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.570
Here.

935
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:20.450
My goodness. What's that?

936
01:00:22.335 --> 01:00:24.320
You look like a princess, Han Gyul.

937
01:00:26.673 --> 01:00:28.590
She never tried such things before.

938
01:00:29.275 --> 01:00:30.490
Don't worry.

939
01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:33.860
Grandma and Aunt will get you many hairpins.

940
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.300
What about Dad? Will you get one for Dad too?

941
01:00:37.484 --> 01:00:39.630
Of course. Dad too.

942
01:00:42.355 --> 01:00:46.070
Mom. What's So Won going to do?

943
01:00:46.426 --> 01:00:49.610
If he gets swayed by Dad again, he's no human at all.

944
01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:55.450
Whatever happens, I must help him take care of Han Gyul.

945
01:01:09.983 --> 01:01:12.100
What is it? Why did you call me?

946
01:01:14.821 --> 01:01:16.900
I need to talk to you. Sit down.

947
01:01:29.402 --> 01:01:30.620
Write it down.

948
01:01:32.005 --> 01:01:33.150
Hurry.

949
01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:41.130
A memorandum.

950
01:01:41.881 --> 01:01:45.030
I, Hong Young Hye, swear to the followings.

951
01:01:45.585 --> 01:01:47.150
What are you doing?

952
01:01:47.153 --> 01:01:49.250
Just write it down.

953
01:01:49.255 --> 01:01:51.640
It won't harm you. Write it down.

954
01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:55.660
(Memorandum)

955
01:01:55.662 --> 01:01:59.010
After this moment,

956
01:01:59.332 --> 01:02:02.280
Regardless of Lee So Won's relation to her,

957
01:02:02.602 --> 01:02:05.820
I, Hong Young Hye, will raise Oh Han Gyul.

958
01:02:12.212 --> 01:02:13.420
Aren't you going to write it down?

959
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.130
Give up now.

960
01:02:15.782 --> 01:02:17.760
Even Mrs. Yang knows it.

961
01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:21.770
What are you trying to hide by making me write this?

962
01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:24.190
It's over now,

963
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:26.910
so please get over it.

964
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.970
Are you saying you can't write it?

965
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:32.230
No, I can't.

966
01:02:32.232 --> 01:02:34.300
No, I won't.

967
01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.230
- Hey, come here. - Let me go.

968
01:02:37.237 --> 01:02:39.000
- Write it down. Sit. - My gosh.

969
01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.100
- Write it now. - Let me go.

970
01:02:41.107 --> 01:02:42.320
My gosh.

971
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.090
You're insane!

972
01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:47.930
Hey, Hong Young Hye.

973
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:50.800
Are you seriously going to do this?

974
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:55.850
Even until the last moment,

975
01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.020
I squeezed my brain out...

976
01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:02.010
to figure out a way to save our son all night.

977
01:03:02.128 --> 01:03:05.610
Are you going to be all selfish?

978
01:03:05.899 --> 01:03:08.230
How can you call yourself a mother?

979
01:03:08.234 --> 01:03:10.010
Get a grip.

980
01:03:11.171 --> 01:03:15.190
Do you think raising Han Gyul...

981
01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.490
will help So Won?

982
01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.980
This all happened because you abandoned...

983
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.800
the pregnant girl six years ago. Can't you see it?

984
01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:29.170
You have no right to order So Won around.

985
01:03:29.489 --> 01:03:32.170
What you're doing isn't helping him.

986
01:03:32.492 --> 01:03:36.320
You're only pushing him off the cliff and ruining him.

987
01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:37.510
What did you say?

988
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.650
What about you? What have you done for him?

989
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.900
You're the one who ruined not just my life,

990
01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.780
but also his life.

991
01:03:48.174 --> 01:03:52.090
If you just accepted it when I said...

992
01:03:53.479 --> 01:03:58.080
that Han Gyul's my daughter and that there's some deep meaning behind,

993
01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:01.570
this would've never happened.

994
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.850
Listen, Lee Shin Mo.

995
01:04:03.857 --> 01:04:05.440
I don't want to listen to you.

996
01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.070
That's not all.

997
01:04:07.193 --> 01:04:09.960
When they found out that she's So Won's daughter,

998
01:04:09.963 --> 01:04:13.330
any normal moms would beg their daughters-in-law...

999
01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:16.230
that they'll raise the kid,

1000
01:04:16.236 --> 01:04:20.240
but you just couldn't wait to ruin everything.

1001
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.800
This would've never happened...

1002
01:04:22.809 --> 01:04:24.960
if you didn't take Han Gyul to the bazaar.

1003
01:04:25.979 --> 01:04:28.760
You're the one to blame for So Won's divorce.

1004
01:04:29.749 --> 01:04:33.410
Were you trying to calm Mrs. Yang...

1005
01:04:33.419 --> 01:04:35.900
by making me write this?

1006
01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:39.970
Yes. This is the only way to save So Won.

1007
01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.870
Mrs. Yang's a cool woman.

1008
01:04:43.162 --> 01:04:45.130
If I tell her everything that happened,

1009
01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:48.110
she'll extenuate and forgive us.

1010
01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:50.470
What we have left is Han Gyul...

1011
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.220
They won't accept her, so I should raise her?

1012
01:04:53.873 --> 01:04:55.690
Why not?

1013
01:04:56.342 --> 01:04:59.760
That way, you can atone for your sin.

1014
01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.130
Also, you can fulfill the duty as a mom for the last time.

1015
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:07.870
If you still have any mother's affection left,

1016
01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.670
write as I say. Write it.

1017
01:05:15.028 --> 01:05:16.110
Fine.

1018
01:05:16.562 --> 01:05:19.110
I can raise her with no problem.

1019
01:05:22.802 --> 01:05:23.920
Good.

1020
01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:29.820
At least you have conscience.

1021
01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:44.840
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

1022
01:05:45.124 --> 01:05:47.890
The thought of facing the shameless people...

1023
01:05:47.894 --> 01:05:49.870
suffocates me.

1024
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:55.380
Whatever. I don't care.

1025
01:05:58.171 --> 01:05:59.480
Hold on.

1026
01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.920
What's important now?

1027
01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.590
My daughter's fate is up to me.

1028
01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:08.530
Darn it. Let's face them.

1029
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.070
(I, Hong Young Hye, swear to the followings.)

1030
01:06:19.659 --> 01:06:21.170
Okay. Great.

1031
01:06:21.861 --> 01:06:24.510
This will persuade Mrs. Yang.

1032
01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:31.450
Who is it?

1033
01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:32.920
Are we expecting a guest?

1034
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.390
Mrs. Yang. Hello.

1035
01:06:43.816 --> 01:06:46.130
I'm here because Ms. Yang called.

1036
01:06:49.822 --> 01:06:52.070
Why did you...

1037
01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:55.920
tell her to come all the way here? What are you going to tell her?

1038
01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:59.110
She's already in shock. That's so thoughtless of you.

1039
01:07:02.068 --> 01:07:03.730
I'm sorry for bugging you.

1040
01:07:03.736 --> 01:07:05.920
Please accept my apology.

1041
01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:07.420
No thanks.

1042
01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:11.260
Our children's marriage is over.

1043
01:07:11.377 --> 01:07:13.880
They're on the verge of getting divorced.

1044
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.790
I wouldn't just ignore this as a mother.

1045
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:19.960
You're very generous.

1046
01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.680
I'm sure you'd be in a high rank position if you were a man.

1047
01:07:23.689 --> 01:07:28.170
I don't want to hear any of your sly compliments.

1048
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:31.690
We don't even feel comfortable facing each other.

1049
01:07:31.697 --> 01:07:33.880
Are we going to sit down or what?

1050
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.150
- Let's sit. - Yes.

1051
01:07:38.905 --> 01:07:42.420
I know you're tired, so I'll make it brief.

1052
01:07:42.942 --> 01:07:45.440
What are you doing standing there?

1053
01:07:45.445 --> 01:07:47.130
Bring some tea.

1054
01:07:48.948 --> 01:07:50.700
It's fine!

1055
01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:55.150
I'm about to cough blood out.

1056
01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:58.240
Why would I drink tea with you?

1057
01:07:58.591 --> 01:08:00.510
Sit down, and get to the point.

1058
01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.780
My opinion is also her opinion.

1059
01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:08.000
You can talk to me alone.

1060
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.150
No.

1061
01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:12.050
There's something I want to say.

1062
01:08:12.271 --> 01:08:16.290
What? What's wrong with you?

1063
01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:19.360
Who's going to start first?

1064
01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:22.540
Do you want me to get to the conclusion?

1065
01:08:22.548 --> 01:08:26.160
No, no. There is an order for everything.

1066
01:08:26.552 --> 01:08:30.470
I'll start first.

1067
01:08:30.823 --> 01:08:35.040
First of all, I'd like to say sorry.

1068
01:08:35.161 --> 01:08:37.830
I'm ashamed and sorry.

1069
01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:39.210
I don't know what to say.

1070
01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.850
As So Won's father,

1071
01:08:43.169 --> 01:08:45.870
I sincerely beg your forgiveness.

1072
01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:49.050
I don't need crocodile tears.

1073
01:08:49.242 --> 01:08:51.170
My goodness.

1074
01:08:51.177 --> 01:08:54.880
You tried to fool me...

1075
01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:57.950
like a marble in your hand.

1076
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:02.100
Were you planning to deceive me...

1077
01:09:02.321 --> 01:09:06.050
if I didn't hear it that day?

1078
01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.110
Not at all.

1079
01:09:09.095 --> 01:09:13.330
I was trying my best to minimize the damage on you...

1080
01:09:13.332 --> 01:09:15.460
and work it out peacefully.

1081
01:09:15.468 --> 01:09:19.380
Have you heard how this happened?

1082
01:09:19.672 --> 01:09:21.020
So?

1083
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.750
My son...

1084
01:09:23.142 --> 01:09:27.330
never meant to hide it to intentionally hurt Yeon Ju.

1085
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.440
The mistake he committed before he got married...

1086
01:09:30.449 --> 01:09:32.300
finally broke out after six years.

1087
01:09:33.019 --> 01:09:38.140
I know it hurt Yeon Ju so much after all,

1088
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:44.510
but I think she can understand it if she tries.

1089
01:09:44.964 --> 01:09:48.200
What you're saying is he didn't do anything wrong,

1090
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:49.680
so just take it as it is?

1091
01:09:50.169 --> 01:09:51.880
Are you siding with your son?

1092
01:09:52.171 --> 01:09:54.720
No. That's not it.

1093
01:09:55.374 --> 01:10:00.120
Don't make it worse. Stay quiet.

1094
01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.040
I'll do the talking now.

1095
01:10:02.048 --> 01:10:03.130
Mrs. Yang.

1096
01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:06.700
Think of why you're here.

1097
01:10:07.186 --> 01:10:12.170
Aren't we gathered here to help our kids in any means possible?

1098
01:10:13.659 --> 01:10:15.560
We have to admit...

1099
01:10:15.561 --> 01:10:18.590
So Won and Yeon Ju didn't get along at first,

1100
01:10:18.598 --> 01:10:20.030
but now,

1101
01:10:20.032 --> 01:10:22.800
they were about to work it out.

1102
01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.130
That's... That's why... Oh, my.

1103
01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:28.440
That's why it's upsetting me.

1104
01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:31.220
Right. I feel bad too.

1105
01:10:32.612 --> 01:10:34.390
Honestly,

1106
01:10:34.714 --> 01:10:36.940
even though So Won is my son,

1107
01:10:36.949 --> 01:10:39.060
I know he's not very friendly.

1108
01:10:39.852 --> 01:10:42.870
He became even colder after he failed his first love.

1109
01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:46.850
I'm sure it wasn't easy for him to open up like this.

1110
01:10:46.859 --> 01:10:49.060
Stop talking gibberish.

1111
01:10:49.061 --> 01:10:50.860
That's not why I'm here.

1112
01:10:50.863 --> 01:10:52.030
What's your point?

1113
01:10:52.031 --> 01:10:54.630
Tell me what this is about.

1114
01:10:54.634 --> 01:10:57.630
My point is whatever it takes,

1115
01:10:57.637 --> 01:11:00.020
we should help them stay together.

1116
01:11:00.373 --> 01:11:02.790
Right. That's the answer.

1117
01:11:02.808 --> 01:11:06.370
That's your opinion.

1118
01:11:06.379 --> 01:11:10.010
What about my dear daughter's life?

1119
01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:11.850
To be honest,

1120
01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.550
my daughter's just a little behind the education,

1121
01:11:14.553 --> 01:11:17.690
but why would such a young girl...

1122
01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:20.720
raise someone else's child, as if she lacks in something?

1123
01:11:20.726 --> 01:11:23.060
I thought about it over and over again,

1124
01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:25.330
but there's no answer to this.

1125
01:11:25.331 --> 01:11:27.600
This is unacceptable.

1126
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.700
I know. I know,

1127
01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.700
but think about their future...

1128
01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:35.170
That's why it's driving me crazy.

1129
01:11:35.174 --> 01:11:37.740
Why does Yeon Ju have to do that?

1130
01:11:37.743 --> 01:11:39.270
It's not like raising a puppy.

1131
01:11:39.278 --> 01:11:42.180
Raising someone else's child...

1132
01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:43.740
isn't a piece of cake.

1133
01:11:43.749 --> 01:11:45.210
Tell me, Ms. Hong.

1134
01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:48.820
My daughter's about to vomit blood.

1135
01:11:48.821 --> 01:11:51.470
Tell me what you can do.

1136
01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.210
My goodness. Why are you quiet?

1137
01:11:57.463 --> 01:11:59.390
I told you to speak up.

1138
01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.980
Hurry up. Say it.

1139
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:05.680
What...

1140
01:12:08.874 --> 01:12:10.720
What's this?

1141
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:14.280
I, Hong Young Hye, swear to the followings.

1142
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.950
"Regardless of Lee So Won's relation to her,"

1143
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:21.370
"I, Hong Young Hye, will raise Oh Han Gyul."

1144
01:12:22.021 --> 01:12:23.320
Is this true?

1145
01:12:23.322 --> 01:12:26.750
Of course. This is why she called you...

1146
01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:29.140
to come over.

1147
01:12:29.362 --> 01:12:31.460
We'll become Han Gyul's parents,

1148
01:12:31.464 --> 01:12:34.750
and never make you worry about her,

1149
01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:37.350
so please stop being angry,

1150
01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:39.270
and please forgive So Won.

1151
01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:42.670
My gosh. You stay quiet!

1152
01:12:42.675 --> 01:12:44.240
You're so noisy.

1153
01:12:44.243 --> 01:12:46.610
She's the one raising the kid,

1154
01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.590
so stay quiet, or go into your room.

1155
01:12:48.981 --> 01:12:50.800
Tell me, Ms. Hong.

1156
01:12:51.016 --> 01:12:53.230
Are you really going to do what it says on here?

1157
01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:56.380
Answer me.

1158
01:12:56.389 --> 01:12:58.740
Is this really what you want?

1159
01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:17.250
Oh, my. This is unbelievable.

1160
01:13:17.543 --> 01:13:21.530
This is quite a show you're putting on.

1161
01:13:33.225 --> 01:13:35.510
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1162
01:13:35.594 --> 01:13:37.760
I'm such a lucky guy who married a great lady.

1163
01:13:37.763 --> 01:13:39.330
Bravo.

1164
01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:42.200
Today, we will commemorate our wedding.

1165
01:13:42.201 --> 01:13:44.970
The person who stole the proposal is here.

1166
01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:47.130
Weren't you alone in the office?

1167
01:13:47.139 --> 01:13:48.140
Ms. Lee Ru Ri?

1168
01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.600
I'm going to tell Tae Yang.

1169
01:13:49.608 --> 01:13:52.370
I can't let him know that I tried to kill his father.

1170
01:13:52.378 --> 01:13:55.540
This will be my last card.

1171
01:13:55.548 --> 01:13:59.950
I want to live with you and your wife as soon as possible.

1172
01:13:59.952 --> 01:14:01.420
It's your choice.

1173
01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.580
Are you going to choose my daughter or your daughter?

1174
01:14:03.589 --> 01:14:05.240
No!
