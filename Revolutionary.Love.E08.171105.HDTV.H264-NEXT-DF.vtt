00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.052
Where?

3
00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.676
<i>[Episode 8]</i>
Seman Foods in Anseong.

4
00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:24.598
He went there
to terminate their contract.

5
00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:27.450
You sent an intern alone to do
something like that?

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.737
What about it?
It was Director Seol's order.

7
00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:33.367
What? Managing Director Seol?

8
00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:42.151
<i>This is your first test, Byun Hyuk.</i>

9
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.746
<i>How will you pass this test?</i>

10
00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:52.730
Hello!

11
00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:59.371
Can we just go in like this? Is it okay?

12
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.030
Is no one here?

13
00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:15.899
What's wrong, Joon?

14
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:35.300
- What are you doing? Hurry.
- Okay.

15
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.595
- Come hold him up.
- Okay.

16
00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:39.949
All right. Yeah.

17
00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:45.720
Hey, hurry up. Joon, hurry.

18
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.288
- Okay.
- Joon, faster.

19
00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:52.568
Oh, this hurts.

20
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.223
Are you all right?

21
00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:11.880
Mister, are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

22
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.269
You have to live no matter what.
You have to live and see it through.

23
00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.300
Don't you have family, mister?

24
00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.079
Don't you have parents or children?

25
00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.205
I... I want to live.

26
00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.416
I want to live!

27
00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.918
But, I can't do this,
no matter how hard I try.

28
00:02:28.918 --> 00:02:30.840
What am I supposed to do?

29
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:37.935
President!

30
00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:40.091
President! President!

31
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:42.971
President, what is this?

32
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:46.703
Why did you do this?

33
00:02:46.703 --> 00:02:49.043
Get up, please. Get up.

34
00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:55.984
What are we
supposed to do if you do this?

35
00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:28.017
What just happened?

36
00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:30.675
What did we see?

37
00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:40.031
You two are out here.

38
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:41.881
Is the president okay?

39
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:44.972
He would've been in big trouble if
you'd come even a bit later.

40
00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:48.061
You two saved his life.

41
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.489
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

42
00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.859
No problem.

43
00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.744
Shouldn't he go to the hospital?

44
00:03:53.744 --> 00:03:56.793
Yes, his family is coming soon.

45
00:03:56.793 --> 00:04:00.025
But... who are you again?

46
00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:03.436
I'm here from the Strategic Planning
team of Gangsu Foods.

47
00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:06.845
Gangsu Foods?

48
00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.299
I don't know if this is the right
situation for it...

49
00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.132
but I came to get this stamped
with a seal.

50
00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:19.926
Get out. Get out!

51
00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.061
How dare you come in here?

52
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:26.090
I was just told to get these
stamped with a seal.

53
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.311
Get lost, you jerks. Get out of here!

54
00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:38.501
Looks like the talks didn't go so well.

55
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.364
Gosh, he just said to get them stamped.

56
00:04:44.087 --> 00:04:45.946
Let's go, Joon.

57
00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:47.056
Okay.

58
00:04:55.308 --> 00:04:59.777
That's why you need to come to
an agreement and get it done.

59
00:04:59.777 --> 00:05:01.018
How can I do that?

60
00:05:01.018 --> 00:05:04.172
That's a matter of your skill,
Byun Hyuk.

61
00:05:04.172 --> 00:05:06.001
Here's a new contract.

62
00:05:07.128 --> 00:05:10.219
Does this make sense?
I have to come to an agreement with him.

63
00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:11.948
How can I do that?

64
00:05:11.948 --> 00:05:14.320
Can they do this, Jae Hoon?

65
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.522
Do I have to resolve
work issues for you now too?

66
00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:18.441
Figure out your own work problems.

67
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:21.626
That president was hanging himself
and I was just there.

68
00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:23.561
I was like this and this.

69
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:25.967
Then I did this and barely
managed to save him.

70
00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:28.172
I don't know him, but that president...

71
00:05:31.232 --> 00:05:35.876
I think he was doing that
because of this very contract.

72
00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:40.008
So, how can I go back there and
asked him to stamp his seal?

73
00:05:44.438 --> 00:05:47.621
How can you work if you're always
thinking about people's situations?

74
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:51.037
Since you're in the company now,
you need to take care of yourself.

75
00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:00.837
He is so cold, as always.

76
00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:05.010
If he stamps his seal,
the factory will probably shut down.

77
00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:08.044
Why will they shut down?

78
00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:12.727
Usually, they buy all the ingredients
to prepare for future orders.

79
00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:15.818
The production line would be
set up in preparation of that.

80
00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:19.708
But, Gangsu is suddenly terminating
the contract before production.

81
00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:21.008
So they would have to shut down.

82
00:06:21.008 --> 00:06:23.587
I have to get that seal stamped though.

83
00:06:23.587 --> 00:06:25.987
Yes, you do.

84
00:06:25.987 --> 00:06:27.458
That will ruin them.

85
00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.547
Yes, it will.

86
00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:33.330
Unless Gangsu Foods pays them
compensation for damages.

87
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.628
Compensation for damages?

88
00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:36.229
What? Compensation for damages.

89
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.229
Yes, compensation for damages.
Can't we do it?

90
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.340
Why would we send you
if we were going to offer that?

91
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.861
We wanted to handle it quietly
without legal issues.

92
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:52.220
If we do it that way,
Seman Foods will close down.

93
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.229
- Who said that?
- Joon.

94
00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.049
Hey, are you in a position to care
about subcontractors?

95
00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:01.160
You're an employee of Gangsu Foods.

96
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.462
If you can't get that seal stamped,
everyone on our team will be blamed.

97
00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:08.229
You might be safe since
you're the CEO's son.

98
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.828
Other people will get a black mark
for causing a loss to the company.

99
00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:15.530
In severe cases, it's a demotion.
Do you know that?

100
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.741
Is that how things work?

101
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:21.883
What does Joon know about our
team to speak so carelessly?

102
00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:23.398
Seriously...

103
00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:27.710
Joon didn't do anything wrong.

104
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.907
She only answered
because I asked a question.

105
00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:23.729
Oh, seriously.

106
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:43.254
Joon?

107
00:08:43.254 --> 00:08:45.739
She called saying she can't come today.

108
00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:48.398
Really? That's strange.

109
00:08:48.398 --> 00:08:51.468
She was gone when
I went up this morning.

110
00:08:51.468 --> 00:08:52.744
She's not answering her phone.

111
00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:55.946
You don't know why
she's not here, do you?

112
00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:57.556
We don't know.

113
00:08:57.556 --> 00:08:59.032
Maybe she's visiting her father.

114
00:08:59.032 --> 00:09:00.301
Her father?

115
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:03.022
Her father passed away long ago.

116
00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:09.872
When she has a lot on her mind,
she has a habit of going to her dad.

117
00:09:09.872 --> 00:09:11.613
Ah, I see.

118
00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:17.613
What should I do?

119
00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:24.936
If you can't get that stamped today,
don't even think about coming to work!

120
00:09:27.194 --> 00:09:29.296
My goodness.

121
00:09:29.296 --> 00:09:31.432
I told you I have nothing more to say.

122
00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:33.778
Why do you keep showing up?

123
00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:36.009
I'm not an employee of Gangsu Foods.

124
00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:40.114
Oh, what is all of this?

125
00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:43.124
Are these your meals?

126
00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.290
Have you been filling up on soju?

127
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.816
Why does it matter to you?

128
00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:48.686
Why wouldn't it matter to me?

129
00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:50.734
I did save your life.

130
00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:54.691
Nonetheless, I won't stamp my seal.

131
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.252
Even with a knife to my throat, I won't.

132
00:09:57.252 --> 00:10:01.849
It may seem like a drop in the bucket,
but I will sue for damages.

133
00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:05.055
Yes, you should.

134
00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:08.825
You should do everything you want...

135
00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:12.305
except for dying.

136
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.162
Why would you die for them?

137
00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:22.426
Why would you die to please them?

138
00:10:22.426 --> 00:10:27.225
The moment you get weak,
you lose to them.

139
00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:29.672
You can't sit back like this.

140
00:10:29.672 --> 00:10:31.484
You have to hold on, no matter what.

141
00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:36.177
How long can a person like me hold on?

142
00:10:37.263 --> 00:10:39.345
I'm always in the same
sad state every day.

143
00:10:39.345 --> 00:10:41.893
Don't get weak on me again.

144
00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:43.776
You've worked hard all this time.

145
00:10:45.614 --> 00:10:49.888
You were a subcontractor
for Gangsu Foods for over 20 years.

146
00:10:49.888 --> 00:10:52.302
I know that was quite a feat.

147
00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:57.454
Back in the day, Gangsu Foods
wasn't this bad though.

148
00:10:57.454 --> 00:11:02.350
When Manager Baek was around,
I was still dealing with real people.

149
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.194
He could protect us from
the abuse of the main contractor.

150
00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:10.984
What's the use of saying these things?

151
00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:13.108
I'm just kicking myself at this point.

152
00:11:16.023 --> 00:11:17.234
Gosh.

153
00:11:17.234 --> 00:11:21.887
Why is it that all the good people
pass away so early?

154
00:11:47.922 --> 00:11:48.950
Joon.

155
00:11:50.749 --> 00:11:52.835
Have I become the lead figure
in wielding abuse?

156
00:11:54.138 --> 00:11:55.994
It's not to that extent.

157
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:58.228
Um...

158
00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:03.507
To put it simply, you're like a tool.

159
00:12:04.878 --> 00:12:07.359
You're an employee who has to do
what your bosses tell you to.

160
00:12:08.646 --> 00:12:14.037
But, I wish you could be a little
different than other normal employees.

161
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.233
You want me to be different?

162
00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:21.853
If you want to,
you have the strength to do it.

163
00:12:21.853 --> 00:12:22.893
I do?

164
00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:27.402
Even with the cleaning service
employees...

165
00:12:27.402 --> 00:12:31.152
if you hadn't been there and
if it weren't for you

166
00:12:31.152 --> 00:12:34.763
do you think we would have
the results we have today?

167
00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:36.734
It's because it was you.

168
00:12:36.734 --> 00:12:42.093
I believe the end result is what it
was because of you.

169
00:12:42.093 --> 00:12:44.730
It happened because it was me?

170
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.705
Yes, because it was you.

171
00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:49.892
Because it was you...

172
00:12:49.892 --> 00:12:51.936
Because you changed your mind...

173
00:12:51.936 --> 00:12:55.628
things we've been fighting against
for over 10 years were easily resolved.

174
00:12:57.478 --> 00:12:59.676
It makes me very angry.

175
00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:02.946
Yet, that is the reality.

176
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.970
I have to get to my part-time job.

177
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.129
I'm going to get going.

178
00:13:31.123 --> 00:13:32.412
But, Joon...

179
00:13:33.954 --> 00:13:36.128
I understand what you're trying to say.

180
00:13:38.093 --> 00:13:41.292
I understand why you want me to be
different than other employees.

181
00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:42.980
Because it's me and I'm me.

182
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.220
That's why the result was different.
I can understand that too.

183
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.321
But, the thing is...

184
00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:50.825
suppose I change like you want me to.

185
00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:55.523
What will happen then?

186
00:13:55.523 --> 00:13:57.594
What do you mean?

187
00:13:57.594 --> 00:14:00.633
If I really do change...

188
00:14:00.633 --> 00:14:05.103
When that time comes...
will you see me as a man then?

189
00:14:08.422 --> 00:14:11.326
Do you... like Hyuk?

190
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.460
Will you do that?

191
00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:26.754
Excuse me?

192
00:14:26.754 --> 00:14:28.531
That girl.

193
00:14:28.531 --> 00:14:32.946
That girl who came in when Hyuk was
getting beaten by Father, Baek Joon.

194
00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:34.402
Do you know anything about her?

195
00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:38.931
No, not really.

196
00:14:40.551 --> 00:14:43.681
I heard she was there during
the brick incident with CEO Min.

197
00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:46.402
You didn't see her when you went there?

198
00:14:48.402 --> 00:14:50.113
I'm not sure.

199
00:14:50.113 --> 00:14:52.576
She's a very suspicious girl.

200
00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:56.494
She's not the quality of girl that
Byun Hyuk would be around.

201
00:14:56.494 --> 00:14:59.912
She's just the type cause trouble.

202
00:14:59.912 --> 00:15:02.470
She has been bothering me.

203
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.672
The fact that Hyuk turned himself in
and started working as a cleaner...

204
00:15:07.672 --> 00:15:10.301
Even going on about hiring them directly.

205
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.311
Now, he's become an intern.

206
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:17.191
This is not the Hyuk that I know.

207
00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:18.470
Right, Section Chief Kwon?

208
00:15:23.743 --> 00:15:28.551
Hyuk's actions have always
been difficult to predict.

209
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:30.901
You know that better than me, Chief.

210
00:15:30.901 --> 00:15:35.162
Even so, he's never done this.

211
00:15:35.162 --> 00:15:39.850
Can't you see that Hyuk has changed?

212
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.821
Since we're on the topic,
look into Baek Joon's background.

213
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:48.850
Find out who she is and
why she's always with Hyuk.

214
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.003
Okay?

215
00:15:51.003 --> 00:15:52.340
Yes, I will.

216
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.508
Apartment 302. My place.

217
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.821
Beep, beep, beep. It's open.

218
00:16:25.249 --> 00:16:26.522
Why isn't it opening?

219
00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:34.100
<i>Why isn't it opening?</i>

220
00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:37.849
<i>Beep, beep, beep.</i>

221
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:42.277
<i>Hello?</i>

222
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.185
<i>That's strange.</i>

223
00:16:45.185 --> 00:16:47.166
<i>Beep, beep, beep.</i>

224
00:16:50.282 --> 00:16:51.868
Why isn't it opening?

225
00:16:56.617 --> 00:16:57.686
Hey there.

226
00:16:57.686 --> 00:16:59.033
This is my place.

227
00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:02.252
Beep, beep, beep.

228
00:17:02.252 --> 00:17:04.457
Please stop, okay?

229
00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:07.599
Really?

230
00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:16.511
Oh, it's open.

231
00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:24.196
I thought I was going to die.

232
00:17:27.403 --> 00:17:31.417
You! Why weren't you opening, door?

233
00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:38.452
My head hurts.

234
00:18:02.792 --> 00:18:04.627
You can't sleep here.

235
00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:08.975
Don't bother me.

236
00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:10.554
Wake up, okay?

237
00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:22.601
Man, I'm going crazy.

238
00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:25.003
Joon! Joon!

239
00:18:26.386 --> 00:18:27.615
Joon.

240
00:18:28.913 --> 00:18:30.463
Joon!

241
00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:33.913
You have to give me an answer.
How can you just leave, Joon?

242
00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:35.032
Joon!

243
00:18:38.695 --> 00:18:40.069
Hyuk.

244
00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:42.436
Yes, tell me whatever it is.

245
00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:43.966
Tell me how you feel.

246
00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.773
You're a good person.

247
00:18:53.773 --> 00:18:56.256
You're a good friend.

248
00:18:56.256 --> 00:18:57.397
Also...

249
00:18:59.343 --> 00:19:00.866
you were a good colleague too.

250
00:19:04.196 --> 00:19:05.877
That's it?

251
00:19:05.877 --> 00:19:07.856
Isn't that enough?

252
00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.501
Joon.

253
00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:13.840
I know that you're a good person and
we're already good friends.

254
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.727
Also, we were once good work colleagues.

255
00:19:16.727 --> 00:19:19.905
I'm very thankful for that. Aren't you?

256
00:19:19.905 --> 00:19:22.773
Of course, I'm thankful. But, Joon...

257
00:19:22.773 --> 00:19:24.763
That's good, then.

258
00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:27.073
Let's just go that far.

259
00:19:27.073 --> 00:19:28.445
I like you.

260
00:19:30.615 --> 00:19:32.164
I like you too...

261
00:19:33.195 --> 00:19:34.343
as a friend.

262
00:19:39.693 --> 00:19:42.761
Ah, I have to go to work,
so I'm going to head up now.

263
00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:43.926
Sleep well.

264
00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:25.663
Ah, you scared me.

265
00:20:26.788 --> 00:20:29.069
What are you doing there
like that in the dark?

266
00:20:32.176 --> 00:20:34.071
You really scared me.

267
00:20:38.186 --> 00:20:40.686
When a woman says she wants
to be friends with a man...

268
00:20:41.785 --> 00:20:45.747
that's a rejection, right?

269
00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:48.590
Did Joon say she just
wants to be friends?

270
00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:54.300
Is it because she's just shy?

271
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.829
She might be unable to express herself.

272
00:20:56.829 --> 00:20:58.785
I know Baek Joon pretty well.

273
00:20:58.785 --> 00:21:01.827
She doesn't play games
if she likes someone.

274
00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:03.512
She's the type to tell the guy first.

275
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:07.610
No, you say that because you only know
Joon as a friend and not as a woman.

276
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.361
Joon may be sure of herself
and have strong opinions

277
00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:14.080
but, she is not so sure
when it comes to dating.

278
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.683
Even when she likes someone,
she can't express her true feelings.

279
00:21:16.683 --> 00:21:18.856
Are these feelings for real or what?

280
00:21:19.852 --> 00:21:21.494
She's the type to be conflicted.

281
00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:23.214
That's it.

282
00:21:23.214 --> 00:21:24.742
She said she wanted to be friends?

283
00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:26.052
Well, that's...

284
00:21:29.975 --> 00:21:31.788
Perhaps, that's because
we haven't progressed

285
00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:33.601
beyond the stages of friendship.

286
00:21:33.601 --> 00:21:35.154
Isn't that possible, friend?

287
00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:36.818
Progress, yeah right.

288
00:21:36.818 --> 00:21:38.118
Yes.

289
00:21:38.118 --> 00:21:42.945
This is the time to show her
my intimate feelings.

290
00:21:42.945 --> 00:21:45.145
Hey, you'll get in big trouble
with Section Chief Yang

291
00:21:45.145 --> 00:21:46.946
if you don't get that stamp.

292
00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:50.108
Nothing comes before love, my friend.

293
00:21:57.975 --> 00:21:59.992
I'm going to take a shower.

294
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:13.610
Oh, my head hurts.

295
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:45.184
What? What is this?

296
00:22:55.933 --> 00:22:58.121
What was that?

297
00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:01.380
You, you! What are you doing?

298
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:07.407
<i>Get out! Get out! Get out!</i>

299
00:23:07.407 --> 00:23:10.497
Hey, you! Get out!

300
00:23:10.497 --> 00:23:12.054
Get out, you crazy punk!

301
00:23:12.054 --> 00:23:13.407
Stop it!

302
00:23:13.407 --> 00:23:15.378
Get out, crazy punk!

303
00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:17.061
Hold on. Just hold on!

304
00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:21.515
Calm down.

305
00:23:21.515 --> 00:23:22.867
Where am I?

306
00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:24.869
I asked you where I am.

307
00:23:24.869 --> 00:23:28.145
Here? This is my place.

308
00:23:28.145 --> 00:23:31.034
What? What did you say?

309
00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:43.484
Why I am here then?

310
00:23:43.484 --> 00:23:47.935
You didn't kidnap me, did you?

311
00:23:47.935 --> 00:23:49.215
What do you mean kidnap?

312
00:23:49.215 --> 00:23:51.273
Then why am I here?

313
00:23:51.273 --> 00:23:53.263
That's what I want to ask you!

314
00:23:54.715 --> 00:23:57.145
- Get out.
- What?

315
00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:59.451
Just get out!

316
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:02.822
<i>Get out!</i>

317
00:24:02.822 --> 00:24:04.186
Did you all hear that too?

318
00:24:04.186 --> 00:24:05.778
What is it?

319
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.923
T... T-1000?

320
00:24:17.923 --> 00:24:19.076
T-1000?

321
00:24:20.975 --> 00:24:22.721
Ah, seriously.

322
00:24:22.721 --> 00:24:24.003
Why are you here?

323
00:24:24.003 --> 00:24:26.107
You're not here to catch me, are you?

324
00:24:26.107 --> 00:24:27.457
Why would he catch you?

325
00:24:27.457 --> 00:24:29.349
Did you forget you went
to the prosecutor?

326
00:24:29.349 --> 00:24:31.186
Yes, that's right.

327
00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:32.607
Why are you here then?

328
00:24:37.707 --> 00:24:41.225
Ha Yeon Hee, why are you
coming out from there?

329
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.926
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

330
00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:55.475
Nothing happened
between us yesterday, right?

331
00:24:55.475 --> 00:24:57.346
That's not true.

332
00:24:57.346 --> 00:24:59.129
You forcefully entered my home.

333
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.178
- His home?
- Forceful entry.

334
00:25:02.178 --> 00:25:07.820
Yes, but did anything
inappropriate happen?

335
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.012
On my honor as a policeman,
nothing like that happened.

336
00:25:11.012 --> 00:25:12.733
Are you satisfied?

337
00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:14.299
I am satisfied with that.

338
00:25:15.461 --> 00:25:18.840
Sorry, I drank a lot yesterday.

339
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.856
Well, then.

340
00:25:51.871 --> 00:25:54.490
The new person on
the third floor is T-1000?

341
00:25:57.975 --> 00:26:00.561
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

342
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:04.135
Kwon Jae Hoon saw
everything. What do I do?

343
00:26:04.135 --> 00:26:07.295
I just don't know.

344
00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:09.399
What a relief that Joon
is alone on the roof.

345
00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:13.500
No matter how drunk she is,
she won't go into the wrong place.

346
00:26:16.206 --> 00:26:17.539
Isn't that right, Joon?

347
00:26:19.227 --> 00:26:23.437
I'm a designated driver,
so I wouldn't really be drunk anyway.

348
00:26:24.368 --> 00:26:27.848
I'd like it if you would refrain
from driving so late, Joon.

349
00:26:34.638 --> 00:26:38.657
I don't like that you work so hard, Joon.

350
00:26:38.657 --> 00:26:43.079
Why don't you stop working so hard
and find a man to depend on?

351
00:26:49.539 --> 00:26:53.148
You... didn't brush your teeth, did you?

352
00:26:55.955 --> 00:26:57.607
Oh, sorry.

353
00:26:57.607 --> 00:26:59.799
I have to go to work.
I'm going to head back up.

354
00:27:01.043 --> 00:27:02.045
Gosh.

355
00:27:15.063 --> 00:27:17.380
Is this something to drag on like this?

356
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.915
Well, you must think you can work
slowly since you're the CEO's son.

357
00:27:21.915 --> 00:27:23.232
This could be a problem.

No, it's not that at all.

359
00:27:25.301 --> 00:27:29.093
I just don't think I can forcefully
get that seal stamped.

360

Our new product is going
to be launched soon.

361

We need to take care of this quickly.

362
00:27:33.865 --> 00:27:36.330
It's just that I've seen some things.

363
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.628
- Just to bury them...
- Hold on.

364
00:27:38.628 --> 00:27:41.951
That's offensive to hear.
Are you calling me a jerk or what?

365
00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:44.521
No, that's not what I meant.

366

Isn't there a way for us to both win?

368
00:27:49.698 --> 00:27:51.678
Shouldn't we think about it a bit more?

369
00:27:51.678 --> 00:27:53.496
Don't think. Don't think at all.

370
00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:56.088
You can't even do this task,
so why do you keep thinking?

371
00:27:57.689 --> 00:28:01.439
Geez, why did Director Seol tell me
give this task to an intern?

372
00:28:04.667 --> 00:28:07.064
There's a problem... a big problem.

- Right now... in the lobby.

I'm really not making any excuses,
Section Chief Yang.

485
00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:19.261
My legal seal is back in my office.

486
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.952
I'll give it to your intern
when he comes by.

487
00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:25.332
I really am sorry.

488
00:36:25.332 --> 00:36:28.292
I think I must've lost
my mind momentarily.

489
00:36:28.292 --> 00:36:30.227
This will never happen again.

490
00:36:30.227 --> 00:36:34.682
Please work with Seman Foods
again in the future.

491
00:36:34.682 --> 00:36:38.589
President Jang, I heard you.
Please go and don't interrupt our work.

492
00:36:38.589 --> 00:36:40.640
Yes, all right. I'm sorry.

493
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.703
I'm really sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

494
00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:46.723
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

495
00:36:59.287 --> 00:37:02.729
<i>They're doing this because
Byun Gang Su instructed them to.</i>

496
00:37:02.729 --> 00:37:04.979
What wrong are the employees committing?

497
00:37:04.979 --> 00:37:08.468
You're all just salary men anyway.

498
00:37:08.468 --> 00:37:10.705
This was already decided
by people above us.

499
00:37:10.705 --> 00:37:12.553
We can't do anything for him.

500
00:37:14.129 --> 00:37:17.198
By that, do you mean my father?

501
00:37:18.539 --> 00:37:22.035
<i>Byun Gang Su, you son of a bitch!</i>

502
00:38:03.461 --> 00:38:04.655
Baek Sung Ki?

503
00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:07.624
I've heard of him a lot from somewhere.

504
00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:12.158
Ah, that Baek Sung Ki.

505
00:38:12.158 --> 00:38:14.464
Do you happen to know him?

506
00:38:22.653 --> 00:38:26.176
<i>The Baek Sung Ki who developed
Gangsu Food's red chili paste.</i>

507
00:38:26.176 --> 00:38:27.807
<i>That's probably him.</i>

508
00:38:27.807 --> 00:38:29.517
<i>He was in the Strategic Planning team.</i>

509
00:38:29.517 --> 00:38:32.227
<i>I've only heard about him,
so I don't know much.</i>

510
00:38:45.218 --> 00:38:48.673
<i>But, I think he left the company.</i>

511
00:38:48.673 --> 00:38:51.823
<i>I heard it was related to something bad.</i>

512
00:39:21.607 --> 00:39:24.606
<i>[Baek Sung Ki: Dismissed
for charges of bribery]</i>

513
00:39:33.021 --> 00:39:36.606
I don't want to earn money cleaning
up after rich people like you.

514
00:39:36.606 --> 00:39:39.278
I'm telling you one more time.

515
00:39:39.278 --> 00:39:43.510
I have no interest in a full-time job,
especially in your company.

516
00:39:46.314 --> 00:39:48.979
<i>[Charges of bribery against
Manager Baek were submitted to HR.]</i>

517
00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:57.194
Did you find anything?

518
00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.131
There was nothing of interest.

519
00:39:59.131 --> 00:40:00.778
Her father passed away.

520
00:40:00.778 --> 00:40:03.997
Her mother is remarried and
they live separately.

521
00:40:03.997 --> 00:40:08.689
She doesn't have close relatives,
so there are no sources of information.

522
00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:11.118
- I'll look into it some more.
- Will you?

523
00:40:14.823 --> 00:40:17.160
All right. You can go.

524
00:40:20.713 --> 00:40:21.763
Yes.

525
00:41:07.071 --> 00:41:08.464
What are you doing?

526
00:41:11.209 --> 00:41:12.276
Nothing really.

527
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:19.970
So, you're going to get
the contract tomorrow?

528
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:24.557
Yeah, all I need to do
now is get that contract.

529
00:41:29.158 --> 00:41:31.327
You know, Joon...

530
00:41:31.327 --> 00:41:36.097
I never dreamed that this was how
my father's company was run.

531
00:41:36.097 --> 00:41:40.535
This is a product with no issues,
but our company is putting an end to it.

532
00:41:40.535 --> 00:41:42.307
The main contractor is being oppressive.

533
00:41:42.307 --> 00:41:45.499
Isn't there a systemic issue with
main contractors and subcontractors?

534
00:41:45.499 --> 00:41:46.937
It's not a slavery contract.

535
00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:50.827
Why don't subcontractors have any rights?

536
00:41:50.827 --> 00:41:52.986
I feel so bad for
President Jang who has no power.

537
00:41:56.205 --> 00:41:59.995
Yes, I do feel bad for him.

538
00:41:59.995 --> 00:42:02.559
He was wronged, as well.

539
00:42:02.559 --> 00:42:04.814
Still, he has no choice but to let it go.

540
00:42:04.814 --> 00:42:07.597
People in the powerless position have to.

541
00:42:07.597 --> 00:42:10.865
They could end up suffering
an even bigger loss if they don't.

542
00:42:13.963 --> 00:42:15.894
Why did Managing Director Seol...

543
00:42:17.863 --> 00:42:19.814
give me this torturous task?

544
00:42:23.825 --> 00:42:25.283
Why do you think he did, Joon?

545
00:42:27.783 --> 00:42:29.022
At the very least...

546
00:42:30.696 --> 00:42:35.928
I doubt it was just for you to know how
people feel wronged and end it there.

547
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:39.385
In the end, you make
the decision with this task.

548
00:42:39.385 --> 00:42:40.977
I do?

549
00:42:40.977 --> 00:42:43.472
Yes.

550
00:42:43.472 --> 00:42:44.573
You do.

551
00:42:46.321 --> 00:42:47.792
<i>She said these words to me.</i>

552
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.200
I wish you could be a little different
than other normal employees.

553
00:42:54.526 --> 00:42:55.718
<i>How?</i>

554
00:42:57.229 --> 00:43:01.531
If you want to,
you have the strength to do it.

555
00:43:03.392 --> 00:43:05.990
<i>How is that you could say
those words to me, Joon?</i>

556
00:43:08.189 --> 00:43:13.979
<i>Like an outsider, I've been latching
onto my father all this time.</i>

557
00:43:13.979 --> 00:43:16.843
<i>I enjoyed life thinking what belonged
to my father was mine.</i>

558
00:43:16.843 --> 00:43:21.731
<i>I really was just a third generation
rich guy with nothing going for me.</i>

559
00:43:54.283 --> 00:43:57.397
Yeah, what wrong have you done?

560
00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:00.993
You're just an employee
who has to follow orders.

561
00:44:00.993 --> 00:44:03.412
You have no choice either, right?

562
00:44:03.412 --> 00:44:09.602
Still, my heart was in pain seeing
you treat President Jang like that.

563
00:44:09.602 --> 00:44:13.865
Because you were being used as
a tool to abuse power.

564
00:44:15.475 --> 00:44:17.934
I'm a tool and a target.

565
00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:19.963
Who?

566
00:44:19.963 --> 00:44:21.796
Who targets you?

567
00:44:21.796 --> 00:44:22.917
You.

568
00:44:27.283 --> 00:44:28.658
You do it the most.

569
00:44:31.908 --> 00:44:34.111
Oh, I do?

570
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:36.885
Sorry for all the trouble I caused.

571
00:44:36.885 --> 00:44:38.455
Stop causing trouble if you know.

572
00:44:38.455 --> 00:44:41.171
Okay, my friend. I'll try my best.

573
00:44:45.566 --> 00:44:47.242
But, my friend...

574
00:44:47.242 --> 00:44:50.450
is there anything
that I can do right now?

575
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:51.589
What do you mean?

576
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:54.151
About Seman Foods?

577
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:57.754
Of course not.
Just get the contract stamped.

578
00:44:59.135 --> 00:45:03.421
Why did Managing Director Seol
give me this task then?

579
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:05.881
It's one of two reasons.

580
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:07.950
Know yourself.

581
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.060
What else?

582
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.656
Know your place.

583
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:16.551
Well... don't they mean the same thing?

584
00:45:18.323 --> 00:45:22.225
It means you should realize
that you can't do much.

585
00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:34.243
<i>That is what my friend said again.</i>

586
00:45:38.388 --> 00:45:42.723
If you can't get that seal stamped,
everyone on our team will be blamed.

587
00:45:42.723 --> 00:45:45.765
You might be safe since
you're the CEO's son.

588
00:45:45.765 --> 00:45:50.593
Other people will get a black mark
for causing a loss to the company.

589
00:45:50.593 --> 00:45:52.910
In severe cases, it's a demotion.
Do you know that?

590
00:45:55.115 --> 00:45:58.403
<i>How can both sides win?</i>

591
00:45:58.403 --> 00:46:00.444
<i>Is there really no way?</i>

592
00:46:00.444 --> 00:46:02.144
<i>How will you split it?</i>

593
00:46:03.566 --> 00:46:06.627
I could give you
10 billion won right now.

594
00:46:06.627 --> 00:46:08.970
You can split that with your friend.

595
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:12.832
It's up to you how you split it.

596
00:46:12.832 --> 00:46:14.439
How will you split it?

597
00:46:15.598 --> 00:46:18.238
I will split it 50-50.

598
00:46:19.988 --> 00:46:21.606
What?

599
00:46:21.606 --> 00:46:23.557
Was that it?

600
00:46:23.557 --> 00:46:24.881
What are you saying?

601
00:46:24.881 --> 00:46:26.881
I think I know the reason, Jae Hoon.

602
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.033
Hold on.

603
00:46:30.033 --> 00:46:31.751
Where are you going now?

604
00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:33.048
To work.

605
00:46:44.807 --> 00:46:46.359
You startled me!

606
00:46:48.609 --> 00:46:49.999
Why are you here so late?

607
00:46:49.999 --> 00:46:51.640
I need a designated driver, Joon.

608
00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.468
A designated driver?

609
00:46:53.468 --> 00:46:55.839
- Where are you going at this hour?
- To work.

610
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.077
What are you doing?

611
00:47:10.274 --> 00:47:12.289
Why do you want to know?

612
00:47:12.289 --> 00:47:14.303
Well, where's President Jang?

613
00:47:15.925 --> 00:47:17.624
The office. Why?

614
00:47:21.265 --> 00:47:23.790
- This is all...
- Are you here to see us in ruin?

615
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.827
Give it to me.

616
00:47:24.827 --> 00:47:27.675
Yes, you'll get it soon.

617
00:47:27.675 --> 00:47:31.234
Yes, please do that. Bye now.

618
00:47:38.484 --> 00:47:41.655
President Jang, what are you doing?

619
00:47:41.655 --> 00:47:45.803
What should I do with it? It'll rot soon.

620
00:47:45.803 --> 00:47:49.403
I bought lots of beef from
New Zealand just for Gangsu Foods.

621
00:47:49.403 --> 00:47:51.553
I'm selling it off for a low price.

622
00:47:51.553 --> 00:47:52.646
What?

623
00:47:55.118 --> 00:47:56.423
Oh yeah.

624
00:47:56.423 --> 00:47:59.843
I heard you're CEO Byun's son.

625
00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:01.562
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

626
00:48:01.562 --> 00:48:06.818
Pretend you never heard me
cursing your father... Sir.

627
00:48:06.818 --> 00:48:11.368
Never mind that.
President, unload your truck now.

628
00:48:11.368 --> 00:48:12.551
Why?

629
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:17.142
How can you make beef rice bowls
without the beef?

630
00:48:17.142 --> 00:48:19.591
So, unload the truck right now.

631
00:48:21.517 --> 00:48:24.260
Why would I make those?

632
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.769
I stamped my seal on
the termination contract.

633
00:48:28.769 --> 00:48:33.348
Yes, give this to Gangsu Foods.

634
00:48:33.348 --> 00:48:36.821
You should make the beef rice bowls.

635
00:48:36.821 --> 00:48:40.771
Goodness, what if I do?
What do I do with them?

636
00:48:40.771 --> 00:48:44.111
Put the brand Seman Foods
on them and sell them in the stores.

637
00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:51.754
Wait, would Gangsu Foods allow that?

638
00:48:51.754 --> 00:48:54.959
I'll be in charge of whether
they allow that or not.

639
00:48:54.959 --> 00:48:57.502
Produce those beef rice bowls.

640
00:49:01.551 --> 00:49:03.647
Hyuk.

641
00:49:03.647 --> 00:49:07.428
You... you just said
you'd be in charge of it.

642
00:49:07.428 --> 00:49:09.859
Yes, I will.

643
00:49:09.859 --> 00:49:13.057
I'm the one who makes
decisions in this matter.

644
00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:25.086
What are you planning to do?

645
00:49:25.086 --> 00:49:28.926
Seman was our contractor for 24 years.

646
00:49:28.926 --> 00:49:31.289
That's long enough
to be considered a friend.

647
00:49:31.289 --> 00:49:35.289
We should split it 50-50 with a friend.

648
00:49:35.289 --> 00:49:37.758
Did Gangsu Foods allow this?

649
00:49:37.758 --> 00:49:39.314
I should get permission now.

650
00:49:39.314 --> 00:49:41.428
First, we should terminate the contract.

651
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.068
What? You really got
the contract stamped?

652
00:49:50.068 --> 00:49:51.627
Take a look to confirm.

653
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.397
You should've done
this earlier. Good job.

654
00:50:01.397 --> 00:50:05.397
Then Seman Foods has completely
terminated their contract with us, right?

655
00:50:05.397 --> 00:50:08.127
Yes, it's completely terminated.

656
00:50:08.127 --> 00:50:13.281
What Seman Foods does has nothing to
do with Gangsu Foods anymore, right?

657
00:50:13.281 --> 00:50:16.216
It doesn't matter what they do,
so tell them to do what they please.

658
00:50:16.216 --> 00:50:20.743
Really? You really said that,
Section Chief Yang.

659
00:50:20.743 --> 00:50:23.939
They can do as they please...
as they please?

660
00:50:23.939 --> 00:50:27.441
Why do you keep asking
the same thing? I said yes.

661
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:30.080
Thank you for confirming,
Section Chief Yang.

662
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.999
How did it go?

663
00:50:57.171 --> 00:50:58.890
It's your turn now.

664
00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.970
Okay.

665
00:51:08.133 --> 00:51:10.577
You're all here.

666
00:51:10.577 --> 00:51:12.633
Here. Drink this.

667
00:51:12.633 --> 00:51:14.928
Thank you.

668
00:51:14.928 --> 00:51:18.935
Do any of you want
a part-time job after work today?

669
00:51:18.935 --> 00:51:19.984
What kind?

670
00:51:19.984 --> 00:51:22.383
You know that president
from the subcontractor?

671
00:51:22.383 --> 00:51:24.147
He started producing products.

672
00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:26.667
Their employees are very busy and
they're lacking manpower.

673
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:30.214
I thought that factory
got their contract terminated.

674
00:51:30.214 --> 00:51:34.584
Hyuk wants to try and save the factory,
so he said to make the product.

675
00:51:34.584 --> 00:51:36.511
Did they get permission from the bosses?

676
00:51:36.511 --> 00:51:38.894
Half yes and half no.

677
00:51:38.894 --> 00:51:40.247
You know how it is.

678
00:51:40.247 --> 00:51:42.694
Mister Byun is causing
trouble again, isn't he?

679
00:51:44.283 --> 00:51:47.309
Because of the situation they're in,
they can't pay a lot.

680
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:51.492
Instead, they promise a bonus once
the products start selling.

681
00:51:51.492 --> 00:51:52.542
Bonus?

682
00:51:55.176 --> 00:51:57.769
Do any of you want to go?

683
00:51:57.769 --> 00:51:59.035
Bonus! Bonus!

684
00:52:10.448 --> 00:52:12.240
What's the matter, Madam Ahn?

685
00:52:13.314 --> 00:52:17.095
If only there had been
one person like Hyuk...

686
00:52:17.095 --> 00:52:20.961
our factory wouldn't have shut down.

687
00:52:25.298 --> 00:52:27.247
What do you mean?

688
00:52:28.747 --> 00:52:31.649
Madam Ahn's family had
a subcontracting factory too.

689
00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:36.359
They shut down when
the main company terminated the contract.

690
00:52:36.359 --> 00:52:39.642
When she saw that president
getting kicked out...

691
00:52:39.642 --> 00:52:42.968
She says it's bringing
back some memories.

692
00:52:42.968 --> 00:52:46.602
Lately, she's been crying all the time.

693
00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.642
Joon, I'll go with you.

694
00:53:00.642 --> 00:53:02.513
I don't need to get paid.

695
00:53:02.513 --> 00:53:05.356
I'll happily go to help.

696
00:53:05.356 --> 00:53:09.430
Me too, but I need to get paid
even if it's a little.

697
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:13.301
I'll go too. I'll go for sure.

698
00:53:13.301 --> 00:53:14.734
Thank you.

699
00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.584
Thank you, everyone.

700
00:53:23.352 --> 00:53:26.863
So, did you find out
anything else about Baek Joon?

701
00:53:28.964 --> 00:53:31.292
There was nothing much to find out.

702
00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:35.642
Really?

703
00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:41.361
Yes, there was nothing
suspicious in her history.

704
00:53:41.361 --> 00:53:44.769
She grew up in a normal family and
was a normal college student.

705
00:53:55.368 --> 00:53:57.999
Any connections to Gangsu Group?

706
00:53:57.999 --> 00:53:59.501
There was nothing.

707
00:54:08.477 --> 00:54:10.019
Baek Joon's father, Baek Sung Ki.

708
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.289
Why didn't you report it?

709
00:54:21.377 --> 00:54:23.164
Are you getting any other ideas?

710
00:54:24.352 --> 00:54:28.450
Why? You feel bad
because Hyuk's your friend?

711
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.504
- It's not like that.
- Then what?

712
00:54:33.814 --> 00:54:36.716
I made a judgment call that it wasn't
something for you to worry about.

713
00:54:36.716 --> 00:54:39.763
I don't need your judgment calls.

714
00:54:39.763 --> 00:54:42.472
Just do what I tell you to, you punk.

715
00:54:48.205 --> 00:54:51.089
Aren't you on my side to get
promoted quickly?

716
00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:55.258
You know Hyuk very well.

717
00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:58.120
He isn't the type to protect people
just because they're his friends.

718
00:55:11.575 --> 00:55:15.303
Don't lose focus because
of some useless sympathy.

719
00:55:15.303 --> 00:55:18.700
Think about yourself, okay?

720
00:55:27.535 --> 00:55:30.539
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

721
00:55:46.669 --> 00:55:48.698
Don't worry.

722
00:55:48.698 --> 00:55:51.850
The CEO said he'll
take care of everything.

723
00:55:58.330 --> 00:55:59.591
Father!

724
00:56:02.912 --> 00:56:04.059
Father.

725
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.019
Eat well and stay healthy.

726
00:56:08.019 --> 00:56:11.356
Be well until I return.

727
00:56:11.356 --> 00:56:14.211
All right, Jae Hoon?

728
00:56:14.981 --> 00:56:16.363
<i>Jae Hoon.</i>

729
00:56:34.318 --> 00:56:38.557
<i>My friend, mon ami, my pal.</i>

730
00:56:38.557 --> 00:56:40.863
<i>I finally found out what I can do.</i>

731
00:56:48.486 --> 00:56:50.673
Oh, I'm going insane.

732
00:57:15.383 --> 00:57:17.149
Hurry, hurry.

733
00:57:17.149 --> 00:57:18.749
Keep it moving.

734
00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.091
This is going well.

735
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:23.305
Oh my.

736
00:57:26.039 --> 00:57:27.901
Take this box.

737
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:29.885
Hurry. Go, go.

738
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:34.142
<i>[Gangsu Beef Rice]</i>

739
00:57:48.513 --> 00:57:51.211
Oh, Jae Hoon. You're here?

740
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.254
Producing our product without permission.

741
00:58:03.254 --> 00:58:06.455
Gangsu Foods will not let this go.

742
00:58:06.455 --> 00:58:08.379
President Jang.

743
00:58:08.379 --> 00:58:09.680
You should prepare yourself.

744
00:58:15.129 --> 00:58:16.263
Gosh.

745
00:58:18.176 --> 00:58:19.370
I'll talk to him.

746
00:58:20.729 --> 00:58:21.787
Jae Hoon.

747
00:58:21.787 --> 00:58:24.015
What will we do?

748
00:58:26.276 --> 00:58:27.921
Hey, Jae Hoon.

749
00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:33.624
It wasn't without permission.
I told President Jang to do it.

750
00:58:33.624 --> 00:58:37.010
A Gangsu Foods employee gave
the product over to a subcontractor?

751
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:38.068
Are you crazy?

752
00:58:38.068 --> 00:58:40.807
They can divide the profits
with Gangsu. Isn't that okay then?

753
00:58:40.807 --> 00:58:42.175
That makes no sense.

754
00:58:42.175 --> 00:58:44.972
Gangsu Foods was going
to discontinue the item anyway.

755
00:58:44.972 --> 00:58:48.785
They will sell under the name Seman
and still divide profits with Gangsu.

756
00:58:48.785 --> 00:58:51.504
Isn't it too much
to say they can't do it?

757
00:58:51.504 --> 00:58:54.033
They don't want to do it,
but they don't want anyone else to.

758
00:58:54.033 --> 00:58:55.173
What is that?

759
00:58:55.173 --> 00:58:57.519
That's your simple-minded
way of thinking.

760
00:58:57.519 --> 00:58:59.260
We have a new product being launched.

761
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.300
There's another product to compete
with that we didn't think of.

762
00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.749
- You think the bosses will sit idly by?
- Yeah.

763
00:59:04.749 --> 00:59:10.010
I'm simple so I don't understand that
our company wants all the profits.

764
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:13.028
I asked you to keep your troubles
outside the company, didn't I?

765
00:59:13.028 --> 00:59:15.238
I'll be responsible for this one.

766
00:59:15.238 --> 00:59:16.872
I started it with that mindset.

767
00:59:16.872 --> 00:59:19.281
Then you should've
kept it a secret from me too.

768
00:59:19.281 --> 00:59:20.941
What are you thinking?

769
00:59:20.941 --> 00:59:22.923
How do you expect me
to take care of this?

770
00:59:22.923 --> 00:59:25.562
- I didn't call you to take care of it.
- Then why?

771
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:26.892
You're my friend.

772
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.211
I just didn't want to lie to you.

773
00:59:34.531 --> 00:59:36.144
Are you a cat thinking of the mouse?

774
00:59:36.144 --> 00:59:40.071
Don't worry.
I won't make you clean it up.

775
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:41.642
I really mean it this time.

776
00:59:51.118 --> 00:59:52.419
I really mean it.

777
00:59:57.028 --> 00:59:59.707
Oh, Jae Hoon.

778
00:59:59.707 --> 01:00:01.135
You're here?

779
01:00:01.135 --> 01:00:03.176
I just bought all this food.

780
01:00:03.176 --> 01:00:04.475
Do you want to come in and eat?

781
01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:07.117
I told you not to get involved in
Hyuk's business.

782
01:00:07.117 --> 01:00:09.336
But, you let things get
out of hand like this?

783
01:00:09.336 --> 01:00:11.225
Hyuk made the decision to do it.

784
01:00:11.225 --> 01:00:13.397
I'm just getting paid and helping.

785
01:00:13.397 --> 01:00:17.098
If you weren't encouraging him,
where would he get the idea to do it?

786
01:00:18.537 --> 01:00:21.109
Aren't you underestimating
your friend too much?

787
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:22.964
Do you think Hyuk's
my avatar or something?

788
01:00:22.964 --> 01:00:24.832
You got Hyuk to turn himself in.

789
01:00:24.832 --> 01:00:29.383
He got rid of service contractors
and you got him hired as an intern.

790
01:00:29.383 --> 01:00:31.836
Now, he's trying to solve this
subcontractor issue.

791
01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:33.504
How can I not say this?

792
01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:39.024
After hearing your side of it,
I suppose I understand.

793
01:00:40.363 --> 01:00:44.602
But, Hyuk made the call on all of that
and came to his own decision.

794
01:00:44.602 --> 01:00:45.961
You doing this...

795
01:00:47.187 --> 01:00:48.564
is it related to your father?

796
01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:04.330
What are you doing?

797
01:01:05.497 --> 01:01:07.636
Are you digging into my background?

798
01:01:07.636 --> 01:01:09.155
I told you.

799
01:01:09.155 --> 01:01:12.245
I have to know about people around Hyuk.

800
01:01:12.245 --> 01:01:15.943
Yes, my dad worked for Gangsu Foods.

801
01:01:15.943 --> 01:01:17.263
What about it?

802
01:01:17.263 --> 01:01:19.126
What does that have to do with Hyuk?

803
01:01:19.126 --> 01:01:21.207
It really has no connection?

804
01:01:21.207 --> 01:01:23.787
You have no intentions regarding Hyuk?

805
01:01:23.787 --> 01:01:26.785
What's your motive
in saying these things?

806
01:01:26.785 --> 01:01:30.033
What intentions? What kind
of intentions would I have with Hyuk...

807
01:01:31.807 --> 01:01:34.698
Do you... like Hyuk?

808
01:01:36.881 --> 01:01:38.068
You're not thinking...

809
01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.917
What are you imagining, Kwon Jae Hoon?

810
01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:46.089
I'm just curious why
you're always with Hyuk.

811
01:01:48.276 --> 01:01:51.026
Besides helping Hyuk...

812
01:01:51.026 --> 01:01:52.736
there's no other reason, is there?

813
01:01:57.767 --> 01:02:00.098
I must like him.

814
01:02:02.705 --> 01:02:06.696
I do get a strange feeling
when I'm looking at Hyuk.

815
01:02:07.955 --> 01:02:12.906
I keep wanting to help him and
I'm proud of him when he tries things.

816
01:02:12.906 --> 01:02:17.557
If I tell you that it's just friendship,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

817
01:02:17.557 --> 01:02:20.086
So, let's just say I like him.

818
01:02:20.086 --> 01:02:21.209
Joon, are you really...

819
01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:24.269
I'm getting confused because you
keep asking me these things.

820
01:02:24.269 --> 01:02:28.240
How do I feel and why do I always
want to be with Hyuk?

821
01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.758
I think I need to figure out my feelings.

822
01:02:30.758 --> 01:02:34.906
Do I really like Hyuk as a man or not?

823
01:02:34.906 --> 01:02:35.990
Right?

824
01:02:52.859 --> 01:02:55.236
I brought you food to eat.
Everyone, eat up!

825
01:02:55.236 --> 01:02:57.473
Yeah, food!

826
01:02:57.473 --> 01:03:00.415
Food is here. Food is here.

827
01:03:00.415 --> 01:03:02.805
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

828
01:03:02.805 --> 01:03:04.684
- Looks good.
- It's sushi?

829
01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:07.214
Come on. Come on.

830
01:03:07.214 --> 01:03:08.890
We'll be eating well today.

831
01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:11.562
Oh my. Looks good.

832
01:03:11.562 --> 01:03:13.660
Oh my! That looks so good.

833
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.173
Thank you.

834
01:03:15.173 --> 01:03:16.834
Oh, it's good.

835
01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:19.104
- Eat.
- Have you eaten?

836
01:03:19.104 --> 01:03:20.986
- I ate.
- This looks expensive.

837
01:03:23.899 --> 01:03:25.403
Let's eat up.

838
01:03:25.403 --> 01:03:28.638
I... like you.

839
01:03:30.178 --> 01:03:31.513
I said I like you.

840
01:03:34.488 --> 01:03:35.950
So, what?

841
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:37.550
What am I supposed to do to about that?

842
01:03:41.352 --> 01:03:42.486
<i>Joon.</i>

843
01:04:01.874 --> 01:04:04.667
<i>Honestly, so do I, Joon.</i>

844
01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:07.662
Here's the latte you ordered. Thank you.

845
01:04:07.662 --> 01:04:08.807
Hello...

846
01:04:16.783 --> 01:04:18.758
What can I get for you?

847
01:04:25.747 --> 01:04:26.928
An Americano.

848
01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:29.997
That's 5,000 won.

849
01:04:33.522 --> 01:04:35.361
<i>[Musical]</i>

850
01:04:37.984 --> 01:04:39.805
Your card, please.

851
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.747
One moment, please.

852
01:05:24.519 --> 01:05:26.415
I'm here with coffee...

853
01:06:04.646 --> 01:06:07.401
What are you doing here alone?

854
01:06:07.401 --> 01:06:09.792
Joon, look at the sky.

855
01:06:13.948 --> 01:06:18.533
Wow, I can see a lot stars.

856
01:06:20.173 --> 01:06:21.473
They are so pretty.

857
01:06:22.783 --> 01:06:23.914
They are pretty.

858
01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:27.584
They're like flying dandelion seeds.

859
01:06:29.638 --> 01:06:32.874
Even after that accident,
you still like dandelion seeds?

860
01:06:32.874 --> 01:06:34.854
The dandelion seeds did nothing wrong.

861
01:06:34.854 --> 01:06:37.203
I'm the one at fault
causing accidents everywhere I go.

862
01:06:56.819 --> 01:07:00.743
I'm getting confused because you
keep asking me these things.

863
01:07:00.743 --> 01:07:03.926
Do I really like Hyuk as a man or not?

864
01:07:13.982 --> 01:07:17.406
This time I really
can't cause any trouble.

865
01:07:18.573 --> 01:07:20.852
President Jang's life is on the line.

866
01:07:22.564 --> 01:07:26.497
I can't take care of my own life.
How did I end up responsible for his?

867
01:07:30.066 --> 01:07:31.743
You think I can do a good job?

868
01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:34.923
Honestly, I'm so nervous and my heart
feels like it's going to explode.

869
01:07:36.057 --> 01:07:39.484
And Managing Director Seol, no...

870
01:07:39.484 --> 01:07:42.524
I might have to go up against my father.

871
01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:46.124
Be calm and clear.

872
01:07:46.124 --> 01:07:48.263
Tell them what your thoughts are.

873
01:07:50.002 --> 01:07:53.205
You can do a good job.
You are Byun Hyuk.

874
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:03.388
The first person to tell me
I can do a good job...

875
01:08:05.597 --> 01:08:06.937
is you.

876
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:10.479
Thank you, Joon.

877
01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:42.598
Can we try once to confirm?

878
01:08:45.351 --> 01:08:46.458
Just to see...

879
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.203
if I can be a man to you or not?

880
01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:57.011
What if we try and it feels wrong?

881
01:08:57.011 --> 01:08:58.360
It can't feel wrong.

882
01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:01.659
How do you know that?

883
01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:02.979
I know that much, at least.

884
01:09:09.757 --> 01:09:13.168
All right. Let's try it then.

885
01:09:13.168 --> 01:09:16.217
Um, but if it feels wrong...

886
01:09:17.288 --> 01:09:21.348
then we have to remain
friends after that.

887
01:09:21.348 --> 01:09:22.927
I don't think that will happen.

888
01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:27.851
