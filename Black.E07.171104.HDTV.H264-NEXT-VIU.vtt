1
00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:19.624
You should've laid low and behaved yourself when I let you live.

2
00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:20.764
(Episode 7)

3
00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:46.314
What's happening? Why can't I get out of here?

4
00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:48.254
What is going on?

5
00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:50.225
Why can't I get out of here?

6
00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:11.615
Gosh, who was it?

7
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:13.544
I clearly saw it.

8
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:20.785
By the way, where did Joon go?

9
00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:33.565
Why can't I get out?

10
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:39.135
Why can't I...

11
00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:42.305
get out of this body?

12
00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:02.464
Joon, were you here the whole time?

13
00:02:04.464 --> 00:02:06.594
I looked everywhere for you.

14
00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:12.734
Actually, there's something urgent.

15
00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:15.274
When the power went out earlier,

16
00:02:15.274 --> 00:02:17.074
I saw a moment of death.

17
00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:21.584
It might've been an abduction case. The person was tied to a chair.

18
00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:23.915
Then the building exploded.

19
00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:27.125
Why did that girl pop into my mind when I was about to die?

20
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:30.255
I can't understand it. How unpleasant.

21
00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:32.554
Joon.

22
00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:35.965
Joon, you're listening, right?

23
00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:37.995
Yes.

24
00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:39.965
What about Leo?

25
00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:42.704
I checked right away, but it wasn't him.

26
00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:45.334
I checked people around him, and I don't think it's them either.

27
00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:48.544
I have no idea who it was.

28
00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:51.644
I'll get out soon. Give me a minute.

29
00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:06.495
Someone will die.

30
00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:08.595
I'm tired. Let's leave.

31
00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.644
This is crazy. I must've lost my mind.

32
00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.285
She's really not my type.

33
00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:30.984
Hey, Mr. Green.

34
00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:34.454
It looks like Joe Black is abducting Princess Green.

35
00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:36.685
Will you let him leave with her, Mr. Green?

36
00:03:37.255 --> 00:03:38.995
Cut it out, okay?

37
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.394
Gosh, you're making me feel embarrassed.

38
00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:44.435
What's the matter with you? I was just joking.

39
00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:46.165
Hey, why are you drinking so much?

40
00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:47.635
You'll black out again.

41
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.475
You don't remember a thing when you black out.

42
00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:52.834
Stop drinking. You'll make a mistake.

43
00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:54.245
Let go. Hey!

44
00:04:31.675 --> 00:04:33.514
That shadow...

45
00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:36.784
Who could it be?

46
00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:42.024
They're never around when I need them.

47
00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:44.154
Why aren't they back yet?

48
00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:52.164
Why are you getting back just now?

49
00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:54.334
Why are you welcoming us so enthusiastically?

50
00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:56.735
You must have a hidden agenda.

51
00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:59.404
Come on! You better tell us the facts.

52
00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:00.545
It's "truth".

53
00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:02.305
- It's "facts". - It's "truth".

54
00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:04.274
- "Facts". - Be quiet. Listen up, guys.

55
00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:07.014
I can't get out. I cannot get out of this body.

56
00:05:07.644 --> 00:05:10.185
What? What do you mean?

57
00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:12.385
Look at this.

58
00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:15.385
This body fell into a river and died after some jerk stabbed me.

59
00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:18.055
I'm certain that it died. It fell into a river and died.

60
00:05:18.094 --> 00:05:20.094
But I couldn't get out of it.

61
00:05:20.464 --> 00:05:22.094
That's why it's alive again now. Does this make sense to you?

62
00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:24.735
Gosh, no way.

63
00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:25.935
416.

64
00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:28.534
Do I look like I'm lying now?

65
00:05:29.034 --> 00:05:30.704
Do I? Look at me.

66
00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:36.844
What are you doing now? Are you trying to poop or what?

67
00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:45.355
I can't get out. I can't leave this body.

68
00:05:45.454 --> 00:05:48.324
Sorry? We can go in and out of human bodies freely...

69
00:05:48.324 --> 00:05:50.125
after entering them.

70
00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:53.195
Exactly. But I can't get out of this body.

71
00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.625
No matter how hard I try, I just can't leave this body.

72
00:05:56.724 --> 00:06:00.235
007, why is this happening? Say something.

73
00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.764
Well, I'm not sure.

74
00:06:02.764 --> 00:06:05.974
I've never been through anything like this even in the Joseon era.

75
00:06:05.974 --> 00:06:07.445
Then hurry up, and look into it.

76
00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.105
Find out why this is happening to me, would you?

77
00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:12.115
What if I can't get out of this body even after catching that loser?

78
00:06:12.274 --> 00:06:13.274
I'll be doomed.

79
00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:14.644
Okay, I heard you.

80
00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:18.185
But try to look at the bright side.

81
00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:20.485
As long as you're locked up in that body,

82
00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:24.824
it'll be invincible and immortal no matter how many times...

83
00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:28.094
that jerk who's after Han Moo Gang tries to kill him.

84
00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:32.534
That means you'll be able to continue using his body.

85
00:06:33.764 --> 00:06:35.834
- Really? - Yes.

86
00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:38.505
Am I supposed to be happy about this or what?

87
00:06:44.774 --> 00:06:46.375
Why did you kill Han Moo Gang?

88
00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:47.445
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:49.945
I lost my reason momentarily.

90
00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:54.324
If we kill Han Moo Gang, that jerk won't let it slide!

91
00:06:54.654 --> 00:06:55.954
I'll make sure there are no further problems.

92
00:06:56.755 --> 00:06:59.755
And I'll take care of the body before it gets found.

93
00:07:12.034 --> 00:07:14.974
You didn't have to kill Moo Gang!

94
00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:20.685
Shut it before I rip your mouth off.

95
00:07:24.514 --> 00:07:25.555
It's me.

96
00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.954
What happened to the informant tailing Moo Gang?

97
00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:32.195
Still?

98
00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:36.625
The situation is quite urgent now. Find that jerk immediately.

99
00:07:53.714 --> 00:07:54.714
What?

100
00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:57.214
Why am I here?

101
00:07:57.985 --> 00:07:59.784
I'm supposed to be in Ha Ram's storage.

102
00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:01.685
- Side effects? - That's right.

103
00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:04.995
You might not be able to teleport as you please.

104
00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:06.654
I can't teleport? Why not?

105
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:10.795
You have dreams now. That means you're becoming more and more human.

106
00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:13.834
Humans cannot teleport, can they?

107
00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:15.505
What is this?

108
00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:18.635
Am I really becoming a human?

109
00:08:19.105 --> 00:08:21.875
I won't be able to get out of this body or teleport.

110
00:08:24.144 --> 00:08:26.445
Han Moo Gang's body is gone? What do you mean?

111
00:08:27.284 --> 00:08:28.615
Have you looked everywhere?

112
00:08:29.985 --> 00:08:32.355
Search the bottom of the lake if you have to!

113
00:08:32.985 --> 00:08:34.385
These idiots.

114
00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:45.965
What?

115
00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:48.135
He's not dead.

116
00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:53.774
I'm busy, but I have to walk like those stupid humans?

117
00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:02.245
Isn't this a car key?

118
00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:07.225
That's right.

119
00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:08.585
Where is it?

120
00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:19.034
Yes, this is it.

121
00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:24.005
All right.

122
00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:28.644
I've spent ages in cars waiting to take those who die in car accidents.

123
00:09:29.544 --> 00:09:31.245
This will be a piece of cake.

124
00:09:34.144 --> 00:09:35.615
Where is the key?

125
00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:37.784
Where should I put it in?

126
00:09:42.885 --> 00:09:43.894
There.

127
00:09:46.024 --> 00:09:47.865
Good. Oh, gosh.

128
00:09:50.794 --> 00:09:52.064
I can do this.

129
00:09:55.635 --> 00:09:57.375
I can do this. Of course I can.

130
00:10:28.705 --> 00:10:29.735
Hello?

131
00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:34.845
What?

132
00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:37.115
My dad?

133
00:10:37.514 --> 00:10:39.044
Yes. Okay.

134
00:10:44.284 --> 00:10:47.284
Yes, I just got here. Where should I go?

135
00:11:03.804 --> 00:11:04.904
That man...

136
00:11:04.904 --> 00:11:08.745
- Hey! - Just die! Die already, please!

137
00:11:08.774 --> 00:11:10.575
Let go of me!

138
00:11:13.784 --> 00:11:14.784
Ms. Fortune-teller.

139
00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:16.745
Hurry!

140
00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:19.154
Hurry up!

141
00:11:25.294 --> 00:11:26.654
What do you think?

142
00:11:27.664 --> 00:11:28.664
Do you see it?

143
00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:36.404
Hey, you brat.

144
00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:38.975
I told you to never come here.

145
00:11:38.975 --> 00:11:40.644
What... What are you doing?

146
00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:42.174
Who are you?

147
00:11:46.885 --> 00:11:47.885
Get off me!

148
00:11:49.144 --> 00:11:50.314
Are you okay?

149
00:11:51.414 --> 00:11:52.414
Let's go.

150
00:11:55.255 --> 00:11:56.755
Why that little...

151
00:12:04.264 --> 00:12:05.264
Hi, Lawyer Jung.

152
00:12:06.694 --> 00:12:07.934
Did you copy it?

153
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:11.635
Bring it to my office.

154
00:12:19.014 --> 00:12:24.184
The person who killed that man was wearing the same watch.

155
00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:26.855
Does that mean the person who will kill that man...

156
00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.325
will kill Mr. Oh's dad as well?

157
00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:32.255
Listen.

158
00:12:39.294 --> 00:12:41.705
Don't be so discouraged. Let's wait a little longer.

159
00:12:42.034 --> 00:12:45.034
He has survived crises worse than this.

160
00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:52.514
- Hello. - Okay then.

161
00:12:53.414 --> 00:12:54.985
- What is it? - It's about Yoon Soo Wan.

162
00:12:55.444 --> 00:12:58.284
She handed in her resignation, and I can't reach her. What's going on?

163
00:12:58.654 --> 00:13:00.255
She... She handed in her resignation?

164
00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:02.885
You didn't know about this? Here.

165
00:13:04.794 --> 00:13:06.355
(Letter of Resignation)

166
00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:11.064
Hold on.

167
00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:15.564
The phone is turned off...

168
00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:18.434
Her phone is off.

169
00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:21.205
What happened to her?

170
00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:29.284
Did the man who was here leave?

171
00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:32.154
You mean that grump? He left earlier.

172
00:13:32.784 --> 00:13:35.485
- Where is her other guardian? - She didn't come here today.

173
00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:43.995
(Kim Soon Hee)

174
00:13:52.475 --> 00:13:53.975
She must've seen something again.

175
00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:59.174
I told her not to get involved in it.

176
00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:00.745
Please help me this once.

177
00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:04.684
I told you. I can't give you the patient's personal information.

178
00:14:07.024 --> 00:14:08.255
What should I do?

179
00:14:10.955 --> 00:14:14.365
Listen. You can give it to a police officer, right?

180
00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:24.735
What?

181
00:14:24.735 --> 00:14:28.404
So please come to Royeol Hospital now, and check it for me.

182
00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:30.575
Hello? Hello...

183
00:14:31.715 --> 00:14:34.414
There she goes again. It wasn't easy for me to come this far!

184
00:14:52.835 --> 00:14:55.635
Have you seen someone wearing a watch...

185
00:14:55.664 --> 00:14:58.434
with a butterfly shape around your dad?

186
00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:01.075
I'm not sure.

187
00:15:01.845 --> 00:15:03.245
I should call the police.

188
00:15:03.615 --> 00:15:05.014
No one would believe me.

189
00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:07.845
What should we do then?

190
00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:09.115
Don't worry too much.

191
00:15:09.715 --> 00:15:12.284
There will be a way to catch the killer.

192
00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:15.424
- But... But how? - Before...

193
00:15:17.154 --> 00:15:19.524
he kills your dad,

194
00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:22.424
he will kill someone else first.

195
00:15:22.465 --> 00:15:24.465
- What? - It's the husband...

196
00:15:25.235 --> 00:15:26.495
of a patient in this hospital.

197
00:15:27.664 --> 00:15:30.064
I saw the killer stabbing him to death.

198
00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:34.575
How can you be sure it's the same person?

199
00:15:35.304 --> 00:15:36.605
You said you didn't see his face.

200
00:15:37.014 --> 00:15:39.845
His watch. He was wearing the same watch.

201
00:15:40.784 --> 00:15:41.985
But...

202
00:15:42.444 --> 00:15:44.455
that can't be the only watch of its' kind.

203
00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:47.085
The bloodstain he got on his watch when he killed the husband...

204
00:15:47.955 --> 00:15:49.455
was still there...

205
00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:53.394
when he was removing your dad's respirator.

206
00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:56.225
There may be many watches which look alike,

207
00:15:56.764 --> 00:16:00.335
but the bloodstain can't be the same, can it?

208
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.505
So there is still a chance.

209
00:16:04.705 --> 00:16:08.144
If we catch the killer before he kills the husband,

210
00:16:08.904 --> 00:16:11.144
your dad may be fine as well.

211
00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:14.314
So if we catch him when he tries...

212
00:16:14.544 --> 00:16:15.544
to kill the husband...

213
00:16:15.544 --> 00:16:17.985
Then my dad won't die either.

214
00:16:19.814 --> 00:16:22.284
- Who would try to kill those two? - I don't know.

215
00:16:25.495 --> 00:16:26.495
Did you find out?

216
00:16:26.495 --> 00:16:28.794
His phone is turned off. This is his address.

217
00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:31.135
Let's hurry up and go.

218
00:16:31.965 --> 00:16:32.965
What?

219
00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:34.365
Let go of me.

220
00:16:34.664 --> 00:16:36.365
How persistent.

221
00:16:36.904 --> 00:16:38.404
You're such a nosy person.

222
00:16:38.404 --> 00:16:39.975
You hold my hand whenever you want.

223
00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:42.575
Fine, I won't hold your hand. Let's hurry off.

224
00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:44.174
Wait. Let me come with you.

225
00:16:44.444 --> 00:16:46.115
You should stay here.

226
00:16:46.115 --> 00:16:48.115
Don't leave your dad's side,

227
00:16:48.715 --> 00:16:51.115
and call me if someone comes to your mind.

228
00:16:56.154 --> 00:17:00.054
Don't worry too much. We'll catch the killer.

229
00:17:01.194 --> 00:17:04.565
- Thank you. - What are you doing? I'm busy.

230
00:17:12.105 --> 00:17:13.105
Hello?

Ha Ram!

235
00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.754
Seung Chul.

236
00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:05.795
Did Joon write you back?

237
00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:11.595
He must be busy trying to get accustomed to Seoul.

238
00:18:12.795 --> 00:18:14.964
Are you wearing that again because Joon isn't around?

239
00:18:14.964 --> 00:18:17.434
He told you not to cover your pretty eyes.

240
00:18:17.434 --> 00:18:19.004
Take it off.

241
00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:26.115
I’m going to tell him everything if you wear them again.

242
00:18:26.214 --> 00:18:28.984
Gosh, I might be late. See you!

243
00:18:29.845 --> 00:18:32.055
Seung Chul! The shadow...

244
00:18:33.015 --> 00:18:34.055
The shadow...

245
00:18:42.865 --> 00:18:45.464
Ha Ram, what's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

246
00:18:46.365 --> 00:18:48.704
Don't... Don't go. Don't go to the movies.

247
00:18:48.704 --> 00:18:49.704
What?

248
00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:53.704
Are you talking about going to the movies as a group tomorrow?

249
00:18:53.744 --> 00:18:55.674
Tomorrow? Is it tomorrow?

250
00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:58.174
Don't... Don't go. Please don't go there.

251

All right, Hyun Soo. Let's go together.

256

Don't... Don't go. Don't go there.

257
00:19:14.224 --> 00:19:16.194
Okay, I won't go to the movies.

258

You should get going. I'll go now.

What's the matter with that kid?

It's nothing.

262
00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:28.244
Back then,

263
00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:31.214
I was too young.

264
00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:33.944
I should’ve held on to you more tightly.

265
00:19:35.045 --> 00:19:37.454
I should've tried harder to make sure you didn't go there.

266
00:19:40.154 --> 00:19:41.285
Is it someone you know?

267

Back in elementary school,

268
00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:55.934
he was your closest friend.

He was my friend?

20 years ago,

275
00:20:15.325 --> 00:20:18.325
a newly built mall in Moojin collapsed.

276
00:20:19.025 --> 00:20:20.694
In the theater on the fifth floor of the mall,

277
00:20:21.765 --> 00:20:23.795
seventh graders from Moojin Middle School...

278
00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:25.934
were watching a movie altogether that day.

279
00:20:26.065 --> 00:20:27.265
That accident...

280
00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:31.704
killed nearly 300 people.

281
00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:40.015
Even though so many people died,

282
00:20:40.444 --> 00:20:42.444
we still don't know why that building collapsed,

283
00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:45.385
and...

284
00:20:46.315 --> 00:20:48.984
what kind of corruption took place in the construction process.

285
00:20:49.454 --> 00:20:52.694
The truth wasn't fully revealed yet,

286
00:20:55.664 --> 00:20:59.335
but the case just got buried away.

287

Why?

288
00:21:01.464 --> 00:21:03.265
The building owner, Woo Byung Sik,

289
00:21:03.904 --> 00:21:06.605
tried to flee abroad with all related documents.

290
00:21:06.605 --> 00:21:09.875
But he got into a rollover accident on his way to the airport...

291
00:21:11.075 --> 00:21:13.375
and was found completely burnt.

292

but no one was responsible for the disaster. It was total nonsense.

My nephew died when Moojin Time Mart collapsed.

He actually told his parents he didn't want to go because...

317
00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:36.994

She was very ill back then.

325

Every penny my brother-in-law earned was spent on her medications.

00:23:34.154 --> 00:23:38.325
You should pray that you can fully recover soon.

333
00:23:38.454 --> 00:23:41.265
Gosh, my baby.

334
00:23:42.595 --> 00:23:43.934
And this is for you.

335
00:23:45.664 --> 00:23:48.635
Mom and Dad will stay at the prayer center for about a week.

336
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:50.974
Watch movies and buy yourself some good food.

337
00:23:50.974 --> 00:23:53.504
You should take your friends to the karaoke too.

338
00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:55.875
Where did you get this money?

339
00:23:56.914 --> 00:23:58.575
Mom, where's your ring?

340
00:23:59.474 --> 00:24:01.015
She took it to a pawnshop...

341
00:24:01.785 --> 00:24:03.785
so that you can watch the movie and hang out with your friends.

342
00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:06.385
Gosh, you didn't have to say that.

343
00:24:06.515 --> 00:24:09.855
I'll start working again when I get better,

344
00:24:09.855 --> 00:24:12.355
so I'll be able to get my ring back very soon. Don't worry.

345
00:24:12.355 --> 00:24:13.565
Mom.

346
00:24:14.664 --> 00:24:17.795
Get going. Go, and have fun, okay?

347
00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:20.865
You don't need to be frugal. Just spend it all. All right?

348
00:24:20.865 --> 00:24:23.704
And don't skip meals while we're gone.

349
00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:27.275
Order some jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk with your friends.

350
00:24:28.575 --> 00:24:30.444
- Wait for further information. - Please calm down. We're...

351
00:24:30.444 --> 00:24:32.775
We're really doing our best now, so please...

352
00:24:33.115 --> 00:24:35.585
- When the investigation is done... - Kyung Min.

353
00:24:37.154 --> 00:24:39.615
Officer, I'm here for my son, Seung Chul.

354
00:24:39.654 --> 00:24:41.484
The accident happened a while ago. Why didn't you come sooner?

355
00:24:41.484 --> 00:24:44.894
We didn't know because we were at a prayer center in the mountains.

356
00:24:45.154 --> 00:24:46.154
What's his name?

357
00:24:46.595 --> 00:24:47.825
Park Seung Chul.

358
00:24:47.825 --> 00:24:50.464
Grade 7 Class 3 at Moojin Middle School.

359
00:24:50.664 --> 00:24:52.595
His name isn't on the death roll.

360
00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:54.335
Thank you so much.

361
00:24:54.365 --> 00:24:57.275
The building collapsed, so we haven't collected all bodies yet.

362
00:24:58.974 --> 00:24:59.974
Park Seung Chul.

363
00:25:00.904 --> 00:25:01.904
Just a moment, please.

364
00:25:08.845 --> 00:25:09.914
Please check.

365
00:25:13.525 --> 00:25:15.555
What... What is this?

366
00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:19.025
Seung Chul's friend said that it is his hand.

367
00:25:19.025 --> 00:25:21.224
Before heading to the theater, they stopped by a pawnshop together...

368
00:25:21.224 --> 00:25:24.535
to get his mom's ring. He wore it to make sure he doesn't lose it.

369
00:25:24.535 --> 00:25:26.734
Please check it, and make sure that it's your ring, ma'am.

370
00:25:41.585 --> 00:25:45.754
No, it can't be our dear Seung Chul...

371
00:25:49.724 --> 00:25:52.754
Try this. I picked the leaves and brewed it myself.

372
00:25:54.464 --> 00:25:55.924
I'm the chairman of the Truth Commission...

373
00:25:55.924 --> 00:25:58.734
on the Time Mart collapse disaster, Pastor Kang Dong Chul.

374
00:25:58.964 --> 00:26:00.265
It happened 20 years ago,

375
00:26:00.265 --> 00:26:02.765
so most people have forgotten about the accident.

376
00:26:03.164 --> 00:26:06.174
Thank you very much for visiting us.

377
00:26:07.305 --> 00:26:09.474
Do you know this man?

378
00:26:11.575 --> 00:26:15.285
Yes, he's Mr. Park, Seung Chul's father. I know him well.

379
00:26:16.184 --> 00:26:18.184
I can't get a hold of him.

380
00:26:18.254 --> 00:26:20.654
I was wondering if you know where he might be.

381
00:26:20.654 --> 00:26:23.494
Actually, we haven't spoken to him for quite a while now.

382
00:26:23.924 --> 00:26:27.464
He had some conflicts with other victims' families.

383
00:26:27.494 --> 00:26:30.125
Conflicts? Like what?

384
00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:32.664
It was because of Seung Chul's mother.

385
00:26:32.664 --> 00:26:34.635
What about his mother?

386
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:37.135
After losing Seung Chul like that,

387
00:26:38.575 --> 00:26:41.144
the two of them came to our church and prayed a lot.

388
00:26:41.144 --> 00:26:43.644
They even served as representatives of the bereaved at one point,

389
00:26:44.015 --> 00:26:45.545
but she received...

390
00:26:46.174 --> 00:26:49.015
settlement money from the company...

391
00:26:49.015 --> 00:26:51.984
to keep our lips sealed behind other families' back.

392
00:26:54.754 --> 00:26:56.684
The media found out about it...

393
00:26:56.684 --> 00:26:59.694
and made it look like all victims' families were...

394
00:26:59.694 --> 00:27:02.525
trying to use their children's deaths to earn money,

395
00:27:02.724 --> 00:27:06.035
so we lost the people's support and couldn't reveal the truth.

396
00:27:06.035 --> 00:27:09.305
All other victims' families as well as Seung Chul's dad...

397
00:27:09.305 --> 00:27:12.934
felt extremely betrayed by her.

398
00:27:12.934 --> 00:27:17.974
I heard she ended up leaving the country with the settlement money.

399
00:27:18.115 --> 00:27:21.744
That left Mr. Park devastated.

400
00:27:22.845 --> 00:27:27.684
After that, he started falling apart and lost his faith as well.

401
00:27:27.684 --> 00:27:30.924
Then that incident broke out.

402
00:27:31.224 --> 00:27:32.355
Incident?

403
00:27:33.055 --> 00:27:34.194
People started to suspect...

404
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:36.565
that the donation was being used for other purposes.

405
00:27:36.565 --> 00:27:40.535
Other families brought it up and suspected that it was his doing...

406
00:27:40.664 --> 00:27:43.575
because of what his wife had done in the past.

407
00:27:44.035 --> 00:27:47.944
He had a big fight with a few families because of that.

408
00:27:48.105 --> 00:27:50.674
And he never came back since that day.

409
00:27:50.914 --> 00:27:53.275
I tried calling him, but he wouldn't answer.

410
00:27:55.714 --> 00:27:57.355
By the way,

411
00:27:58.315 --> 00:28:00.924
did something happen...

412
00:28:01.154 --> 00:28:02.954
to Mr. Park?

413
00:28:03.595 --> 00:28:07.924
Well... No. Nothing has happened to him yet.

414
00:28:09.164 --> 00:28:10.494
Gosh, it's hot.

415
00:28:10.494 --> 00:28:12.464
- Oh, dear. Goodness. - Gosh.

416
00:28:12.595 --> 00:28:13.904
Are you okay?

417
00:28:15.135 --> 00:28:17.004
Yes, I'm okay.

418
00:28:17.135 --> 00:28:18.934
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

419
00:28:21.105 --> 00:28:22.644
Gosh, that was clumsy of you.

420
00:28:23.004 --> 00:28:24.144
He's lying.

421
00:28:24.944 --> 00:28:26.444
What? About what?

422
00:28:26.444 --> 00:28:28.085
He lied about not seeing Mr. Park for a long time.

423
00:28:30.045 --> 00:28:31.855
He went to that house.

424
00:28:32.484 --> 00:28:33.825
And it was very recent.

425
00:28:34.355 --> 00:28:37.025
That house? You mean Seung Chul's house?

426
00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:39.694
How did you know that?

427
00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:43.765
His shoes match the prints on the blanket.

428
00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:55.204
But why would a pastor lie to us?

429
00:28:56.375 --> 00:28:58.244
Do you think pastors never lie?

430
00:29:02.085 --> 00:29:03.144
What is this?

431
00:29:03.885 --> 00:29:06.615
This picture was also at that old man's hospital lobby.

432
00:29:10.525 --> 00:29:13.025
Is this Mr. Oh's dad?

433
00:29:13.964 --> 00:29:15.394
The pastor is suspicious.

434
00:29:15.494 --> 00:29:18.595
He's related to both Mr. Park and Mr. Oh's dad.

435
00:29:21.734 --> 00:29:22.835
Excuse me.

436
00:29:23.365 --> 00:29:27.045
But you really haven't heard anything about Mr. Park, right?

437
00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:29.974
You haven't seen him...

438
00:29:29.974 --> 00:29:33.115
or visited his house recently, right?

439
00:29:33.115 --> 00:29:37.214
No. I'm also curious how he's doing these days.

440
00:29:43.378 --> 00:29:46.718
Hi, Mr. Oh. Do you know Pastor Kang Dong Chul?

441
00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:48.188
Pastor Kang?

442
00:29:48.918 --> 00:29:49.948
Of course.

443
00:29:52.118 --> 00:29:53.658
How do you know him?

444
00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:55.688
My dad has made donations to the families...

445
00:29:55.688 --> 00:29:59.329
of the Moojin Time Mart incident victims for a long time.

446
00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:02.668
I heard he and Pastor Kang met in the process.

447
00:30:03.428 --> 00:30:05.039
After my dad collapsed,

448
00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:08.769
he came to see my dad and pray for him once a month.

449
00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:10.178
I'm very grateful to him.

450
00:30:10.479 --> 00:30:12.009
But why are you asking about him?

451
00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:13.849
It's not certain yet,

452
00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:15.878
but he's suspicious.

453
00:30:16.749 --> 00:30:19.749
He's also related to the man I told you about.

454
00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:22.948
It looked like he hasn't visited my dad for a while.

455
00:30:23.218 --> 00:30:27.059
Really? Could you find out if something happened to him recently?

456
00:30:28.489 --> 00:30:29.489
Okay.

457
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:34.099
But...

458
00:30:35.069 --> 00:30:38.638
why do you think he snuck into Seung Chul's dad's house?

459
00:30:43.168 --> 00:30:44.408
He came outside.

460
00:30:57.658 --> 00:30:59.089
(Royeol Insurance)

461
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:09.299
- What about the original copy? - It has been placed...

462
00:31:09.398 --> 00:31:11.198
in the safe.

463
00:31:11.239 --> 00:31:12.398
Okay. You can go now.

464
00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:16.168
Excuse me, Man Ho.

465
00:31:21.908 --> 00:31:23.779
Don't you know how to knock?

466
00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:25.779
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

467
00:31:26.749 --> 00:31:29.718
But why isn't Pastor Kang coming to see Dad these days?

468
00:31:29.718 --> 00:31:32.388
He came to pray for Dad once a week.

469
00:31:32.388 --> 00:31:33.729
Pastor, my foot.

470
00:31:33.729 --> 00:31:35.829
- He's a total fraud. - What?

471
00:31:35.829 --> 00:31:37.759
Before Dad collapsed,

472
00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:41.099
he stopped making donations to the victims of Time Mart something.

473
00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:44.398
- Why? - How should I know that?

474
00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:47.638
Anyway, that man came to me and begged me to support them again.

475
00:31:47.638 --> 00:31:50.908
So I told him I'd think about it after Dad dies. What a scumbag.

476
00:31:52.178 --> 00:31:53.648
But why are you suddenly asking about him?

477
00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:57.118
It was nothing. I'll get going now.

478
00:32:00.448 --> 00:32:02.349
Gosh, that brat.

479
00:32:08.888 --> 00:32:12.398
Lastly, I will leave Royeol Electronics...

480
00:32:12.858 --> 00:32:15.769
to my youngest son, Man Soo.

481
00:32:19.769 --> 00:32:21.769
That senile old man.

482
00:32:22.408 --> 00:32:24.438
Who does he think made Royeol into what it is now?

483
00:32:28.708 --> 00:32:31.678
What? Your dad stopped making donations?

484
00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.549
Yes. I checked it out,

485
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:37.188
and the amount of money he had donated to them is quite big.

486
00:32:37.319 --> 00:32:39.958
Why do you think he stopped it so suddenly?

487
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:42.059
- Oh, gosh. - Goodness!

488
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:44.458
Ms. Fortune-teller. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

489
00:32:44.628 --> 00:32:47.569
- No, I'm... I'm fine. - That jerk.

490
00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:50.398
You're such a terrible driver.

491
00:32:50.499 --> 00:32:52.868
- You used to be a good driver. - Be quiet.

492
00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:54.368
This is harder than it looks.

493
00:32:55.608 --> 00:32:57.339
It looked easier when I watched it.

494
00:32:59.708 --> 00:33:00.809
We're almost there.

495
00:33:16.459 --> 00:33:17.599
(Kang Dong Chul)

496
00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:21.629
Unbelievable.

497
00:33:22.499 --> 00:33:26.439
He was the one who embezzled the donations, not Seung Chul's dad.

498
00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:29.109
Mr. Oh's dad must've stopped making donations because he found out.

499
00:33:30.908 --> 00:33:32.738
Just a moment. I'll call you right back.

500
00:33:33.408 --> 00:33:35.948
Humans never disappoint me.

501
00:33:37.479 --> 00:33:41.519
I can imagine why he would try to kill Mr. Oh's dad,

502
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:45.088
but I still don't know why he'd kill Seung Chul's dad.

503
00:33:46.318 --> 00:33:47.689
Do you think...

504
00:33:48.428 --> 00:33:51.528
Pastor Kang really is the killer I saw in the shadow?

505
00:33:52.059 --> 00:33:54.399
If he has that watch in his house, won't it become clear?

506
00:33:55.798 --> 00:33:56.968
Yes, it will.

507
00:33:58.468 --> 00:34:00.508
- Wait here. - What are you going to do?

508
00:34:01.338 --> 00:34:04.209
I'm a detective. This is a piece of cake.

509
00:34:55.988 --> 00:34:58.899
Yes. This is the watch I saw.

510
00:34:59.859 --> 00:35:00.968
Let's capture him right now.

511
00:35:03.028 --> 00:35:05.138
- On what grounds? - What?

512
00:35:05.198 --> 00:35:07.669
The things you said can't be evidence. Don't you know that?

513
00:35:07.709 --> 00:35:09.068
Then what should we do?

514
00:35:10.709 --> 00:35:13.338
There must be a reason he ransacked Seung Chul's house.

515
00:35:13.649 --> 00:35:14.849
We should find that out.

516
00:35:37.868 --> 00:35:39.138
There's a fly here.

517
00:35:49.278 --> 00:35:50.548
- Gosh. - Joon!

518
00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:52.249
- What is this? - You surprised me.

519
00:35:55.048 --> 00:35:56.048
What's this?

520
00:35:59.419 --> 00:36:00.428
Joon.

521
00:36:00.729 --> 00:36:03.499
This is the evidence of Pastor Kang's embezzlement.

522
00:36:05.698 --> 00:36:06.758
Yes.

523
00:36:07.269 --> 00:36:09.798
I think Mr. Park has carefully gathered these for a long time.

524
00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.638
This must be the reason why he wanted to kill Mr. Park.

525
00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:18.678
- Get out now. - Let go of me.

526
00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:21.109
You! Were you on that jerk's side?

527
00:36:21.209 --> 00:36:23.149
You devils!

528
00:36:23.149 --> 00:36:25.149
- Quiet! - You're the devil.

529
00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.678
You devils!

530
00:36:28.488 --> 00:36:30.019
I want to kill that man.

531
00:36:38.658 --> 00:36:40.298
It's all over now, right?

532
00:36:40.729 --> 00:36:43.999
Seung Chul's dad and Mr. Oh's dad will both be fine, right?

533
00:36:43.999 --> 00:36:46.399
Probably. That punk has been arrested.

534
00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:50.638
But still, I should see him to be at ease.

535
00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:53.678
Stop talking nonsense.

536
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:55.379
Let's go now.

537
00:37:01.618 --> 00:37:02.649
Hello?

538
00:37:02.649 --> 00:37:04.618
I'm calling from Royeol Hospital.

539
00:37:04.618 --> 00:37:07.329
You told me to call when the patient's guardian came.

540
00:37:07.528 --> 00:37:09.189
He's in the hospital room right now.

541
00:37:34.749 --> 00:37:36.249
(World Drink)

542
00:37:38.359 --> 00:37:41.229
(World Drink)

543
00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:42.658
Get off.

544
00:37:42.658 --> 00:37:44.229
What do you think you're doing?

545
00:37:44.798 --> 00:37:46.129
It was him.

546
00:37:47.729 --> 00:37:48.999
Hey, Ha Ram.

547
00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:52.298
You might cross paths, so I'll just wait here and check if he comes out.

548
00:37:52.539 --> 00:37:55.309
Call me right away if you see Seung Chul's dad.

549
00:38:06.379 --> 00:38:07.548
What?

550
00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:10.519
Is this guy really the culprit?

551
00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:15.129
How annoying.

552
00:38:18.928 --> 00:38:20.269
You thief!

553
00:38:23.428 --> 00:38:26.039
Oh, you're Detective Han. What are you doing here?

554
00:38:26.908 --> 00:38:27.939
This...

555
00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:31.309
I'm sorry. I wasn't planning on stealing it at first.

556
00:38:31.408 --> 00:38:32.508
What?

557
00:38:33.579 --> 00:38:35.979
You stole it? Isn't this yours?

558
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:40.618
No. I went to that house because I had to find something.

559
00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:51.758
Is anyone home?

560
00:39:03.939 --> 00:39:07.278
I'm really telling the truth. Please forgive me just this once.

561
00:39:08.048 --> 00:39:10.048
If he's not the owner of this watch,

562
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:12.548
does that mean someone else is the murderer?

563
00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:33.968
Are you still looking for the owner of this watch and the man who...

564
00:39:33.968 --> 00:39:35.468
made Han Jin Sook work as a prostitute?

565
00:39:35.568 --> 00:39:38.008
That's why I'm going to Moojin today.

566
00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:41.948
Some of the prostitutes who used to work with Han Jin Sook...

567
00:39:41.948 --> 00:39:44.548
are apparently still living in Moojin.

568
00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:47.548
My gosh, you guys are working so hard.

569
00:39:47.548 --> 00:39:49.618
- Did you eat? - What took you so long?

570
00:39:49.919 --> 00:39:51.218
Eat this while you work.

571
00:39:51.218 --> 00:39:53.189
- What's that? - I got it from a famous restaurant.

572
00:39:53.189 --> 00:39:54.729
Oh, really? Thank you.

573
00:39:56.388 --> 00:39:59.428
What are you doing? Why did you just act that way?

574
00:40:03.329 --> 00:40:07.638
I think he wants to take Han Jin Sook's case from us.

575
00:40:08.568 --> 00:40:10.939
- What? - I overheard him while sleeping.

576
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:14.448
But he was searching Han Jin Sook's phone call records.

577
00:40:14.448 --> 00:40:18.548
And when we were having a team meeting, I saw him...

578
00:40:18.548 --> 00:40:21.249
trying to eavesdrop on what we were saying.

579
00:40:21.488 --> 00:40:24.689
Exactly. He's just trying to take this case from us...

580
00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:26.519
because he's not getting anywhere...

581
00:40:26.519 --> 00:40:29.289
with that mental hospital case.

582
00:40:29.289 --> 00:40:32.658
So keep things confidential if you don't want to lose our case to him.

583
00:40:32.658 --> 00:40:35.999
Our team will no longer exist if we lose this case as well. Okay?

584
00:40:35.999 --> 00:40:37.039
Okay.

585
00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:42.138
Why?

586
00:40:42.868 --> 00:40:43.939
What?

587
00:40:47.448 --> 00:40:49.448
My gosh.

588
00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:53.789
That jerk used to wash my socks when he was a recruit.

589
00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.388
My gosh.

590
00:40:56.689 --> 00:40:58.388
- Let's go. - Okay.

591
00:40:58.388 --> 00:40:59.689
Keep up the good work.

592
00:41:01.229 --> 00:41:03.758
- Hey, you can eat this. - Okay. Thank you.

593
00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:07.399
- Bye. - Where's Moo Gang?

594
00:41:07.399 --> 00:41:11.198
Him? My gosh, don't even talk to me about him.

595
00:41:11.198 --> 00:41:13.638
I can't even look at him anymore.

596
00:41:14.769 --> 00:41:16.238
Actually, I'm relieved.

597
00:41:16.238 --> 00:41:19.778
I'm going to think of him as a freelancer for a while.

598
00:41:19.778 --> 00:41:21.079
That's what I'm going to do.

599
00:41:22.149 --> 00:41:23.448
Okay, go ahead.

600
00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:27.289
Think whatever you want.

601
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:38.129
No one seems to know anything about what happened to Moo Gang.

602
00:41:38.798 --> 00:41:40.599
I'll continue to keep an eye on them.

603
00:41:41.368 --> 00:41:44.138
So don't show up in front of Moo Gang for a while.

604
00:41:44.439 --> 00:41:45.499
Okay.

605
00:41:48.669 --> 00:41:51.678
I'm pretty sure that jerk saw my face.

606
00:41:51.678 --> 00:41:54.278
Why didn't he report me even after he got stabbed?

607
00:42:06.618 --> 00:42:09.189
(World Drink)

608
00:42:09.189 --> 00:42:10.899
(Sunglasses)

609
00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:11.999
Hello?

610
00:42:12.059 --> 00:42:14.329
Didn't you see Seung Chul's dad leaving?

611
00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:15.499
They say he left just now.

612
00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:16.669
No, I didn't see him.

613
00:42:22.908 --> 00:42:25.838
We already caught the culprit,

614
00:42:26.209 --> 00:42:27.778
so I'm sure nothing will happen.

615
00:42:28.908 --> 00:42:30.079
Ms. Fortune-teller.

616
00:42:30.778 --> 00:42:32.349
I heard that Pastor Kang turned out to be the culprit.

617
00:42:33.178 --> 00:42:36.318
I also handed in my dad's donation records to the police.

618
00:42:37.689 --> 00:42:38.689
That ungrateful jerk.

619
00:42:39.118 --> 00:42:42.229
Now that we caught him, does that mean my dad's going to live?

620
00:42:42.388 --> 00:42:43.899
Yes, but...

621
00:42:45.959 --> 00:42:47.928
Why didn't I think of that earlier?

622
00:42:48.868 --> 00:42:50.338
We can just check and see...

623
00:42:50.338 --> 00:42:53.338
if there's still a shadow on your father's body or not.

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

625
00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.218
It seems that Pastor Kang wasn't the culprit.

626
00:43:13.218 --> 00:43:15.729
- What? - What's going on?

627
00:43:15.758 --> 00:43:18.198
If Pastor Kang isn't the culprit, that means he'll be in trouble too.

628
00:43:24.968 --> 00:43:25.968
Wait for me.

629
00:43:25.968 --> 00:43:27.609
(Office, World Drink)

630
00:43:29.138 --> 00:43:30.278
Good work.

631
00:43:30.278 --> 00:43:31.738
Thank you, sir.

632
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:33.849
What is it?

633
00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:35.649
Didn't Mr. Yang tell you off for being late?

634
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:37.979
Everything was fine.

635
00:43:37.979 --> 00:43:39.948
- I'll go home now. - Okay. Goodbye.

636
00:43:39.948 --> 00:43:41.118
- Bye. - Bye.

637
00:43:58.638 --> 00:43:59.999
I guess she found out.

638
00:44:01.508 --> 00:44:03.508
But you won't be able to save anyone...

639
00:44:04.238 --> 00:44:06.238
because I'm not going to let you.

640
00:44:06.408 --> 00:44:08.709
I'm 444, the best there is in this business.

641
00:44:10.149 --> 00:44:13.079
What? Wait. Right here.

642
00:44:13.988 --> 00:44:15.689
Why didn't he see him?

643
00:44:21.088 --> 00:44:22.189
Wait.

644
00:44:24.698 --> 00:44:25.758
That's...

645
00:44:35.068 --> 00:44:37.809
Turn on the lights. We need to turn the lights on!

646
00:44:41.448 --> 00:44:42.979
I almost forgot.

647
00:44:42.979 --> 00:44:44.118
About what?

648
00:44:44.879 --> 00:44:46.218
When there was a blackout...

649
00:44:46.548 --> 00:44:49.789
at the party, I saw a shadow.

650
00:44:50.158 --> 00:44:51.218
What?

651
00:44:51.258 --> 00:44:53.419
I couldn't see the person's face because it was too dark.

652
00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:57.059
But that person had a mask on and was kidnapped.

653
00:44:57.059 --> 00:44:59.999
And that coat was also at the scene.

654
00:44:59.999 --> 00:45:03.169
What does that man have anything to do with kidnapping?

655
00:45:04.899 --> 00:45:06.769
What? He's the guy...

656
00:45:07.408 --> 00:45:09.209
who delivered alcohol to the party.

657
00:45:10.278 --> 00:45:11.879
- What? - I remember...

658
00:45:11.879 --> 00:45:12.879
because I signed the receipt myself.

659
00:45:15.508 --> 00:45:17.849
Yes. It was from World Drink.

660
00:45:18.778 --> 00:45:20.149
Mr. Park?

661
00:45:20.189 --> 00:45:22.448
He just left after bringing back his truck.

662
00:45:23.818 --> 00:45:25.059
What's this?

663
00:45:25.419 --> 00:45:27.129
My gosh, this startled me.

664
00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:28.829
What is this?

665
00:45:31.129 --> 00:45:32.629
What? That's...

666
00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.109
He's Steven Yoo.

667
00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:42.939
Hi, man.

668
00:45:42.939 --> 00:45:44.209
What's this doing here?

669
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:42.329
When the power went out earlier, I saw a moment of death.

670
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:45.669
It might've been an abduction case. The person was tied to a chair.

671
00:46:46.368 --> 00:46:47.908
Then the building exploded.

672
00:46:47.968 --> 00:46:48.968
What?

673
00:46:50.539 --> 00:46:52.238
Was that guy the kidnapper?

674
00:46:55.149 --> 00:46:58.019
Sang Min. This is what your friend was wearing at the party, right?

675
00:46:58.019 --> 00:46:59.419
That's Steven's.

676
00:47:00.019 --> 00:47:01.388
Why do you have this?

677
00:47:01.388 --> 00:47:03.189
- Call him right now. - Okay.

678
00:47:07.388 --> 00:47:09.189
The receiver's phone is turned off.

679
00:47:09.658 --> 00:47:10.859
His phone has been turned off.

680
00:47:12.359 --> 00:47:15.599
When was the last time you saw him?

681
00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.539
I think he left in the middle of the party.

682
00:47:17.798 --> 00:47:20.468
I guess he thought it was boring. He didn't even say goodbye.

683
00:47:20.669 --> 00:47:21.939
Do you know where he lives?

684
00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.678
Yes. He lives in the Philippines.

685
00:47:24.678 --> 00:47:27.149
And right now, he's staying at a hotel in Seoul.

686
00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:28.749
He is staying there with his mom.

687
00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:41.689
Why are you doing this? Why...

688
00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:43.329
Shut it!

689
00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:44.928
You should resent your father.

690
00:47:45.258 --> 00:47:46.459
Shut it!

691
00:47:50.198 --> 00:47:52.039
Please... Please...

692
00:47:52.368 --> 00:47:53.568
Help!

693
00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:03.379
Is your son really safe?

694
00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:05.749
He already left Korea to go to school.

695
00:48:06.218 --> 00:48:09.118
Who are you to ask me questions about him?

696
00:48:09.618 --> 00:48:12.019
If you don't leave, I'm going to call the police.

697
00:48:12.019 --> 00:48:14.658
Why did you come to Korea?

698
00:48:15.028 --> 00:48:16.428
Why are you here?

699
00:48:16.428 --> 00:48:20.499
We had a Korean housekeeper who took care of Steven as a child.

700
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:23.738
But she had to come back to Korea because she got into an accident.

701
00:48:23.868 --> 00:48:27.338
We came to visit her because my son got worried about her.

702
00:48:31.439 --> 00:48:32.908
There's no record of him having left Korea.

703
00:48:33.609 --> 00:48:34.908
Why are you lying?

704
00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.818
You have to tell us the truth.

705
00:48:38.618 --> 00:48:40.618
Your son's life is on the line.

706
00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:44.359
Your son got kidnapped, right?

707
00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.888
The kidnapper called you, didn't he?

708
00:48:48.028 --> 00:48:50.859
It's Mr. Park Soon Nam, right?

709
00:48:51.099 --> 00:48:52.359
You know who he is, don't you?

710
00:48:52.359 --> 00:48:53.769
No!

711
00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.999
I have nothing more to say to you.

712
00:48:57.738 --> 00:48:59.368
So get out of here right now.

713
00:49:00.039 --> 00:49:02.809
Excuse me. Wait. Please.

714
00:49:06.678 --> 00:49:08.678
Mr. Park is going to die soon.

715
00:49:09.178 --> 00:49:12.349
I think he has something to do with this incident.

716
00:49:12.879 --> 00:49:15.048
I wonder why he kidnapped Steven.

717
00:49:15.189 --> 00:49:18.019
Maybe it's because of money. Sang Min told me that...

718
00:49:18.618 --> 00:49:22.229
she raises Steven all by himself, and she's apparently really rich.

719
00:49:23.359 --> 00:49:26.528
If he just wanted money, he would've tried to kill him quietly.

720
00:49:26.528 --> 00:49:29.729
He wouldn't be making such a big issue by installing bombs.

721
00:49:30.198 --> 00:49:31.568
Then I wonder if he's trying to take revenge.

722
00:49:32.068 --> 00:49:33.838
We need to catch him first.

723
00:49:33.838 --> 00:49:35.769
Should we go back to the hospital? He might've gone back again.

724
00:49:48.818 --> 00:49:49.888
It's me.

725
00:49:50.088 --> 00:49:53.758
Some people came and asked me questions about Steven.

726
00:49:54.459 --> 00:49:55.559
What should I do?

727
00:51:06.158 --> 00:51:07.298
What's this?

728
00:51:11.698 --> 00:51:12.769
(Sunglasses)

729
00:51:18.039 --> 00:51:19.109
Who are you?

730
00:51:19.408 --> 00:51:21.149
Why are you following me?

731
00:51:22.249 --> 00:51:23.278
Calm down.

732
00:51:29.749 --> 00:51:31.789
Who are you? What are you?

733
00:51:37.899 --> 00:51:41.198
I warned her that her son's going to die if she tells the police.

734
00:51:41.968 --> 00:51:43.868
I can't believe she still called the police.

735
00:51:44.838 --> 00:51:47.539
Calm down. You might really stab me.

736
00:51:47.868 --> 00:51:49.939
How do you expect me to calm down?

737
00:51:50.539 --> 00:51:52.039
I'm going to kill you too.

738
00:51:59.479 --> 00:52:01.019
I said calm down.

739
00:52:01.019 --> 00:52:03.189
I don't care if you kill anyone or even decide to kill yourself.

740
00:52:03.189 --> 00:52:05.559
You can do whatever you want.

741
00:52:16.269 --> 00:52:17.338
This is...

742
00:52:28.579 --> 00:52:31.479
I'll go to the reception desk and ask if he came by.

743
00:52:45.258 --> 00:52:47.428
Is Ms. Kim Soon Hee's guardian not here?

744
00:52:47.428 --> 00:52:49.698
I think he went somewhere for a while.

745
00:52:49.698 --> 00:52:51.838
I already told him that she needs to get an MRI scan today.

746
00:52:52.468 --> 00:52:54.468
Please tell him if he gets here while she's gone.

747
00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:57.539
It'll take around 30 minutes.

748
00:53:25.798 --> 00:53:26.908
This person...

749
00:53:28.508 --> 00:53:30.479
Why do you have this?

750
00:53:30.638 --> 00:53:31.879
Who does it belong to?

751
00:53:33.379 --> 00:53:35.349
It's the watch that his son was wearing.

752
00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:38.079
He said he got it as a gift from his father.

753
00:53:39.448 --> 00:53:41.349
I figured if I sent his son's watch,

754
00:53:41.649 --> 00:53:43.618
he might get scared and show up.

755
00:53:43.988 --> 00:53:46.289
That's why I kept it at my house.

756
00:53:47.289 --> 00:53:49.988
But how do you have this?

757
00:53:50.899 --> 00:53:52.258
Who's the guy's father?

758
00:53:54.129 --> 00:53:55.629
Woo Byung Sik.

759
00:53:58.939 --> 00:54:02.309
Woo Byung Sik, the man who killed my son.

760
00:54:09.609 --> 00:54:10.678
He's...

761
00:54:11.218 --> 00:54:12.919
The building owner, Woo Byung Sik,

762
00:54:13.718 --> 00:54:16.349
tried to flee abroad with all related documents.

763
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:17.588
But he got into a rollover accident...

764
00:54:18.189 --> 00:54:19.559
on his way to the airport...

765
00:54:20.888 --> 00:54:23.088
and was found completely burnt.

766
00:54:24.229 --> 00:54:26.198
("A Body Speculated to Be Woo Byung Sik Has Been Found")

767
00:54:29.169 --> 00:54:30.698
I thought this guy was dead.

768
00:54:31.198 --> 00:54:33.238
He's not dead.

769
00:54:34.709 --> 00:54:36.908
Everyone just thinks he's dead.

770
00:54:37.809 --> 00:54:38.879
No.

771
00:54:39.439 --> 00:54:41.908
Everybody knows that he's still alive,

772
00:54:42.008 --> 00:54:43.879
but they're just pretending like they don't know!

773
00:55:08.709 --> 00:55:10.039
Mr. Park didn't come back,

774
00:55:10.678 --> 00:55:12.209
and her cousin left a while ago.

775
00:55:14.408 --> 00:55:15.448
Why?

776
00:55:15.678 --> 00:55:16.849
Woo Byung Sik.

777
00:55:17.849 --> 00:55:19.349
Woo Byung Sik's still alive.

778
00:55:20.149 --> 00:55:22.448
This watch. It's the exact same watch that I saw.

779
00:55:24.019 --> 00:55:26.258
Ms. Fortune-teller. Ms. Fortune-teller.

780
00:55:26.588 --> 00:55:28.658
While everyone was being fooled,

781
00:55:31.658 --> 00:55:33.059
my wife...

782
00:55:34.499 --> 00:55:36.028
My poor wife...

783
00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:38.099
refused to give up.

784
00:55:38.338 --> 00:55:39.769
I thought she deserved to die.

785
00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:44.079
I was cursing at her for betraying our son by getting dirty money.

786
00:55:44.379 --> 00:55:48.579
But she was actually fighting for Seung Chul all by herself.

787
00:55:50.008 --> 00:55:51.548
And I didn't even know that.

788
00:55:55.488 --> 00:55:58.519
- Please just die already! Just die! - Stop it!

789
00:55:58.789 --> 00:56:00.359
Just die already!

790
00:56:07.868 --> 00:56:08.999
What?

791
00:56:10.238 --> 00:56:11.439
This...

792
00:56:12.798 --> 00:56:13.868
This is...

793
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:21.879
This box was with Soon Hee's other belongings from the Philippines.

794
00:56:22.678 --> 00:56:25.118
And I think she was going to send it to you.

795
00:56:27.749 --> 00:56:28.749
(To Seung Chul's dad)

796
00:56:34.428 --> 00:56:35.789
Honey.

797
00:56:36.289 --> 00:56:38.198
You resented me a lot, didn't you?

798
00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:40.059
I'm sorry.

799
00:56:41.769 --> 00:56:45.099
But I never believed...

800
00:56:46.399 --> 00:56:48.508
that Woo Byung Sik was dead.

801
00:56:51.609 --> 00:56:54.649
(1 year after Time Mart Collapse)

802
00:56:54.809 --> 00:56:56.379
No matter how hard we try,

803
00:56:56.979 --> 00:57:00.019
if we can't prove that Woo Byung Sik is still alive,

804
00:57:00.919 --> 00:57:03.349
we won't be able to find out why our son, Seung Chul,

805
00:57:04.419 --> 00:57:08.229
and all those poor kids had to die.

806
00:57:09.258 --> 00:57:13.099
I realized that we won't be able to bring any truth to light.

807
00:57:13.528 --> 00:57:16.129
That's why I made up my mind...

808
00:57:16.629 --> 00:57:20.309
to find Woo Byung Sik and bring him back to Korea at all costs...

809
00:57:21.368 --> 00:57:25.278
so that he can explain to the people and the bereaved why it happened.

810
00:57:25.678 --> 00:57:27.709
I decided to reveal the truth.

811
00:57:27.709 --> 00:57:30.079
- Reveal the truth! - Reveal the truth!

812
00:57:31.718 --> 00:57:34.919
But I needed money in order to do that.

813
00:57:35.849 --> 00:57:37.818
- Hence, - She received the money!

814
00:57:37.818 --> 00:57:42.388
I received the money for our son's death.

815
00:57:42.388 --> 00:57:46.028
I don't care if the whole world criticizes what I did.

816
00:57:47.129 --> 00:57:49.698
Why did Seung Chul have to die?

817
00:57:50.468 --> 00:57:53.039
Who's responsible for my son's death?

818
00:57:53.039 --> 00:57:54.609
Move over!

819
00:57:55.169 --> 00:57:59.379
I wanted to make them get judged by the law no matter what.

820
00:58:06.318 --> 00:58:07.988
How can you receive that money?

821
00:58:08.888 --> 00:58:10.559
Gosh, she ruined everything!

822
00:58:26.638 --> 00:58:29.368
Whenever I heard that Woo Byung Sik had been spotted,

823
00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:32.338
I went there to catch him regardless of where in the world it was.

824
00:58:32.638 --> 00:58:33.809
Then one day,

825
00:58:34.379 --> 00:58:37.678
I found a woman who was speculated to be his mistress,

826
00:58:38.678 --> 00:58:40.818
and I started working as their housekeeper.

827
00:58:40.988 --> 00:58:43.818
I waited and waited.

828
00:58:43.919 --> 00:58:45.519
I thought that he would...

829
00:58:45.519 --> 00:58:47.928
- show up there eventually. - That's good enough.

830
00:58:47.928 --> 00:58:49.928
I'll give you a few days off so that you can get some rest.

831
00:58:49.928 --> 00:58:51.928
- But... - I'll see you ladies next week.

832
00:59:06.379 --> 00:59:07.379
What?

833
00:59:07.809 --> 00:59:09.948
Are all of you leaving for the day?

834
00:59:10.979 --> 00:59:13.048
- Yes. - Oh, that's right.

835
00:59:13.318 --> 00:59:15.519
He's coming today. Okay, bye.

836
00:59:20.588 --> 00:59:21.829
I couldn't believe my eyes.

837
00:59:22.588 --> 00:59:23.999
Woo Byung Sik actually...

838
00:59:25.059 --> 00:59:26.968
showed up in front of me.

839
00:59:44.149 --> 00:59:45.249
It's him, isn't it?

840
00:59:45.579 --> 00:59:47.749
Steven. Woo Byung Sik's son.

841
00:59:50.258 --> 00:59:53.559
I met him while I was working at a restaurant.

842
00:59:53.559 --> 00:59:56.959
Back then, I didn't even know that he was Woo Byung Sik.

843
00:59:57.729 --> 01:00:00.769
After that, he bought a house for me in the Philippines,

844
01:00:00.769 --> 01:00:03.698
and I gave birth to Steven and continued living there.

845
01:00:04.198 --> 01:00:07.838
He only visited us once every few months...

846
01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:10.238
and stayed for a couple of days.

847
01:00:10.238 --> 01:00:11.338
That's all.

848
01:00:11.338 --> 01:00:12.738
So after going into hiding,

849
01:00:13.138 --> 01:00:15.309
he lived normally and even had a son.

850
01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.508
I'm sorry.

851
01:00:16.508 --> 01:00:17.979
Where is he now?

852
01:00:17.979 --> 01:00:19.948
I... I don't know.

853
01:00:19.948 --> 01:00:21.618
Will you let your son die?

854
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.349
I really don't know where he is.

855
01:00:24.459 --> 01:00:26.758
Someone sent me this video,

856
01:00:26.758 --> 01:00:28.829
so I contacted him about it.

857
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:31.959
- He said he'd take care of it, - If you want your son to live,

858
01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:33.028
- but I haven't been able to... - then...

859
01:00:33.028 --> 01:00:35.698
- get a hold of him since then. - give me a call on this phone.

860
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:37.298
We should tell the police about this.

861
01:00:37.298 --> 01:00:39.499
No. You absolutely can't do that.

862
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:43.408
Then... Then Steven will die.

863
01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.609
I reached out to the Philippines police,

864
01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:52.149
and they said a witness stated that she fell off the cliff...

865
01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.048
after being chased by someone.

866
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:56.488
It must've been Woo Byung Sik.

867
01:00:57.019 --> 01:01:00.059
He must've been after my wife after finding out what she was up to.

868
01:01:01.559 --> 01:01:05.198
That's why she can't even rest in peace.

869
01:01:05.198 --> 01:01:07.068
I'm just realizing it now.

870
01:01:30.359 --> 01:01:32.289
Detective, you don't have any children, right?

871
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:37.059
We call those who have lost their spouses by death...

872
01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:40.129
"widow" or "widower".

873
01:01:40.769 --> 01:01:44.039
And kids who have lost their parents are called orphans.

874
01:01:45.338 --> 01:01:46.468
But...

875
01:01:47.669 --> 01:01:49.338
do you know...

876
01:01:50.209 --> 01:01:52.209
what parents who have lost their children are called?

877
01:01:54.908 --> 01:01:56.079
There's no word.

878
01:01:57.649 --> 01:01:59.618
It's so cruel...

879
01:01:59.618 --> 01:02:01.919
that there's no word for it.

880
01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:06.088
So?

881
01:02:06.618 --> 01:02:09.559
Is that why you were planning on kidnapping his son?

882
01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:13.428
You were going to use a child's life to avenge your son's death?

883
01:02:14.068 --> 01:02:15.968
That boy will be fine.

884
01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.298
I'm a father, not a monster.

885
01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.309
The bomb won't go off.

886
01:02:24.278 --> 01:02:26.948
This is fake.

887
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.419
I was just trying to lure Woo Byung Sik,

888
01:02:31.178 --> 01:02:32.579
that's all.

889
01:02:35.488 --> 01:02:37.189
He'll be fine?

890
01:02:41.088 --> 01:02:42.229
Gosh, please...

891
01:02:42.229 --> 01:02:45.298
Why are you doing this to me? Why...

892
01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.468
Yes.

893
01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.099
So...

894
01:02:50.899 --> 01:02:53.568
So, please... Please.

895
01:02:54.169 --> 01:02:55.939
Give me some time, please.

896
01:02:56.979 --> 01:02:58.439
I must make that jerk, Woo Byung Sik,

897
01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.948
reveal himself...

898
01:03:02.609 --> 01:03:04.218
in front of the public.

899
01:03:09.888 --> 01:03:13.189
What? Are you saying you'll broadcast the whole thing or what?

900
01:03:13.528 --> 01:03:14.588
That's right.

901
01:03:15.428 --> 01:03:17.859
I'll broadcast it live online.

902
01:03:18.499 --> 01:03:19.999
I can't trust broadcasting companies.

903
01:03:19.999 --> 01:03:21.399
I'll make sure everyone in the country...

904
01:03:21.968 --> 01:03:25.238
sees Woo Byung Sik through the live broadcast.

905
01:03:25.738 --> 01:03:29.568
Who do you think will try to kill Seung Chul's dad?

906
01:03:29.568 --> 01:03:31.379
Do you think that Woo Byung Sik...

907
01:03:32.738 --> 01:03:34.749
will let you do that even if he shows up?

908
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:38.019
What if you end up getting killed?

909
01:03:38.118 --> 01:03:40.019
That's precisely what I want.

910
01:03:41.988 --> 01:03:43.149
Gosh, please...

911
01:03:43.149 --> 01:03:44.888
Please... Please...

912
01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:46.488
Kill me.

913
01:03:46.718 --> 01:03:48.488
If you don't kill me,

914
01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.959
your son will die.

915
01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:52.298
I'll kill him.

916
01:03:52.298 --> 01:03:53.769
No, don't!

917
01:03:54.669 --> 01:03:55.729
Only then...

918
01:03:57.798 --> 01:04:01.008
Only then, my plan will come to completion.

919
01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:08.349
So...

920
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:10.379
So please...

921
01:04:11.278 --> 01:04:12.919
Don't get in my way.

922
01:04:12.919 --> 01:04:14.388
Please. I beg you.

923
01:04:14.548 --> 01:04:16.519
Don't get in my way, please.

924
01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.158
Please.

925
01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:20.088
I beg you.

926
01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.749
I'm sorry.

927
01:04:45.305 --> 01:04:47.805
If you persuade Woo Byung Sik to turn himself in,

928
01:04:47.805 --> 01:04:50.745
Mr. Park will no longer need to go on with this hostage situation.

929
01:04:50.745 --> 01:04:53.816
So please tell him to turn himself in.

930
01:04:55.015 --> 01:04:56.546
Is hiding your husband from the police...

931
01:04:56.546 --> 01:04:58.646
more important than your son's life?

932
01:05:14.095 --> 01:05:16.695
He's not picking up. He's not answering.

933
01:05:17.305 --> 01:05:18.566
Is it ringing?

934
01:05:18.765 --> 01:05:21.236
Give me his number. I'll try to track his location.

935
01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:25.046
What?

936
01:05:25.976 --> 01:05:27.015
What's going on?

937
01:05:30.046 --> 01:05:31.046
What is it?

938
01:05:31.785 --> 01:05:33.916
His name is the number one trending search term at the moment.

939
01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:34.916
What?

940
01:05:35.186 --> 01:05:36.215
Hang on.

941
01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.925
- All people of Korea. - Look at this.

942
01:05:42.325 --> 01:05:44.066
Please have a good look at this picture.

943
01:05:44.865 --> 01:05:46.396
This man is Woo Byung Sik.

944
01:05:47.566 --> 01:05:49.796
Woo Byung Sik, the main culprit of the Time Mart collapse disaster,

945
01:05:50.765 --> 01:05:53.305
whom the media reported to have been found dead...

946
01:05:53.936 --> 01:05:55.476
in a burnt car,

947
01:05:56.476 --> 01:05:58.876
has actually been alive for the last 20 years.

948
01:06:00.046 --> 01:06:01.175
And in a few minutes...

949
01:06:02.046 --> 01:06:03.276
at 8pm sharp,

950
01:06:03.845 --> 01:06:05.186
Woo Byung Sik...

951
01:06:06.385 --> 01:06:08.385
will appear before your eyes.

952
01:06:14.825 --> 01:06:15.825
Woo Byung Sik.

953
01:06:17.866 --> 01:06:19.726
If you want your son to live,

954
01:06:20.465 --> 01:06:21.795
you better get yourself here quickly.

955
01:06:23.165 --> 01:06:24.236
He's alive?

956
01:06:24.265 --> 01:06:25.965
How shameless. I can't believe he's alive.

957
01:06:25.965 --> 01:06:27.375
Isn't that man really Woo Byung Sik?

958
01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.776
- Who is he? - He's alive?

959
01:06:28.875 --> 01:06:30.705
That can't be. He's probably just his look-alike.

960
01:06:30.705 --> 01:06:32.375
No! He's obviously alive.

961
01:06:32.476 --> 01:06:35.116
- He must really be alive. - What's that man doing though?

962
01:06:35.246 --> 01:06:37.486
There's a pattern on the face of the watch.

963
01:06:39.915 --> 01:06:41.156
I've never seen it.

964
01:06:44.656 --> 01:06:48.696
Then have you heard anything about the owner of Pumpkin Singer?

965
01:06:49.156 --> 01:06:51.295
Who? Clara?

966
01:06:51.295 --> 01:06:53.326
Gosh, don't even talk about her in front of me.

967
01:06:53.425 --> 01:06:57.066
She got out alone when the rest of us got raided by the police.

968
01:06:57.066 --> 01:06:59.665
I'm sure she's doing fine wherever she is.

969
01:07:01.276 --> 01:07:02.805
What are you doing now?

970
01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:05.005
There's big news.

971
01:07:05.005 --> 01:07:07.545
- What news? - Mr. Park, a father of one...

972
01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:08.675
of Time Mart Collapse victims,

973
01:07:08.776 --> 01:07:10.816
is insisting that Woo Byung Sik, the main culprit of the collapse...

974
01:07:10.915 --> 01:07:13.116
and the former CEO of the construction company,

975
01:07:13.146 --> 01:07:16.186
is actually alive in his online broadcast at the moment...

976
01:07:16.186 --> 01:07:18.055
That jerk, Woo Byung Sik, is really alive?

977
01:07:18.226 --> 01:07:20.726
- Wasn't he found burnt and dead? - In the picture he disclosed,

978
01:07:20.925 --> 01:07:23.226
there is a man who is speculated to be Woo Byung Sik.

979
01:07:23.226 --> 01:07:25.595
He completely fooled everyone in this country.

980
01:07:25.595 --> 01:07:28.465
He's also insisting he's holding Woo Byung Sik's son hostage now.

981
01:07:28.465 --> 01:07:30.465
- Hang on. - If he doesn't come until 8pm...

982
01:07:30.465 --> 01:07:33.976
You should catch him and ask him where Clara is.

983
01:07:35.205 --> 01:07:37.246
- Pardon me? - That jerk...

984
01:07:37.246 --> 01:07:39.675
used to be a regular at Pumpkin Singer.

985
01:07:39.675 --> 01:07:41.746
He had so many clients to entertain.

986
01:07:42.045 --> 01:07:43.915
He used to go there all the time...

987
01:07:43.946 --> 01:07:46.316
and had many private conversations with Clara.

988
01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:47.816
- You mean Woo Byung Sik? - Yes.

989
01:07:47.986 --> 01:07:50.726
Gosh, I totally knew that his building would collapse.

990
01:07:50.726 --> 01:07:52.726
He spent all of his money on entertaining his clients.

991
01:07:52.726 --> 01:07:56.026
I bet he bought the cheapest construction materials.

992
01:07:56.255 --> 01:07:58.026
It's so obvious.

993
01:07:59.226 --> 01:08:03.765
I'm pretty sure Clara made a hefty amount through him.

994
01:08:08.135 --> 01:08:09.335
If that's the case,

995
01:08:11.076 --> 01:08:12.845
could Woo Byung Sik be this jerk?

996
01:08:15.845 --> 01:08:16.986
Try to remember.

997
01:08:17.746 --> 01:08:19.316
Did you see anything else other than the shadow?

998
01:08:19.585 --> 01:08:20.755
I'm not sure.

999
01:08:28.295 --> 01:08:30.226
- Calm down. Try to stay calm. - Woo Byung Sik.

1000
01:08:30.226 --> 01:08:33.295
If you don't show up on time, your son...

1001
01:08:33.595 --> 01:08:35.866
will die just like how my son died.

1002
01:08:35.866 --> 01:08:37.665
- "Just like how my son died"? - Just remember that.

1003
01:08:37.665 --> 01:08:39.705
Could he be at Moojin Time Mart?

1004
01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:42.375
(April 16, 1997, We will remember the day forever.)

1005
01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:43.375
(The Largest Shopping Complex in Asia)

1006
01:08:47.276 --> 01:08:49.175
Do you really think he's here?

1007
01:08:49.175 --> 01:08:51.545
- Call Moojin Police Station now. - Yes, sir.

1008
01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:55.915
Gosh, why do I have to take a leak again?

1009
01:09:01.226 --> 01:09:04.326
There was construction going on where Time Mart used to be,

1010
01:09:04.326 --> 01:09:06.965
but it's been put on pause as the victims' families object. Look.

1011
01:09:10.536 --> 01:09:11.635
They're not there.

1012
01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:24.585
They're not here. This isn't the place.

1013
01:09:36.496 --> 01:09:37.496
(The Largest Shopping Complex in Asia)

1014
01:09:42.165 --> 01:09:44.366
What? What do you mean?

1015
01:09:44.366 --> 01:09:47.106
You see these buildings at the back, right?

1016
01:09:47.106 --> 01:09:50.946
But I saw a large road outside the window of the building.

1017
01:09:51.776 --> 01:09:54.215
It was lined with street lights,

1018
01:09:54.276 --> 01:09:57.646
but strangely, only one direction of the road was completely empty.

1019
01:09:58.015 --> 01:09:59.085
What?

1020
01:09:59.316 --> 01:10:01.616
Only one direction was completely empty?

1021
01:10:02.455 --> 01:10:04.585
The police must've been controlling traffic going that way. Hold on.

1022
01:10:09.026 --> 01:10:11.095
- I think it's Seoun, not Moojin. - Sorry?

1023
01:10:11.095 --> 01:10:13.566
There's a night marathon happening in Geumpyung-gu,

1024
01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:15.265
and they've blocked one side of the road for it.

1025
01:10:15.536 --> 01:10:16.595
Look at this.

1026
01:10:17.436 --> 01:10:18.536
Let's go there, then.

1027
01:10:30.915 --> 01:10:32.885
Woo Byung Sik is alive? My foot.

1028
01:10:33.246 --> 01:10:35.356
People in this country love conspiracy theories.

1029
01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.255
He got compensated. What's he doing now?

1030
01:10:37.255 --> 01:10:39.555
I'm so sick of it. Until when will he try to make money off of it?

1031
01:10:50.335 --> 01:10:52.066
- He's a total psycho. - He's a psycho.

1032
01:10:52.066 --> 01:10:53.936
- What a waste of time. - The top floor.

1033
01:10:53.936 --> 01:10:55.436
- Where? - Nice, it's like a game!

1034
01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:56.875
Woo Byung Sik.

1035
01:10:57.276 --> 01:10:59.246
Woo Byung Sik!

1036
01:11:04.786 --> 01:11:05.986
Woo Byung Sik.

1037
01:11:06.515 --> 01:11:08.755
Get yourself here immediately!

1038
01:11:09.316 --> 01:11:10.625
If you don't show up soon,

1039
01:11:11.585 --> 01:11:13.696
I'll really kill your son.

1040
01:11:14.526 --> 01:11:16.925
I'm really going to kill him!

1041
01:11:25.965 --> 01:11:27.005
Please.

1042
01:11:27.906 --> 01:11:29.705
If you don't come soon,

1043
01:11:30.076 --> 01:11:31.276
your son will die.

1044
01:11:31.805 --> 01:11:34.746
I said, I'm really going to kill him!

1045
01:11:40.585 --> 01:11:43.625
Yes, this is the place. They must be here.

1046
01:11:43.986 --> 01:11:45.555
Oh, no. It's already 8pm.

1047
01:11:45.555 --> 01:11:47.255
Mr. Park will die at 8:20pm,

1048
01:11:47.255 --> 01:11:48.996
but Steven will die before that.

1049
01:11:49.295 --> 01:11:51.125
Then let's go that way first.

1050
01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:52.265
- Okay. - Let's go.

1051
01:12:00.135 --> 01:12:03.036
Oh, over there. They're over there.

1052
01:12:11.446 --> 01:12:13.116
Woo Byung Sik, you better be watching this.

1053
01:12:14.215 --> 01:12:16.186
If you don't show up immediately,

1054
01:12:17.085 --> 01:12:18.286
I...

1055
01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:21.226
will really kill your son.

1056
01:12:28.335 --> 01:12:30.366
I'll really kill him!

1057
01:12:50.425 --> 01:12:51.455
No!

1058
01:13:05.566 --> 01:13:08.175
Hey, Ha Ram.

1059
01:13:09.776 --> 01:13:10.946
Are you okay?

1060
01:13:11.746 --> 01:13:12.845
Did you get hurt?

1061
01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:14.545
Do you have any injuries?

1062
01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:19.045
Steven... Steven...

1063
01:13:20.186 --> 01:13:22.055
Steven. Steven.

1064
01:13:25.726 --> 01:13:26.726
Ha Ram.

1065
01:13:32.026 --> 01:13:33.165
What...

1066
01:13:35.595 --> 01:13:36.696
Gosh.

1067
01:13:52.116 --> 01:13:55.755
I never even set up a bomb. This can't be.

1068
01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:00.356
Steven...

1069
01:14:00.555 --> 01:14:02.356
Steven.

1070
01:14:16.946 --> 01:14:19.476
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1071
01:14:20.106 --> 01:14:22.415
I came too late. I'm sorry.

1072
01:15:02.555 --> 01:15:03.726
Please...

1073
01:15:04.255 --> 01:15:07.095
Please don't kill me. Please don't...

1074
01:15:24.045 --> 01:15:26.476
There has been a bomb explosion at a redevelopment site.

1075
01:15:26.476 --> 01:15:28.946
Residents in the vicinity are evacuating the area at the moment.

1076
01:15:34.755 --> 01:15:36.156
I have some information for you.

1077
01:15:38.186 --> 01:15:39.955
The man who just detonated the bomb...

1078
01:15:40.555 --> 01:15:43.295
purchased another bomb from me.

1079
01:15:44.026 --> 01:15:46.936
He bought one that's a lot stronger than the one that just went off.

1080
01:15:46.996 --> 01:15:48.295
He bought one that's a lot stronger than the one that just went off.

1081
01:15:58.446 --> 01:15:59.545
What?

1082
01:16:00.106 --> 01:16:01.246
Honey...

1083
01:16:03.015 --> 01:16:04.215
Honey!

1084
01:16:12.786 --> 01:16:14.656
You filthy jerk.

1085
01:16:17.265 --> 01:16:18.595
Then...

1086
01:16:20.226 --> 01:16:22.066
was that you?

1087
01:16:24.835 --> 01:16:28.205
Was that you?

1088
01:16:37.845 --> 01:16:38.915
All agents,

1089
01:16:38.915 --> 01:16:41.455
kill him immediately if he shows any signs of setting off a bomb.

1090
01:17:02.406 --> 01:17:04.175
No!

1091
01:17:21.755 --> 01:17:24.226
The culprit of the kidnap and bombing incident, Park Soon Nam,

1092
01:17:24.226 --> 01:17:25.226
had lost his son...

1093
01:17:25.226 --> 01:17:28.436
20 years ago because of the collapse of Moojin Time Mart.

1094
01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:30.196
And after he became distant with his wife,

1095
01:17:30.196 --> 01:17:34.175
it seems highly possible that his rage made him become delusional.

1096
01:17:34.335 --> 01:17:37.305
His wife suddenly disappeared after she received a large sum...

1097
01:17:37.305 --> 01:17:40.476
of settlement money from the construction company 20 years ago.

1098
01:17:40.476 --> 01:17:44.286
After that, he is known to have had disputes with other victim families.

1099
01:17:44.345 --> 01:17:47.515
- The photo of Woo Byung Sik... - Mr. Park has been living alone...

1100
01:17:47.515 --> 01:17:50.425
- is nowhere to be found. - ever since his wife left home.

1101
01:17:50.425 --> 01:17:53.486
- They say the photo was actually... - It turns out that he had been...

1102
01:17:53.486 --> 01:17:56.856
- a photoshopped photo. - suffering from depression...

1103
01:18:47.776 --> 01:18:48.845
Here.

1104
01:19:42.996 --> 01:19:44.005
Honey.

1105
01:19:45.165 --> 01:19:46.436
I'm sorry.

1106
01:19:47.236 --> 01:19:49.505
I failed like a fool.

1107
01:19:50.946 --> 01:19:52.345
I even...

1108
01:19:53.576 --> 01:19:54.845
I even killed you.

1109
01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:56.616
It's okay.

1110
01:19:58.385 --> 01:20:01.816
At least we never gave up.

1111
01:20:04.385 --> 01:20:06.125
Thank you, honey.

1112
01:20:08.226 --> 01:20:09.425
Let's...

1113
01:20:11.665 --> 01:20:13.295
go see Seung Chul now.

1114
01:20:16.135 --> 01:20:18.305
I'm sure he'll be waiting for us.

1115
01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:50.936
Photos of Woo Byung Sik are falling from the sky.

1116
01:20:51.236 --> 01:20:54.476
- Hundreds of photos... - The photos turned out to be real.

1117
01:20:54.476 --> 01:20:56.946
- of Woo Byung Sik fell from... - Therefore, he has instantly...

1118
01:20:56.946 --> 01:20:59.505
become a wanted man.

1119
01:20:59.505 --> 01:21:01.045
Interpol...

1120
01:21:01.045 --> 01:21:04.246
will also search for him as well.

1121
01:21:04.786 --> 01:21:07.816
If Woo Byung Sik gets caught, he'll be charged with...

1122
01:21:12.755 --> 01:21:15.496
- It's Woo Byung Sik. - My gosh, he was still alive.

1123
01:22:02.635 --> 01:22:04.746
Hey, you're here.

1124
01:22:05.276 --> 01:22:07.015
Where's my wife and Steven?

1125
01:22:07.015 --> 01:22:09.045
They're waiting for you on the boat.

1126
01:22:11.215 --> 01:22:15.156
Okay, thank you. Thank you for taking care of everything.

1127
01:22:50.326 --> 01:22:51.625
How could you...

1128
01:23:26.555 --> 01:23:28.226
(Black)

1129
01:23:28.226 --> 01:23:30.965
Why do I keep making mistakes about the moment of their deaths?

1130
01:23:31.066 --> 01:23:33.765
I never trust humans.

1131
01:23:34.165 --> 01:23:35.835
Where's Woo Byung Sik?

1132
01:23:35.835 --> 01:23:39.606
I don't know who released all those photos, but I'm very grateful.

1133
01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.205
You shouldn't trust anyone either.

1134
01:23:41.205 --> 01:23:43.305
You should be careful of Oh Man Soo.

1135
01:23:43.335 --> 01:23:45.446
Yes. It'll be fine as long as I keep quiet.

1136
01:23:45.906 --> 01:23:48.175
I'll die as you wish.

1137
01:23:48.746 --> 01:23:49.816
You're going to die?

1138
01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:51.746
You won't have it your way.
