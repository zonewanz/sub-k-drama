1
00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.194
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:10.030
- Hello. - This place is really pretty.

3
00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:13.033
- It was in "The Beauty Inside". - That's right.

4
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.367
It's the same cafe.

5
00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:16.336
The owner of the cafe has my respect.

6
00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:18.571
- Big respect. - Respect, respect.

7
00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:20.573
So Min, you cut your bangs.

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.077
I cut my bangs to refresh myself without cutting my hair short.

9
00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:26.179
- Why did you refresh yourself? - Did someone dump you?

10
00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.747
- Did something happen? - Did someone break your heart?

11
00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:29.883
- You and your boyfriend broke up. - No.

12
00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.352
- You and your boyfriend broke up. - She is looking for another love.

13
00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:37.257
Ji Hyo, you never change your hairstyle.

14
00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:39.426
- I don't have a change of heart. - I know.

15
00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.528
- I always remain the same. - Seriously.

16
00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:43.730
- You are amazing. - Ji Hyo is really like that.

17
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.731
- I always remain the same. - Ji Hyo remains calm...

18
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.435
while those around her suffer because of her.

19
00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.303
Those around her suffer because of her.

20
00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:52.639
- She is fine. - No matter what happens,

21
00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:53.807
- she remains unaffected. - That's right.

22
00:00:53.807 --> 00:00:55.041
- She is cool. - She remains unaffected.

23
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.509
- She is a strong woman. - She is incredible.

24
00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:57.677
- Respect. - Big respect.

25
00:00:57.677 --> 00:00:58.745
(Respect for a strong woman)

26
00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.880
Se Chan, your face is very swollen today.

27
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.148
(By the way...)

28
00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.084
(Why is his face puffy?)

29
00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:05.552
I'm not swollen, I gained weight.

30
00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:06.820
(He is stressed out.)

31
00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:10.090
Both Se Chan and I binge eat these days.

32
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.592
- New Zealand changed us. - I eat my stress away.

33
00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:14.627
- I can't stop thinking about it. - You look better.

34
00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:15.929
My face is rounder, right?

35
00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.198
Your mouth doesn't look as protruded.

36
00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:20.200
I realized something during the last week's shoot.

37
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.968
The members have a lot of moles on their necks.

38
00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:24.237
- That's right. - They have moles on their necks.

39
00:01:24.604 --> 00:01:26.840
- That's right. - I have a mole right here.

40
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.676
Haha, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok have them.

41
00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:31.978
- Seok Jin, you don't have any. - No, I don't.

42
00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:33.179
- You have a wart instead. - Doesn't he have a mole?

43
00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.148
- What are you talking about? - You have a wart.

44
00:01:35.148 --> 00:01:36.182
- A wart? - I don't have a wart.

45
00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:38.518
- Don't grandpas get warts? - Don't say that.

46
00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:40.587
You can get warts at any age.

47
00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:42.522
Anyone can get warts.

48
00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:45.058
- Scary grandpas get them. - The two of you are attacking me.

49
00:01:45.058 --> 00:01:47.827
- I see a wart! - Get your hand off of me.

50
00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:50.930
Don't cut in when we are talking.

51
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.166
(So Min and Seok Jin show off their chemistry from the start.)

52
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.200
For goodness' sake.

53
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:58.805
Thank you for working hard on various projects.

54
00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:00.140
(Thank you for working hard on various projects.)

55
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.642
- It was nothing. - Why is he using such a warm tone?

56
00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:05.412
- Seriously. - We must be done with the projects.

57
00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:07.747
Only a few members worked hard.

58
00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:08.748
That's right.

59
00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:13.286
I gave Seok Jin the nickname of Sinsa-dong Mudfish.

60
00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:15.789
- He slips away from penalties. - That's right.

61
00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:18.324
- He is incredible. - Last week,

62
00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:20.360
I did an amazing job of slipping away.

63
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.061
He's so good at it.

64
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:26.533
To soothe your tired body and mind with a fall vacation,

65
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.202
we prepared "Running Man, Do Whatever You Want".

66
00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:31.805
(Running Man's fall vacation, Do Whatever You Want)

67
00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:33.339
We are getting a vacation.

68
00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:35.742
- Do Whatever You Want. - We are finally getting a prize.

69
00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:37.944
Before you go,

70
00:02:38.144 --> 00:02:40.713
please write down the vacation you recommend...

71
00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:44.117
to the person to your left.

72
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.286
Jong Kook should have sat to your left.

73
00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:47.720
Where do you want to send me?

74
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.689
Gosh, this is upsetting.

75
00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.758
Let's recommend good places to each other.

76
00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:53.860
- Let's write down what we want. - Okay.

77
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.728
One bad place will ruin everything.

78
00:02:55.728 --> 00:02:58.631
- It will be a dog fight. - This isn't a penalty.

79
00:02:58.631 --> 00:03:00.700
You are right. This is a vacation.

80
00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:02.469
Kwang Soo, don't joke around with this.

81
00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.304
I know what you've always wanted to do.

82
00:03:04.304 --> 00:03:05.672
(Don't worry.)

83
00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:07.373
This is for Seok Jin.

84
00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:10.677
"From Seok Jin".

85
00:03:10.677 --> 00:03:12.045
Sinsa-dong Mudfish.

86
00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.713
(What does So Min want to do?)

87
00:03:13.713 --> 00:03:16.349
I could have written down your nickname.

88
00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.951
- Which one? - Anyang Hothead.

89
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:20.954
- Anyang Hothead. - Anyang Hothead?

90
00:03:20.954 --> 00:03:22.355
Anyang Hothead.

91
00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:24.891
Sinsa-dong Mudfish and Anyang Hothead.

92
00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:27.694
Anyang Hothead. You must think it suits you.

93
00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:31.931
Jong Kook likes his new nickname.

94
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:33.666
This is perfect for you.

95
00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:35.835
- My goodness. - It's tailored to your needs.

96
00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:37.770
- Really? - Yes.

97
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.739
- I don't want to do anything. - You don't want to do anything.

98
00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.040
- No. - You will get your wish.

99
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.408
- My goodness. - That's right.

100
00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:43.443
You won't do anything.

101
00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:46.412
Wait a minute.

102
00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:48.548
Keep writing without looking in my direction.

103
00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:49.749
(Urgent)

104
00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.418
- You look a bit like Han Hyo Joo. - Who?

105
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.255
(My goodness, he says I look like Han Hyo Joo.)

106
00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:56.256
Thank you.

107
00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.958
Jae Seok, why are you being annoying in the morning?

108
00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.929
When she was looking down, she looked a bit like Han Hyo Joo.

109
00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.164
- How annoying! - Don't spoil her.

110
00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:06.165
(Anyang Hothead chimes in.)

111
00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:08.501
- Seriously. - Don't say such a thing.

112
00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:12.405
From this side, her eye is this big due to a sty.

113
00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:13.439
(He reveals that she has a sty.)

114
00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.440
Why won't it go away?

115
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.243
Do you have a sty? Gosh, I shook her hand earlier.

116
00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:20.947
Why did you say that? Don't tell people.

117
00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:22.515
That's right.

118
00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:25.351
Kwang Soo recently hosted Kim Ki Bang's wedding.

119
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:27.820
- An acquaintance of mine was there. - Okay.

120
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.822
- How did Kwang Soo do? - I heard you did a terrible job.

121
00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:31.891
I heard it was very boring.

122
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:34.193
It was my first time to get booed for hosting a wedding.

123
00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:36.462
- How is that possible? - From afar,

124
00:04:36.462 --> 00:04:39.699
I couldn't hear what the guests were saying, but they did this.

125
00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:41.000
(That's wrong.)

126
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.369
- They did this. - Seriously.

127
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.439
You have no right to talk about hosting a wedding.

128
00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.308
- Why do you say that? - At my sister's wedding,

129
00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:50.543
you said my father's name instead of the groom's name.

130
00:04:50.543 --> 00:04:52.545
(Seok Jin's father almost walked down the aisle twice.)

131
00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:55.081
He said my father's name.

132
00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:56.282
Why did you do that?

133
00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:59.052
- Did you finish writing? - Yes.

134
00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:03.356
Hand the envelope to the person to your left.

135
00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:04.724
Here you go.

136
00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:07.760
- It contains my sincerity. - I will see what you wrote.

137
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:09.562
It's something you like.

138
00:05:09.562 --> 00:05:11.965
- Really? - Really.

139
00:05:11.965 --> 00:05:14.434
- I can trust you, right? - Of course you can.

140
00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:17.303
- You don't have to do anything. - Don't open it yet.

141
00:05:17.303 --> 00:05:20.707
Please take turns to talk about with which thoughts...

142
00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:22.842
- you recommended the plan. - Shall we do that?

143
00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:24.410
- Let's start with Cunning Yang. - Shall I go first?

144
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.612
- Shall we start with Cunning Yang? - Cunning Yang.

145
00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:28.147
- It's from Kwang Soo, right? - Yes, it is.

146
00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:32.385
"Dear Se Chan. Se Chan, it's me, Kwang Soo."

147
00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:34.020
"I am having many thoughts."

148
00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:36.422
"What could be a vacation of your dreams?"

149
00:05:36.823 --> 00:05:39.892
"I suddenly remembered..."

150
00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:41.961
Why did you write a letter?

151
00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:43.896
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

152
00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:46.833
This is why you were terrible with hosting the wedding.

153
00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:47.934
- For goodness' sake. - Why would you bring that up?

154
00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:50.403
You shouldn't have made these unnecessary comments.

155
00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:51.804
(Where is the actual recommendation?)

156
00:05:51.804 --> 00:05:54.440
- Seriously. - This is excessive.

157
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.911
"I suddenly remembered something you always wanted to try."

158
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.947
- We still didn't get to the point. - This is ridiculous.

159
00:06:00.947 --> 00:06:03.783
- For goodness' sake. - What is this?

160
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.086
It's waxing.

161
00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:08.321
(What?)

162
00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:10.056
(Waxing?)

163
00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:11.057
What?

164
00:06:11.057 --> 00:06:13.893
(Am I hearing things?)

165
00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:14.894
Waxing!

166
00:06:14.894 --> 00:06:17.397
"Satiate your curiosity and gain confidence..."

167
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.333
- "with waxing." - Waxing!

168
00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:21.634
Isn't this a penalty?

169
00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:24.637
Se Chan has talked about it.

170
00:06:24.637 --> 00:06:26.039
He was curious about waxing.

171
00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.340
How much hair do you want me to remove?

172
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.341
(There are different types of waxing.)

173
00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:30.043
- What? - Everything?

174
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:31.444
Where do you want him to be waxed?

175
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:35.748
Are you referring to the Brazilian waxing?

176
00:06:37.283 --> 00:06:38.317
- Come on. - Hey.

177
00:06:38.317 --> 00:06:40.586
- Okay. Say that I got the waxing. - Well, I'm not the one getting it.

178
00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:42.622
To whom should I show my waxed body?

179
00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:45.758
Do I have to get naked in front of you and show you my body?

180
00:06:45.992 --> 00:06:48.661
- That's right. - How could you feel shy about that?

181
00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:49.662
(He's disappointed.)

182
00:06:49.662 --> 00:06:51.931
- It's too much. Why would I get it? - Waxing?

183
00:06:51.931 --> 00:06:53.599
- I wrote a good one compared to it. - Hey, this vacation is...

184
00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.402
- You should've written a good one. - This is a penalty, not a vacation.

185
00:06:56.402 --> 00:06:58.337
No, hear me out. Se Chan really talked about getting a waxing.

186
00:06:58.337 --> 00:07:00.673
- Kwang Soo is so weird. - What's gotten into him?

187
00:07:00.673 --> 00:07:02.442
- He's gotten strange. - Are you doing this on purpose...

188
00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:03.509
- because Jong Kook likes me? - Why are you doing this?

189
00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:04.644
That's right, you jerk.

190
00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:06.913
(That's right, you jerk.)

191
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.815
So watch your back.

192
00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:11.851
- But still, Kwang Soo. - Be grateful it was just a waxing.

193
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:13.086
He got it in for me.

194
00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:14.253
I was going to write shaving your head.

195
00:07:14.253 --> 00:07:15.822
Anyway, since he wrote it, you must carry it out.

196
00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:18.024
Whether it's your leg or some other part, you must do it.

197
00:07:18.024 --> 00:07:19.292
- That's right. - Right.

198
00:07:19.392 --> 00:07:20.993
But seriously, what is his deal with me?

199
00:07:20.993 --> 00:07:22.095
(The first vacation spot gives them the chills.)

200
00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:23.896
Gosh, Kwang Soo can be so scary.

201
00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:26.232
- Compared to this, mine is great. - Kwang Soo...

202
00:07:26.532 --> 00:07:28.134
I'll read what Se Chan wrote for me.

203
00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:30.203
"To my hero, Haha."

204
00:07:30.937 --> 00:07:34.040
"I think you've been stressed out lately because of Nevis Swing."

205
00:07:34.373 --> 00:07:36.042
"Since you have to get on the ride as the penalty,"

206
00:07:36.042 --> 00:07:38.544
"I hoped that you would familiarize yourself with the word, 'swing'."

207
00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:41.047
- He's in trouble. He's doomed. - Poor Haha.

208
00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:43.516
"Go to a dancing studio and learn how to swing dance."

209
00:07:44.016 --> 00:07:45.418
I mean it, Haha.

210
00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:46.552
- This is... - You have to get on that ride.

211
00:07:46.552 --> 00:07:47.787
- I want you to get used to it. - Really?

212
00:07:47.787 --> 00:07:48.855
You know swing dance?

213
00:07:48.855 --> 00:07:50.790
- He can learn how to jive or rumba. - That's too harsh.

214
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.425
- Swing dance... - Actually, Haha and I learned...

215
00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:55.428
- them on a show back in the days. - I learned the cha-cha dance.

216
00:07:55.428 --> 00:07:57.697
- You'll be fine. - You have a knack for dancing.

217
00:07:57.697 --> 00:07:59.799
- Get comfortable with it. - He must be cool to look good.

218
00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:01.534
You'll look cool.

219
00:08:01.534 --> 00:08:02.668
Goodness, what a bad move.

220
00:08:02.668 --> 00:08:05.638
- So it just rhymed with "swing". - Right.

221
00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:07.673
- It rhymes with Nevis Swing. - But that was witty, Se Chan.

222
00:08:07.673 --> 00:08:09.008
- It was, wasn't it? - Yes, it was.

223
00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:10.076
- Thank you. - Sure.

224
00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:11.544
You like everything he says, don't you?

225
00:08:11.544 --> 00:08:12.712
Well, waxing was good too.

226
00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:14.814
What about Ji Hyo's?

227
00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:16.182
Well, mine is...

228
00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:18.451
Ji Hyo likes sleeping.

229
00:08:18.718 --> 00:08:20.653
- My gosh. - She likes it.

230
00:08:20.653 --> 00:08:22.889
- I guess it's a good one. - "To Ji Hyo, my neighbor."

231
00:08:23.156 --> 00:08:25.525
"It seems like you can never get enough sleep."

232
00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:27.827
"This place is perfect for you to take a long nap."

233
00:08:27.827 --> 00:08:30.630
- "Go to a sleeping cafe." - Seriously? She's going to sleep?

234
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.099
- Haha really wrote that. - "Sleep tight and rest."

235
00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:35.001
- That's such a great one. - Can she really do that though?

236
00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:36.402
- It's good for her, - This week,

237
00:08:36.402 --> 00:08:39.038
- but what about the show? - she won't get any air time.

238
00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:41.140
- Do you not want her on the show? - Really?

239
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.943
- Is that what you want? - I'll be on the show for a second.

240
00:08:43.943 --> 00:08:46.479
No. Imagine how funny it'd be if you were to have sleep paralysis.

241
00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:48.548
But I never get sleep paralysis.

242
00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:49.749
(This will be enough for your air time.)

243
00:08:49.749 --> 00:08:51.918
- You just look silly like that. - He can write that?

244
00:08:51.918 --> 00:08:54.287
- Goodness, this is... - But he really...

245
00:08:54.487 --> 00:08:55.721
thought about Ji Hyo.

246
00:08:55.721 --> 00:08:57.523
- You should sleep talk. - That's right.

247
00:08:57.523 --> 00:09:00.193
- You're tired today. It's perfect. - That sounds like fun.

248
00:09:00.193 --> 00:09:01.494
- Shall I read mine? - Yes.

249
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:02.995
- Isn't that a good one? - It is.

250
00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:04.263
Ji Hyo wrote this, right?

251
00:09:04.263 --> 00:09:05.698
- I did. - What is it?

252
00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:08.434
Hold on. Gosh.

253
00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:09.602
- What is it? - I bet it's ramyeon.

254
00:09:09.602 --> 00:09:10.837
- Does he have to eat ramyeon? - No.

255
00:09:10.837 --> 00:09:12.605
- If I were to write his... - I was serious about this.

256
00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:13.773
- I wrote this for you. - That's a long letter.

257
00:09:13.773 --> 00:09:15.041
Jong Kook, read it.

258
00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:17.009
"Kim Jong Kook".

259
00:09:19.278 --> 00:09:21.247
- My letter isn't affectionate. - Goodness.

260
00:09:21.347 --> 00:09:22.682
She just wrote, "Kim Jong Kook".

261
00:09:22.682 --> 00:09:24.150
- I like that. - Ji Hyo.

262
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.152
- Ji Hyo. - Was she challenging him?

263
00:09:26.152 --> 00:09:27.486
- "Kim Jong Kook". - But...

264
00:09:27.486 --> 00:09:29.522
I like how plain it sounds. She just wrote his name.

265
00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:31.691
- That's right. - I hate those endearments.

266
00:09:31.691 --> 00:09:34.493
"To Jong Kook, the health promoter".

267
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:37.563
"I want you to eat sweet potatoes as they are in season now."

268
00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:38.664
That's nice.

269
00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:40.666
- You like sweet potatoes. - "Go to a sweet potato farm."

270
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:43.569
(Go to the sweet potato farm.)

271
00:09:44.303 --> 00:09:45.838
"Dig sweet potatoes yourself."

272
00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:48.307
- He likes healthy food. - That's right.

273
00:09:48.307 --> 00:09:51.244
- You can work out while digging. - Hey, she's right.

274
00:09:51.344 --> 00:09:52.845
- Get some fresh air. - I hate things like this.

275
00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:54.113
You know what I mean?

276
00:09:54.447 --> 00:09:55.681
I hate doing small stuff.

277
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:59.752
- I rather do something big. - Like trivial tasks?

278
00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:00.786
- Hey. - Like trivial tasks?

279
00:10:00.786 --> 00:10:03.856
- I really hate doing those. - When you grab the stem...

280
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.259
- I'll read what Jong Kook wrote. - Learning to swing dance is good.

281
00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:09.562
"To Jae Seok. You love eating noodles."

282
00:10:09.562 --> 00:10:10.930
- He does. - "Jae Seok."

283
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.231
- I was really thoughtful. - "You especially like ramyeon."

284
00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:15.601
"Go to a ramyeon buffet and eat as much as ramyeon you want."

285
00:10:15.902 --> 00:10:17.970
"Let's get it!" I love this.

286
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.472
- There's a ramyeon buffet? - You want me to eat ramyeon?

287
00:10:19.472 --> 00:10:20.673
- This place actually exists? - There's such place?

288
00:10:20.673 --> 00:10:23.776
- This is it. This is a good one. - Jong Kook gave me a good one.

289
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.778
- I knew he likes eating noodles. - Thank you.

290
00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:26.846
(This is how he takes care of Jae Seok.)

291
00:10:27.446 --> 00:10:28.781
This is amazing.

292
00:10:28.781 --> 00:10:30.116
I really want to visit that buffet.

293
00:10:30.116 --> 00:10:31.584
- I'm really curious about it too. - I want to go there too.

294
00:10:31.584 --> 00:10:32.852
Jong Kook is being so nice to Jae Seok.

295
00:10:32.852 --> 00:10:34.654
Then I'll change mine to the ramyeon buffet too.

296
00:10:34.654 --> 00:10:35.688
No, leave it.

297
00:10:35.988 --> 00:10:38.624
(When have you ever seen me eating ramyeon?)

298
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:40.927
- It's time to read mine now. - I'm sure you'll like what I wrote.

299
00:10:40.927 --> 00:10:43.462
- Jae Seok wrote it for you. - Jae Seok annoys me.

300
00:10:43.462 --> 00:10:45.197
- I'm sure you'll like it. - I wonder what he wrote.

301
00:10:45.498 --> 00:10:48.634
"To Seok Jin, Sinsa-dong Mudfish".

302
00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:50.036
"Fishing..."

303
00:10:50.469 --> 00:10:51.737
- You want me to go fishing? - Yes.

304
00:10:52.004 --> 00:10:53.739
- I hate fishing. - What's wrong with him?

305
00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:55.841
- I know that he hates fishing. - Hey.

306
00:10:55.841 --> 00:10:57.877
There are tons of fish at Noryangjin Market.

307
00:10:57.877 --> 00:10:59.211
- You should go fishing. - As soon as I heard it,

308
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:02.248
- I started yawning. - "Go fishing. Catch fresh seafood."

309
00:11:02.315 --> 00:11:05.184
- "Cook seafood ramyeon." - That's right.

310
00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:06.819
And this is his favorite part.

311
00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:09.455
This is the best part of it.

312
00:11:09.822 --> 00:11:12.325
"Lie down as you look up to the sky and hum."

313
00:11:12.358 --> 00:11:15.061
It's a description of a mad man.

314
00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:17.129
- Hey. - "Look up the sky"?

315
00:11:17.129 --> 00:11:18.597
- Are you in your right mind? - This is what I'm talking about.

316
00:11:18.597 --> 00:11:20.266
- He likes lying down. - That's true.

317
00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:22.635
When he lies down, he starts humming.

318
00:11:22.635 --> 00:11:23.636
(It's a personalized vacation for him.)

319
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.605
- Who knows? Kwang Soo... - All right.

320
00:11:26.672 --> 00:11:29.408
I gave her a good one. Right before the shoot, she told me...

321
00:11:29.408 --> 00:11:30.643
that she didn't want to do anything.

322
00:11:30.643 --> 00:11:31.644
- Hey, read yours. - Shall we hear yours?

323
00:11:31.644 --> 00:11:33.512
"To So Min".

324
00:11:33.512 --> 00:11:36.983
"So Min, you always talk and chat like a parrot relentlessly."

325
00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:39.085
- That sounds affectionate. - "I bet it's hard to always talk."

326
00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:41.687
"So I found the perfect vacation for you to relax."

327
00:11:41.687 --> 00:11:43.856
- This sounds caring. - "It's temple stay."

328
00:11:44.156 --> 00:11:45.958
- That's nice. - Temple stay.

329
00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.360
"Get yourself sorted out there."

330
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.761
- "Try the practice of silence." - She can go to the temple.

331
00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:50.162
- That would be so hard for her. - "And declutter..."

332
00:11:50.162 --> 00:11:51.364
- "your mind." - That will be so frustrating.

333
00:11:51.364 --> 00:11:53.632
The letter just sounds caring,

334
00:11:53.833 --> 00:11:55.935
but in the end, he told her to be quiet.

335
00:11:55.935 --> 00:11:57.269
(The letter sounds caring, but in the end, he told her to be quiet.)

336
00:11:58.471 --> 00:12:01.273
I guess two of our female members will be very quiet.

337
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.310
- That's right. - One of them will be sleeping.

338
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.613
- So Min wrote this letter. - I can't wait to hear this one.

339
00:12:07.613 --> 00:12:09.015
"To Kwang Soo".

340
00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:10.483
"Kwang Soo, you're working hard."

341
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.120
"I heard prawns are in season now."

342
00:12:14.687 --> 00:12:16.022
He's going to catch prawns.

343
00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:18.190
- You're making him catch prawns. - "I saw..."

344
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:21.894
"I saw that you really enjoyed eating shrimps in Indonesia."

345
00:12:22.762 --> 00:12:25.264
"People are picking pen shells in the mudflat near the West Sea."

346
00:12:25.731 --> 00:12:27.266
"Pick a lot of pen shells."

347
00:12:27.533 --> 00:12:29.201
"And prawns and their shells are great for your joints."

348
00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:31.637
"I hope you can enjoy your vacation as you eat the heads too."

349
00:12:31.637 --> 00:12:32.972
- You have to eat the heads too. - What is he doing?

350
00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:35.107
We'll get to see the mudflat. It's been a while.

351
00:12:35.107 --> 00:12:36.442
He has to pick prawns.

352
00:12:36.542 --> 00:12:38.377
She wants me to go to the mudflat and pick pen shells?

353
00:12:38.377 --> 00:12:42.214
When you sprinkle the salt, they come up. You can pick them then.

354
00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:44.283
Anyway, he can do that. I'm glad mine is great.

355
00:12:44.283 --> 00:12:46.419
- Everyone will be on their own? - Will we be by ourselves?

356
00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:48.687
- Put recommended vacation spots... - This is great.

357
00:12:48.687 --> 00:12:50.589
back into the envelopes and hand over them to me.

358
00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:51.957
You're not going to mix these letters, right?

359
00:12:51.957 --> 00:12:53.292
I've never gotten such a good one.

360
00:12:53.292 --> 00:12:54.727
I just got the chills.

361
00:12:55.394 --> 00:12:56.762
- Se Chan. - Am I right?

362
00:12:57.229 --> 00:12:59.098
- Why? - No way. They wouldn't do that.

363
00:12:59.098 --> 00:13:00.232
- What is it? - What is it?

364
00:13:00.332 --> 00:13:02.835
- They might mix those. - Can I eat temple food there?

365
00:13:02.935 --> 00:13:04.603
- We might pick one of those? - But...

366
00:13:04.603 --> 00:13:05.771
- what if Jong Kook... - If we do pick one...

367
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:07.807
What if Jong Kook picks the one with ramyeon buffet?

368
00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:09.975
- That's feasible. - I really want to eat...

369
00:13:09.975 --> 00:13:11.043
- ramyeon. - That's right.

370
00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:13.379
If I do choose the ramyeon buffet, I'm doomed.

371
00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:15.848
- This is good. Let's go! - It's a penalty for him.

372
00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:17.183
Ramyeon buffet.

373
00:13:17.183 --> 00:13:19.752
Now, I will...

374
00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:21.687
tell you the rules of Do Whatever You Want, the fall vacation...

375
00:13:21.687 --> 00:13:24.457
- for our Running Man's members. - What is it?

376
00:13:24.623 --> 00:13:27.026
There are eight vacation spots that you recommended for each other.

377
00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:30.830
(There are 8 vacation spots that you recommended for each other.)

378
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.334
Those are the vacation spots that all of you will...

379
00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:38.971
- enjoy together. - I knew it.

380
00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:41.273
- Didn't I tell you? - It was for the member next to me.

381
00:13:41.273 --> 00:13:42.808
You said it was for the member sitting next to me.

382
00:13:43.008 --> 00:13:46.846
Among these 8 vacation spots, you will draw 5 randomly.

383
00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:49.315
(They will draw 5 vacation spots randomly.)

384
00:13:49.315 --> 00:13:50.783
- This is crazy. - We're in trouble.

385
00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:53.052
- What if we get the waxing? - Waxing? You little...

386
00:13:53.085 --> 00:13:55.221
- Kwang Soo. - I didn't know we all would get it.

387
00:13:55.821 --> 00:13:57.323
I don't like learning how to swing dance too.

388
00:13:58.257 --> 00:14:00.860
You will have only eight hours to finish them.

389
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.361
(They only have 8 hours for their vacation.)

390
00:14:02.628 --> 00:14:04.730
Within the given time, you can enjoy...

391
00:14:05.064 --> 00:14:08.534
your vacation with the budget of 1,000 dollars.

392
00:14:08.534 --> 00:14:10.903
- 1,000 dollars? - The sleeping cafe will be great.

393
00:14:10.903 --> 00:14:12.505
That'd be awesome. We can eat everything there.

394
00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:17.209
However, if you fail to enjoy five of your vacations in time...

395
00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:19.979
or if you fail to spend all of the budget,

396
00:14:20.346 --> 00:14:23.482
you must come up with 1,000 dollars and return the money to us.

397
00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:26.152
(If they fail, they must return 1,000 dollars to the crew.)

398
00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:27.686
We have to use up the money.

399
00:14:27.686 --> 00:14:29.054
1,000 dollars won't be hard.

400
00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:32.558
We have chance cards that will help you maximize your experience.

401
00:14:32.558 --> 00:14:34.093
- What are those? - Please discuss among yourselves.

402
00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:36.095
- And use them at critical moments. - We have chance cards?

403
00:14:36.795 --> 00:14:38.264
We have the dividing card.

404
00:14:38.631 --> 00:14:39.632
- Dividing card? - What is that?

405
00:14:39.632 --> 00:14:42.935
8 of you can split into 2, and go to 2 vacation spots simultaneously.

406
00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:44.203
(They can go to 2 vacation spots at once.)

407
00:14:44.203 --> 00:14:45.871
We also have the deleting card.

408
00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:48.073
- That's nice. - This is the best one.

409
00:14:48.107 --> 00:14:49.909
And another one is the recommendation card.

410
00:14:49.909 --> 00:14:52.945
You can call your acquaintance and change the vacation spot.

411
00:14:52.945 --> 00:14:54.013
(Recommendation card)

412
00:14:54.346 --> 00:14:56.415
And you have the dud card.

413
00:14:56.415 --> 00:14:57.416
(They won't get anything from it.)

414
00:14:57.416 --> 00:14:58.617
We'll get nothing from that.

415
00:14:58.751 --> 00:15:01.020
- Choose one. - Okay. I'll get us a good one.

416
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.289
(Kwang Soo will choose the first vacation spot.)

417
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:04.390
Kwang Soo's choosing.

418
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.958
(Waxing, swing dance, sleeping cafe, picking sweet potatoes,)

419
00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.626
(ramyeon buffet, temple stay, fishing, and catching shrimps)

420
00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:10.162
- We never know... - I chose the middle one.

421
00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:12.064
I rather go fishing.

422
00:15:13.032 --> 00:15:14.934
Look at his face. Goodness.

423
00:15:15.034 --> 00:15:16.101
- I guess it's a bad one. - What is it?

424
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:17.703
- I knew you'd pick a bad one. - Is it waxing?

425
00:15:17.703 --> 00:15:18.938
Is it really waxing?

426
00:15:18.938 --> 00:15:20.005
- What is it? - What is it?

427
00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:22.107
Sweet potatoes...

428
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.143
(It's picking sweet potatoes.)

429
00:15:24.143 --> 00:15:25.144
Sweet potatoes.

430
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:27.379
Goodness, what's wrong with that guy?

431
00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:29.114
We have to pick them from the field.

432
00:15:31.016 --> 00:15:32.785
- Se Chan, choose one. - Can I?

433
00:15:32.885 --> 00:15:34.286
You picked the sweet potatoes.

434
00:15:34.286 --> 00:15:36.188
- The five vacation spots... - Get the sleeping cafe or buffet.

435
00:15:36.322 --> 00:15:38.557
- Just don't get the waxing. - Don't pick the waxing.

436
00:15:38.557 --> 00:15:40.426
(Please let's just make sure we don't get waxing.)

437
00:15:41.427 --> 00:15:42.795
- Hey, what is it? - Make sure it's not waxing.

438
00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:44.096
You can't choose waxing.

439
00:15:44.897 --> 00:15:46.665
(As he sighs, he sinks his head.)

440
00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:49.368
(What is the vacation spot Se Chan has chosen?)

441
00:15:49.368 --> 00:15:51.904
I'm sorry. My name is on this letter.

442
00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:54.006
- What is it? - Is it the swing dance?

443
00:15:54.006 --> 00:15:55.341
No, it's waxing.

444
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:56.842
(His name implies that they have a chance to get waxing.)

445
00:15:56.842 --> 00:15:58.244
(We have to get our hair waxed together?)

446
00:15:58.244 --> 00:15:59.311
Seriously?

447
00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:01.380
- All of us have to do it. - How could you pick that one?

448
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.016
How could you pick that one? And why did you write that?

449
00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:05.884
I don't have any hair to shave.

450
00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:08.387
Let's use the chance for the waxing.

451
00:16:08.387 --> 00:16:10.990
I have the perfect amount of hair right now.

452
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.292
(The one who recommended waxing committed the biggest crime.)

453
00:16:13.359 --> 00:16:14.360
Exactly.

454
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.262
Once you start waxing, you have to get it regularly.

455
00:16:16.262 --> 00:16:17.896
- What's the third one? - Let's use the chance card.

456
00:16:17.896 --> 00:16:19.031
It's not that...

457
00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:21.200
Why did you do that?

458
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.268
What is it?

459
00:16:22.268 --> 00:16:23.802
(Did Ji Hyo pick a bad vacation spot too?)

460
00:16:23.802 --> 00:16:24.870
- Ji Hyo, what is it? - Ji Hyo.

461
00:16:25.137 --> 00:16:26.672
- It's Haha's. - I'm sorry, Haha.

462
00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:28.107
- Is it the swing dance? - It's the swing dance.

463
00:16:28.107 --> 00:16:29.375
(It's the swing dance.)

464
00:16:29.975 --> 00:16:31.744
- This episode won't be any fun. - Goodness.

465
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:33.345
Jong Kook.

466
00:16:33.345 --> 00:16:35.948
- Goodness. - I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

467
00:16:36.248 --> 00:16:37.783
Let me pick one myself.

468
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.918
We've picked the worst options so far.

469
00:16:39.918 --> 00:16:41.587
- Exactly. - We have the worst ones.

470
00:16:41.587 --> 00:16:43.222
- Gosh. - It's the fourth choice.

471
00:16:43.222 --> 00:16:44.490
Waxing is too much.

472
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.025
- I'll make sure to pick ramyeon. - Okay.

473
00:16:46.025 --> 00:16:47.793
- Please. - Ramyeon.

474
00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:50.129
- Please. - We need at least one good place.

475
00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:53.132
(He reacts loudly after checking his choice.)

476
00:16:53.132 --> 00:16:54.199
- What is it? - Is it ramyeon?

477
00:16:55.567 --> 00:16:56.568
- What is it? - Is it ramyeon?

478
00:16:56.568 --> 00:16:57.670
It's ramyeon buffet!

479
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.171
(Jae Seok chose the ramyeon buffet.)

480
00:16:59.171 --> 00:17:01.507
- Yes! - Nice.

481
00:17:01.507 --> 00:17:04.410
- Respect. - Good job.

482
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.711
- It's your turn now. - Respect!

483
00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:07.746
- We respect Jae Seok. - Respect.

484
00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:09.748
Let's go have some ramyeon.

485
00:17:09.748 --> 00:17:11.116
- He's Superman. - I chose ramyeon.

486
00:17:11.317 --> 00:17:13.919
- Thank goodness I picked this. - Goodness.

487
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:16.288
- It's like the oasis in a desert. - But Jong Kook doesn't like it.

488
00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:18.691
What else do we have left? She shouldn't pick prawn fishing.

489
00:17:18.691 --> 00:17:20.959
- It's vow of silence, right? - Are we going to ride a boat?

490
00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:22.528
- What is it? - What should we do?

491
00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:23.962
- What is it? - So it's prawn fishing.

492
00:17:23.962 --> 00:17:25.297
(What's their last vacation spot?)

493
00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:28.067
It's Sinsa-dong Mudfish, fishing.

494
00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:30.002
(She has picked fishing.)

495
00:17:30.002 --> 00:17:31.637
- How are we supposed to... - It's fishing?

496
00:17:31.637 --> 00:17:32.871
- It's fishing? - Yes.

497
00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:35.374
Do we have to have ramyeon again?

498
00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:37.843
- You wrote that. - We have ramyeon buffet too.

499
00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:39.778
- Let's go have some ramyeon first. - Good.

500
00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:44.183
Please decide the order first before you start your vacation.

501
00:17:44.183 --> 00:17:45.851
- Let's eat first. - Ramyeon.

502
00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:47.319
Let's make waxing the last to do.

503
00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:49.822
Let's use the chance card to get rid of it later.

504
00:17:49.822 --> 00:17:51.590
- Let's get rid of it from the list. - Put the strange ones at the back.

505
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.225
That waxing is the worst to be honest.

506
00:17:53.225 --> 00:17:55.327
- Right. - Why did you write that?

507
00:17:55.327 --> 00:17:56.495
Let's go to the sweet potato farm first.

508
00:17:56.495 --> 00:17:57.796
- Good idea. - All right.

509
00:17:57.796 --> 00:18:00.933
Let's do a physical activity first and go to fill ourselves.

510
00:18:00.933 --> 00:18:03.035
- Then the fishing. - Let's go fishing after.

511
00:18:03.035 --> 00:18:05.471
Let's cross out swing dance and waxing from the list later on.

512
00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:07.439
- We'll go pick sweet potatoes. - Right.

513
00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:10.008
I'll search if there's any sweet potato farm in Incheon.

514
00:18:10.008 --> 00:18:13.178
We'll help you find available places if you can't.

515
00:18:13.178 --> 00:18:15.981
- Will there be any? - It should be located around here.

516
00:18:15.981 --> 00:18:18.417
There's a farm that provides picking experiences for people.

517
00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:20.185
- A sweet potato farm in Incheon. - I found one too.

518
00:18:20.486 --> 00:18:22.321
- Where is it located? - It should be somewhere near here.

519
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:24.289
They aren't answering. Hello?

520
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.192
- Hello? - Is it the sweet potato farm?

521
00:18:27.659 --> 00:18:29.962
- Yes. - Are you open today?

522
00:18:29.962 --> 00:18:31.830
- From 1pm today. - From 1pm?

523
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.732
- Can we pick sweet potatoes? - It's too late.

524
00:18:33.732 --> 00:18:34.933
- We should change schedule then. - Yes.

525
00:18:34.933 --> 00:18:36.935
- We'll call you later. - Thank you.

526
00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:38.103
- We have to use the GPS. - Bye.

527
00:18:38.103 --> 00:18:40.339
But this place is open from 1pm. What time is it now?

528
00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:41.473
- It's 10am. - That's...

529
00:18:41.473 --> 00:18:42.674
- It's too late then. - We need to go right now.

530
00:18:42.674 --> 00:18:45.411
And the sun will be high up in the sky around 1pm.

531
00:18:45.411 --> 00:18:46.545
- It'll be hot. - It'll be extremely hot.

532
00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:48.080
- We might get sunstroke. - It's better in the morning.

533
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.314
- I'll try calling them. - Try it.

534
00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:50.949
Kwang Soo, try it.

535
00:18:50.949 --> 00:18:52.251
(He tries calling another farm.)

536
00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:53.786
You won't be able to host the wedding. Are you okay with that?

537
00:18:53.852 --> 00:18:55.020
What?

538
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.755
- Can you tell them? - Sure.

539
00:18:58.457 --> 00:18:59.525
The music.

540
00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:01.093
The music is nice.

541
00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:02.594
(She starts dancing.)

542
00:19:02.594 --> 00:19:03.962
It goes well with the farm.

543
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.498
Goodness.

544
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.501
(They're impossible.)

545
00:19:10.969 --> 00:19:12.070
Hello?

546
00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:16.241
- Is this the sweet potato farm? - Yes.

547
00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:18.844
- Are you open today? - Yes.

548
00:19:19.178 --> 00:19:20.746
- From what time? - Ask him if we can go now.

549
00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:22.714
From what time are you open?

550
00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:25.784
We're open from the morning.

551
00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:28.053
Can we go right now?

552
00:19:28.053 --> 00:19:29.421
Ask him if it's okay to shoot there.

553
00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:31.356
- Tell him we're Running Man. - Is it okay...

554
00:19:31.356 --> 00:19:33.926
Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo of Running Man.

555
00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:36.662
(The owner stays silent.)

556
00:19:37.463 --> 00:19:39.198
It seems like he doesn't know who Kwang Soo is.

557
00:19:39.298 --> 00:19:40.866
I don't think he knows you.

558
00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:43.001
Hold on. I'll let you talk to the famous person.

559
00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:45.437
Kwang Soo, you better work harder.

560
00:19:45.437 --> 00:19:48.707
Hello, sir. I'm Yu Jae Seok of Running Man.

561
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:50.876
Oh, hello.

562
00:19:50.876 --> 00:19:52.578
- See? He responded differently. - It's different.

563
00:19:52.578 --> 00:19:54.513
- He recognized Jae Seok right away. - Goodness.

564
00:19:54.646 --> 00:19:57.683
We're filming the show at the moment,

565
00:19:57.683 --> 00:20:00.986
and we have to find a farm in which we can pick sweet potatoes.

566
00:20:00.986 --> 00:20:03.055
Can we go with our filming crew?

567
00:20:03.288 --> 00:20:04.389
Yes, of course.

568
00:20:04.389 --> 00:20:07.292
Goodness, thank you. We'll head there right now then.

569
00:20:07.593 --> 00:20:09.628
- Okay, call me when you're here. - Okay.

570
00:20:09.628 --> 00:20:10.729
Thank you.

571
00:20:10.729 --> 00:20:11.763
Good.

572
00:20:11.763 --> 00:20:13.332
- We respect him. - He said okay right away.

573
00:20:13.332 --> 00:20:14.700
- Respect. - Goodness.

574
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.468
- Respect! - Respect.

575
00:20:16.468 --> 00:20:17.970
(Should I go pick sweet potatoes in Indonesia?)

576
00:20:19.872 --> 00:20:21.840
- Let's go. - Let's go.

577
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.176
- Get it. - Let's get it.

578
00:20:24.176 --> 00:20:26.578
- We'll pick sweet potatoes, right? - Yes.

579
00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:27.813
Let's get it.

580
00:20:28.614 --> 00:20:31.049
- I'm so excited to have ramyeon. - Me too.

581
00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:32.818
I didn't know there was a buffet for ramyeon.

582
00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:34.386
I might have ramyeon in a long time.

583
00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:35.621
- Really? - Jong Kook.

584
00:20:35.621 --> 00:20:38.190
I'll put chicken breast in your ramyeon.

585
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.258
(Will it be healthy food then?)

586
00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:42.194
So Min, I'd love that.

587
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:45.364
(They're excited to be on their relaxing vacation.)

588
00:20:45.364 --> 00:20:46.665
Join in.

589
00:20:48.867 --> 00:20:52.671
(We're on our vacation today.)

590
00:20:54.006 --> 00:20:57.409
By the way, waxing is too...

591
00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:58.610
Kwang Soo wrote that.

592
00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.112
(Who recommended waxing?)

593
00:21:00.112 --> 00:21:02.080
That's too much.

594
00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:04.449
Right. Or go do it alone.

595
00:21:04.449 --> 00:21:05.751
We can use the chance card later.

596
00:21:05.751 --> 00:21:08.153
- Get your body waxed. - Or we have to go together.

597
00:21:08.153 --> 00:21:09.454
- What? - Goodness.

598
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:11.323
We have to spend all 1,000 dollars.

599
00:21:11.323 --> 00:21:13.659
Shouldn't we buy a huge sack to put in sweet potatoes then?

600
00:21:13.659 --> 00:21:15.994
- Right. - We should pick a lot of them.

601
00:21:16.295 --> 00:21:18.463
We have to pick a lot of them.

602
00:21:19.698 --> 00:21:21.266
I'm so curious to know by the way.

603
00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:22.601
Why is this a relaxing vacation?

604
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:24.770
(He comes to wonder suddenly.)

605
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.572
- What is? - This.

606
00:21:26.572 --> 00:21:27.806
Why is this a vacation?

607
00:21:28.073 --> 00:21:30.509
I just don't get why she wrote that for me.

608
00:21:30.676 --> 00:21:33.011
What do you mean? I wrote it for you.

609
00:21:33.178 --> 00:21:34.646
Sweet potatoes...

610
00:21:35.113 --> 00:21:37.950
I did a good job in writing fishing.

611
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.586
Hey, it takes much time to catch fish.

612
00:21:40.586 --> 00:21:42.087
It's only a waste of time.

613
00:21:42.087 --> 00:21:44.923
- I'm a master of fishing. - What are you talking about?

614
00:21:44.923 --> 00:21:47.593
Don't lie, Jae Seok.

615
00:21:47.593 --> 00:21:49.227
I'm like a fisherman.

616
00:21:49.995 --> 00:21:51.663
They call me a fisherman in the field.

617
00:21:51.663 --> 00:21:55.734
When we went to fishing, everyone caught fish except for you.

618
00:21:56.935 --> 00:21:59.705
(3 years ago)

619
00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:06.578
(The members caught big fish here and there.)

620
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.381
(Reeling)

621
00:22:09.381 --> 00:22:12.384
(He failed to catch fish alone.)

622
00:22:12.384 --> 00:22:14.319
(Jae Seok was the only one who couldn't catch anything.)

623
00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:17.489
When will I get to catch something?

624
00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:20.759
I'll show you this time.

625
00:22:20.926 --> 00:22:23.295
I'll show you what fishing is.

626
00:22:23.295 --> 00:22:25.864
- Shall we bring it on today? - Goodness.

627
00:22:25.998 --> 00:22:30.102
I'll show you the difference between an amateur and an expert.

628
00:22:30.102 --> 00:22:32.404
If you fail to catch at least one, you will get somewhere waxed.

629
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:34.306
- Deal? - Goodness.

630
00:22:34.306 --> 00:22:36.942
Then it'll become a penalty. Let's go first and talk later.

631
00:22:36.942 --> 00:22:38.176
Why are you stepping back?

632
00:22:38.944 --> 00:22:41.046
- Are you not confident? - Why are you getting upset?

633
00:22:41.847 --> 00:22:44.149
Goodness, get off.

634
00:22:45.017 --> 00:22:46.151
This isn't your car.

635
00:22:46.652 --> 00:22:48.420
- I'm driving, so get off. - This isn't your car.

636
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.956
It's not my car, but I'm driving this car, so get off.

637
00:22:50.956 --> 00:22:52.591
Let him off at the crossroad over there.

638
00:22:52.591 --> 00:22:54.326
- Right. - Drop him off there.

639
00:22:54.326 --> 00:22:56.795
Take a taxi and come to the farm.

640
00:22:56.795 --> 00:22:58.697
(They're on their way to the farm.)

641
00:22:59.998 --> 00:23:01.033
We're here.

642
00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:03.001
It feels like there's the sweet potato farm somewhere around here.

643
00:23:03.001 --> 00:23:04.469
- We're here. - Goodness.

644
00:23:04.536 --> 00:23:06.171
Here it is.

645
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:08.106
Let's pick sweet potatoes, and leave here quickly.

646
00:23:08.106 --> 00:23:09.641
Let's pick them quickly, and get some ramyeon.

647
00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:10.909
Let's not waste time here.

648
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:12.944
I've never picked sweet potatoes before.

649
00:23:13.278 --> 00:23:16.515
(Try our delicious sweet potatoes.)

650
00:23:16.515 --> 00:23:18.483
It's the first course of your vacation.

651
00:23:18.617 --> 00:23:21.153
It's what Ji Hyo recommends to Jong Kook.

652
00:23:21.153 --> 00:23:22.621
(The first course is the sweet potato farm.)

653
00:23:22.621 --> 00:23:25.123
Before you start enjoying your vacation, there's one announcement.

654
00:23:25.157 --> 00:23:27.025
Please come in.

655
00:23:27.025 --> 00:23:28.427
- What? - What's coming in?

656
00:23:28.493 --> 00:23:30.495
Perhaps, we have to choose tools.

657
00:23:30.595 --> 00:23:32.597
- No way. - No way.

658
00:23:32.597 --> 00:23:36.334
(They're getting suspicious.)

659
00:23:37.569 --> 00:23:38.937
Gosh, it's a roulette again.

660
00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:40.305
It's a roulette.

661
00:23:40.372 --> 00:23:42.240
- Is it a roulette again? - What is it?

662
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.276
(They have a bad feeling about this.)

663
00:23:44.943 --> 00:23:47.312
- What is this? - "Company credit card".

664
00:23:47.312 --> 00:23:48.613
- What is this? - We might have to pay for this.

665
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.415
- We might have to pay for this. - Goodness.

666
00:23:50.415 --> 00:23:52.517
You told us to use the 1,000 dollars. What is this now?

667
00:23:52.517 --> 00:23:55.921
(What is this suspicious roulette for?)

668
00:23:55.954 --> 00:23:56.988
All right, guys.

669
00:23:56.988 --> 00:24:01.093
You have to use up 1,000 dollars throughout the five courses.

670
00:24:01.326 --> 00:24:05.330
The roulette is fairly divided by your names and the company card.

671
00:24:05.497 --> 00:24:07.666
After you finish enjoying each course, you'll spin the roulette,

672
00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:10.469
and the chosen person will pay for the expenses.

673
00:24:10.469 --> 00:24:11.770
(They'll spin the roulette to decide whom will pay for each course.)

674
00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.105
- I mean... - What is this?

675
00:24:13.105 --> 00:24:15.173
I thought we were going to have a relaxing vacation.

676
00:24:15.173 --> 00:24:16.241
Isn't this a vacation?

677
00:24:16.241 --> 00:24:19.144
If you don't wish to spin the roulette,

678
00:24:19.144 --> 00:24:20.912
- do you see the box over there? - Yes.

679
00:24:20.912 --> 00:24:22.380
It's the golden bell box.

680
00:24:22.914 --> 00:24:25.283
(Golden bell box)

681
00:24:25.283 --> 00:24:28.620
Until you fill this sack with sweet potatoes,

682
00:24:28.854 --> 00:24:32.124
vote for one member whom you want to pay for the course.

683
00:24:32.124 --> 00:24:36.628
(They'll write a member's name in secret and put it in the box.)

684
00:24:36.628 --> 00:24:39.698
- In secret? - Any kind of paper is fine.

685
00:24:39.698 --> 00:24:41.299
Write someone's name on a piece of paper and put it in the box.

686
00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:43.502
That person will pay for the course.

687
00:24:43.502 --> 00:24:44.770
If there are several pieces of paper inside the box...

688
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.839
That's why I was given a pen.

689
00:24:48.106 --> 00:24:49.541
If it's one person, will that person pay for the course?

690
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:51.510
That's right. If there are several papers,

691
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.445
we'll draw one among them.

692
00:24:53.445 --> 00:24:55.747
Let's just go for the company card.

693
00:24:55.747 --> 00:24:57.482
- Right, let's hold hands. - The company card.

694
00:24:57.482 --> 00:24:58.784
Right? Let's not write names.

695
00:24:58.784 --> 00:25:00.252
Why are you trying to write a name already?

696
00:25:00.252 --> 00:25:01.486
I just want to ask a question.

697
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.088
Is it okay to write a name on here?

698
00:25:03.155 --> 00:25:04.856
- Don't do this. - Let's not write names.

699
00:25:04.856 --> 00:25:06.892
Let's go for the company card.

700
00:25:06.925 --> 00:25:08.460
Let's spin the roulette.

701
00:25:08.593 --> 00:25:11.229
We'll leave the roulette and the box here.

702
00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:13.532
Enjoy picking sweet potatoes.

703
00:25:13.899 --> 00:25:15.033
(They shouldn't vote for anyone if they want to use the company card.)

704
00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:16.868
- Let's go pick sweet potatoes. - Right.

705
00:25:16.868 --> 00:25:19.938
We're going to the ramyeon buffet, so we shouldn't waste time here.

706
00:25:19.938 --> 00:25:21.139
- Right. - Okay.

707
00:25:21.306 --> 00:25:22.307
Let's go.

708
00:25:22.808 --> 00:25:24.643
- Where do we get the tools? - We should eat ramyeon.

709
00:25:25.177 --> 00:25:26.411
So Min.

710
00:25:26.478 --> 00:25:27.813
- Goodness. - What are you doing?

711
00:25:27.813 --> 00:25:28.914
It's nothing.

712
00:25:28.914 --> 00:25:30.248
You guys are too much.

713
00:25:30.248 --> 00:25:34.953
(Who will get to pay for the first course?)

714
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.988
- We're running out of time. - That's right.

715
00:25:37.088 --> 00:25:38.857
We don't have much time.

716
00:25:39.424 --> 00:25:41.026
Where should I dig? Here?

717
00:25:41.159 --> 00:25:43.028
All right, guys. Look here.

718
00:25:43.328 --> 00:25:44.329
You guys...

719
00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:46.198
haven't picked sweet potatoes before, right?

720
00:25:46.364 --> 00:25:48.233
Have you?

721
00:25:48.533 --> 00:25:49.634
Have you?

722
00:25:49.634 --> 00:25:52.704
I'm experienced with everything.

723
00:25:52.704 --> 00:25:54.873
I'm the master of fishing and picking sweet potatoes.

724
00:25:55.006 --> 00:25:57.275
About 10 years ago from now...

725
00:25:57.275 --> 00:25:59.511
Stop talking nonsense and just pick sweet potatoes.

726
00:25:59.611 --> 00:26:00.679
Well...

727
00:26:01.213 --> 00:26:03.114
Ji Hyo!

728
00:26:03.515 --> 00:26:05.250
- There are so many here. - Where?

729
00:26:05.617 --> 00:26:06.685
It's nice here.

730
00:26:07.185 --> 00:26:08.854
(They have found a place with a lot of sweet potatoes.)

731
00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:10.722
Se Chan, you're no joke.

732
00:26:10.989 --> 00:26:12.157
Ji Hyo.

733
00:26:16.394 --> 00:26:18.864
Check this out. It's long just like Kwang Soo.

734
00:26:19.064 --> 00:26:20.832
- Come on. - It looks like Kwang Soo.

735
00:26:20.832 --> 00:26:22.033
I don't look like that.

736
00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:24.169
You look exactly like this.

737
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.905
Check this out. It's like Seok Jin.

738
00:26:27.505 --> 00:26:28.740
It's like Seok Jin.

739
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.308
(Ta-da. Doesn't it look like Seok Jin?)

740
00:26:30.308 --> 00:26:32.244
What? How does that look like me?

741
00:26:32.244 --> 00:26:33.245
It sort of does.

742
00:26:33.745 --> 00:26:34.813
Look over here.

743
00:26:34.813 --> 00:26:36.481
(Their friendship grows through the experience.)

744
00:26:36.481 --> 00:26:38.083
Hey.

745
00:26:38.783 --> 00:26:41.119
Gosh, look at this.

746
00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:42.721
It's easy to dig them out.

747
00:26:43.188 --> 00:26:44.856
We're doing very well.

748
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.925
- This is great. - Isn't it?

749
00:26:46.925 --> 00:26:48.827
- There's a lot. - Dig here, Se Chan.

750
00:26:49.327 --> 00:26:50.328
I'll do it.

751
00:26:50.328 --> 00:26:52.063
(He volunteers to help.)

752
00:26:52.063 --> 00:26:53.632
I've done everything.

753
00:26:53.632 --> 00:26:55.800
- Dig over here. - We're doing very well.

754
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.068
(The sweet potato expert shows off.)

755
00:26:57.068 --> 00:26:59.037
- You're so good at shoveling. - I know.

756
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.172
Jae Seok is good at shoveling.

757
00:27:01.172 --> 00:27:04.209
I've done it for 10 years.

758
00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:05.810
(His talent is shoveling.)

759
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:10.181
(He conquers all sweet potato fields.)

760
00:27:10.181 --> 00:27:12.817
- There are no sweet potatoes. - Why not?

761
00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:14.352
There aren't any over here.

762
00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:15.954
- There aren't any. - Dig over here.

763
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:18.490
There aren't any where Jae Seok is digging.

764
00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.993
- I found some. - Where?

765
00:27:21.993 --> 00:27:25.497
(Is the expert finally showing off his skills?)

766
00:27:26.965 --> 00:27:28.867
(Screaming in joy)

767
00:27:28.867 --> 00:27:30.635
(That's tiny.)

768
00:27:30.635 --> 00:27:31.970
It's so small.

769
00:27:32.203 --> 00:27:34.906
(On the contrary, he finds a small sweet potato.)

770
00:27:34.906 --> 00:27:36.274
What's that, Jae Seok?

771
00:27:37.275 --> 00:27:40.078
I let them go because they're too small.

772
00:27:40.078 --> 00:27:41.079
(It's not worth it.)

773
00:27:41.947 --> 00:27:42.948
(The others find big ones.)

774
00:27:42.948 --> 00:27:44.649
- I got lucky. - Goodness.

775
00:27:45.483 --> 00:27:47.485
- They're here. It's so small. - I know.

776
00:27:48.386 --> 00:27:50.021
Look how small it is,

777
00:27:50.021 --> 00:27:51.890
but they found big ones.

778
00:27:52.057 --> 00:27:53.058
It's this small.

779
00:27:53.058 --> 00:27:54.859
(Look how small it is.)

780
00:27:54.859 --> 00:27:56.561
They're so small.

781
00:27:57.395 --> 00:27:58.930
Am I responsible for that?

782
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.367
No, but they found big ones over there.

783
00:28:02.367 --> 00:28:03.635
(He gets discouraged.)

784
00:28:04.069 --> 00:28:05.637
Why can't I find any here?

785
00:28:05.637 --> 00:28:07.973
- It's strange. - There aren't any.

786
00:28:08.206 --> 00:28:09.341
These are so small.

787
00:28:10.108 --> 00:28:11.142
Goodness.

788
00:28:11.142 --> 00:28:16.748
Guys, look at these. Jae Seok's are so tiny.

789
00:28:16.948 --> 00:28:19.684
So Min, be careful what you say.

790
00:28:20.318 --> 00:28:21.486
Be careful what you say.

791
00:28:21.853 --> 00:28:24.289
The sweet potatoes that Jae Seok found...

792
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:25.857
(Make yourself clear.)

793
00:28:26.257 --> 00:28:28.393
So Min, what are you saying?

794
00:28:28.393 --> 00:28:30.261
Jae Seok's are so tiny.

795
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:32.063
So Min!

796
00:28:32.931 --> 00:28:34.366
Are you out of your mind?

797
00:28:34.366 --> 00:28:35.367
(Speak accurately.)

798
00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:36.568
Hey.

799
00:28:37.002 --> 00:28:39.771
- These are big. - I feel so proud.

800
00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:42.007
There are only big ones.

801
00:28:42.007 --> 00:28:43.074
Let me see.

802
00:28:44.642 --> 00:28:46.311
(Why are they so small over here?)

803
00:28:46.311 --> 00:28:48.380
Why are the sweet potatoes so tiny?

804
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.283
(Why are they so small over here?)

805
00:28:52.283 --> 00:28:53.284
Look at this.

806
00:28:54.219 --> 00:28:55.220
Isn't it cute?

807
00:28:56.187 --> 00:28:57.355
Gosh, this is big.

808
00:28:59.057 --> 00:29:01.292
- Good ones are over here. - Right.

809
00:29:01.593 --> 00:29:02.894
Big ones are over here.

810
00:29:03.228 --> 00:29:05.764
I'm quite experienced with digging sweet potatoes.

811
00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:08.800
I'll show you my expertise in fishing.

812
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.068
I found more.

813
00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:11.836
I want to go somewhere.

814
00:29:11.836 --> 00:29:13.071
(Jae Seok dreams of traveling.)

815
00:29:14.439 --> 00:29:17.742
Based on what Ji Hyo wrote,

816
00:29:17.742 --> 00:29:20.345
you must steam the sweet potatoes.

817
00:29:20.478 --> 00:29:23.581
Steaming them takes 20 minutes. 1 of you should take some.

818
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:26.184
I'll take them now.

819
00:29:26.284 --> 00:29:27.552
- I'll do it. - I will.

820
00:29:27.552 --> 00:29:28.920
- I will. - No, I will.

821
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.555
I'll do it since I'm the youngest.

822
00:29:30.555 --> 00:29:32.524
- No, I should do it. - I will.

823
00:29:32.757 --> 00:29:36.928
As a sweet potato veteran, I'll take them.

824
00:29:36.928 --> 00:29:38.696
- I'll do it. - Do you have mythomania?

825
00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:41.032
Why do you say that you're good at everything?

826
00:29:41.032 --> 00:29:42.767
- Let's go. - This should be enough.

827
00:29:42.767 --> 00:29:45.437
- Let's go together. This is enough. - Okay, let's go.

828
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.172
- We'll be back. - See you soon.

829
00:29:51.443 --> 00:29:53.078
While I shovel,

830
00:29:53.078 --> 00:29:55.280
- What are you doing? - someone should pick them.

831
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.281
I'll pick them.

832
00:29:56.481 --> 00:29:58.083
Let's dig out big ones.

833
00:29:58.083 --> 00:29:59.384
(He struggles for 10 minutes.)

834
00:29:59.384 --> 00:30:01.653
- Seriously. - So Min, can you help me?

835
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:05.590
Gosh, look at these.

836
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.460
Hey, look how big they are.

837
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.861
Look over here.

838
00:30:10.762 --> 00:30:12.097
So Min.

839
00:30:12.597 --> 00:30:14.332
Didn't you ask me to pull it up?

840
00:30:14.866 --> 00:30:17.068
I've been struggling to...

841
00:30:17.068 --> 00:30:18.369
- take it off. - You asked to pull it up...

842
00:30:19.037 --> 00:30:20.171
because you like it.

843
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:21.172
(It looks like a diaper.)

844
00:30:21.573 --> 00:30:22.841
My goodness.

845
00:30:23.675 --> 00:30:26.444
Gosh, I'm getting angry.

846
00:30:27.445 --> 00:30:29.380
How does he find good ones?

847
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.349
Ji Hyo, look at this.

848
00:30:31.483 --> 00:30:33.184
- Gosh. - That's huge.

849
00:30:33.184 --> 00:30:34.953
(It's big like Jong Kook.)

850
00:30:35.353 --> 00:30:36.754
Look at them.

851
00:30:37.689 --> 00:30:39.791
There's another one here.

852
00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:41.659
It's a great exercise.

853
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.628
That's right, Jong Kook.

854
00:30:43.995 --> 00:30:45.463
(He finishes picking sweet potatoes.)

855
00:30:45.463 --> 00:30:47.665
Sweet potatoes are being steamed on the other side.

856
00:30:47.665 --> 00:30:48.933
You may go and eat them.

857
00:30:50.668 --> 00:30:51.669
Are they done?

858
00:30:52.203 --> 00:30:53.671
- Shall we open it? - It's been 20 minutes.

859
00:30:53.671 --> 00:30:55.473
- I can smell them. - They look delicious.

860
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.541
Let's see.

861
00:30:56.541 --> 00:30:58.676
(They look big and delicious.)

862
00:30:58.676 --> 00:31:00.578
- These look amazing. - They look delicious.

863
00:31:00.578 --> 00:31:02.213
- They're cooked. - They'd be good with milk.

864
00:31:02.213 --> 00:31:04.048
- Shall we eat them? - They're ready to eat.

865
00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:05.150
(He splits it open.)

866
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.051
- It's a pumpkin sweet potato. - It's golden.

867
00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:08.653
- Take a bite. - It's golden.

868
00:31:08.653 --> 00:31:10.221
- What color is it? - Be careful.

869
00:31:10.822 --> 00:31:12.090
Gosh, look at this.

870
00:31:12.657 --> 00:31:13.825
- How is it? - It's so good.

871
00:31:13.825 --> 00:31:16.094
It's not necessary to peel it.

872
00:31:16.327 --> 00:31:17.529
You can push out the inside.

873
00:31:18.329 --> 00:31:21.065
- It's very sweet. - Now is the perfect time to eat.

874
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.368
- It's delicious. - They'll still be good tomorrow.

875
00:31:23.368 --> 00:31:25.803
- Be careful of your hand. - We'll give you kimchi.

876
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.639
(Even its complementary dish kimchi is served.)

877
00:31:27.639 --> 00:31:29.207
Let's get it, let's get it.

878
00:31:29.207 --> 00:31:30.575
- Why are you being nice to us? - Get it.

879
00:31:30.575 --> 00:31:32.277
Look. Put it on top.

880
00:31:32.277 --> 00:31:34.646
That's exactly what I'm doing.

881
00:31:35.513 --> 00:31:36.648
I know what to do.

882
00:31:36.848 --> 00:31:37.949
That's right.

883
00:31:37.949 --> 00:31:39.317
Crunchy cucumber field?

884
00:31:39.817 --> 00:31:41.586
- Gosh. - I've never done this before.

885
00:31:41.586 --> 00:31:43.221
Ji Hyo, this was a great idea.

886
00:31:43.321 --> 00:31:44.556
It's therapeutic indeed.

887
00:31:44.556 --> 00:31:45.557
Isn't it great?

888
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.693
- You deserve respect, Ji Hyo. - A lot of respect.

889
00:31:48.693 --> 00:31:49.827
(Enjoy sweet potato picking this autumn.)

890
00:31:50.862 --> 00:31:53.932
The drinks you have here cost a dollar each.

891
00:31:53.932 --> 00:31:55.900
That's a good price.

892
00:31:55.967 --> 00:31:57.735
The total cost is 106 dollars.

893
00:31:57.735 --> 00:31:59.270
Running Man members deserve it.

894
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.638
It's 50 dollars' worth of sweet potatoes.

895
00:32:00.638 --> 00:32:02.173
Let's spend more.

896
00:32:02.173 --> 00:32:03.575
- Come on. - We have enough.

897
00:32:03.575 --> 00:32:04.909
What about our crew members?

898
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:05.910
(Let's spend a lot.)

899
00:32:07.445 --> 00:32:09.214
- Really? - My goodness.

900
00:32:09.214 --> 00:32:11.482
(He suddenly cares about the crew members.)

901
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:14.285
Here's a drink for each of you.

902
00:32:14.285 --> 00:32:16.454
It's because it's not his money.

903
00:32:16.454 --> 00:32:18.656
Does anyone want some Coke?

904
00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.958
Take it.

905
00:32:20.058 --> 00:32:22.160
He's acting like he's never met them before.

906
00:32:22.994 --> 00:32:25.463
It's okay as long as I don't pay.

907
00:32:25.463 --> 00:32:26.731
(He hopes he doesn't get picked.)

908
00:32:28.066 --> 00:32:31.369
(It's time to determine how they'll pay.)

909
00:32:31.369 --> 00:32:35.340
If there are no names inside the box,

910
00:32:35.573 --> 00:32:38.276
- Do we spin the roulette? - you'll spin the roulette.

911
00:32:38.376 --> 00:32:41.646
If there is a name in the box, that person will pay.

912
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.648
Here we go.

913
00:32:43.648 --> 00:32:44.649
Here I go.

914
00:32:45.183 --> 00:32:47.452
Let's not put anyone's name in it.

915
00:32:47.452 --> 00:32:49.220
- Let's trust each other. - Pay with the company card.

916
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.221
Right?

917
00:32:50.488 --> 00:32:51.656
Here I go.

918
00:32:53.825 --> 00:32:55.593
(There's something inside.)

919
00:32:55.593 --> 00:32:59.130
It won't be necessary to carry that heavy roulette today.

920
00:33:00.098 --> 00:33:03.067
I think a war is about to break.

921
00:33:04.168 --> 00:33:06.638
It's a sweet potato.

922
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:08.740
Is there a name on it?

923
00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.741
"Yu Jae Seok".

924
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:11.776
(The first candidate is Jae Seok.)

925
00:33:11.776 --> 00:33:13.544
Whoever wrote it should be ashamed.

926
00:33:14.445 --> 00:33:15.480
What is it?

927
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.181
What did you write?

928
00:33:18.249 --> 00:33:20.084
Does it look like Yu Jae Seok?

929
00:33:20.084 --> 00:33:21.085
Does it?

930
00:33:21.819 --> 00:33:22.920
We have to write it.

931
00:33:23.388 --> 00:33:25.089
- This is done. - Take it off.

932
00:33:25.089 --> 00:33:26.824
All right.

933
00:33:26.824 --> 00:33:28.526
Whoever wrote it should be ashamed.

934
00:33:29.027 --> 00:33:30.995
Gosh, it's written on a sweet potato.

935
00:33:31.696 --> 00:33:33.164
"Beloved Kim Jong Kook".

936
00:33:33.164 --> 00:33:36.200
(The second candidate is Jong Kook.)

937
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.538
It's the same handwriting as the letter to Jong Kook.

938
00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:43.541
- What? Let me see it. - What?

939
00:33:43.675 --> 00:33:45.209
It's the same handwriting.

940
00:33:45.943 --> 00:33:47.178
Was it Ji Hyo?

941
00:33:47.178 --> 00:33:48.980
It must be Ji Hyo.

942
00:33:50.982 --> 00:33:53.751
He'll know it's me if I refer to him as an older man.

943
00:33:55.486 --> 00:33:56.688
(She erases it.)

944
00:33:57.889 --> 00:34:01.959
I'd like Jong Kook to pay since I recommended this place.

945
00:34:01.959 --> 00:34:04.896
(Ji Hyo targets Jong Kook.)

946
00:34:05.997 --> 00:34:09.534
(Were you the one who wrote my name, Ji Hyo?)

947
00:34:09.534 --> 00:34:10.535
Okay.

948
00:34:12.303 --> 00:34:14.072
- "Lee Kwang Soo". - "Lee Kwang Soo".

949
00:34:14.172 --> 00:34:15.173
Me?

950
00:34:15.273 --> 00:34:17.675
- "Kim Jong Kook". - It's a variety of people.

951
00:34:17.675 --> 00:34:18.676
"Yu Jae Seok".

952
00:34:18.943 --> 00:34:20.545
He's picked twice.

953
00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:21.913
"Jeon So Min".

954
00:34:22.013 --> 00:34:23.047
There's So Min?

955
00:34:23.047 --> 00:34:24.782
Yes. Next is "Lee Kwang Soo".

956
00:34:24.782 --> 00:34:25.783
Is it me again?

957
00:34:25.983 --> 00:34:27.785
- That's right. - Why is it me?

958
00:34:27.819 --> 00:34:28.853
Is there one more?

959
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.422
- It's "Yu Jae Seok". - All right.

960
00:34:31.689 --> 00:34:32.890
Jae Seok has the most votes.

961
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:35.827
- Luckily, I'm not a candidate. - He's popular.

962
00:34:37.061 --> 00:34:39.731
- Kwang Soo got 2 votes. - 2 votes.

963
00:34:39.731 --> 00:34:41.566
I have 3 votes. Jong Kook has 2 votes.

964
00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:42.734
So Min has one vote.

965
00:34:42.967 --> 00:34:45.636
How many people put a name in the box?

966
00:34:45.636 --> 00:34:46.804
Eight people.

967
00:34:47.105 --> 00:34:48.940
- Did everyone write? - Everyone did.

968
00:34:49.374 --> 00:34:50.375
I didn't write any.

969
00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:52.110
(Jong Kook says that he didn't write any.)

970
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.078
It's not that. I'm sorry.

971
00:34:54.078 --> 00:34:57.048
- I thought I could write two names. - Who did you write?

972
00:34:57.048 --> 00:34:59.751
(Whose name did you write?)

973
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:03.020
- Do I have to tell you? - I didn't write any.

974
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.822
(Why is she looking at me?)

975
00:35:04.822 --> 00:35:06.958
There are two leaves.

976
00:35:07.024 --> 00:35:08.726
Shall I say whom I want to exclude?

977
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.528
Whose names did you write?

978
00:35:10.928 --> 00:35:13.965
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

979
00:35:14.165 --> 00:35:15.566
How dare you?

980
00:35:15.566 --> 00:35:17.235
- Did you write these? - So Min.

981
00:35:17.568 --> 00:35:18.903
- I didn't write them. - So Min.

982
00:35:18.903 --> 00:35:20.538
- Those aren't mine. - Did you write these?

983
00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:21.939
I'll take out the stone.

984
00:35:21.939 --> 00:35:22.940
(She takes out Kwang Soo's name.)

985
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.743
- Okay. - Look, I have three votes.

986
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.379
- I have 3 votes. - I only have 1 vote.

987
00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:31.416
3 votes for Jae Seok, 2 votes for Jong Kook.

988
00:35:31.449 --> 00:35:33.551
- Gosh, So Min. - 1 vote for So Min and Kwang Soo.

989
00:35:33.551 --> 00:35:34.585
Okay.

990
00:35:35.453 --> 00:35:37.255
The person with the most votes should pick.

991
00:35:37.288 --> 00:35:38.589
It'd be funny if you pick yourself.

992
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:40.825
- No. - You only get one chance.

993
00:35:40.892 --> 00:35:42.093
- You get one chance. - Really?

994
00:35:42.093 --> 00:35:43.394
Pick one right away.

995
00:35:43.394 --> 00:35:45.296
You might pick your own name.

996
00:35:45.296 --> 00:35:46.631
(Jae Seok has the highest probability.)

997
00:35:46.631 --> 00:35:50.568
(Who will pay for the costs at the sweet potato farm?)

998
00:35:50.568 --> 00:35:51.569
Here's the name.

999
00:35:53.171 --> 00:35:54.172
One.

1000
00:35:54.172 --> 00:35:58.376
(The total cost is 106 dollars.)

1001
00:35:58.376 --> 00:35:59.377
2, 3.

1002
00:35:59.377 --> 00:36:02.380
(Who will pay the vacation costs?)

1003
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.648
It's Kim Jong Kook.

1004
00:36:03.648 --> 00:36:06.484
(Jong Kook must pay.)

1005
00:36:06.484 --> 00:36:07.919
(He didn't get chosen.)

1006
00:36:08.486 --> 00:36:10.888
Why are you doing this to me?

1007
00:36:11.289 --> 00:36:14.692
Jong Kook said that the members deserve it.

1008
00:36:14.692 --> 00:36:16.894
- Right. - Thank you for the food.

1009
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:19.464
Thank you, Jong Kook.

1010
00:36:19.464 --> 00:36:21.098
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

1011
00:36:21.098 --> 00:36:23.568
All of us recognize this face.

1012
00:36:24.035 --> 00:36:26.137
He's going to start getting angry.

1013
00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:30.441
- Come on. - Anyang Hothead is coming soon.

1014
00:36:30.441 --> 00:36:32.343
Anyang Hothead.

1015
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.246
(Before Jong Kook gets angry, sweet potato digging is finished.)

1016
00:36:37.782 --> 00:36:39.851
Let's do a chance card lottery.

1017
00:36:39.851 --> 00:36:41.018
Ji Hyo, you pick one.

1018
00:36:41.018 --> 00:36:42.320
You should do it.

1019
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.788
Just pick one.

1020
00:36:44.322 --> 00:36:45.690
I hope we can divide into two groups.

1021
00:36:45.823 --> 00:36:46.891
Is it a dud?

1022
00:36:47.525 --> 00:36:48.759
- It's a dividing card! - It's a dividing card!

1023
00:36:48.759 --> 00:36:50.094
- A dividing card. - Unbelievable.

1024
00:36:50.094 --> 00:36:51.329
Respect.

1025
00:36:51.562 --> 00:36:53.097
Big respect.

1026
00:36:53.097 --> 00:36:56.267
One team will go fishing, and the other will take a dance class.

1027
00:36:56.467 --> 00:36:57.869
My goodness.

1028
00:36:57.869 --> 00:37:00.037
We'll leave the rest to chance.

1029
00:37:00.238 --> 00:37:01.405
It'll be chosen randomly.

1030
00:37:01.405 --> 00:37:02.440
All right.

1031
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.975
I bet Kwang Soo will be taking a swing dance class.

1032
00:37:03.975 --> 00:37:05.409
Two, three.

1033
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.113
(Swing dance, fishing, swing dance, fishing)

1034
00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:10.515
Let me see.

1035
00:37:10.781 --> 00:37:12.416
Kwang Soo will be taking a swing dance class.

1036
00:37:12.984 --> 00:37:14.151
Ji Hyo is taking a swing dance class.

1037
00:37:14.151 --> 00:37:16.954
- I'm a bad dancer. - It'll be so cringe worthy.

1038
00:37:16.954 --> 00:37:22.293
(They move to the second spot, expecting hardships.)

1039
00:37:23.494 --> 00:37:26.397
(Team Fishing, Team Swing Dance)

1040
00:37:26.397 --> 00:37:27.798
75 dollars is a lot.

1041
00:37:27.798 --> 00:37:29.400
Is that how much it usually costs?

1042
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.102
Dance classes are expensive.

1043
00:37:31.102 --> 00:37:32.169
I see.

1044
00:37:32.169 --> 00:37:33.371
Let's go for company card.

1045
00:37:33.638 --> 00:37:35.239
- That sounds good. - Promise me.

1046
00:37:35.239 --> 00:37:37.742
- Company card. - We have no choice.

1047
00:37:37.742 --> 00:37:38.843
Promise me.

1048
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.013
Put your hand here. Otherwise, you're not with us.

1049
00:37:42.013 --> 00:37:43.781
Let's shout, "Swing, swing, swing."

1050
00:37:43.781 --> 00:37:45.583
- Start. Swing, swing, swing. - Swing, swing, swing.

1051
00:37:45.583 --> 00:37:46.584
Okay.

1052
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.288
- What's with your expression? - What?

1053
00:37:50.288 --> 00:37:53.791
(What's that face?)

1054
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:56.327
Why were you smiling? Your eyes...

1055
00:37:58.296 --> 00:38:00.498
I'm not supposed to smile on a variety show?

1056
00:38:01.632 --> 00:38:04.602
- I can't believe this. - We're here to relax.

1057
00:38:05.002 --> 00:38:07.104
- Today's theme is relaxing. - I give up.

1058
00:38:07.438 --> 00:38:08.706
- Stop it. - I give up.

1059
00:38:08.706 --> 00:38:10.575
We have to go for company card.

1060
00:38:10.575 --> 00:38:12.109
(Will Team Swing Dance be all right?)

1061
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:13.377
We have to pay 400 dollars.

1062
00:38:14.145 --> 00:38:15.980
Not everyone has to catch one.

1063
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.981
No.

1064
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:18.482
As soon as we catch one,

1065
00:38:18.482 --> 00:38:21.185
- we'll make ramyeon. - We'll make ramyeon with it.

1066
00:38:21.352 --> 00:38:22.486
Wink at that car.

1067
00:38:22.486 --> 00:38:24.889
- Why? - It's a beat-up car.

1068
00:38:25.022 --> 00:38:27.191
Gosh, she's making us wink at a beat-up car again.

1069
00:38:27.525 --> 00:38:29.126
I already winked.

1070
00:38:29.126 --> 00:38:31.195
I winked without realizing.

1071
00:38:31.195 --> 00:38:32.797
Why do you wink?

1072
00:38:32.797 --> 00:38:34.365
- It brings good luck. - It does?

1073
00:38:34.365 --> 00:38:36.100
We'll catch big fish today.

1074
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.201
Really?

1075
00:38:37.201 --> 00:38:39.236
- We'll catch huge ones. - I winked too.

1076
00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:40.805
- Did you wink? - I did.

1077
00:38:40.972 --> 00:38:43.407
I have a good feeling.

1078
00:38:43.407 --> 00:38:45.343
(Team Fishing is feeling positive.)

1079
00:38:45.343 --> 00:38:48.412
- It's so blue. Look at the sea. - Look at that.

1080
00:38:49.347 --> 00:38:51.549
It's the ocean. The sea!

1081
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.952
- Look at that. - Look at that.

1082
00:38:54.952 --> 00:38:57.021
- This place is great. - It's nice here.

1083
00:38:57.021 --> 00:38:59.190
- I didn't think it'd be this nice. - It's so nice.

1084
00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.293
- So Min, it's nice, right? - Yes, it is.

1085
00:39:02.293 --> 00:39:04.762
- I'll teach you how to fish. - It's so nice.

1086
00:39:04.762 --> 00:39:06.564
Hold on, captain!

1087
00:39:06.697 --> 00:39:08.299
- Hello. - Where are you?

1088
00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:10.635
- I'm here. - Hello.

1089
00:39:10.635 --> 00:39:12.403
- It looks so luxurious. - Hello.

1090
00:39:12.403 --> 00:39:13.904
Nice to meet you.

1091
00:39:13.904 --> 00:39:15.473
Thank you for welcoming us on a holiday.

1092
00:39:15.673 --> 00:39:17.808
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1093
00:39:17.808 --> 00:39:19.744
- How much do we have to pay? - How much do we have to pay?

1094
00:39:20.144 --> 00:39:23.280
It's my own boat.

1095
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.649
So...

1096
00:39:24.649 --> 00:39:27.918
just pay me about 200 dollars for the fuel.

1097
00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:29.687
Thank you.

1098
00:39:29.687 --> 00:39:30.955
It's too cheap.

1099
00:39:30.955 --> 00:39:32.323
It's a holiday today.

1100
00:39:32.323 --> 00:39:34.558
- Be quiet. - We'll pay 300 dollars.

1101
00:39:34.725 --> 00:39:36.761
(That's not necessary.)

1102
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:39.263
- Think about it. - Let's do that.

1103
00:39:39.263 --> 00:39:42.033
We can pay with the company card.

1104
00:39:43.868 --> 00:39:46.070
(Right, we can pay with the company card.)

1105
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.439
Let us pay just 200 dollars.

1106
00:39:49.106 --> 00:39:51.175
200 dollars? That's just for the fuel.

1107
00:39:51.175 --> 00:39:52.610
We should pay him for his time too.

1108
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.111
He's working on a holiday.

1109
00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:55.780
- Let's pay 300 dollars. - We should pay 300 dollars.

1110
00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.782
- We'll pay 300 dollars. - Sure.

1111
00:39:58.082 --> 00:39:59.216
Thank you.

1112
00:39:59.216 --> 00:40:00.584
He asked us for 200 dollars.

1113
00:40:00.584 --> 00:40:02.920
- He needs some profits. - He's right.

1114
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.122
Don't write any names.

1115
00:40:05.122 --> 00:40:06.590
Of course. We'll pay with the company card.

1116
00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.758
Let's pay with the company card.

1117
00:40:07.758 --> 00:40:09.493
- Don't write any names. - We should pay him a bit more.

1118
00:40:09.493 --> 00:40:11.162
Let's do it that way.

1119
00:40:11.162 --> 00:40:12.396
It's nice. There's some shade too.

1120
00:40:12.396 --> 00:40:13.631
- It's nice. - Jae Seok.

1121
00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:16.867
- Show us. - Stop rolling your eyes, So Min.

1122
00:40:17.535 --> 00:40:18.536
(Will they spin the roulette?)

1123
00:40:18.536 --> 00:40:19.603
It's nice.

1124
00:40:19.904 --> 00:40:22.073
It's not so hard to catch webfoot octopuses.

1125
00:40:22.073 --> 00:40:23.607
I've caught some before.

1126
00:40:23.607 --> 00:40:25.576
I tried it five years ago.

1127
00:40:25.576 --> 00:40:27.478
- Webfoot octopuses? - You could catch one right away.

1128
00:40:27.645 --> 00:40:29.346
- I almost felt bad. - Hey.

1129
00:40:29.613 --> 00:40:31.215
If you're after webfoot octopuses, get on another boat.

1130
00:40:31.582 --> 00:40:35.052
This boat is for catching tuna.

1131
00:40:35.252 --> 00:40:36.854
- How is this a tuna boat? - What are you saying?

1132
00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:38.789
- It's for webfoot octopuses. - Look at my arms.

1133
00:40:39.056 --> 00:40:41.058
They're too nice for webfoot octopuses.

1134
00:40:41.325 --> 00:40:43.994
If you want tuna, Jong Kook can catch them with his fists.

1135
00:40:43.994 --> 00:40:47.465
(If you want tuna, Jong Kook can catch them with his fists.)

1136
00:40:47.465 --> 00:40:49.900
By the way,

1137
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.168
I'll put this here.

1138
00:40:51.168 --> 00:40:53.037
(The box gets on board too.)

1139
00:40:53.037 --> 00:40:55.306
- We don't need it. - We don't need it.

1140
00:40:55.606 --> 00:40:57.975
(You didn't hear? We don't need it.)

1141
00:40:57.975 --> 00:40:59.944
- We're not going to use it. - Put it away.

1142
00:41:00.077 --> 00:41:01.879
We decided to be nice.

1143
00:41:01.879 --> 00:41:03.147
Let's stay this way to the end.

1144
00:41:03.147 --> 00:41:05.683
If you write someone's name now,

1145
00:41:06.317 --> 00:41:08.018
you're a jerk.

1146
00:41:08.219 --> 00:41:10.154
- Of course. - Let me tell you.

1147
00:41:10.154 --> 00:41:12.656
- After what you said... - Of course.

1148
00:41:12.656 --> 00:41:14.391
I won't forgive you.

1149
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:16.994
- I don't think he will. - Seriously.

1150
00:41:17.094 --> 00:41:19.964
I already start to feel sick.

1151
00:41:19.964 --> 00:41:21.799
- No way. - Are you nervous?

1152
00:41:21.799 --> 00:41:23.567
(The boat departs.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1153
00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:25.102
Look at the sea!

1154
00:41:25.102 --> 00:41:28.038
(They have been exhausted from all the missions and penalties.)

1155
00:41:28.038 --> 00:41:31.208
(The beautiful waves are relieving all their stress.)

1156
00:41:31.942 --> 00:41:35.980
(This is therapeutic.)

1157
00:41:36.781 --> 00:41:39.817
The sun on the waves looks beautiful.

1158
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:44.455
It looks so beautiful.

1159
00:41:44.955 --> 00:41:47.358
Saving it in my heart.

1160
00:41:47.358 --> 00:41:48.526
I'll do Se Ho's version.

1161
00:41:49.326 --> 00:41:52.196
(Saving it in my eyes)

1162
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.432
(Se Ho's version shocked everyone.)

1163
00:41:55.432 --> 00:41:57.301
What's with him?

1164
00:41:57.868 --> 00:42:00.304
Saving it in my eyes.

1165
00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:01.405
(Saving the view in my eyes)

1166
00:42:02.206 --> 00:42:04.341
(You guys look so happy.)

1167
00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:05.910
Stop it.

1168
00:42:07.678 --> 00:42:08.846
What is Jong Kook doing?

1169
00:42:09.213 --> 00:42:10.748
I'm getting all wet.

1170
00:42:10.748 --> 00:42:11.882
Me too.

1171
00:42:12.149 --> 00:42:14.018
- Look at this. - The water is spraying everywhere.

1172
00:42:14.418 --> 00:42:16.387
Come sit here.

1173
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.322
The waves are so strong.

1174
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.658
(Therapeutic, my foot.)

1175
00:42:20.658 --> 00:42:22.092
It's cold.

1176
00:42:22.092 --> 00:42:23.994
(They're getting sprayed by the waves.)

1177
00:42:23.994 --> 00:42:25.462
The waves are so strong.

1178
00:42:25.462 --> 00:42:27.865
(We're getting all wet.)

1179
00:42:27.865 --> 00:42:30.634
- It's cold. - I feel like I'm back in Indonesia.

1180
00:42:30.634 --> 00:42:31.669
(Memories of the Tiger Moth Tour)

1181
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.841
(It looks as if they're being penalized.)

1182
00:42:37.241 --> 00:42:38.375
You're so wet.

1183
00:42:38.676 --> 00:42:41.078
I'm soaked.

1184
00:42:44.615 --> 00:42:47.184
Wherever I go, it's never easy.

1185
00:42:48.118 --> 00:42:50.688
This is not what I was expecting.

1186
00:42:51.055 --> 00:42:52.857
I didn't expect this.

1187
00:42:52.857 --> 00:42:54.191
(I didn't know it'd be so tough.)

1188
00:42:55.459 --> 00:42:57.061
Help!

1189
00:42:57.528 --> 00:42:58.863
Help!

1190
00:42:59.797 --> 00:43:01.031
So Min, stay seated.

1191
00:43:01.031 --> 00:43:02.566
- Help! - Goodness.

1192
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.970
The sea is angry.

1193
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.171
I can't...

1194
00:43:07.438 --> 00:43:09.607
- stay here any longer. - My pants are all wet.

1195
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.342
We can't shoot in this situation.

1196
00:43:12.576 --> 00:43:14.078
Can we really shoot?

1197
00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:16.680
Sir, help!

1198
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.016
Help!

1199
00:43:19.283 --> 00:43:20.351
Sir!

1200
00:43:20.351 --> 00:43:21.886
We'll have webfoot octopuses next time.

1201
00:43:21.886 --> 00:43:23.854
(We'll just buy some.)

1202
00:43:24.622 --> 00:43:25.823
We're here.

1203
00:43:25.823 --> 00:43:27.191
We finally made it.

1204
00:43:27.391 --> 00:43:28.759
It's time to fish.

1205
00:43:29.293 --> 00:43:31.128
- You've tried this before, right? - Yes.

1206
00:43:31.428 --> 00:43:34.231
- If somethings bites it... - Do we put it into the water?

1207
00:43:34.231 --> 00:43:35.966
- Can we start? - Yes.

1208
00:43:35.966 --> 00:43:37.034
Can we put it into the water now?

1209
00:43:37.034 --> 00:43:38.335
It has to touch the bottom.

1210
00:43:38.335 --> 00:43:41.772
The bait is so nice. I'm sure we'll catch some.

1211
00:43:42.473 --> 00:43:44.008
- We'll catch something. - Good luck.

1212
00:43:44.008 --> 00:43:47.077
We'll definitely catch something.

1213
00:43:47.177 --> 00:43:48.646
We have to.

1214
00:43:48.646 --> 00:43:50.314
Let's do it.

1215
00:43:50.314 --> 00:43:52.383
- Let's catch something. - Who will catch one first?

1216
00:43:52.383 --> 00:43:54.618
I want to beat you guys.

1217
00:43:54.618 --> 00:43:56.820
She wants to beat us.

1218
00:43:57.154 --> 00:44:00.591
If I can beat Jong Kook, I'll win.

1219
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:02.559
(You wish.)

1220
00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:05.629
Let's try to catch fluke.

1221
00:44:06.096 --> 00:44:07.865
I'm a fluke expert.

1222
00:44:07.865 --> 00:44:09.934
That's absurd.

1223
00:44:10.768 --> 00:44:12.202
Gosh.

1224
00:44:12.202 --> 00:44:14.705
He denies everything I say.

1225
00:44:14.705 --> 00:44:16.140
(He denies everything I say.)

1226
00:44:16.273 --> 00:44:20.110
Just go to a sashimi place and eat some fluke.

1227
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:22.413
You're fishing at a nice place thanks to me.

1228
00:44:22.413 --> 00:44:24.682
Be quite and be grateful.

1229
00:44:25.149 --> 00:44:27.151
Just eat some seafood ramyeon later.

1230
00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:28.152
(The fishing king says to thank him.)

1231
00:44:28.152 --> 00:44:30.120
(I'll see how many you catch.)

1232
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.121
Okay.

1233
00:44:31.221 --> 00:44:33.223
Let me show you.

1234
00:44:33.223 --> 00:44:34.525
(Sea fishing starts.)

1235
00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.630
(Did something bite Seok Jin's bait?)

1236
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:42.866
All I'm getting is seaweed.

1237
00:44:42.866 --> 00:44:44.468
(He was fooled by seaweed.)

1238
00:44:45.502 --> 00:44:47.171
They're not interested in the shrimp.

1239
00:44:48.372 --> 00:44:55.112
(Time is ticking away.)

1240
00:44:55.112 --> 00:44:56.347
Take a bite.

1241
00:44:57.381 --> 00:44:58.682
I said, "Take a bite."

1242
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:02.920
(It's unbelievable quiet,)

1243
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.489
(and there isn't a single webfoot octopus in sight.)

1244
00:45:05.489 --> 00:45:06.590
It's so quiet.

1245
00:45:07.358 --> 00:45:09.126
The water is so calm.

1246
00:45:12.129 --> 00:45:13.831
Be confident.

1247
00:45:14.465 --> 00:45:15.799
We'll catch something.

1248
00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:17.201
I'm sure we will.

1249
00:45:17.768 --> 00:45:19.803
I'll show you guys.

1250
00:45:19.803 --> 00:45:21.338
(Which of the two will break the calm?)

1251
00:45:22.539 --> 00:45:24.074
Reel it in.

1252
00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:25.709
Reel it in.

1253
00:45:25.709 --> 00:45:27.511
Sir!

1254
00:45:27.578 --> 00:45:28.746
Sir!

1255
00:45:28.746 --> 00:45:31.215
(So Min calls the captain hurriedly.)

1256
00:45:32.182 --> 00:45:39.089
(Nothing has happened to Jae Seok and Jong Kook's baits yet.)

1257
00:45:39.089 --> 00:45:43.360
Something ate the bait and left.

1258
00:45:44.628 --> 00:45:47.698
You should have reeled the line in when something nibbled at the bait.

1259
00:45:47.698 --> 00:45:49.566
(It ate just the body of the shrimp.)

1260
00:45:49.566 --> 00:45:52.503
It just left the head of the shrimp.

1261
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.973
- It must have been a fluke. - It must have been a fluke.

1262
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.475
- Really? - You should have caught it.

1263
00:45:58.475 --> 00:46:00.377
- What a shame. - I didn't feel anything.

1264
00:46:00.544 --> 00:46:02.346
- It's a shame. - You didn't notice.

1265
00:46:02.346 --> 00:46:04.915
- It's very subtle. - So Min...

1266
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:06.850
is getting hooked on fishing.

1267
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.318
I'm a fishing queen.

1268
00:46:08.919 --> 00:46:10.954
(I'm a fishing queen.)

1269
00:46:10.954 --> 00:46:12.456
I'm a fishing queen.

1270
00:46:13.824 --> 00:46:15.125
It's fun.

1271
00:46:15.292 --> 00:46:17.761
- Fishing is fun. - It gets more and more fun.

1272
00:46:18.295 --> 00:46:20.931
Jae Seok is being so quiet.

1273
00:46:21.298 --> 00:46:23.901
Just wait and see.

1274
00:46:23.901 --> 00:46:26.070
He was so...

1275
00:46:27.171 --> 00:46:28.806
He was so confident.

1276
00:46:29.973 --> 00:46:32.309
Stop it. That's enough.

1277
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:34.011
(I will show you soon.)

1278
00:46:34.812 --> 00:46:37.214
- He talked big. - Seriously.

1279
00:46:37.448 --> 00:46:40.751
(So Min's fishing rod bends again while the other members quarrel.)

1280
00:46:41.051 --> 00:46:44.088
(This is real!)

1281
00:46:44.621 --> 00:46:50.694
(Is the novice fisher, So Min fated to catch fish?)

1282
00:46:50.694 --> 00:46:51.862
For goodness' sake.

1283
00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:55.399
It swam away when I felt the bite and reeled in.

1284
00:46:55.399 --> 00:46:58.235
(The head of shrimp is gone this time.)

1285
00:46:58.235 --> 00:47:00.337
- It ate the head this time. - It ate cleanly.

1286
00:47:00.737 --> 00:47:02.072
That's too bad.

1287
00:47:02.973 --> 00:47:04.341
How did it eat the head?

1288
00:47:04.341 --> 00:47:06.443
(Don't people usually feel the bite if fish finishes the bait?)

1289
00:47:06.877 --> 00:47:08.378
Did it eat the shrimp again?

1290
00:47:08.378 --> 00:47:09.513
(Did it eat the shrimp again?)

1291
00:47:10.914 --> 00:47:13.717
This is driving me crazy. When did this happen?

1292
00:47:13.817 --> 00:47:15.119
I didn't feel anything.

1293
00:47:15.486 --> 00:47:18.155
So Min, you became well-known among the flukes.

1294
00:47:18.155 --> 00:47:19.256
I am like the owner of a restaurant.

1295
00:47:19.256 --> 00:47:20.657
You are known as someone who gives food for free.

1296
00:47:20.657 --> 00:47:21.825
(It's like a soup kitchen.)

1297
00:47:22.426 --> 00:47:24.962
I don't even feel a nibble.

1298
00:47:25.362 --> 00:47:26.697
Why won't fish eat my bait?

1299
00:47:26.697 --> 00:47:27.731
(Their baits are untouched.)

1300
00:47:28.065 --> 00:47:29.166
It lures the fish, but...

1301
00:47:29.466 --> 00:47:31.101
It's similar to my life.

1302
00:47:31.435 --> 00:47:33.470
Even though I can lure men, I can't make any one of them mine.

1303
00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:39.076
(Even though I can lure men, I can't make any one of them mine.)

1304
00:47:39.176 --> 00:47:45.182
(Not many men bite the bait even though I gave them so much.)

1305
00:47:45.649 --> 00:47:49.052
(My life is similar to fishing.)

1306
00:47:49.686 --> 00:47:54.191
(How is Team Swing Dance doing while So Min looks back on herself?)

1307
00:47:54.191 --> 00:47:55.559
(They arrive at the dance academy with the acclaimed instructors.)

1308
00:47:55.559 --> 00:47:56.660
They are dancing.

1309
00:47:56.927 --> 00:47:58.862
- Is this the right place? - Yes, it is.

1310
00:47:59.563 --> 00:48:01.565
They are the instructors.

1311
00:48:02.366 --> 00:48:04.201
That's swing dance.

1312
00:48:04.201 --> 00:48:05.903
- That's right. - Is that it?

1313
00:48:05.903 --> 00:48:07.037
It looks cool.

1314
00:48:07.804 --> 00:48:08.972
- Let's go. - Let's take our shoes off.

1315
00:48:08.972 --> 00:48:10.274
It looks difficult.

1316
00:48:17.281 --> 00:48:19.349
- Hello. - Hello.

1317
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:22.486
- It's nice to meet you. - Who spoke to us on the phone?

1318
00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:24.521
- I did. - You did. Hello.

1319
00:48:24.855 --> 00:48:27.591
- What brings you here? - We are here...

1320
00:48:27.591 --> 00:48:30.394
- to learn swing dance. - Swing dance.

1321
00:48:30.394 --> 00:48:31.995
What you did just now is swing dance, right?

1322
00:48:31.995 --> 00:48:33.764
Yes, I'm dancing it right now.

1323
00:48:33.764 --> 00:48:35.032
You need two people for it.

1324
00:48:35.165 --> 00:48:37.568
Have you heard of Nevis Swing?

1325
00:48:37.568 --> 00:48:38.669
Stop it.

1326
00:48:38.969 --> 00:48:41.305
We only have an experience with Nevis Swing.

1327
00:48:41.505 --> 00:48:43.373
That's why we are here.

1328
00:48:43.373 --> 00:48:44.708
We came here to get over Nevis Swing.

1329
00:48:44.708 --> 00:48:46.343
(They enter the world of swing dance.)

1330
00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.713
(The instructors give a swing dance performance.)

1331
00:48:54.151 --> 00:48:59.923
(Their facial expressions and steps make the onlookers dance.)

1332
00:49:00.224 --> 00:49:02.392
(They have the perfect teamwork.)

1333
00:49:02.626 --> 00:49:04.628
(They are so cool.)

1334
00:49:06.964 --> 00:49:09.499
There she goes.

1335
00:49:09.499 --> 00:49:11.969
(They are surprised by the endless difficult dance moves.)

1336
00:49:12.703 --> 00:49:16.440
(The passionate swing dance is bound to burn Running Man's vacation.)

1337
00:49:19.676 --> 00:49:20.744
Please stop.

1338
00:49:20.744 --> 00:49:24.114
(Is this what swing dance is like?)

1339
00:49:24.114 --> 00:49:26.149
- Please stop. - Is that how it normally goes?

1340
00:49:26.149 --> 00:49:28.218
- This is the easy version. - This is the easy one?

1341
00:49:28.218 --> 00:49:30.554
- Yes, it is. - We don't know anything about it.

1342
00:49:30.554 --> 00:49:31.955
I will do the man's part.

1343
00:49:32.756 --> 00:49:34.157
- I will do the man's part. - Me too.

1344
00:49:34.157 --> 00:49:35.325
(They show off their manliness.)

1345
00:49:36.226 --> 00:49:38.962
Everything that is related to swing is scary.

1346
00:49:39.296 --> 00:49:41.765
We need to partner up.

1347
00:49:42.099 --> 00:49:45.235
Since there are three men, someone must do the woman's part.

1348
00:49:45.469 --> 00:49:48.005
Please pick one of us.

1349
00:49:48.672 --> 00:49:49.740
- Should he do the woman's part? - Me?

1350
00:49:49.773 --> 00:49:51.174
(As soon as they finish asking,)

1351
00:49:51.174 --> 00:49:52.276
(she chooses Kwang Soo.)

1352
00:49:52.276 --> 00:49:54.278
- Should I do the woman's part? - Your face is the prettiest.

1353
00:49:54.278 --> 00:49:55.512
Really?

1354
00:49:55.846 --> 00:50:01.084
(If I do the woman's part, I must do this...)

1355
00:50:01.084 --> 00:50:03.920
(and that, right?)

1356
00:50:05.922 --> 00:50:07.724
(Why is it me?)

1357
00:50:07.724 --> 00:50:09.092
He has long hair.

1358
00:50:09.092 --> 00:50:12.629
His hair is as long as mine. He can wear a hair piece.

1359
00:50:12.996 --> 00:50:14.531
There is a hair piece.

1360
00:50:14.531 --> 00:50:15.599
(Now, he is Kwang Ja, not Kwang Soo.)

1361
00:50:16.033 --> 00:50:18.602
(The instructors finally reveal the dance routine they will learn.)

1362
00:50:20.203 --> 00:50:22.005
(Relaxed)

1363
00:50:22.306 --> 00:50:25.075
(Clumsy)

1364
00:50:25.442 --> 00:50:26.443
(Claps)

1365
00:50:28.779 --> 00:50:31.948
(The cheerful swing steps add to the swing rhythm.)

1366
00:50:33.583 --> 00:50:34.651
How do they do that?

1367
00:50:35.352 --> 00:50:39.923
(Even though it looks easy, they can only follow clumsily.)

1368
00:50:43.527 --> 00:50:44.628
(Lifting)

1369
00:50:44.795 --> 00:50:49.099
(They pull off difficult dance moves with a smile on.)

1370
00:50:51.535 --> 00:50:54.171
(Welcome to the world of swing dance.)

1371
00:50:54.571 --> 00:50:55.639
Bravo!

1372
00:50:55.772 --> 00:50:57.007
- It was cool. - Bravo!

1373
00:50:57.007 --> 00:50:58.141
Respect, respect.

1374
00:50:58.141 --> 00:51:00.344
(Swing dance deserves big respect.)

1375
00:51:00.477 --> 00:51:02.145
This isn't the dance routine we will learn, right?

1376
00:51:02.145 --> 00:51:03.980
- It is. - It is.

1377
00:51:04.114 --> 00:51:06.149
Would you please take out a few dance moves?

1378
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.586
We don't know if we will be able to learn it.

1379
00:51:09.586 --> 00:51:12.022
- The basic steps will be enough. - That's right.

1380
00:51:12.189 --> 00:51:15.125
Your talent, skills, and facial expressions...

1381
00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:19.129
- will take care of everything. - Our bodies won't follow.

1382
00:51:19.129 --> 00:51:22.232
We need to learn the basic rules of swing dance.

1383
00:51:22.232 --> 00:51:24.368
We heard the lesson is 70 dollars per hour.

1384
00:51:24.401 --> 00:51:26.837
We should reach an agreement on the price.

1385
00:51:27.437 --> 00:51:29.373
We need to bargain.

1386
00:51:29.373 --> 00:51:31.775
- Let's bargain for the price. - 75 dollars per hour.

1387
00:51:31.775 --> 00:51:33.910
It's 75 dollars per hour for each person.

1388
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.045
- 75 dollars. - Yes.

1389
00:51:35.045 --> 00:51:37.214
How about we agree on 300 dollars for everyone?

1390
00:51:37.514 --> 00:51:38.715
It's for an hour.

1391
00:51:39.015 --> 00:51:43.387
We dress casually for the lesson...

1392
00:51:43.387 --> 00:51:45.355
because it's a popular dance in the US.

1393
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:47.157
Kwang Soo, I will do it for you.

1394
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:49.926
It looks funny if it's at the front. Let's put it on the side.

1395
00:51:50.761 --> 00:51:52.095
Kwang Soo, it looks good on you.

1396
00:51:52.095 --> 00:51:54.331
- How pretty! - You look like a gypsy woman.

1397
00:51:54.498 --> 00:51:55.832
Look.

1398
00:51:55.832 --> 00:51:57.234
Doesn't he look beautiful?

1399
00:51:57.667 --> 00:51:59.903
You remind me a bit of Sol Bi.

1400
00:51:59.903 --> 00:52:01.772
(Surprised)

1401
00:52:01.972 --> 00:52:04.274
- Why would you bring up Sol Bi? - You remind me a bit of Sol Bi.

1402
00:52:04.374 --> 00:52:06.076
You remind me a bit of Sol Bi.

1403
00:52:06.076 --> 00:52:07.477
Kwang Soo, it looks good on you.

1404
00:52:07.577 --> 00:52:10.280
(Se Chan is wearing an item for men.)

1405
00:52:10.347 --> 00:52:11.481
(Laughing)

1406
00:52:12.616 --> 00:52:14.151
I feel like we are in "Rustic Period".

1407
00:52:14.985 --> 00:52:17.154
We are like the thugs in "Rustic Period".

1408
00:52:17.587 --> 00:52:18.688
- The two of you... - We are like the thugs.

1409
00:52:18.688 --> 00:52:20.724
- Breaking news! - That's right.

1410
00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:21.992
- Breaking news! - That's how it goes.

1411
00:52:22.292 --> 00:52:23.493
What does that make you?

1412
00:52:23.493 --> 00:52:24.528
(What does that make you?)

1413
00:52:24.528 --> 00:52:25.862
(A wild woman)

1414
00:52:25.862 --> 00:52:27.364
- Sol Bi. - Sol Bi.

1415
00:52:27.431 --> 00:52:28.465
- Stop it. - Seriously.

1416
00:52:28.532 --> 00:52:29.833
He isn't Sol Bi.

1417
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.968
Isn't he a shaman?

1418
00:52:32.969 --> 00:52:36.306
Why don't you wear a wrap instead of a skirt?

1419
00:52:36.306 --> 00:52:37.707
- It's nice. - It's nice.

1420
00:52:37.774 --> 00:52:40.210
Would you please make your voice more feminine?

1421
00:52:40.577 --> 00:52:42.345
- We need to concentrate. - Kwang Ja.

1422
00:52:42.479 --> 00:52:44.815
We won't be able to learn anything.

1423
00:52:44.815 --> 00:52:46.349
(They divide into groups and begin training.)

1424
00:52:47.551 --> 00:52:50.454
(He teaches the steps one by one.)

1425
00:52:51.521 --> 00:52:54.658
(He gives them a lesson according to their capabilities.)

1426
00:52:55.225 --> 00:52:56.426
Backwards.

1427
00:52:56.426 --> 00:52:58.762
(Haha and Se Chan are doing pretty well.)

1428
00:52:58.762 --> 00:53:00.530
Good. Good job.

1429
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:01.565
(You are doing a good job.)

1430
00:53:02.232 --> 00:53:05.202
Please go slowly.

1431
00:53:05.335 --> 00:53:06.403
Let's go.

1432
00:53:06.803 --> 00:53:09.806
(They keep missing the steps.)

1433
00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:12.108
That was incredible.

1434
00:53:12.108 --> 00:53:13.677
(She is in a daze.)

1435
00:53:13.677 --> 00:53:17.214
(These two are struggling with the basic steps.)

1436
00:53:17.214 --> 00:53:20.217
(They always show the same dance moves.)

1437
00:53:20.217 --> 00:53:24.721
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo have a dance they used for the past 7 years.)

1438
00:53:25.422 --> 00:53:26.523
Let's try this by ourselves.

1439
00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:28.291
- In 1, 2, 3, 4. - In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1440
00:53:32.295 --> 00:53:33.296
Wrong steps.

1441
00:53:33.296 --> 00:53:34.998
We forgot everything without her.

1442
00:53:34.998 --> 00:53:36.233
- I will move to the front. - Please show us again.

1443
00:53:36.399 --> 00:53:37.834
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

1444
00:53:37.834 --> 00:53:39.336
(The women need a lot of instructions.)

1445
00:53:39.569 --> 00:53:40.604
Good job.

1446
00:53:40.604 --> 00:53:42.739
(They are improving slowly.)

1447
00:53:42.739 --> 00:53:44.941
(I am starting to get it.)

1448
00:53:45.275 --> 00:53:46.776
(They train with passion.)

1449
00:53:46.776 --> 00:53:47.844
Stretch out your legs.

1450
00:53:48.078 --> 00:53:49.246
I'm exhausted.

1451
00:53:49.779 --> 00:53:51.882
You are exhausted, right? Let's take a short break.

1452
00:53:53.817 --> 00:53:56.486
No, I don't want to stop.

1453
00:53:56.486 --> 00:53:57.554
Go.

1454
00:53:58.121 --> 00:53:59.356
Please show me one more time.

1455
00:53:59.356 --> 00:54:01.424
- Kwang Soo, are you okay? - I'm okay.

1456
00:54:01.424 --> 00:54:02.893
Please don't stop me.

1457
00:54:03.393 --> 00:54:06.463
(No one can stop me.)

1458
00:54:06.463 --> 00:54:07.531
(She's praising him.)

1459
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:10.166
(She praises Kwang Soo to stop him,)

1460
00:54:10.166 --> 00:54:12.936
(but his steps only get faster.)

1461
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:14.971
- Is it good? - Yes, it's good.

1462
00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:16.239
Please teach us the next move.

1463
00:54:16.239 --> 00:54:17.741
- Shall we move on? - Yes.

1464
00:54:18.008 --> 00:54:21.278
Let's have one couple stand here, and the other one stand here.

1465
00:54:22.012 --> 00:54:23.146
- Now. - Stand here.

1466
00:54:23.146 --> 00:54:24.915
- Please take good care of me. - Please take good care of me.

1467
00:54:25.115 --> 00:54:27.117
A man and a woman, the leader and follower...

1468
00:54:27.117 --> 00:54:28.418
face each other.

1469
00:54:28.418 --> 00:54:29.986
Then cross while facing each other.

1470
00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.389
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1471
00:54:32.389 --> 00:54:34.991
(They have a good teamwork.)

1472
00:54:35.525 --> 00:54:37.027
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1473
00:54:37.027 --> 00:54:38.295
Return to your place.

1474
00:54:38.295 --> 00:54:39.663
Which foot goes first?

1475
00:54:39.663 --> 00:54:40.797
I'm sorry,

1476
00:54:41.197 --> 00:54:42.732
but my partner looks angry.

1477
00:54:42.732 --> 00:54:44.234
I'm not angry, but focused.

1478
00:54:44.301 --> 00:54:45.936
- He won't even look at me. - I'm focusing hard.

1479
00:54:45.936 --> 00:54:47.270
I'm very focused.

1480
00:54:47.404 --> 00:54:48.805
- I'm taking this seriously. - Since this is a partner dance,

1481
00:54:48.838 --> 00:54:51.074
you need to depend on and trust each other.

1482
00:54:51.141 --> 00:54:53.209
-You also need to have love... - Friendship.

1483
00:54:53.209 --> 00:54:54.411
- for one another. - You need an eye contact.

1484
00:54:54.411 --> 00:54:56.279
- An eye contact. - Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1485
00:54:56.279 --> 00:54:58.548
- I love you, Se Chan. - I love you, Ji Hyo.

1486
00:54:58.548 --> 00:54:59.950
- That's what it means to dance. - Let's love each other.

1487
00:54:59.983 --> 00:55:02.519
Love and cherish each other.

1488
00:55:03.386 --> 00:55:05.288
The facial expression is important.

1489
00:55:05.288 --> 00:55:06.356
(I love you.)

1490
00:55:06.356 --> 00:55:07.424
That's great.

1491
00:55:07.424 --> 00:55:09.759
(They are full of love.)

1492
00:55:09.893 --> 00:55:11.528
All right. Let's move on.

1493
00:55:11.828 --> 00:55:13.096
Let's try what we learned earlier.

1494
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:15.565
I can't stop myself.

1495
00:55:15.699 --> 00:55:17.067
You look like you are in a good mood.

1496
00:55:17.067 --> 00:55:19.202
It's the feeling of swing dance.

1497
00:55:19.202 --> 00:55:21.137
- Good. - This part is for women.

1498
00:55:21.137 --> 00:55:24.574
The move where you turn your hips is called swivel.

1499
00:55:24.808 --> 00:55:27.944
We will walk forward as we swivel.

1500
00:55:29.112 --> 00:55:33.183
(Swivel adds beauty to the swing rhythm.)

1501
00:55:33.917 --> 00:55:34.985
It's something you are good at.

1502
00:55:34.985 --> 00:55:36.086
Do this quickly.

1503
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:39.055
Do this quickly.

1504
00:55:39.055 --> 00:55:43.360
2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Women will go around men.

1505
00:55:44.628 --> 00:55:46.463
- What are you doing? - Did you lose your mind?

1506
00:55:46.763 --> 00:55:48.264
- Did you lose your mind? - Did I do it wrong?

1507
00:55:48.264 --> 00:55:49.933
- You look scary. - This is swing dance.

1508
00:55:49.933 --> 00:55:51.334
You are doing well.

1509
00:55:51.334 --> 00:55:52.836
- It was nice. - Kwang Soo is very scary.

1510
00:55:52.836 --> 00:55:55.739
Women need to turn fast in the count of eight.

1511
00:55:55.739 --> 00:55:56.973
- Fast? - Yes.

1512
00:55:56.973 --> 00:55:58.775
- Circle the man. - I need quick steps.

1513
00:55:59.009 --> 00:56:00.844
We used to go like this. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1514
00:56:00.844 --> 00:56:02.846
(They must move faster.)

1515
00:56:02.846 --> 00:56:04.147
6, 7, 8. That's right.

1516
00:56:04.147 --> 00:56:05.882
You are doing well.

1517
00:56:05.882 --> 00:56:07.183
That's good.

1518
00:56:07.183 --> 00:56:09.252
- Go faster. - That's good.

1519
00:56:09.252 --> 00:56:13.323
(I'm faster and more unique compared to the others.)

1520
00:56:14.824 --> 00:56:15.825
You are very fast.

1521
00:56:15.825 --> 00:56:17.694
May we remove the flower?

1522
00:56:17.961 --> 00:56:20.163
- He looks like a crazy person. - He is crazy for dance.

1523
00:56:20.163 --> 00:56:22.065
That flower makes him look like a crazy person.

1524
00:56:22.732 --> 00:56:24.434
You are doing well even though it's a bit scary.

1525
00:56:24.434 --> 00:56:25.635
- Let's try again. - Stand behind him.

1526
00:56:25.635 --> 00:56:27.404
(Short and Tall Couple continues to smile.)

1527
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:29.839
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - Start to move forward.

1528
00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:31.775
Next.

1529
00:56:31.775 --> 00:56:33.677
- This is great. - The next movement is...

1530
00:56:34.411 --> 00:56:37.080
- It's Haha's favorite. - I did it a long time ago.

1531
00:56:38.982 --> 00:56:41.651
- It's too difficult for now. - Just do it.

1532
00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:43.953
(Do you mean this?)

1533
00:56:43.953 --> 00:56:44.988
He can do it.

1534
00:56:44.988 --> 00:56:45.989
(Do you mean this?)

1535
00:56:46.523 --> 00:56:48.525
Kwang Soo, it's for men.

1536
00:56:48.525 --> 00:56:50.627
It's the male dancer's part. It's not for women.

1537
00:56:50.727 --> 00:56:52.062
It's for male dancers.

1538
00:56:52.062 --> 00:56:53.730
Yours is moving the pelvis.

1539
00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:55.465
- Can I do it too? - No.

1540
00:56:55.765 --> 00:56:57.434
- It's almost the last part. - It's the highlight.

1541
00:56:57.434 --> 00:57:01.604
The male dancer lifts the female.

1542
00:57:01.604 --> 00:57:05.175
This is how you do it. The female dancer must jump.

1543
00:57:05.175 --> 00:57:08.144
- You must jump. - As she jumps,

1544
00:57:08.244 --> 00:57:11.181
go down and up like this.

1545
00:57:11.181 --> 00:57:12.515
(The man's strength and the woman's jumping are the key.)

1546
00:57:12.515 --> 00:57:15.318
- The man supports. In 5, 6, 7, 8. - In 5, 6, 7, 8.

1547
00:57:15.318 --> 00:57:17.921
- Step, down, up, down. - That's right.

1548
00:57:17.921 --> 00:57:19.122
- You did well. - Good job.

1549
00:57:19.122 --> 00:57:20.223
- We can do it. - Was it okay?

1550
00:57:20.223 --> 00:57:21.524
I'm too heavy.

1551
00:57:21.524 --> 00:57:23.193
- You're light. - You aren't heavy at all.

1552
00:57:23.193 --> 00:57:26.196
- You're very light. - May we try it?

1553
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:27.330
(Can you take a look at us?)

1554
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:28.465
We're confident.

1555
00:57:28.465 --> 00:57:29.499
- Okay. - I practiced a lot too.

1556
00:57:29.499 --> 00:57:31.468
- Go ahead. - We'll give it a try.

1557
00:57:32.035 --> 00:57:35.105
1, 2, 3, 4. Back, step, down.

1558
00:57:35.939 --> 00:57:37.307
That was great.

1559
00:57:37.307 --> 00:57:39.576
- How was it good? - It wasn't.

1560
00:57:39.609 --> 00:57:42.078
You didn't see Kwang Soo's face.

1561
00:57:42.078 --> 00:57:43.880
- His face was strange. - Really?

1562
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:44.948
Fix his facial expression.

1563
00:57:44.948 --> 00:57:46.616
Let me take a look at the facial expression.

1564
00:57:46.616 --> 00:57:47.951
- Facial expression? Okay. - Yes.

1565
00:57:48.618 --> 00:57:52.288
- Get ready. - 1, 2, 3, 4. Back, step, down.

1566
00:57:53.123 --> 00:57:56.359
(It's the wrong smile of a swing dancer.)

1567
00:57:56.359 --> 00:57:58.962
Good job. You're doing very well.

1568
00:57:59.195 --> 00:58:02.298
I bet they can try this move.

1569
00:58:02.298 --> 00:58:03.700
Please follow our move.

1570
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:08.705
5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1571
00:58:08.705 --> 00:58:10.006
(He adds a kick.)

1572
00:58:10.006 --> 00:58:11.908
- That's so easy. - 5, 6, 7.

1573
00:58:11.908 --> 00:58:14.778
(Do you mean a kick between my legs?)

1574
00:58:14.778 --> 00:58:16.946
- Watch us carefully. - Let's go.

1575
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.515
Try it, Kwang Soo.

1576
00:58:18.515 --> 00:58:19.816
- Watch carefully. - All right.

1577
00:58:19.816 --> 00:58:22.152
- Haha, give him the count. - You can do it.

1578
00:58:22.152 --> 00:58:23.820
- Get ready, set. - Wait.

1579
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.055
- I'm not a real woman. - Start with the count.

1580
00:58:26.256 --> 00:58:29.292
1, 2, 3, 4, back, step, down.

1581
00:58:35.198 --> 00:58:37.233
(How could you?)

1582
00:58:37.233 --> 00:58:39.035
You must hold him up.

1583
00:58:39.169 --> 00:58:40.503
I did.

1584
00:58:40.503 --> 00:58:42.105
- Haha. - He let me go.

1585
00:58:42.205 --> 00:58:44.908
After you put down your partner,

1586
00:58:45.175 --> 00:58:49.179
you'll choreograph the next part.

1587
00:58:49.179 --> 00:58:52.582
For example, you may finish in this pose.

1588
00:58:52.582 --> 00:58:54.150
- You can finish like this. - Or...

1589
00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.351
do this.

1590
00:58:57.253 --> 00:58:58.321
(Swinging)

1591
00:58:58.321 --> 00:59:00.423
- You may finish in this pose. - Can you do that?

1592
00:59:01.124 --> 00:59:02.492
Let's try that.

1593
00:59:02.525 --> 00:59:04.928
- Show us how you did the last part. - Be creative.

1594
00:59:05.528 --> 00:59:08.231
Put your leg around the partner's waist.

1595
00:59:08.498 --> 00:59:10.433
- Lift her up. - Here's how you move.

1596
00:59:10.433 --> 00:59:11.501
Turn her around.

1597
00:59:12.335 --> 00:59:14.237
Separate the legs while you jump.

1598
00:59:14.237 --> 00:59:15.271
Three.

1599
00:59:15.939 --> 00:59:17.073
It doesn't work.

1600
00:59:17.807 --> 00:59:19.108
(Come on!)

1601
00:59:19.108 --> 00:59:20.643
Haha wanted to kick him.

1602
00:59:21.044 --> 00:59:22.045
How dare you?

1603
00:59:22.712 --> 00:59:25.415
(They're not fighting. They're creating the last part.)

1604
00:59:25.815 --> 00:59:27.417
Practice on your own.

1605
00:59:28.318 --> 00:59:31.521
Let's practice one last time while watching the teacher.

1606
00:59:31.621 --> 00:59:32.622
Okay.

1607
00:59:32.622 --> 00:59:35.859
Cross and turn. Watch the arms.

1608
00:59:35.925 --> 00:59:39.295
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1609
00:59:39.596 --> 00:59:43.299
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo dance well together.)

1610
00:59:44.334 --> 00:59:45.335
One more time.

1611
00:59:46.236 --> 00:59:49.072
(They're very focused that they're not speaking.)

1612
00:59:49.072 --> 00:59:51.241
Gosh, what are we doing?

1613
00:59:51.241 --> 00:59:53.610
Please let me go eat ramyeon.

1614
00:59:53.676 --> 00:59:54.811
Try harder.

1615
00:59:54.811 --> 00:59:55.912
What is this?

1616
00:59:55.912 --> 00:59:57.113
(What's this on my head?)

1617
00:59:58.314 --> 00:59:59.515
What are we doing?

1618
00:59:59.949 --> 01:00:02.085
(What do you mean? It's swing dance.)

1619
01:00:02.318 --> 01:00:07.123
(Their surprising swing dance performance is coming up soon.)

1620
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:10.426
- We don't have much time. - We must hurry.

1621
01:00:10.426 --> 01:00:12.228
We can't stay here long.

1622
01:00:12.729 --> 01:00:15.999
Fishing is not about catching fish. It's about catching time.

1623
01:00:18.101 --> 01:00:19.502
(They haven't caught any fish for 1 hour.)

1624
01:00:19.502 --> 01:00:21.437
I didn't catch anything.

1625
01:00:21.437 --> 01:00:23.039
(They haven't caught any fish for 1 hour.)

1626
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.110
Bite, bite.

1627
01:00:27.277 --> 01:00:30.413
(They even get aggressive.)

1628
01:00:30.413 --> 01:00:32.615
Can anyone catch just one fish?

1629
01:00:32.615 --> 01:00:34.751
Let's try to catch at least one.

1630
01:00:34.951 --> 01:00:37.854
What happened? Come on, Jae Seok.

1631
01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:40.023
There aren't any fish, So Min.

1632
01:00:40.023 --> 01:00:41.090
(He has no idea what's going on.)

1633
01:00:43.326 --> 01:00:44.560
(Jong Kook's fishing rod moves.)

1634
01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.963
Didn't something get caught? Take a look.

1635
01:00:46.963 --> 01:00:47.964
(It's tight.)

1636
01:00:47.964 --> 01:00:49.032
- He caught something. - He did.

1637
01:00:49.098 --> 01:00:51.868
(Did Jong Kook catch something after an hour?)

1638
01:00:52.302 --> 01:00:53.303
What's going on?

1639
01:00:53.303 --> 01:00:55.104
(Will Jong Kook catch first?)

1640
01:00:55.738 --> 01:01:01.444
(Will Jong Kook fill the containers with fish?)

1641
01:01:01.444 --> 01:01:04.547
I caught it. I caught a webfoot octopus.

1642
01:01:04.547 --> 01:01:06.049
- Hurry up. - It's a webfoot octopus.

1643
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:07.150
(Did he catch a webfoot octopus?)

1644
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.184
He caught a webfoot octopus.

1645
01:01:08.818 --> 01:01:15.024
(Jong Kook catches a large webfoot octopus.)

1646
01:01:15.024 --> 01:01:16.025
It's a webfoot octopus.

1647
01:01:16.025 --> 01:01:18.461
(After 1 hour, they finally catch something.)

1648
01:01:18.461 --> 01:01:20.630
- He caught one. - I caught a webfoot octopus.

1649
01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.498
- Gosh. - May I touch the head?

1650
01:01:22.498 --> 01:01:23.499
Yes, take it off.

1651
01:01:24.133 --> 01:01:25.134
- Take it off. - Goodness.

1652
01:01:25.134 --> 01:01:27.036
Gosh, it's interesting.

1653
01:01:27.603 --> 01:01:29.172
You can eat it raw.

1654
01:01:29.238 --> 01:01:32.375
The webfoot octopus bit the bait. It's so cute.

1655
01:01:32.408 --> 01:01:34.377
I should have caught it.

1656
01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:36.179
You don't know anything about fishing.

1657
01:01:36.179 --> 01:01:39.215
Gosh, this is so frustrating. It's so annoying.

1658
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:42.785
I bet the webfoot octopus that he caught is all we're catching today.

1659
01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:44.554
That's how I feel.

1660
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:48.658
- It's a webfoot octopus. - I caught one.

1661
01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:51.794
I caught a webfoot octopus.

1662
01:01:51.794 --> 01:01:53.262
(They catch the second one.)

1663
01:01:53.262 --> 01:01:55.064
- It's big. - Goodness.

1664
01:01:55.298 --> 01:01:56.532
I almost lost it.

1665
01:01:57.033 --> 01:01:58.668
He caught another one.

1666
01:01:58.668 --> 01:02:01.204
- It's really big. - It's so big.

1667
01:02:01.604 --> 01:02:05.208
(This is what fishing is like.)

1668
01:02:05.975 --> 01:02:10.613
Fish recognize the bait of a professional fisherman.

1669
01:02:10.613 --> 01:02:13.182
- Goodness. - He insisted on fishing...

1670
01:02:13.182 --> 01:02:15.018
even though he's not good at it.

1671
01:02:16.352 --> 01:02:18.588
Is something wrong with my bait? Why can't I catch any?

1672
01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:22.291
I'm in a lonely fight.

1673
01:02:23.126 --> 01:02:26.129
I'm fighting against the sea, fishing, and the fish.

1674
01:02:26.129 --> 01:02:27.430
(It's a saying of the king of fishing.)

1675
01:02:28.398 --> 01:02:31.100
No fish falls for my bait.

1676
01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.702
(Jae Seok hasn't caught any.)

1677
01:02:32.702 --> 01:02:33.836
I felt something.

1678
01:02:34.037 --> 01:02:36.139
Is something wrong with my bait? Why can't I catch any?

1679
01:02:36.139 --> 01:02:37.807
(He's at risk of losing his title.)

1680
01:02:38.441 --> 01:02:42.612
(Will he recover his damaged reputation?)

1681
01:02:45.014 --> 01:02:46.416
Did you feel something?

1682
01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:48.785
(Something bites the bait.)

1683
01:02:49.185 --> 01:02:50.186
He got something.

1684
01:02:50.186 --> 01:02:54.090
(Those who looked down on me, just watch what I got.)

1685
01:02:54.090 --> 01:03:00.129
(He calls himself the king of fishing. Will he prove himself?)

1686
01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:01.364
The fishing rod got bent.

1687
01:03:01.364 --> 01:03:02.932
(He calls himself the king of fishing. Will he prove himself?)

1688
01:03:10.046 --> 01:03:11.340
The fishing rod got bent.

1689
01:03:13.976 --> 01:03:17.480
(He catches a tiny webfoot octopus.)

1690
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.783
- Come on. - Okay.

1691
01:03:20.783 --> 01:03:23.686
- This is great. - It's a small webfoot octopus.

1692
01:03:23.686 --> 01:03:25.721
Okay, this is great.

1693
01:03:26.355 --> 01:03:27.490
Okay, nice.

1694
01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:28.858
(It's a small webfoot octopus.)

1695
01:03:28.991 --> 01:03:31.394
- Finally, - I'm going to catch one myself.

1696
01:03:31.394 --> 01:03:35.198
they're reacting to my professional fishing bait.

1697
01:03:35.465 --> 01:03:37.700
You caught such a small one.

1698
01:03:38.067 --> 01:03:39.836
Be quiet, So Min.

1699
01:03:39.869 --> 01:03:42.371
I'm on the fishing channel.

1700
01:03:43.673 --> 01:03:45.074
Did you catch it on camera?

1701
01:03:45.074 --> 01:03:46.109
(Yu Jae Seok, the webfoot octopus expert)

1702
01:03:46.109 --> 01:03:49.445
You missed such an important moment.

1703
01:03:49.612 --> 01:03:52.381
The smallest octopus in the container is Jae Seok's.

1704
01:03:53.249 --> 01:03:54.851
- It's the smallest. - It's a baby.

1705
01:03:56.152 --> 01:03:58.821
His sweet potatoes and webfoot octopus are small.

1706
01:03:58.821 --> 01:04:00.823
(Everything he gets is small.)

1707
01:04:02.325 --> 01:04:07.296
(Is Jae Seok's expertise in small things?)

1708
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:10.333
He's Small Jae Seok.

1709
01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:11.400
(He gets a new nickname, "Small Jae Seok".)

1710
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.468
My goodness.

1711
01:04:12.468 --> 01:04:14.036
(He gets a new nickname, "Small Jae Seok").

1712
01:04:15.471 --> 01:04:17.974
It'd be great if I catch one fluke.

1713
01:04:17.974 --> 01:04:18.975
(No one catches any fluke.)

1714
01:04:18.975 --> 01:04:21.811
What if the fish want us to stop fishing?

1715
01:04:22.145 --> 01:04:23.246
Stop fishing.

1716
01:04:23.412 --> 01:04:25.047
It's time for us to leave.

1717
01:04:25.047 --> 01:04:26.949
(They caught one webfoot octopus each.)

1718
01:04:28.217 --> 01:04:30.987
Wait a minute. I think I caught something.

1719
01:04:30.987 --> 01:04:34.190
(Wait a minute. I think I caught something.)

1720
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.692
- It's fluke. - I caught something.

1721
01:04:37.126 --> 01:04:38.594
- He caught it. - What is it?

1722
01:04:38.594 --> 01:04:43.799
(He feels a different type of bite.)

1723
01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:44.901
I caught it.

1724
01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:48.037
- It's fluke. - What is it? It's not fluke.

1725
01:04:48.037 --> 01:04:49.038
What is it?

1726
01:04:50.139 --> 01:04:51.174
What is it?

1727
01:04:51.174 --> 01:04:52.842
(What type of fish is it?)

1728
01:04:52.842 --> 01:04:53.876
What is it?

1729
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:55.845
- What is it? - It's flathead.

1730
01:04:55.845 --> 01:04:59.048
(Jong Kook catches huge flathead.)

1731
01:04:59.048 --> 01:05:00.082
It's flathead.

1732
01:05:00.983 --> 01:05:02.118
He caught something.

1733
01:05:02.485 --> 01:05:03.619
(He caught a great one.)

1734
01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:04.921
That's amazing.

1735
01:05:04.921 --> 01:05:06.889
- Jong Kook is amazing. - Jong Kook caught it.

1736
01:05:07.089 --> 01:05:09.325
How did you catch it?

1737
01:05:09.959 --> 01:05:12.128
I had a feeling that I got lucky.

1738
01:05:12.461 --> 01:05:14.597
Can we eat this fish, sir?

1739
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:18.768
You can eat it raw, but it's perfect for stew.

1740
01:05:18.768 --> 01:05:20.303
Maybe not for ramyeon.

1741
01:05:20.903 --> 01:05:22.805
I just felt it.

1742
01:05:22.872 --> 01:05:25.341
- Its mouth... - Congratulations.

1743
01:05:25.341 --> 01:05:26.943
Why can't I catch anything like that?

1744
01:05:26.943 --> 01:05:29.478
(Jong Kook proved his class.)

1745
01:05:30.213 --> 01:05:32.348
We have enough webfoot octopuses to make ramyeon.

1746
01:05:32.348 --> 01:05:34.817
Something ate the shrimp and left.

1747
01:05:35.585 --> 01:05:37.420
This is the first thing I caught.

1748
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.454
(A small webfoot octopus)

1749
01:05:38.454 --> 01:05:40.623
- I'm sorry. - Look at that.

1750
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.258
It's interesting.

1751
01:05:42.658 --> 01:05:44.760
- Put them in one by one. - Okay.

1752
01:05:45.628 --> 01:05:47.463
Yes, like that.

1753
01:05:48.097 --> 01:05:49.532
I'm sorry, but...

1754
01:05:49.532 --> 01:05:51.901
- stop saying that at the back. - You're doing a good job.

1755
01:05:52.868 --> 01:05:54.003
Look at that soup.

1756
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:56.239
They have so much ink.

1757
01:05:56.272 --> 01:05:57.640
It's webfoot octopus ink ramyeon.

1758
01:05:59.408 --> 01:06:00.643
The soup...

1759
01:06:00.643 --> 01:06:01.677
(This is the real vacation.)

1760
01:06:01.677 --> 01:06:02.979
This is making me eat a lot.

1761
01:06:02.979 --> 01:06:05.681
(Jae Seok puts a webfoot octopus in his mouth.)

1762
01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:09.252
- It tastes so good. - It tastes really good.

1763
01:06:09.852 --> 01:06:11.721
- It tastes fantastic. - With webfoot octopuses...

1764
01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:14.023
(Even Jong Kook enjoys ramyeon today.)

1765
01:06:14.023 --> 01:06:15.591
It tastes much better.

1766
01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.529
Dear ramyeon advertisers...

1767
01:06:20.529 --> 01:06:22.031
(This is my chance.)

1768
01:06:22.765 --> 01:06:25.668
(So Min is good at describing flavors.)

1769
01:06:25.668 --> 01:06:28.437
(She'll make people's mouths water.)

1770
01:06:29.272 --> 01:06:31.374
(Dear advertisers, what do you think of me?)

1771
01:06:31.374 --> 01:06:33.242
You look too ambitious. Stop it.

1772
01:06:33.242 --> 01:06:34.677
(They're trying to protect her.)

1773
01:06:34.677 --> 01:06:36.679
(Disappointed)

1774
01:06:37.913 --> 01:06:39.482
You should hum now.

1775
01:06:39.482 --> 01:06:40.516
(The last task is humming.)

1776
01:06:40.516 --> 01:06:42.318
Just me? Shouldn't everyone do it?

1777
01:06:43.919 --> 01:06:45.688
How do you hum?

1778
01:06:45.688 --> 01:06:47.923
(Humming)

1779
01:06:47.923 --> 01:06:48.991
Like this.

1780
01:06:48.991 --> 01:06:52.461
(I'm happy when you smile)

1781
01:06:52.461 --> 01:06:53.562
Isn't this humming?

1782
01:06:53.562 --> 01:06:55.498
That's just a nasal sound.

1783
01:06:56.332 --> 01:06:58.467
(I thought I was humming.)

1784
01:06:59.568 --> 01:07:01.470
- One song comes to my mind. - Which one?

1785
01:07:02.438 --> 01:07:05.875
("Meeting" by Noh Sa Yeon)

1786
01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:10.212
(Seok Jin likes it.)

1787
01:07:10.813 --> 01:07:13.783
(To get over it)

1788
01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:16.786
(It's too...)

1789
01:07:17.219 --> 01:07:19.522
Judging from the way she sings,

1790
01:07:19.522 --> 01:07:21.390
she must have been born before 1965.

1791
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:23.959
(So Min sounds old.)

1792
01:07:25.361 --> 01:07:29.965
(They all start to sing together.)

1793
01:07:30.499 --> 01:07:32.101
(She hits the high notes.)

1794
01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:33.569
I love you

1795
01:07:33.569 --> 01:07:36.539
(She hits the high notes.)

1796
01:07:36.806 --> 01:07:42.378
(They sing together despite the age gap.)

1797
01:07:43.446 --> 01:07:47.249
(Relaxing tour, I love you)

1798
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:50.286
- Harmony. - What's with you?

1799
01:07:51.087 --> 01:07:53.055
I want to be good at singing.

1800
01:07:53.055 --> 01:07:54.323
(After accomplishing all tasks, they're back.)

1801
01:07:54.323 --> 01:07:55.591
Good work, everybody.

1802
01:07:55.858 --> 01:07:57.360
Thank you, Captain.

1803
01:07:57.727 --> 01:08:00.863
I'm so happy to finally land.

1804
01:08:02.732 --> 01:08:04.600
- It was exhausting. - I felt sick.

1805
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.768
It wasn't easy.

1806
01:08:05.768 --> 01:08:07.470
(Jae Seok goes back onto the boat.)

1807
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:08.804
I'm happy to land.

1808
01:08:09.271 --> 01:08:10.506
Give me some paper.

1809
01:08:11.941 --> 01:08:14.577
(While everyone is getting off the boat,)

1810
01:08:14.577 --> 01:08:17.780
(Jae Seok writes down a name.)

1811
01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.814
Here.

1812
01:08:19.782 --> 01:08:20.950
What are you doing?

1813
01:08:21.317 --> 01:08:22.785
- What? - What are you doing?

1814
01:08:23.219 --> 01:08:25.020
- I'm taking this thing off. - What?

1815
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.323
(Whose name did he write?)

1816
01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:30.926
The total cost of your tour was...

1817
01:08:30.993 --> 01:08:32.795
- 300 dollars. - 300 dollars? Okay.

1818
01:08:32.795 --> 01:08:35.464
(They have to pay 300 dollars.)

1819
01:08:35.464 --> 01:08:39.201
If the box is empty, we'll turn the wheel.

1820
01:08:41.637 --> 01:08:43.672
I see my name.

1821
01:08:43.672 --> 01:08:46.142
(Unbelievable)

1822
01:08:47.610 --> 01:08:50.079
- Who did it? - Who did it?

1823
01:08:51.814 --> 01:08:54.116
(Seok Jin is a candidate.)

1824
01:08:54.116 --> 01:08:57.253
It's Jae Seok's handwriting.

1825
01:08:57.253 --> 01:08:58.587
I recognize his handwriting.

1826
01:08:58.587 --> 01:09:00.423
It's definitely his.

1827
01:09:00.423 --> 01:09:02.425
I can't believe this. Wait.

1828
01:09:02.425 --> 01:09:03.692
(There's something more in the box.)

1829
01:09:03.692 --> 01:09:05.194
Someone wrote a name on a towel.

1830
01:09:05.928 --> 01:09:07.229
A towel?

1831
01:09:07.797 --> 01:09:09.031
Oh, my.

1832
01:09:09.031 --> 01:09:10.199
(Jae Seok's name is written on a towel.)

1833
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.535
Do you have a pen?

1834
01:09:12.535 --> 01:09:13.669
(While they were moving to the fishing spot...)

1835
01:09:14.804 --> 01:09:17.640
(While Jae Seok was hiding from the waves,)

1836
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:23.446
(Seok Jin wrote his name on a towel.)

1837
01:09:24.079 --> 01:09:26.449
(He didn't see it, did he?)

1838
01:09:27.116 --> 01:09:28.884
- There's something more. - What's that?

1839
01:09:28.884 --> 01:09:30.619
- It's an oil control film. - Is there a name on it?

1840
01:09:30.619 --> 01:09:32.788
- There is. - It says, "Kim Jong Kook".

1841
01:09:33.622 --> 01:09:35.191
It's written clearly.

1842
01:09:36.792 --> 01:09:41.297
(While Jong Kook was covering his face...)

1843
01:09:41.697 --> 01:09:43.299
She's writing his name when he's covering his face.

1844
01:09:43.299 --> 01:09:44.800
(So Min is taking the chance.)

1845
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:49.772
(So Min wrote Jong Kook's name.)

1846
01:09:49.805 --> 01:09:52.041
I can't believe you.

1847
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:54.276
The whole time, I was...

1848
01:09:55.144 --> 01:09:56.512
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1849
01:09:56.512 --> 01:09:57.546
There are three balls.

1850
01:09:57.546 --> 01:09:58.781
So Min will pick one.

1851
01:09:59.315 --> 01:10:01.684
- So Min will pick one. - Yes.

1852
01:10:01.684 --> 01:10:03.018
Pull it out at once.

1853
01:10:03.185 --> 01:10:04.253
Just do it.

1854
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.355
The one who gets chosen...

1855
01:10:06.355 --> 01:10:08.023
- will pay. - Should I pick this one?

1856
01:10:08.224 --> 01:10:11.160
I can spend this much for the members.

1857
01:10:12.328 --> 01:10:14.330
Pick Jae Seok.

1858
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:19.168
Go after Sinsa-dong Mudfish.

1859
01:10:19.235 --> 01:10:21.704
Just pick one at once.

1860
01:10:22.238 --> 01:10:23.639
Who is it?

1861
01:10:23.639 --> 01:10:24.707
(Who did she pick?)

1862
01:10:24.707 --> 01:10:27.476
The total cost of your tour was...

1863
01:10:27.476 --> 01:10:28.644
300 dollars.

1864
01:10:28.644 --> 01:10:30.112
(The one who gets chosen has to pay 300 dollars.)

1865
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.914
Who is it?

1866
01:10:31.914 --> 01:10:34.783
(Seok Jin will pay for the fishing.)

1867
01:10:35.451 --> 01:10:36.585
Really?

1868
01:10:36.585 --> 01:10:38.754
(Annoyed)

1869
01:10:40.589 --> 01:10:43.792
(Thank you for everything, Seok Jin.)

1870
01:10:43.792 --> 01:10:45.728
I'm so happy.

1871
01:10:46.328 --> 01:10:47.563
So Min, that little...

1872
01:10:47.796 --> 01:10:49.798
I should have written her name.

1873
01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:51.934
Something is being printed.

1874
01:10:52.535 --> 01:10:53.769
It's a receipt.

1875
01:10:53.769 --> 01:10:55.571
(Seok Jin pays 300 dollars.)

1876
01:10:56.272 --> 01:10:58.240
I recommended this activity for Seok Jin.

1877
01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.242
- He should pay. - Thank you for the good time.

1878
01:11:00.242 --> 01:11:01.777
(Team Fishing is finished.)

1879
01:11:02.711 --> 01:11:03.979
Let's do this.

1880
01:11:04.513 --> 01:11:06.048
- Is it our turn? - Do we go first?

1881
01:11:06.282 --> 01:11:07.950
Be confident and bright.

1882
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:10.019
I'm getting nervous now.

1883
01:11:10.019 --> 01:11:11.954
We're more serious than ever.

1884
01:11:12.021 --> 01:11:13.522
This is not a competition.

1885
01:11:13.923 --> 01:11:15.491
We're here to enjoy ourselves.

1886
01:11:17.326 --> 01:11:19.728
(They learned swing dance for an hour.)

1887
01:11:19.728 --> 01:11:21.630
- Good! - Nice.

1888
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:24.333
(They learned swing dance for an hour.)

1889
01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:29.271
(Will they be able to pull it off?)

1890
01:11:29.905 --> 01:11:31.607
Play the music.

1891
01:11:31.607 --> 01:11:33.809
(The music starts.)

1892
01:11:35.477 --> 01:11:38.681
(They're getting into the rhythm.)

1893
01:11:38.681 --> 01:11:41.517
(They make an eye contact.)

1894
01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.723
(They're pulling off the steps perfectly.)

1895
01:11:49.758 --> 01:11:51.193
(She's back to her confident self.)

1896
01:11:52.461 --> 01:11:56.198
(Perfect teamwork)

1897
01:11:59.335 --> 01:12:02.471
(They're perfectly in sync.)

1898
01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.509
(They even look relaxed.)

1899
01:12:09.745 --> 01:12:13.515
(Ji Hyo is doing a great job.)

1900
01:12:17.219 --> 01:12:22.291
(They spent only an hour to prepare for this performance.)

1901
01:12:23.192 --> 01:12:25.027
(It's the most difficult part.)

1902
01:12:26.362 --> 01:12:28.497
(They perfectly manage it.)

1903
01:12:29.298 --> 01:12:33.736
(Ji Hyo has changed.)

1904
01:12:34.203 --> 01:12:35.871
They're so calm.

1905
01:12:36.538 --> 01:12:38.140
She is doing so well.

1906
01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.375
I'm exhausted.

1907
01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:40.376
(It's time to jump.)

1908
01:12:40.943 --> 01:12:43.112
(Jump)

1909
01:12:44.346 --> 01:12:46.315
(Freestyle dance of each team)

1910
01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:51.053
(The name of this dance is "Floundering in the sea of swing".)

1911
01:12:52.154 --> 01:12:53.756
(They finish it off nicely.)

1912
01:12:55.124 --> 01:12:58.394
(Bravo)

1913
01:12:58.394 --> 01:12:59.862
Great job.

1914
01:12:59.862 --> 01:13:02.531
- We did it! - It was perfect.

1915
01:13:02.965 --> 01:13:04.900
Nevis Swing.

1916
01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.168
Respect, respect.

1917
01:13:06.168 --> 01:13:07.269
(Respect)

1918
01:13:07.269 --> 01:13:09.171
Good teamwork.

1919
01:13:09.838 --> 01:13:11.206
As soon as the music started,

1920
01:13:11.206 --> 01:13:13.842
both of you looked like different people.

1921
01:13:13.842 --> 01:13:15.944
They changed at once.

1922
01:13:16.078 --> 01:13:17.713
- They're talented. - Totally.

1923
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.282
I didn't expect such great teamwork.

1924
01:13:20.282 --> 01:13:22.117
- It was amazing. - You did a fantastic job.

1925
01:13:22.117 --> 01:13:23.185
Great teamwork.

1926
01:13:23.185 --> 01:13:24.353
It was definitely therapeutic.

1927
01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.721
We're taking a day off today.

1928
01:13:25.854 --> 01:13:27.589
All right. Next...

1929
01:13:27.589 --> 01:13:28.957
- You win. - Give it a try.

1930
01:13:28.957 --> 01:13:30.492
- Just try. - I don't remember a thing.

1931
01:13:30.492 --> 01:13:32.161
- They did it at one go. - Next team.

1932
01:13:32.361 --> 01:13:33.696
Let's welcome the next team.

1933
01:13:33.896 --> 01:13:35.064
Haha and...

1934
01:13:35.064 --> 01:13:36.231
- Kwang Soo. - Let's go.

1935
01:13:37.199 --> 01:13:38.300
Let's go.

1936
01:13:38.534 --> 01:13:39.868
Haha looks great.

1937
01:13:39.868 --> 01:13:41.103
Take a pose.

1938
01:13:41.103 --> 01:13:42.171
(Haha looks like a newsboy.)

1939
01:13:43.038 --> 01:13:44.039
Are you ready?

1940
01:13:44.039 --> 01:13:45.040
Let's get it.

1941
01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.975
(Let's get it.)

1942
01:13:48.744 --> 01:13:50.345
(Warming up)

1943
01:13:51.613 --> 01:13:54.116
(They look too excited.)

1944
01:13:54.116 --> 01:13:55.384
Are we paying with a company card?

1945
01:13:55.617 --> 01:13:56.885
Let's do that.

1946
01:13:57.086 --> 01:13:58.320
Swing.

1947
01:13:59.021 --> 01:14:00.489
- Swing, swing, swing. - Way to go!

1948
01:14:00.489 --> 01:14:01.824
(Their steps are energetic.)

1949
01:14:03.692 --> 01:14:05.961
(Their facial expressions are priceless.)

1950
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:11.233
(Great teamwork between the tallest and the shortest)

1951
01:14:11.233 --> 01:14:14.403
(They're perfectly in sync.)

1952
01:14:17.773 --> 01:14:19.808
Nice facial expression.

1953
01:14:19.808 --> 01:14:21.376
(They're natural-born swing dancers.)

1954
01:14:24.813 --> 01:14:27.783
(The audience looks somewhat uncomfortable.)

1955
01:14:33.021 --> 01:14:35.858
Nice! Way to go!

1956
01:14:36.992 --> 01:14:37.993
(It's time to jump.)

1957
01:14:37.993 --> 01:14:39.294
Look at him.

1958
01:14:41.597 --> 01:14:43.532
(Success)

1959
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.635
(How will they finish it off?)

1960
01:14:51.774 --> 01:14:53.041
(Shorty's freeze)

1961
01:14:54.143 --> 01:14:55.177
(Fantastic collaboration of swing dance and B-boying)

1962
01:14:55.177 --> 01:14:56.411
Respect!

1963
01:14:59.181 --> 01:15:02.618
(Haha and Kwang Soo's performance is finished.)

1964
01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.823
I want to cry for some reason.

1965
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:09.191
Let's give them a big hand.

1966
01:15:10.926 --> 01:15:13.495
(Swing dance class for Haha is over.)

1967
01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:18.066
The amount of money you spent for this activity...

1968
01:15:18.233 --> 01:15:21.003
- is 320 dollars in total. - Okay.

1969
01:15:21.003 --> 01:15:22.070
(It was for registering for the class and buying props.)

1970
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.505
Before we calculate the balance,

1971
01:15:23.839 --> 01:15:26.141
let's check the golden bell box.

1972
01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:27.976
We probably won't have anybody.

1973
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:30.846
- Won't they spin the roulette? - We'll use the company card.

1974
01:15:30.846 --> 01:15:32.014
(If there's nobody, they'll use the company card.)

1975
01:15:32.281 --> 01:15:33.382
Let's use the company card.

1976
01:15:33.382 --> 01:15:35.184
(A few hours ago on their way to the swing dance class)

1977
01:15:35.184 --> 01:15:36.518
Let's say swing, swing.

1978
01:15:36.518 --> 01:15:39.588
(This team decides to use the company card.)

1979
01:15:40.322 --> 01:15:42.291
(In a moment)

1980
01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:44.493
Is she in a sleeping cafe? I thought we didn't pick that one.

1981
01:15:45.961 --> 01:15:47.062
I know, right?

1982
01:15:47.062 --> 01:15:48.630
(She makes her own sleeping cafe.)

1983
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:49.832
Isn't this cheating?

1984
01:15:50.365 --> 01:15:52.167
She's not allowed to this.

1985
01:15:52.467 --> 01:15:56.538
She's in her own sleeping cafe. This doesn't make sense.

1986
01:15:56.538 --> 01:15:57.639
(They want to betray her.)

1987
01:15:57.906 --> 01:16:02.878
(They unite without Ji Hyo who's sleeping.)

1988
01:16:03.545 --> 01:16:06.515
(They decide to write Ji Hyo's name.)

1989
01:16:06.515 --> 01:16:07.549
Ji Hyo?

1990
01:16:08.784 --> 01:16:15.524
(They all vote for Ji Hyo.)

1991
01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:17.759
- There are names inside. - Please pick a name.

1992
01:16:17.793 --> 01:16:19.761
- Please call it out for us. - You can open it like this.

1993
01:16:20.262 --> 01:16:22.030
- You can pick whichever. - They are all in there.

1994
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:23.999
- You can read all of them. - All of them.

1995
01:16:23.999 --> 01:16:25.033
(It's from me, Haha, and Se Chan.)

1996
01:16:25.033 --> 01:16:26.068
There are four names.

1997
01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:33.542
(Ji Hyo won't just watch. She betrays them as well.)

1998
01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:35.744
(They unite over their betrayal for each other.)

1999
01:16:35.744 --> 01:16:37.512
- Four? - We all put it in? When?

2000
01:16:37.512 --> 01:16:39.481
(Who will ring the golden bell?)

2001
01:16:40.415 --> 01:16:41.583
Lee Kwang Soo.

2002
01:16:43.752 --> 01:16:44.887
Lee Kwang Soo.

2003
01:16:44.887 --> 01:16:46.822
(Did Ji Hyo write my name?)

2004
01:16:46.822 --> 01:16:47.990
Lee Kwang Soo.

2005
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:49.191
(It's him again.)

2006
01:16:49.191 --> 01:16:50.459
(He got two votes?)

2007
01:16:50.459 --> 01:16:52.527
Song Ji Hyo. It's all Song Ji Hyo.

2008
01:16:53.028 --> 01:16:54.162
I got two for Song Ji Hyo.

2009
01:16:54.162 --> 01:16:56.398
I got 2 for Lee Kwang Soo. It's 2 on 2.

2010
01:16:56.465 --> 01:16:57.833
- My goodness. - What happened?

2011
01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:59.801
- Who did that? - Somebody bent their promise.

2012
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:01.470
Who did you write?

2013
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:02.604
(Which of you is it?)

2014
01:17:02.604 --> 01:17:03.839
- Who is it? - Hold on.

2015
01:17:03.839 --> 01:17:05.107
- Ji Hyo, I wanted to stop. - Who is it?

2016
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.408
That's not the problem right now.

2017
01:17:06.408 --> 01:17:07.943
It's 100 percent certain you wrote my name and I wrote yours.

2018
01:17:08.977 --> 01:17:10.012
This is obvious.

2019
01:17:10.512 --> 01:17:13.181
- I can't write my own name. - Right.

2020
01:17:13.315 --> 01:17:14.683
- That's right. - I'm getting goosebumps.

2021
01:17:14.683 --> 01:17:16.351
- It's either one of us. - Let's clean this up later.

2022
01:17:16.585 --> 01:17:18.186
Please pick one.

2023
01:17:18.186 --> 01:17:20.322
- Just 1? - Yes, you just need to pick 1.

2024
01:17:20.322 --> 01:17:21.957
If it's against Ji Hyo...

2025
01:17:21.957 --> 01:17:25.060
(Is it Kwang Soo or Ji Hyo?)

2026
01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.461
Make sure nobody sees it.

2027
01:17:28.363 --> 01:17:30.065
(What's that supposed to mean?)

2028
01:17:30.065 --> 01:17:31.800
I think this person has a connection with me.

2029
01:17:32.134 --> 01:17:33.435
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2030
01:17:33.435 --> 01:17:36.672
(Who will pay for everything?)

2031
01:17:38.707 --> 01:17:40.309
(It's Kwang Soo.)

2032
01:17:40.309 --> 01:17:41.410
It's Kwang Soo.

2033
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:45.580
(Kwang Soo has to pay 320 dollars with his personal credit card.)

2034
01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.249
Ji Hyo got lucky again.

2035
01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:52.521
- Thanks. This was therapeutic. - I know. Thanks.

2036
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:54.623
- Please turn on some music. - Thanks so much.

2037
01:17:54.656 --> 01:17:57.059
- Isn't this a party? - Let's go party.

2038
01:17:57.059 --> 01:17:58.126
Let's go.

2039
01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.729
(He dances as soon as the music comes on.)

2040
01:18:00.729 --> 01:18:01.763
Let's go.

2041
01:18:01.763 --> 01:18:04.032
(This is a party. Thanks, Kwang Soo!)

2042
01:18:05.267 --> 01:18:08.236
(Swing dance is scary, everybody.)

2043
01:18:09.204 --> 01:18:12.808
(The swing dance was therapeutic for their body and soul.)

2044
01:18:14.042 --> 01:18:16.611
(I'm happy as long as you are.)

2045
01:18:18.013 --> 01:18:20.582
(Kwang Soo pays 320 dollars, and the swing dance is over.)

2046
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:24.052
Thank you, Kwang Soo.

2047
01:18:24.052 --> 01:18:26.521
- Thank you. - That was very therapeutic.

2048
01:18:26.521 --> 01:18:30.525
I paid for it, and it was great.

2049
01:18:30.726 --> 01:18:33.795
I know Ji Hyo wrote my name.

2050
01:18:33.895 --> 01:18:35.330
Who was the other one?

2051
01:18:35.464 --> 01:18:37.065
It's already over so there's no point talking.

2052
01:18:37.065 --> 01:18:38.633
- Wasn't it you? - It wasn't me.

2053
01:18:38.633 --> 01:18:39.735
(Trust me.)

2054
01:18:41.103 --> 01:18:42.437
- Did you write my name? - I didn't.

2055
01:18:42.671 --> 01:18:44.406
I guess I wrote my own name.

2056
01:18:44.539 --> 01:18:46.141
I think you're mistaken.

2057
01:18:46.141 --> 01:18:47.376
I guess I did.

2058
01:18:47.776 --> 01:18:49.811
When you were sleeping, Kwang Soo said to pick you.

2059
01:18:50.045 --> 01:18:51.713
- That's not it. - So...

2060
01:18:51.713 --> 01:18:53.682
- I thought we were doing that. - Look at you.

2061
01:18:53.715 --> 01:18:56.785
You are such a jerk.

2062
01:18:56.785 --> 01:18:58.653
Watch this on TV.

2063
01:18:58.653 --> 01:19:00.255
He wanted to make you pay 500 dollars.

2064
01:19:00.322 --> 01:19:03.025
Anyway, he wanted to make you pay.

2065
01:19:03.025 --> 01:19:04.326
- Gosh. - I'm serious.

2066
01:19:04.326 --> 01:19:05.494
He wanted to make you pay 500 dollars.

2067
01:19:07.262 --> 01:19:09.097
Haha, let's go for some ramyeon.

2068
01:19:09.564 --> 01:19:10.732
There's one nearby.

2069
01:19:10.732 --> 01:19:11.900
(He's searching for a ramyeon buffet.)

2070
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.036
- Ramyeon... - Really?

2071
01:19:14.036 --> 01:19:16.071
(He tries calling them.)

2072
01:19:16.104 --> 01:19:17.873
- I hope... - How long would it take?

2073
01:19:17.873 --> 01:19:19.741
- Hello? - Hello.

2074
01:19:19.741 --> 01:19:21.777
Is this the ramyeon buffet?

2075
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.346
- Yes, it is. - Are you open today?

2076
01:19:24.646 --> 01:19:26.615
- Yes, we are. - Really?

2077
01:19:26.615 --> 01:19:28.050
- Really? - I guess they're not closed.

2078
01:19:28.417 --> 01:19:31.553
This is Yang Se Chan from Running Man.

2079
01:19:31.653 --> 01:19:33.055
- Okay. Hello. - Hello.

2080
01:19:33.055 --> 01:19:35.757
Can the eight of us come and eat now?

2081
01:19:36.224 --> 01:19:37.659
Yes, it's possible.

2082
01:19:38.427 --> 01:19:40.662
Thank you. We'll be on our way.

2083
01:19:40.896 --> 01:19:42.964
- Yes, thank you. - Thank you.

2084
01:19:43.265 --> 01:19:44.933
I've never been to such place.

2085
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.868
I'm going to make it good.

2086
01:19:46.868 --> 01:19:48.570
(He's planning to fill himself up with good ramyeon.)

2087
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:53.308
(There's 1 hour and 30 minutes left until the mission is over.)

2088
01:19:53.442 --> 01:19:55.177
Is this the famous...

2089
01:19:55.177 --> 01:19:56.311
- Yes. - Have you been here?

2090
01:19:56.812 --> 01:19:59.281
- Is this a snack stand? - It's like a convenience store.

2091
01:19:59.381 --> 01:20:01.049
- Look at all the ramyeon. - I know.

2092
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:04.686
- Amazing. - I didn't know this place existed.

2093
01:20:04.686 --> 01:20:06.254
There's tteokbokki too.

2094
01:20:06.254 --> 01:20:08.356
This is like a department store.

2095
01:20:09.024 --> 01:20:11.259
- Look. - You can pick your toppings.

2096
01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:13.095
This is perfect for me.

2097
01:20:13.095 --> 01:20:15.597
This is perfect for Jae Seok.

2098
01:20:15.597 --> 01:20:16.665
It's therapeutic for him.

2099
01:20:16.965 --> 01:20:19.534
- They have jjajang tteokbokki too. - They do.

2100
01:20:20.001 --> 01:20:21.369
- Do they have what I want? - I want this.

2101
01:20:21.369 --> 01:20:23.772
(They choose according to preference.)

2102
01:20:24.106 --> 01:20:25.574
Should I put in eggs now?

2103
01:20:25.774 --> 01:20:27.642
No, not yet. It has to boil first.

2104
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:31.580
I didn't know this place existed.

2105
01:20:31.613 --> 01:20:34.950
- It's cool that you can make it. - Right?

2106
01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:37.652
Jong Kook, this is a great gift for me.

2107
01:20:37.652 --> 01:20:39.054
- This is awesome. - Right?

2108
01:20:39.054 --> 01:20:40.489
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

2109
01:20:41.022 --> 01:20:44.526
(They start gulping it down.)

2110
01:20:45.861 --> 01:20:49.164
(It finally seems like they're on vacation.)

2111
01:20:49.164 --> 01:20:51.399
(Jong Kook tries the first frozen tteokbokki of his life.)

2112
01:20:52.033 --> 01:20:53.635
This is like real tteokbokki.

2113
01:20:54.469 --> 01:20:56.838
I didn't know you'd eat this.

2114
01:20:57.439 --> 01:20:59.541
(He's eating fast food.)

2115
01:20:59.641 --> 01:21:00.876
That's great.

2116
01:21:01.409 --> 01:21:02.644
- Were you sitting here, Kwang Soo? - Go ahead.

2117
01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.082
(Spurting)

2118
01:21:07.082 --> 01:21:11.019
(She spurts spicy sauce towards Haha.)

2119
01:21:11.553 --> 01:21:13.555
Look what So Min did to me.

2120
01:21:14.322 --> 01:21:15.924
(Thanks, So Min.)

2121
01:21:15.924 --> 01:21:18.160
- Look what she did to me. - I'm sorry, Haha.

2122
01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.294
It's okay.

2123
01:21:19.394 --> 01:21:20.929
You are kind of scary.

2124
01:21:21.163 --> 01:21:22.597
Put it in.

2125
01:21:22.597 --> 01:21:24.432
I have to use the sauce. What do I do?

2126
01:21:24.432 --> 01:21:25.934
This is spicy, So Min.

2127
01:21:26.468 --> 01:21:28.436
I don't have the sauce.

2128
01:21:29.304 --> 01:21:30.438
Do you have scissors?

2129
01:21:30.438 --> 01:21:31.573
(She spurts the sauce and collects it back.)

2130
01:21:31.573 --> 01:21:34.776
(She swallows it without biting the noodles off.)

2131
01:21:34.776 --> 01:21:35.944
This is awesome.

2132
01:21:36.845 --> 01:21:40.081
(We bought quite a lot.)

2133
01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:44.219
(Who's going to pay here?)

2134
01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.189
Let's spin the roulette.

2135
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:48.690
Let's do that.

2136
01:21:48.823 --> 01:21:51.159
We can stop people from getting near it.

2137
01:21:52.494 --> 01:21:55.030
I shouldn't do it. I'm not doing this.

2138
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:56.031
(He reflects on himself.)

2139
01:21:56.031 --> 01:21:58.133
- What is it? - Somebody did it, right?

2140
01:21:58.767 --> 01:21:59.935
Do what?

2141
01:21:59.935 --> 01:22:01.102
(Do what?)

2142
01:22:01.102 --> 01:22:02.137
So Min did, right?

2143
01:22:02.137 --> 01:22:05.373
It doesn't even cost a lot. Let's spin the roulette.

2144
01:22:05.373 --> 01:22:06.808
(This is their chance to unite.)

2145
01:22:06.808 --> 01:22:08.210
We finished the cheese.

2146
01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:09.377
Can we have more cheese?

2147
01:22:09.811 --> 01:22:11.680
- Do you want that? - Yes, I do.

2148
01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:13.615
Where are you going, Kwang Soo?

2149
01:22:13.615 --> 01:22:14.749
(He got caught.)

2150
01:22:15.784 --> 01:22:16.918
I'm going to the bathroom.

2151
01:22:17.319 --> 01:22:18.653
- Kwang Soo - Where did you go?

2152
01:22:18.954 --> 01:22:20.488
- Kwang Soo. - Let's stop.

2153
01:22:20.488 --> 01:22:22.757
He's addicted.

2154
01:22:23.058 --> 01:22:24.226
It's a disease.

2155
01:22:24.693 --> 01:22:26.394
Everybody,

2156
01:22:26.561 --> 01:22:30.532
you used 78 dollars in total here.

2157
01:22:31.366 --> 01:22:33.134
We can't use it all.

2158
01:22:33.134 --> 01:22:34.569
- We can't use 200 dollars. - We give up.

2159
01:22:34.603 --> 01:22:36.938
- There are 192 dollars left. - We can't use it.

2160
01:22:37.105 --> 01:22:39.341
- We didn't use enough. - We have to do waxing.

2161
01:22:39.341 --> 01:22:41.977
We spent less than 10 dollars per person.

2162
01:22:42.811 --> 01:22:45.947
Let's open the golden bell box.

2163
01:22:46.715 --> 01:22:47.983
Did anyone put a name in it?

2164
01:22:48.016 --> 01:22:49.484
I didn't do it this time.

2165
01:22:49.484 --> 01:22:51.319
(They wanted to use the company card this time.)

2166
01:22:51.319 --> 01:22:53.088
Should we eat more of this?

2167
01:22:53.321 --> 01:22:55.257
So many people have participated.

2168
01:22:55.857 --> 01:22:56.958
Really?

2169
01:22:57.259 --> 01:22:58.960
- Really? - There are so many.

2170
01:22:59.494 --> 01:23:01.429
(Jae Seok went to the bathroom 20 minutes ago.)

2171
01:23:01.429 --> 01:23:03.131
Where's the bathroom?

2172
01:23:05.433 --> 01:23:08.370
(He recommends Seok Jin.)

2173
01:23:11.706 --> 01:23:14.442
(We were thinking the same.)

2174
01:23:15.944 --> 01:23:17.045
It's full.

2175
01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.548
I'll pay for these two.

2176
01:23:20.915 --> 01:23:22.117
(They've been doing this for 8 years.)

2177
01:23:22.117 --> 01:23:23.218
Don't you have the other kind?

2178
01:23:23.218 --> 01:23:24.919
(They don't trust each other.)

2179
01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.888
Oh, gosh.

2180
01:23:27.455 --> 01:23:29.090
We did this again?

2181
01:23:29.257 --> 01:23:30.525
I just hope I don't get picked.

2182
01:23:30.525 --> 01:23:33.628
There's Se Chan, Kwang Soo, and Haha.

2183
01:23:34.663 --> 01:23:36.598
- Who wants to pick? - I will.

2184
01:23:36.965 --> 01:23:39.701
- There are so many of Seok Jin. - I'll pick.

2185
01:23:40.535 --> 01:23:41.770
Can he practice?

2186
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:42.871
- He can't. - No?

2187
01:23:43.271 --> 01:23:44.739
It's 50-50 chance.

2188
01:23:44.739 --> 01:23:46.775
I have 50 percent chance.

2189
01:23:47.108 --> 01:23:49.077
- I picked one. - The cost...

2190
01:23:49.311 --> 01:23:50.312
Show it.

2191
01:23:50.312 --> 01:23:55.083
(He already paid 300 dollars earlier and Kwang Soo paid a lot too.)

2192
01:23:55.083 --> 01:23:58.586
(Who will end up paying the most?)

2193
01:23:58.586 --> 01:24:01.089
(It's on me.)

2194
01:24:01.089 --> 01:24:02.090
Let's see.

2195
01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:05.026
(My gosh)

2196
01:24:05.927 --> 01:24:08.830
- Thank you, Seok Jin. - Thank you.

2197
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:10.699
Why does this happen?

2198
01:24:10.699 --> 01:24:13.535
Where do we go for the last one?

2199
01:24:14.202 --> 01:24:15.704
Let's go for waxing.

2200
01:24:15.704 --> 01:24:18.473
Since Kwang Soo recommended it, he has to do it.

2201
01:24:18.473 --> 01:24:20.408
But is that the rule? He must do it?

2202
01:24:20.408 --> 01:24:23.378
Se Chan got recommended, so he has to do it too.

2203
01:24:23.645 --> 01:24:26.681
The person who suggested it has to do it.

2204
01:24:26.815 --> 01:24:28.683
Then we'll do it,

2205
01:24:28.683 --> 01:24:31.019
- and we'll pick one more person. - Sure.

2206
01:24:31.019 --> 01:24:32.320
How much money do we have left?

2207
01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:34.823
It's 192 dollars.

2208
01:24:34.823 --> 01:24:36.358
If it's 30 dollars each...

2209
01:24:36.358 --> 01:24:37.992
Should we look into it?

2210
01:24:37.992 --> 01:24:40.795
- You should look into it first. - That's important.

2211
01:24:40.795 --> 01:24:42.697
Call a place nearby.

2212
01:24:43.531 --> 01:24:45.834
We have to get the price right too.

2213
01:24:45.834 --> 01:24:47.902
We can figure it out when we get there.

2214
01:24:47.902 --> 01:24:48.903
(The waxing service has to be exactly 192 dollars.)

2215
01:24:49.104 --> 01:24:50.772
Yes, this is the waxing shop.

2216
01:24:50.772 --> 01:24:52.807
Hello, is this the waxing shop?

2217
01:24:53.375 --> 01:24:55.944
- Yes. - Are you open today?

2218
01:24:56.678 --> 01:24:58.179
- We are. - I see.

2219
01:24:58.446 --> 01:25:01.049
How are the prices like?

2220
01:25:01.049 --> 01:25:02.217
(How are the prices here?)

2221
01:25:02.217 --> 01:25:04.285
What parts are you getting it done?

2222
01:25:04.285 --> 01:25:05.720
Excuse me.

2223
01:25:06.287 --> 01:25:09.657
We need to spend 192 dollars.

2224
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:13.361
I'm sorry. I know this is an odd situation.

2225
01:25:13.762 --> 01:25:17.665
We might need to film us waxing.

2226
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.535
Are you getting the Brazilian waxing?

2227
01:25:20.535 --> 01:25:21.803
- No, no. - No, no.

2228
01:25:21.803 --> 01:25:24.372
(Do you want to get the Brazilian waxing?)

2229
01:25:24.372 --> 01:25:26.141
- No, no. - No.

2230
01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:27.509
I'm sorry.

2231
01:25:27.509 --> 01:25:29.511
Why would we get Brazilian and film it?

2232
01:25:29.511 --> 01:25:30.612
No.

2233
01:25:30.745 --> 01:25:32.881
It would be dangerous to film it.

2234
01:25:32.914 --> 01:25:35.150
- It has to be on TV. - Not that type of filming.

2235
01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:36.751
- It has to be appropriate. - This is SBS.

2236
01:25:36.751 --> 01:25:38.520
It's on TV.

2237
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.822
If not Brazilian...

2238
01:25:40.822 --> 01:25:42.323
- Everything but that. - Legs or...

2239
01:25:42.323 --> 01:25:43.958
We can do any other part.

2240
01:25:44.592 --> 01:25:47.629
If we want to use 192 dollars, how many people should we have?

2241
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:49.197
- It's all men. - It's for men.

2242
01:25:49.431 --> 01:25:51.833
You can get your legs done.

2243
01:25:51.833 --> 01:25:53.735
- Three people? - Legs?

2244
01:25:53.735 --> 01:25:54.736
Okay.

2245
01:25:54.736 --> 01:25:56.805
- I'll send you our address. - Okay, thank you.

2246
01:25:56.805 --> 01:25:59.040
- Thank you. - We can check it there.

2247
01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.208
(The waxing shop is their final stop.)

2248
01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:02.377
(Will they be able to succeed in their mission within 35 minutes?)

2249
01:26:02.377 --> 01:26:03.445
Men and women?

2250
01:26:03.611 --> 01:26:05.480
- Yes, it's for both. - Hello.

2251
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.481
It's separate.

2252
01:26:06.514 --> 01:26:10.251
It's for three men. Does it hurt a lot?

2253
01:26:10.952 --> 01:26:14.689
Well, the pain is inevitable.

2254
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:17.091
If it's 192 dollars, what parts are they doing it?

2255
01:26:17.192 --> 01:26:19.093
2 people on their legs and 1 person on a single leg.

2256
01:26:19.093 --> 01:26:21.629
(1 person will get a single leg done.)

2257
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:22.664
No way.

2258
01:26:23.498 --> 01:26:25.200
We have to match the price.

2259
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.101
- It's his first time. - The price doesn't work out.

2260
01:26:27.101 --> 01:26:30.305
Can we do this then? The person who will get one leg done...

2261
01:26:30.305 --> 01:26:32.574
- 1 of 3? - Yes, it'll be 1 out of 3 of you.

2262
01:26:32.574 --> 01:26:34.108
Can we get three changes of clothes?

2263
01:26:34.108 --> 01:26:36.845
- Sure. - You can come over here.

2264
01:26:37.011 --> 01:26:40.782
This is so painful. Every week is so bad.

2265
01:26:41.015 --> 01:26:43.318
Please. I can't get waxing done.

2266
01:26:43.418 --> 01:26:44.886
I think Seok Jin is a good candidate.

2267
01:26:45.119 --> 01:26:46.588
You have 30 minutes left.

2268
01:26:46.588 --> 01:26:48.022
We have to hurry.

2269
01:26:48.022 --> 01:26:49.791
Let's pick one.

2270
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:52.293
We won't waste time.

2271
01:26:52.393 --> 01:26:55.296
When you all put down your heads, we'll throw this on top.

2272
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:57.599
- I have to tell this to my wife. - Please hurry up.

2273
01:26:57.599 --> 01:26:59.801
I'll remember this.

2274
01:27:02.337 --> 01:27:03.838
(This person will join Kwang Soo and Se Chan.)

2275
01:27:03.838 --> 01:27:06.140
- Just a moment please. - Make up your mind.

2276
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.141
Just a moment.

2277
01:27:07.775 --> 01:27:10.211
- Don't do that. You scared me. - Put your head down.

2278
01:27:10.211 --> 01:27:12.914
- Please put your head down. - Please.

2279
01:27:13.982 --> 01:27:15.016
I have to go somewhere with Dream.

2280
01:27:15.016 --> 01:27:16.818
Stop mumbling.

2281
01:27:16.818 --> 01:27:18.219
- Okay. - Please join us...

2282
01:27:18.219 --> 01:27:19.754
Please, sir.

2283
01:27:19.754 --> 01:27:21.723
Which member will join us?

2284
01:27:22.290 --> 01:27:23.691
We'll pick now. One.

2285
01:27:24.092 --> 01:27:25.126
Put your head down. Two.

2286
01:27:26.127 --> 01:27:31.499
(Who did Kwang Soo and Se Chan pick?)

2287
01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.934
Two.

2288
01:27:37.171 --> 01:27:39.974
(Seok Jin got picked.)

2289
01:27:40.108 --> 01:27:41.809
It worked.

2290
01:27:41.809 --> 01:27:43.311
It's not me.

2291
01:27:43.311 --> 01:27:45.547
Thank you. Thank you so much!

2292
01:27:45.613 --> 01:27:47.916
- Respect. - Respect.

2293
01:27:47.916 --> 01:27:49.617
Respect.

2294
01:27:49.617 --> 01:27:50.852
He wanted to do it.

2295
01:27:50.852 --> 01:27:53.421
- He wasn't even nervous. - He thinks it's obviously not him.

2296
01:27:53.421 --> 01:27:55.857
What do you mean? My heart was beating fast.

2297
01:27:55.857 --> 01:27:57.458
Should we do rock-paper-scissors?

2298
01:27:57.458 --> 01:27:58.760
Let's do rock-paper-scissors for one leg.

2299
01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.662
Do rock-paper-scissors and decide who it'll be.

2300
01:28:00.662 --> 01:28:01.896
Is it the loser or the winner?

2301
01:28:01.896 --> 01:28:02.897
The loser.

2302
01:28:03.097 --> 01:28:04.232
Rock-paper-scissors

2303
01:28:05.633 --> 01:28:06.768
(Se Chan wins.)

2304
01:28:06.768 --> 01:28:08.436
- Okay. - This is driving me nuts.

2305
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:09.571
Thank you.

2306
01:28:10.138 --> 01:28:11.406
I won.

2307
01:28:11.406 --> 01:28:14.008
Do rock-paper-scissors. We have no time.

2308
01:28:14.008 --> 01:28:16.044
- There are 15 minutes left. - I don't want to do just 1 side.

2309
01:28:16.044 --> 01:28:17.845
I really don't want that.

2310
01:28:17.845 --> 01:28:19.380
We have 15 minutes. Hurry.

2311
01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.415
Rock-paper-scissors.

2312
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:24.018
(This is between the two people who paid the most today.)

2313
01:28:24.018 --> 01:28:26.487
(Who will get one leg waxed and pay the fees?)

2314
01:28:26.487 --> 01:28:27.522
Rock-paper-scissors.

2315
01:28:28.356 --> 01:28:31.292
(It's Seok Jin.)

2316
01:28:31.292 --> 01:28:35.663
(Seok Jin gets to have one leg waxed and pay the fees.)

2317
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:38.700
(The Sinsa-dong Mudfish is completely ruined today.)

2318
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.569
- This is... - This is how it feels like.

2319
01:28:41.569 --> 01:28:43.705
It's so nice. It'll be quick.

2320
01:28:44.105 --> 01:28:46.674
I guess people film here. I had no idea.

2321
01:28:46.674 --> 01:28:49.010
We only have 20 minutes left. Let's hurry.

2322
01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:50.311
- Let's hurry. - Hurry.

2323
01:28:50.311 --> 01:28:51.746
- We have no time. - Hug the stuffed animal.

2324
01:28:51.746 --> 01:28:53.414
What's this?

2325
01:28:53.414 --> 01:28:55.416
- Is it that bad? - It won't hurt that much.

2326
01:28:55.416 --> 01:28:56.784
There's a stuffed animal to hug?

2327
01:28:57.585 --> 01:29:00.221
- I don't want to do it. - I have no hair.

2328
01:29:00.221 --> 01:29:02.056
- It'll be very painful. - Is it really bad?

2329
01:29:02.924 --> 01:29:04.192
I think it will.

2330
01:29:04.192 --> 01:29:05.827
Kwang Soo, it'll be worst for you.

2331
01:29:05.827 --> 01:29:10.765
That must be painful. His hair looks like ivy.

2332
01:29:10.765 --> 01:29:12.634
They are tangled up.

2333
01:29:12.634 --> 01:29:14.802
That looks like a rifle.

2334
01:29:14.802 --> 01:29:15.803
(Are you ready?)

2335
01:29:16.104 --> 01:29:17.572
What's this?

2336
01:29:17.572 --> 01:29:19.607
He put it on. I'm done. I have to do it.

2337
01:29:19.907 --> 01:29:22.276
He's going to rip it now.

2338
01:29:22.276 --> 01:29:23.645
(He keeps on talking.)

2339
01:29:23.645 --> 01:29:24.979
This is driving me crazy. What did I do wrong?

2340
01:29:25.513 --> 01:29:27.415
That hurts already.

2341
01:29:27.682 --> 01:29:29.584
You have the most amount of hair.

2342
01:29:29.584 --> 01:29:30.585
Hold on, sir.

2343
01:29:30.952 --> 01:29:32.687
Hold on.

2344
01:29:33.121 --> 01:29:35.890
Are you doing it already? Sir.

2345
01:29:38.426 --> 01:29:40.995
(He starts without warning since they have no time.)

2346
01:29:41.529 --> 01:29:42.730
(Look at all that hair.)

2347
01:29:42.730 --> 01:29:44.866
Wait. Wait a minute.

2348
01:29:45.099 --> 01:29:47.268
(It's clean.)

2349
01:29:47.268 --> 01:29:48.670
(That really hurts.)

2350
01:29:48.670 --> 01:29:50.705
It really hurts.

2351
01:29:51.039 --> 01:29:53.041
I'm serious.

2352
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:54.242
Does it really hurt?

2353
01:29:55.576 --> 01:29:58.279
(This is not the vacation I had in mind.)

2354
01:29:59.247 --> 01:30:02.316
(He wrote waxing this morning...)

2355
01:30:02.316 --> 01:30:05.219
(only to tease Se Chan.)

2356
01:30:05.219 --> 01:30:07.822
(You're lucky I stopped with waxing!)

2357
01:30:07.822 --> 01:30:10.124
(I was going to make you shave your head.)

2358
01:30:10.124 --> 01:30:13.695
(He thought only Se Chan would have to do it.)

2359
01:30:14.696 --> 01:30:16.631
(This is what he gets for his actions.)

2360
01:30:17.532 --> 01:30:19.567
(Look at his face.)

2361
01:30:21.102 --> 01:30:22.503
Get his hands.

2362
01:30:22.503 --> 01:30:24.105
- Does it hurt? - Please slow down.

2363
01:30:24.138 --> 01:30:25.573
Slow down.

2364
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:30.845
(That was unexpected.)

2365
01:30:31.746 --> 01:30:33.614
Excuse me. How could you?

2366
01:30:33.614 --> 01:30:35.516
(They never had such rude customers.)

2367
01:30:37.185 --> 01:30:38.886
That hurts.

2368
01:30:39.287 --> 01:30:40.988
We only have five minutes.

2369
01:30:40.988 --> 01:30:42.290
If we don't finish, do we fail?

2370
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:43.357
Flip over.

2371
01:30:44.392 --> 01:30:46.494
They have no mercy.

2372
01:30:46.861 --> 01:30:50.398
They really have no mercy.

2373
01:30:51.432 --> 01:30:52.967
That's how you are supposed to do it.

2374
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.769
That's my flesh. You just pinched me.

2375
01:30:54.769 --> 01:30:55.903
No, it's not.

2376
01:30:56.137 --> 01:30:58.206
- I think it's my flesh. - My gosh.

2377
01:30:58.239 --> 01:31:00.308
Look. Kwang Soo's legs are so pretty.

2378
01:31:00.308 --> 01:31:01.976
His legs are really pretty.

2379
01:31:02.410 --> 01:31:07.315
I'm worried about Seok Jin. What is he going to do with the other leg?

2380
01:31:07.315 --> 01:31:09.183
You should pay now.

2381
01:31:09.851 --> 01:31:11.652
- Pay now. - We are in trouble.

2382
01:31:12.386 --> 01:31:14.555
(They are almost done waxing with 3 minutes left.)

2383
01:31:14.555 --> 01:31:16.891
Why did you write this down, Kwang Soo?

2384
01:31:16.891 --> 01:31:17.892
(He's losing it.)

2385
01:31:17.892 --> 01:31:19.894
You are done. I'll hold you, Se Chan.

2386
01:31:19.927 --> 01:31:21.496
It's clean.

2387
01:31:21.562 --> 01:31:23.498
Thank you for the good work.

2388
01:31:23.498 --> 01:31:25.833
