1
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.330
You're not Kim Go Eun, are you?

2
00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:27.154
(Episode 2)

3
00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.469
Who are you?

4
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.240
You want me to attend the class?

5
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.049
I was wondering why you called.

6
00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.749
It was a waste of time.

7
00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.590
It must cost a lot to prepare for CSAT for the third time.

8
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.790
I'll pay you handsomely.

9
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.290
You can earn money and learn at the same time.

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.930
My school is famous for its psychology classes.

11
00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.700
As far as I remember, I thought you wanted to go to...

12
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.370
the psychology major at Eunha University when you were in high school.

13
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.799
Am I wrong?

14
00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:10.639
It's a general education curriculum?

15
00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:13.579
And it's once a week?

16
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.150
Try not to stand out, as if you're not even there.

17
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.980
Thanks, Han Ye Ri.

18
00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:23.889
Han Ye Ri?

19
00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.930
You're not Kim Go Eun, but Han Ye Ri?

20
00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:29.230
Let me go. Let me go!

21
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.299
Kim Go Eun!

22
00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.370
There's something I wanted to say to you!

23
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.169
Gosh.

24
00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.869
Where do you think you're going?

25
00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.940
- He has something to say to you. - Let me go.

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940
Let go. I'm not supposed to be here.

27
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.139
Let me go!

28
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.940
But...

29
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.810
I can't explain...

30
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.380
my love for you in words.

31
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.419
Gosh.

32
00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:51.549
Then don't do it.

33
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.450
Did I tell you to do it?

34
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.950
Just shut it and come down.

35
00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.720
Everyone's looking at me.

36
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.690
I need to run away.

37
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.160
Is that so embarrassing...

38
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.669
that you need to run away?

39
00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.639
So that's why I changed my mind.

40
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.769
I prepared this for you!

41
00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:16.440
This explains my love for you.

42
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.179
- No! - Kim Go Eun! I love you!

43
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.269
I love you!

44
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.609
- Byung Cheol! Byung Cheol! - Gosh.

45
00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:56.380
Be careful!

46
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.649
- What is he doing? - What was that?

47
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.829
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

48
00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.799
- Please get out of the way. - Why did she just leave?

49
00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.470
Please get out of the way.

50
00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.389
(I love you, Kim Go Eun, to the end of the universe.)

51
00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.399
I love you!

52
00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:51.000
Let's love each other forever!

53
00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.209
Eun Ho.

54
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.849
Hello, sir.

55
00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.120
I barely recognized you.

56
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.019
You changed a lot.

57
00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.829
You look so much better.

58
00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.930
You're exactly the same.

59
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.659
You haven't changed a bit.

60
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.440
A lot of people do tell me that I look young.

61
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.440
By the way, I don't think I deserve to see you like this.

62
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.510
I didn't even catch the mugger yet.

63
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.909
I know you've tried your best. There was nothing you could do.

64
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.219
There wasn't any witness, and I don't remember his face.

65
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.620
I was mugged on June 14th, right?

66
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.360
That's probably right.

67
00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:51.860
On that day, do you think...

68
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.870
June 14th.

69
00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:55.500
Lee Sun Mi, 25 years old,

70
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.500
was murdered in the same way at her house.

71
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.979
It's nothing.

72
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.479
By the way, I envy her.

73
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.920
If you get asked out like this in front of a lot of people...

74
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.649
By the way, where's Go Eun?

75
00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.289
She was here just a moment ago.

76
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.360
She ran away because she was embarrassed.

77
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.029
And that wasn't Kim Go Eun.

78
00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.380
- Gosh. - What is it? Are you embarrassed?

79
00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.209
Who are you?

80
00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:41.110
This place is too open.

81
00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:44.149
Or should we go...

82
00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:45.550
somewhere inside?

83
00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.550
What did you do to me?

84
00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.519
Do your parents know that you're like this?

85
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.899
This is part of the role play, right?

86
00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:59.599
This is new.

87
00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:01.829
Wait.

88
00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.099
Wait.

89
00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.370
Gosh.

90
00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:09.240
Please, stop.

91
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.289
I prepared this for you!

92
00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.289
This explains my love for you.

93
00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.430
I love you, Go Eun!

94
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:38.700
Gosh, I must have been out of my mind.

95
00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.909
Why would he do that in front of other people?

96
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.250
Why? Why? Why?

97
00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:55.389
I heard you've been attending my lecture for someone else.

98
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:57.889
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:01.430
If you want to punish me, I'll do whatever you say.

100
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.659
- You'll receive punishment? - Yes.

101
00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:07.200
Kim Go Eun will be receiving F as her grade.

102
00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.500
I'll think about what I should do with you, Han Ye Ri.

103
00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.139
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.940
I heard you're preparing to take CSAT for the third time.

105
00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:22.409
Aren't you busy with CSAT studies?

106
00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.250
Do you even have time to listen to this?

107
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.380
What do you mean?

108
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.120
I wanted to take your lectures since I was in high school.

109
00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:32.990
I know I shouldn't say this in a situation like this,

110
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.430
but can I get your autograph?

111
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.630
"The Criminal Mind" by Kim Joo Seok. This is from so long ago.

112
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.940
Did you buy it yourself?

113
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.170
Yes.

114
00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.769
All right.

115
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.510
What are you going to do with what happened yesterday?

116
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.250
Are you going to say yes?

117
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.620
I don't know him very well.

118
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.190
What? I thought he said he'd been tamed or something.

119
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.190
I don't know him well.

120
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.320
I'm sorry I attended your classes secretly,

121
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.129
but I don't think you should get involved in my personal life.

122
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.759
If you're done, I'll get going.

123
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.770
I need to go to work.

124
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.680
Did you hear that?

125
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.280
She says it's an invasion of privacy.

126
00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:33.719
It's a collaboration of lies and solidness.

127
00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:36.489
It's the type that I hate the most.

128
00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:38.989
It didn't feel like she was lying.

129
00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:41.790
I wasn't going to tell you this,

130
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.160
but she even flirted with me.

131
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.640
You know who I am, right?

132
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.369
And then she says, "I don't know him very well."

133
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.509
But seeing as she got protective, there must be something to it.

134
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.479
We'll have to find out if there's really something to it.

135
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.390
- Why? - It's nothing.

136
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.410
What is this?

137
00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:33.079
Get a hold of yourself.

138
00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:40.950
Are you ready to order?

139
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.390
I'd like a cup of Americano.

140
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.030
It's three dollars.

141
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.959
You can swipe the card and sign it yourself.

142
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.469
In that case, I'll pay in cash.

143
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.609
You gave me three dollars.

144
00:10:00.609 --> 00:10:03.109
Okay, so this is how you're going to play this?

145
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.379
You're going to ignore me like this?

146
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.780
What?

147
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.680
Did I surprise you yesterday?

148
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.290
I'm sorry. It's because I'm close to Byung Cheol.

149
00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:17.890
Anyhow, I apologize for what happened yesterday.

150
00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:22.900
Let's pretend like I accepted your apology.

151
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.800
Don't think about doing anything stupid.

152
00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:31.170
What? Something stupid?

153
00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:34.009
I heard rumors about you.

154
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.440
I heard you try to connect people to help them find love.

155
00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:42.209
Did Byung Cheol ask you to help him out?

156
00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:43.849
Did he ask you to help him ask me out?

157
00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:45.079
What?

158
00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:47.989
I don't know what kind of abilities you have,

159
00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:50.859
but don't try to act stupid with me.

160
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.400
And don't intervene with others' love life.

161
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.570
Just take care of yourself.

162
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.540
Thank you, Eun Ho.

163
00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:15.950
I have a serious atopic disease. This is the only water I can drink.

164
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.050
By the way,

165
00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:22.190
why would you like that cynical and mean girl?

166
00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:24.859
She's not mean.

167
00:11:25.459 --> 00:11:28.259
She does look cold and arrogant,

168
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.930
but she's so kind and sweet.

169
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.940
The strawberry latte you ordered is ready.

170
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.440
You should have it.

171
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.140
Oh, my. Is this for me?

172
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.940
Thank you.

173
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.290
How did you know I like strawberry latte?

174
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.989
Go Eun.

175
00:11:57.489 --> 00:11:58.959
Did you just arrive?

176
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.729
What is it?

177
00:12:01.729 --> 00:12:04.129
- Aren't you feeling well? - It's nothing.

178
00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:05.859
When you're sick,

179
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:08.599
my heart hurts even more.

180
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.640
I'm going.

181
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.280
- Excuse me. - Yes?

182
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.619
Do you want to have chicken at my house?

183
00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:32.420
She really said that?

184
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.229
You wouldn't know. Go Eun...

185
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:42.369
I mean, Ye Ri, has so many unexpected charms.

186
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.239
Her name is so pretty. Han Ye Ri.

187
00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:50.780
You're so deeply in love with her.

188
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.239
But...

189
00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.509
why does she keep pushing me away?

190
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.150
I can be really nice to her.

191
00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.050
I really like her.

192
00:13:01.249 --> 00:13:02.650
I'll help you.

193
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.259
Why are you crying?

194
00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:09.629
Eun Ho.

195
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.729
It's all right.

196
00:13:19.339 --> 00:13:21.140
Goodbye.

197
00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:26.280
Welcome.

198
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.599
Love is all about the timing.

199
00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:49.030
You need to watch for the chance when she feels tired and weak.

200
00:14:39.989 --> 00:14:42.420
Was there a road like this before?

201
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.099
This is so fun.

202
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.719
Next, make her feel as if she's become someone special.

203
00:15:13.089 --> 00:15:16.359
Such illusions help people fall in love easily.

204
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.989
That was strange.

205
00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:52.790
I'm sorry for what I did last time.

206
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.259
I didn't take your feelings into account. I was so selfish.

207
00:16:01.099 --> 00:16:04.400
Can you give me one last chance?

208
00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:09.839
I want to protect you all the time, like I did today.

209
00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:13.180
And then, there's the highlight.

210
00:16:32.499 --> 00:16:35.900
But how did you know I lived here?

211
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:41.039
That is...

212
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.380
Did you stalk me?

213
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:49.779
No, that's not what happened.

214
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.219
I warned you not to follow me.

215
00:16:57.219 --> 00:17:02.330
Didn't I warn you? You psycho.

216
00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:07.370
I didn't even hit you.

217
00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:11.170
He'd be doing all right.

218
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.709
Look at what happened.

219
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:23.120
I just did what you told me to do.

220
00:17:23.719 --> 00:17:25.979
You told me everything will work out.

221
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.789
What's wrong? Are you all right?

222
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:31.360
It doesn't matter anymore.

223
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.860
I'll just do as I like.

224
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.330
Hey.

225
00:17:36.459 --> 00:17:38.100
Hey, Byung Cheol!

226
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.969
Hey.

227
00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:44.239
Hey.

228
00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:49.039
Did you plan this?

229
00:17:51.309 --> 00:17:53.049
Did you think I would like something like this?

230
00:17:53.049 --> 00:17:56.420
If you weren't going to go out with him,

231
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.650
- why did you flirt with him? - Did you see me flirt?

232
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.989
Did you see me flirting with him?

233
00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:04.719
Well...

234
00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:09.130
If you do something like this again, I won't let you get away with it.

235
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200
Hey.

236
00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:37.219
Gosh, what is her deal?

237
00:19:25.243 --> 00:19:31.707
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E02 Meloholic "Ye Ri's Dual Personality"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

238
00:20:05.629 --> 00:20:07.129
Han Ye Ri.

239
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.730
- I love you. - Don't do that.

240
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.500
Han Ye Ri.

241
00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:18.139
Don't. Don't do it.

242
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.990
Gosh.

243
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.839
I'll text you the address. Please come here.

244
00:20:55.349 --> 00:20:56.450
Right now.

245
00:21:00.849 --> 00:21:02.389
Where am I?

246
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.859
The artist is trying to show modern people the real life...

247
00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:11.559
because they're so busy to actually live their lives.

248
00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:15.629
The artist is trying to say that resting is not about wasting time.

249
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:22.210
It's about looking back on our lives and finding ourselves.

250
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.710
We'll go to the next exhibition.

251
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.780
- Someone's sleeping over there. - Oh, my.

252
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.379
Who are you?

253
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.980
Sorry?

254
00:21:32.619 --> 00:21:33.750
Excuse me.

255
00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:38.490
Hey, lady!

256
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.290
Excuse me.

257
00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:44.930
- I'm so sorry. - Please hold on.

258
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.530
Go faster and catch her. Hey, lady!

259
00:21:54.639 --> 00:21:56.440
Yeo Jin, I'm here!

260
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.609
- Get on. - All right.

261
00:22:04.409 --> 00:22:05.680
Thank you.

262
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.520
Hey, lady. Wait!

263
00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:08.649
Hey!

264
00:22:08.649 --> 00:22:09.919
- Hey! - Stop there!

265
00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:17.260
This is not bad, right?

266
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.030
No, but can't you go slower?

267
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.099
I'm not even going fast.

268
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.569
I'm sorry Yeo Jin.

269
00:22:27.069 --> 00:22:28.409
What are you sorry for?

270
00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:30.669
You're doing this because of me.

271
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.980
It's nothing.

272
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.490
- Gosh, what should I do? - Did she reappear?

273
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.990
Why did it happen this time?

274
00:22:55.129 --> 00:22:57.470
Han Ye Ri!

275
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.240
Ye Ri!

276
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.270
Please talk to me.

277
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.480
Han Ye Ri!

278
00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:10.609
- Ye Ri! Let's talk. - Gosh, what's wrong with him?

279
00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:15.119
Ye Ri. Ye Ri.

280
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.119
- Ye Ri. - Be quiet.

281
00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.290
- I can't live without you. - Be quiet.

282
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.629
- I love you. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:23:23.629 --> 00:23:24.960
- I'm sorry. - Please accept my love.

284
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.500
- Go home. - Talk inside.

285
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.530
- Go home and be quiet. - I'm sorry.

286
00:23:31.569 --> 00:23:32.740
That's all I remember.

287
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.470
And then, as far as I remember, I woke up there.

288
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.540
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

289
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.480
There could be a trace somewhere.

290
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.819
Can I have this?

291
00:23:53.389 --> 00:23:54.460
It's 100 dollars.

292
00:24:00.399 --> 00:24:01.869
- 80. - All right.

293
00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:04.730
Yes! I got myself a dress!

294
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.010
You don't think I'd have done anything weird, right?

295
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:14.409
I'd just have gone to a club in that dress, right?

296
00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.480
I wouldn't have gone anywhere strange,

297
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.619
right?

298
00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:22.619
We could call Byung Cheol and ask.

299
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.119
I did.

300
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:25.690
But it's gone.

301
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.559
- What's gone? - His number.

302
00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:30.359
He got rid of his number.

303
00:24:32.329 --> 00:24:35.930
Something must have happened last night.

304
00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:32.520
Gosh, it was a dream.

305
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:36.930
Gosh, you surprised me.

306
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.129
I told you not to come in.

307
00:25:39.129 --> 00:25:41.200
I'm an adult now.

308
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.869
So what? Go out.

309
00:25:42.869 --> 00:25:45.700
You can have this. You deserve to have this.

310
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.300
This proves that I'm legally an adult.

311
00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:51.240
When I graduate, I'll...

312
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.839
What? Gosh.

313
00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:54.839
I'll marry you.

314
00:25:55.109 --> 00:25:57.950
Gosh, don't try to deny me. We're destined to be.

315
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.319
- I don't need it. - Gosh.

316
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.230
I'm going.

317
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.629
What just happened? Did Eun Ho leave?

318
00:26:17.099 --> 00:26:20.169
I woke up early to leave with him.

319
00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:22.909
Did you read novels from the internet all night?

320
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:24.740
Get a hold of yourself.

321
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.940
You're in your third year.

322
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.579
I want to get married to Eun Ho when I graduate.

323
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:37.149
Honestly, I want to get married now. But I'm holding myself back...

324
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.220
because of his social status and face.

325
00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:41.589
If you don't allow me to,

326
00:26:41.589 --> 00:26:42.760
I'll just do it anyway.

327
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.030
Gosh.

328
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:47.359
You've been quiet for a while. Why did you start again?

329
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.599
Eun Ho has a girl.

330
00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:52.500
He can't date anyone.

331
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.369
He does. I even know her name. Han Ye Ri.

332
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.510
How do you know?

333
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.040
He kept saying her name in his sleep.

334
00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:03.780
What is it? Do you know her too?

335
00:27:04.349 --> 00:27:05.649
Who is that witch?

336
00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:08.250
Why would you speak to someone you don't know like that?

337
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.919
Eat up.

338
00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.119
Who is she?

339
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.460
Gosh, Eun Ho.

340
00:27:17.859 --> 00:27:18.960
Han Ye Ri.

341
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.559
(Yoo Byung Cheol)

342
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.970
The number you have dialled is not available at this moment.

343
00:27:25.369 --> 00:27:27.470
What's wrong with him? Did he change his number?

344
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.290
Why does this keep happening?

345
00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:01.909
Hey!

346
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:08.139
I didn't recognize you.

347
00:28:08.139 --> 00:28:09.649
I'm sorry. Why did you call me?

348
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.379
About yesterday...

349
00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:17.720
It's nothing. You should get going.

350
00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:24.990
What's this? She ignored me yesterday.

351
00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:31.200
What's going on? Why does she keep changing.

352
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.500
Office assistant?

353
00:28:34.899 --> 00:28:35.970
Me?

354
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.839
I can't just forgive you for what you did.

355
00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:41.379
Instead, I want you to help me work for six months.

356
00:28:42.109 --> 00:28:44.349
I'll keep paying you. How do you like it?

357
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:45.819
I am...

358
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.349
becoming your office assistant?

359
00:28:48.589 --> 00:28:50.020
If you don't want to, you don't need to.

360
00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.990
I want to. It's not that I don't want to.

361
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.790
It's an honor. I'll try my best.

362
00:28:56.089 --> 00:28:57.159
Thank you.

363
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.700
You really like it, don't you?

364
00:29:01.659 --> 00:29:02.899
- Hey. - Hello.

365
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:04.829
Say hello.

366
00:29:05.169 --> 00:29:08.409
This is Han Ye Ri, the office assistant from now on.

367
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.609
And this is Yoo Eun Ho, my teaching assistant.

368
00:29:17.579 --> 00:29:18.579
What are you looking at?

369
00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:27.690
I'll go to class now.

370
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.930
Gosh, your face expression is so funny.

371
00:29:40.569 --> 00:29:42.609
Gosh, why did it have to be him?

372
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.040
That's what I should be saying.

373
00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:54.280
As it's already been decided, let's work well together.

374
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.690
We'll have to see each other everyday.

375
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.419
It won't do to be on bad terms like this.

376
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.359
All right.

377
00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:03.790
Let's work well together, Han Ye Ri.

378
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.680
What's your relationship with Byung Cheol?

379
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.079
Nothing happened between us.

380
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.379
Nothing happened between us.

381
00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.889
So he acted like that on his own even though you weren't interested?

382
00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:34.220
Let me go.

383
00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:41.460
What was that?

384
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.730
She wasn't lying.

385
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.270
There's no such woman who don't lie.

386
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.109
But it felt so different from when I touched others' hands.

387
00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:53.540
I keep telling you there's no such woman who doesn't lie.

388
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:58.550
There are only two kinds of women. Women you know, and those you don't.

389
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.290
So what's my ideal type?

390
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.319
Someone you don't know.

391
00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:06.020
That's right. Someone I don't know.

392
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.730
A stranger

393
00:31:19.139 --> 00:31:21.200
She did seem like a stranger.

394
00:31:21.569 --> 00:31:22.569
What?

395
00:31:22.569 --> 00:31:24.609
It's nothing.

396
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.609
I'm going.

397
00:31:32.379 --> 00:31:34.020
What would he do with his abilities?

398
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.050
He doesn't know how to use them.

399
00:32:27.569 --> 00:32:28.869
Wait!

400
00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:31.270
Excuse me!

401
00:32:38.819 --> 00:32:40.550
- Hello, Professor. - Hello.

402
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.889
Hello.

403
00:32:41.889 --> 00:32:43.520
- Hello. - Hello.

404
00:33:01.639 --> 00:33:04.210
- Hello, Professor. - Hello.

405
00:33:06.879 --> 00:33:08.849
I saw her come in here.

406
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:16.419
- I'll do it. Just give it to me. - Be careful.

407
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.990
You'll get hurt. Let's do it together.

408
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.990
It's fine.

409
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.330
(Hong Kyung Hye)

410
00:34:03.569 --> 00:34:05.839
If you want to eat, you should get a meal ticket.

411
00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:07.600
Excuse me?

412
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.569
If you want to eat, you should get a meal ticket.

413
00:34:10.939 --> 00:34:14.439
If I want to eat, I need to get a meal ticket? All right!

414
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:20.680
- Enjoy your meal, Professor. - Enjoy your meal.

415
00:34:23.289 --> 00:34:24.890
Where did she go?

416
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.339
Oh, my. This is so delicious.

417
00:34:51.709 --> 00:34:53.720
- Doesn't it seem strange? - It does.

418
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.289
I meant the rice.

419
00:34:56.289 --> 00:34:58.519
Isn't it a bit different from other kinds of rice?

420
00:34:58.519 --> 00:35:00.019
It's delicious. I...

421
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.560
I'm a Psychology Professor, Kim Joo Seung.

422
00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:05.600
And psychologically speaking,

423
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.530
it's something that I've never seen before.

424
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.399
It's so strange and sexy.

425
00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:12.100
I didn't mean that. I meant different.

426
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.240
There's air in between each rice.

427
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:20.979
I learned this skill when I worked at a sushi restaurant in Kyoto.

428
00:35:20.979 --> 00:35:22.050
Of course.

429
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.550
You put rice once,

430
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.350
and then some air.

431
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:46.740
Yes.

432
00:35:46.839 --> 00:35:50.310
So you mean you put rice in between air...

433
00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:53.310
I mean, you put air in between rice, right?

434
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.479
Yes.

435
00:35:54.479 --> 00:35:56.180
Enjoy your meal.

436
00:35:56.249 --> 00:35:57.950
Wait a moment.

437
00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:05.760
I want to use all these tickets...

438
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.959
for you, Kyung Hye.

439
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.600
Of course.

440
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.600
- Enjoy your meal. - Thanks.

441
00:36:28.209 --> 00:36:30.680
Does that mean Byung Cheol was lying?

442
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:32.879
But why?

443
00:36:33.879 --> 00:36:35.019
Eun Ho!

444
00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:36.519
Eun Ho!

445
00:36:37.649 --> 00:36:38.990
Have you seen Byung Cheol?

446
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.890
I've been looking for him too. Why are you looking for him?

447
00:36:42.629 --> 00:36:45.499
He missed all his morning classes, and I can't reach him.

448
00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.430
He won't do something like this. Do you think he's sick?

449
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.870
Gosh.

450
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.970
- Is it Byung Cheol? - No.

451
00:36:55.169 --> 00:36:58.510
It's my ex-girlfriend who still thinks that she's my girlfriend.

452
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.149
She's slow-witted, but she's so obsessive.

453
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.749
I can't block her number in fear that she might do something.

454
00:37:07.149 --> 00:37:08.649
How should I get rid of her?

455
00:37:12.819 --> 00:37:14.459
The legend who has returned to school.

456
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.399
Why doesn't he receive my call?

457
00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:21.800
He hasn't been contacting me for a while,

458
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.830
and he didn't receive my calls.

459
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.100
But he just changed his facebook profile,

460
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.470
and it says that he's not in a relationship.

461
00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.240
He also changed his email passwords.

462
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.510
He didn't even say he's going to break up with you. Just wait.

463
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.109
Do you think so?

464
00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.280
He texted me.

465
00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:43.089
Let's break up.

466
00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.189
Gosh, what should I do?

467
00:37:47.189 --> 00:37:48.729
What is it?

468
00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:57.300
She read it. She checked my message.

469
00:37:59.069 --> 00:38:01.200
Gosh, I'm so scared.

470
00:38:02.709 --> 00:38:05.709
But this kind of looks wrong.

471
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.050
You told me that your freedom is more important than your face.

472
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.749
Gosh.

473
00:38:12.479 --> 00:38:13.850
What should I do?

474
00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:15.149
Let's meet and talk.

475
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:22.660
She wants to meet me and talk.

476
00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.689
Then you should go and meet her.

477
00:38:40.539 --> 00:38:43.780
How can you end it with a text? Am I that easy to you?

478
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.749
How can you end it with a text?

479
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.289
Am I that easy to you?

480
00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:51.189
(I was afraid that...)

481
00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:56.890
I was afraid that it'd be too hard for me to say it to you directly.

482
00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.560
I was afraid that it'd be too hard for me to say it to you directly.

483
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.569
Gosh, I can't believe this.

484
00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:09.569
Why do you want to break up with me? Tell me the reason.

485
00:39:09.569 --> 00:39:11.010
Why do you want to break up with me?

486
00:39:12.209 --> 00:39:13.640
Did I do something wrong?

487
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.149
If you tell me, I'll fix everything. I can fix everything.

488
00:39:16.149 --> 00:39:18.649
Gosh, she's being stupid.

489
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.450
Gosh.

490
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.749
I told you not to act like that.

491
00:39:24.789 --> 00:39:27.459
Gosh, she's killing me.

492
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.990
There's nothing wrong with you. I'm just not sure of myself.

493
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.830
I'm sorry.

494
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.129
I'm just not sure I can be good enough for you. You deserve better.

495
00:39:36.129 --> 00:39:39.169
I don't need that. Tell me the real reason.

496
00:39:39.569 --> 00:39:42.470
If we're going to break up, let's be honest here.

497
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:44.839
I don't want you to get hurt.

498
00:39:45.379 --> 00:39:48.580
Let's not ruin the good memories we had.

499
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.910
You're just acting like a good man.

500
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.080
You need to tell me if you don't love me anymore...

501
00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.649
or if you have someone else so that I can move on.

502
00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.620
We started this together. Why do you end this on your own?

503
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:04.729
All right. Let's break up.

504
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.700
You wanted me to say this, right?

505
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.999
You coward.

506
00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:16.140
Who are you?

507
00:40:18.169 --> 00:40:20.640
Hey, why are you doing this?

508
00:40:20.939 --> 00:40:23.350
She's my friend. She gets like this when she gets upset.

509
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.019
Forget what she said. I'm never breaking up with you.

510
00:40:27.519 --> 00:40:28.720
Can you please leave me?

511
00:40:28.749 --> 00:40:30.819
When you're breaking up with someone you once loved,

512
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.760
you should meet her and talk to her.

513
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.789
That's the least you can do when you break up.

514
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.519
Gosh,

515
00:41:02.519 --> 00:41:04.519
I thought she had forgotten.

516
00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:07.390
I guess not.

517
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.459
But didn't I tell you that I was going to meet you and talk?

518
00:41:11.899 --> 00:41:15.629
Hey, I told you I'm sorry.

519
00:41:15.729 --> 00:41:17.800
Please don't get angry.

520
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:22.310
Why do you cling to a man like that?

521
00:41:22.669 --> 00:41:24.310
Don't you have any self-esteem?

522
00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:26.839
I mean...

523
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.780
He and I are...

524
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.819
What are you saying? Speak louder.

525
00:41:31.819 --> 00:41:33.950
He's good at it!

526
00:41:35.189 --> 00:41:36.890
Unlike what he looks like.

527
00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.129
It's not only that.

528
00:41:42.229 --> 00:41:45.700
He's also kind, he looks good looking,

529
00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:49.430
and he takes care of me. That's why.

530
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:50.830
Go home.

531
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.069
It feels like I've been wasting my feelings for you.

532
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:28.100
It's because of her ex-boyfriend that she dated three years ago.

533
00:42:28.569 --> 00:42:32.080
They were dating happily, but he suddenly disappeared.

534
00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:35.680
They broke up like that.

535
00:42:36.209 --> 00:42:38.280
She had such a hard time then.

536
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:48.760
When you break up with someone you loved, you should meet and talk.

537
00:42:49.089 --> 00:42:50.760
That's the least you can do when you break up.

538
00:42:51.459 --> 00:42:55.569
If you're sorry, how can you text me while you're with someone else?

539
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.800
You're a bad girl with no dignity...

540
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.280
that doesn't even have the least manners that a human should have.

(2014 Sunrise Youth Train)

543
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.910
I didn't know something like this existed.

544
00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:40.180
Look at this.

545
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.609
It includes the entrance fees for the tourist attractions and meals.

546
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.120
Do you want to go?

547
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.080
Yes.

548
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.419
It's on the last day of your contest submission.

549
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.560
It's all right. We can go later.

550
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.890
I can finish one day earlier.

551
00:43:58.229 --> 00:44:00.300
It's just because I want to go. Let's go.

552
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.169
All right.

553
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.200
You jerk.

554
00:44:12.979 --> 00:44:14.640
You scumbag.

555
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.649
I'm swearing instead of you.

556
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.419
He's worse than a jerk.

557
00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:30.859
Just cry.

558
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:33.100
Let me go.

559
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.970
You want to cry right now.

560
00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.600
What do you know?

561
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:41.810
It doesn't mean you're weak.

562
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.140
You don't cry because you're weak.

563
00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:48.180
You cry so that you can survive.

564
00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.319
So what I mean to say is,

565
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.919
it's all right for you to cry.

566
00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.189
You need to cry to shake things off.

567
00:45:02.289 --> 00:45:03.859
I...

568
00:45:05.729 --> 00:45:07.060
did too.

569
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.200
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

570
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.939
Something must have gotten inside my eyes.

Are you interested in me or not?

00:46:23.169 --> 00:46:25.479
I will help you break your jinx.

574
00:46:25.539 --> 00:46:29.680
You're someone whom even my soul would fall in love with as...

575
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.680
- you don't pretend or lie. - I love you.

576
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.120
I gave you so many signals.

577
00:46:33.649 --> 00:46:36.390
Is it because of your ex-boyfriend? What did I do wrong?

578
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.850
Don't fall in love with a psycho.

579
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.060
Be careful.

580
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.419
Han Ye Ri is bad luck for you.

581
00:46:40.419 --> 00:46:42.160
- Gosh. - You've been branded.

582
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.689
I think you'd better tell him everything.

583
00:46:44.689 --> 00:46:46.959
Tell him about the evil thing within you.

584
00:46:46.959 --> 00:46:48.300
I should just end this.

585
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:49.569
Suicide.

586
00:46:49.569 --> 00:46:51.200
I'm going to end everything.

587
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.370
Han Ye Ri! No, you shouldn't!

588
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.470
Han Ye Ri!
