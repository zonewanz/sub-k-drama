00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:08.792
Honey.

2
00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:10.761
Hello.

3
00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:15.065
Hyun Soo.

4
00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:34.718
Hello, Mother. Hello, Professor Min.

5
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.453
Hyun Soo.

6
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.625
Chef On, come over here.

7
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:42.993
They're Hyun Soo's parents.

8
00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:44.928
Okay.

9
00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:50.133
Who are they?

10
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.769
They're my parents.

11
00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.305
They wanted to cheer me up, 
so they came to buy me a meal.

12
00:00:56.673 --> 00:01:00.243
Hello. I'm On Jung Sun, 
Hyun Soo's boyfriend.

13
00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:02.746
Oh, I see. Hello.

14
00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:03.947
Hello.

15
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:05.749
Just a moment.

16
00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:08.518
I'm so busy.

17
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.521
Mom, this is my boyfriend.
 His name is On Jung Sun.

18
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.123
He already introduced himself.

19
00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:16.626
My gosh.

20
00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.864
That woman over there is Jung Sun's mother. 
You should say hello.

21
00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:24.501
Do we have to go over there?

22
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.739
- I'll bring her here. - Wait.

23
00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:31.975
I don't know what the right order is.

24
00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:33.977
- Dad. - Yes?

25
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.679
What should I do?

26
00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:44.254
Honey, we should go over there and say hi.

27
00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:47.791
Okay.

28
00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.003
Hello, I'm Hyun Soo's dad.

29
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.973
Hello, I'm Hyun Soo's mom.

30
00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:11.515
Hello, I'm Jung Sun's mom.

31
00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.251
And this is my fiance.

32
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.387
He's a professor at Seomyun University, 
and he's also an artist.

33
00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:20.757
Hello.

34
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:23.693
Oh, yes. Hello.

35
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:41.878
(Temperature of Love)

36
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.649
(Episode 23)

37
00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.624
You've practically devoted 
your life to this office.

38
00:02:55.058 --> 00:02:57.694
Why are you at work on a holiday? 
Your employees won't like it.

39
00:02:58.228 --> 00:02:59.663
You're so talkative.

40
00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.165
You're talkative, but you rarely say anything useful.

41
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.435
I heard you're going to sign a contract with Director Min.

42
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.536
Is that true?

43
00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:08.772
Director Min is still above average.

44
00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:10.874
The only reason he ruined "Unruly Detectives" is because...

45
00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:12.142
he tried too hard to do well.

46
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.311
I'll be able to sign him at a cheap price because he failed.

47
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:16.546
How can you say that as if it has nothing to do with you?

48
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.847
You're the one who failed.

49
00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:19.115
The drama's going to end earlier than planned.

50
00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.184
We didn't lose money, so it doesn't matter.

51
00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:22.886
My gosh, you're incredible.

52
00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:24.854
You didn't lose money even when the drama ended earlier than planned?

53
00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:27.557
You really have everything you want except for love.

54
00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:33.830
How's "Kind Soup"?

55
00:03:33.997 --> 00:03:37.300
Hyun Soo sent me the synopsis and script, but I haven't read it yet.

56
00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:39.402
Now that the ending's changed,

57
00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:40.971
the way that the story unfolds has changed too.

58
00:03:41.238 --> 00:03:42.305
It's become a lot brighter. I like it.

59
00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.841
I should ask the Planning Team to look over it...

60
00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.209
and talk to Hyun Soo afterwards.

61
00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:48.979
Don't you like the fact that the ending's changed?

62
00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.380
I should read it to be sure,

63
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.582
but I don't like it.

64
00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.022
Why is Hyun Soo eating with her parents instead of eating with us?

65
00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:01.825
She came to eat with her family. It's natural for her to be there.

66
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:03.927
But I care for her so much.

67
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:05.895
I'm going to become her mother-in-law.

68
00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:09.165
Do you want to become a mother-in-law?

69
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.701
No, you're right.

70
00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:15.672
I suddenly got reminded of my past mother-in-law. I was so sick of her.

71
00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:26.616
Overall, the food here is very refreshing.

72
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.989
Chef On's dishes are the best.

73
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.326
Not only do they taste nice, but it's also hard to forget about them.

74
00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:38.328
- I agree with you. - Right?

75
00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:41.498
But the portions are too small.

76
00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.068
I enjoyed his dishes.

77
00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:47.604
I knew it. You and I have similar tastes.

78
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.709
We should go now. You said you need to get back to work.

79
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.312
Did you enjoy your meal?

80
00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:58.181
Yes, it was nice.

81
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.384
You should visit again. The menu's going to change next month.

82
00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:05.288
Okay, we will. We'll leave after we say goodbye...

83
00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:06.589
to your mother and her fiance.

84
00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:08.158
Honey.

85
00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:21.604
It was nice meeting you.

86
00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:25.442
It was nice...

87
00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:55.472
You don't need to pay.

88
00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.073
They already paid.

89
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.109
We paid in advance because we knew you'd do this.

90
00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:01.978
Today was an official family outing.

91
00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:03.713
So please invite us again next time.

92
00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:06.816
Okay.

93
00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:08.418
Honey, let's go.

94
00:06:08.418 --> 00:06:09.519
Bye.

95
00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:14.057
Call me.

96
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.504
(Commission Fee, Summary of Commission Fee)

97
00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:35.545
Here's the business consulting report of Good Soup.

98
00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:36.746
(Report on how to improve the management performance of Good Soup)

99
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.817
(Report on how to improve the management performance of Good Soup)

100
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.020
(Good Soup, Current Status)

101
00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:48.858
It's time for you to get involved.

102
00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:50.894
Chef On won't be able to bring out good results...

103
00:06:50.894 --> 00:06:52.529
within the year if he keeps doing things his way.

104
00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.198
Please schedule a meeting with Chef On.

105
00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:56.699
Okay, sir.

106
00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:13.116
It's a report on how to overcome the deficit of Good Soup.

107
00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:23.560
(Report on how to improve the management performance of Good Soup)

108
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.995
They think the quality of your food and meal courses are great.

109
00:07:26.062 --> 00:07:29.032
I also agree with that point. That's why I invested in you.

110
00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:30.166
So?

111
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.237
I want you to give me a report on sales and purchase orders.

112
00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:36.706
This isn't what you promised. It hasn't been a year yet.

113
00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.910
I can't just let you go bankrupt during the remaining time.

114
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.280
You're the one who told me that you won't make me lose money.

115
00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:46.716
You should still keep your promise.

116
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.687
I don't want any money that comes from anything other than Good Soup.

117
00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:53.890
Fine, I'll let you get involved in this.

118
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.593
But keep in mind that I'm only doing this because it's you.

119
00:07:58.862 --> 00:08:00.730
I've been nothing but sincere towards you until now.

120
00:08:05.368 --> 00:08:08.171
I'll give you a report on recent sales and purchase orders.

121
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:24.254
You're right. He tends to be like that.

122
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.022
I don't know why... Get back to work.

123
00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:28.791
Hello, Mr. Park.

124
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:58.588
Keep up the good work.

125
00:08:58.721 --> 00:08:59.822
- Yes, Mr. Park. - Yes, Mr. Park.

126
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:06.563
Gosh, that was scary.

127
00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:17.907
Chef On seemed very decent.

128
00:09:18.074 --> 00:09:21.110
Yes. He thinks decently too. I have a lot to learn from him.

129
00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:22.879
He's more mature than I am.

130
00:09:23.112 --> 00:09:24.347
He's competent too.

131
00:09:24.414 --> 00:09:26.683
He's quite young to have his own restaurant.

132
00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:30.520
His mom must be really rich.

133
00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:34.290
I don't know about that. Someone invested in his restaurant.

134
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.759
What does his father do?

135
00:09:37.193 --> 00:09:38.294
I don't know.

136
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:40.597
How can you not know about that when you're dating him?

137
00:09:40.863 --> 00:09:42.799
They'll slowly get to know about those things.

138
00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.034
She's only getting to know him right now.

139
00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:46.302
You're right, Dad.

140
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.539
Does she live with that man?

141
00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:53.042
Isn't she going to get married to that professor?

142
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.545
I think so.

143
00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:57.880
She's really free-spirited.

144
00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:04.087
When did she get divorced?

145
00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:08.391
He must've gotten hurt if they got divorced when he was a teenager.

146
00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:12.061
Mom, what is it that you want to say?

147
00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:14.364
I have a lot of things I want to say, but I'm not going to.

148
00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:16.899
It's not like...

149
00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:20.136
you introduced him to us as your fiance. You're just dating him.

150
00:10:20.803 --> 00:10:22.005
Honey, we should go now.

151
00:10:22.005 --> 00:10:23.573
What? Okay.

152
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.942
- We'll go now. - Okay.

153
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.383
I was going to go, but I came back.

154
00:10:34.017 --> 00:10:35.184
Why did you come back?

155
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.088
Are you going to get married to Hyun Soo soon?

156
00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:40.890
Why do you ask?

157
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.826
You can't get married to her. Give me your word on that.

158
00:10:44.327 --> 00:10:45.528
You have so much to do in the future.

159
00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:48.197
You're not supposed to get involved in our relationship.

160
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:50.433
It's just like how I respect your private life.

161
00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:52.168
Even if I don't get involved,

162
00:10:53.336 --> 00:10:55.038
Hyun Soo's parents will.

163
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.308
I may be immature at times,

164
00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:01.277
but I've lived longer than you.

165
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.147
I can already tell how things are going to unfold.

166
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:06.949
Her parents aren't going to like you that much.

167
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.485
Do you know how Hyun Soo's mom looked at me?

168
00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:13.523
Mom, please stop viewing the world only in your perspective.

169
00:11:13.523 --> 00:11:15.491
You should try thinking in other people's shoes.

170
00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:17.827
How do you think I'd feel if you say that?

171
00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:19.362
Can't I say what I felt?

172
00:11:19.495 --> 00:11:21.664
What you feel isn't always right.

173
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:24.267
Hyun Soo and I are adults, and that means we can...

174
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.235
get married without having to ask for our parents' permission.

175
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.306
If we ever break up, that's going to be on us, not our parents.

176
00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:34.243
So you'll never be able to influence what happens to our relationship.

177
00:11:35.244 --> 00:11:37.113
You're so resolute.

178
00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:40.983
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

179
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.255
Have you been doing well?

180
00:11:46.723 --> 00:11:47.757
Yes.

181
00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:51.561
I met with Jung Woo. He hasn't ready your script yet.

182
00:11:52.428 --> 00:11:53.763
He wants you to come to his office.

183
00:11:54.263 --> 00:11:57.934
He could've called her himself. Why did he tell you to tell her?

184
00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.303
Would you want to call her if you were him?

185
00:12:00.503 --> 00:12:03.406
He has a really strong pride. He's only seeing her because of work.

186
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.842
How did you think of the script?

187
00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:07.443
I like the edited version.

188
00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:09.612
If Jung Woo approves of it, I'll report it to the company.

189
00:12:09.746 --> 00:12:11.247
Do you think your company will air my drama?

190
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.515
I dropped out of my last drama.

191
00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:14.417
It may have been for the best.

192
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.886
"Unruly Detectives" is going to end earlier than planned.

193
00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:21.524
Did On Entertainment suffer from a huge loss?

194
00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:25.294
He apparently didn't lose any money. Isn't he incredible?

195
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.997
You should get married to a guy like Jung Woo.

196
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.800
Love is useless. You only end up getting hurt.

197
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.470
Life is already full of scars and hardships.

198
00:12:34.771 --> 00:12:38.441
The happiness we get from love can't be exchanged with anything.

199
00:12:42.578 --> 00:12:44.447
- What are you looking at? - I'm looking with my own eyes.

200
00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:45.782
Do I need permission to do that?

201
00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:47.984
Yes, you do because you're looking at me.

202
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.923
Kyung, now that Hong Ah's not here, you're fighting with Joon Ha.

203
00:12:54.457 --> 00:12:56.225
Since we're talking about Writer Ji,

204
00:12:56.225 --> 00:12:58.294
Jung Woo said he's going to make her work with Director Min.

205
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:01.631
Do you think Hong Ah's crazy enough to work with Director Min?

206
00:13:01.898 --> 00:13:03.232
There's no way she will.

207
00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:05.268
When does Mr. Park want to see me?

208
00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:07.036
Call him.

209
00:13:08.604 --> 00:13:09.705
Okay.

210
00:13:18.247 --> 00:13:19.348
This is Park Jung Woo.

211
00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:21.517
Mr. Kim. Did you read the script?

212
00:13:23.686 --> 00:13:25.721
Yes. I'm reading it for the second time.

213
00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.723
Do you have time in the evening?

214
00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:29.559
Yes.

215
00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:31.561
Have dinner beforehand.

216
00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:33.863
I have a dinner appointment, so I can't eat with you.

217
00:13:34.363 --> 00:13:35.431
Okay.

218
00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:54.483
Why aren't you saying anything about my script?

219
00:13:56.552 --> 00:13:58.187
It was an easy read.

220
00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:01.424
It was very provocative.

221
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:04.560
I wrote it based on a true story.

222
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.829
Reality is crazier than drama.

223
00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:10.066
I'm not saying it was bad.

224
00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:14.537
Can you schedule it to be aired?

225
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:18.641
I can't make that decision alone. It has to go through a meeting.

226
00:14:19.242 --> 00:14:21.911
There's a high probability if it's backed by a director.

227
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.313
- A director? - The company...

228
00:14:24.814 --> 00:14:26.916
wants to give it to director Kim Joon Ha.

229
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.486
It's time for him to direct one. You know him, don't you?

230
00:14:31.153 --> 00:14:33.689
I know him well because he's a close friend of Hyun Soo.

231
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.392
I think he's preparing something with Hyun Soo.

232
00:14:37.193 --> 00:14:38.361
It's not for sure though.

233
00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:49.772
Have a seat.

234
00:14:56.379 --> 00:14:57.980
("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

235
00:14:58.681 --> 00:14:59.715
I don't like it.

236
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.852
- Pardon? - It was better before the revision.

237
00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:05.054
Why did you change it to a happy ending?

238
00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:06.789
Because I was following the character...

239
00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:08.190
Did you project yourself into it?

240
00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:12.161
You have a tendency to write your story.

241
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:15.431
I got the motif, but I don't write stories by projecting myself.

242
00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:17.466
I showed all my cards to you two.

243
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.039
I'm not saying anything about that day.

244
00:15:23.472 --> 00:15:25.274
Because I don't want to hurt you.

245
00:15:26.409 --> 00:15:27.877
Did I look pitiful?

246
00:15:29.478 --> 00:15:31.380
The reason why I stayed quiet all these years...

247
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.417
is because I was certain that you'd end up with me.

248
00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:37.787
But you've changed.

249
00:15:37.987 --> 00:15:39.088
I have.

250
00:15:39.555 --> 00:15:42.024
I've in pain for five years because of him. I can't change.

251
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.427
I've been in pain for five years. I can't change either.

252
00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.135
Let's go our own ways.

253
00:15:54.337 --> 00:15:56.138
Then we'll meet at some point.

254
00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:06.215
Can you leave your personal feelings out of it?

255
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.650
I can.

256
00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:11.220
I wanted to produce this drama for its sad ending.

257
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.123
A romance drama with a sad ending can easily have low ratings.

258
00:16:14.123 --> 00:16:16.559
I'm not trying to make money with your work.

259
00:16:17.026 --> 00:16:18.394
I like a unique drama...

260
00:16:18.661 --> 00:16:21.097
loved by minor audience.

261
00:16:21.097 --> 00:16:23.199
I want to write a popular drama.

262
00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:26.335
A drama with a happy ending that makes people happy.

263
00:16:26.469 --> 00:16:27.937
If you keep arguing,

264
00:16:28.437 --> 00:16:30.106
then I'll have to go with your opinion.

265
00:16:30.706 --> 00:16:32.241
But this should have a sad ending.

266
00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:44.887
Mr. Yoo.

267
00:16:45.221 --> 00:16:47.123
- Hyun Soo. - Hi.

268
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.758
What brings you here, Hyun Soo?

269
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:51.961
Are you here to do an interview for your drama?

270
00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:55.731
- Did you have dinner here? - Yes.

271
00:16:56.499 --> 00:16:57.967
I'll get going now.

272
00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:00.569
- Bye, Hong Ah. - Bye, Hyun Soo.

273
00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:07.743
Are you cold?

274
00:17:07.843 --> 00:17:09.412
No. I'm fine.

275
00:17:10.046 --> 00:17:11.647
I said we could talk on the phone.

276
00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:13.582
No, we should talk face-to-face.

277
00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:15.484
You met my parents for the first time.

278
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.288
How were they?

279
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:22.491
Your dad was really nice.

280
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:24.894
My dad really likes you.

281
00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:26.996
My mom does, too.

282
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.233
Though my parents would like anyone I date.

283
00:17:32.435 --> 00:17:33.936
They trust my decision.

284
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.973
You have a sister who's quite tough, don't you?

285
00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:40.209
Yes. She's married.

286
00:17:40.443 --> 00:17:42.711
Her kid is four years old. She can speak really well.

287
00:17:44.213 --> 00:17:47.083
My brother-in-law is gentle and tenacious, so he has the upper hand.

288
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.484
But she's still happy.

289
00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.121
When you saw her before,

290
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.357
she was having a hard time because of a breakup.

291
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.760
So she was taking it out on me.

292
00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:00.863
My parents...

293
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.833
are so in love that they don't care about their children.

294
00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:08.437
They're retiring soon, so they're excited to travel together.

295
00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:14.610
What's your father like?

296
00:18:16.045 --> 00:18:17.279
He's a dentist in Bundang.

297
00:18:18.414 --> 00:18:21.383
I asked him what he's like, but he tells me his occupation.

298
00:18:22.118 --> 00:18:23.619
Does he not want to talk about it?

299
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.222
Or has it not been resolved yet?

300
00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:31.327
How's work? Did you finish your script?

301
00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:34.730
I submitted the summary and the revision.

302
00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:38.234
Mr. Park doesn't like the revised summary.

303
00:18:40.102 --> 00:18:41.871
What happens if he doesn't like it?

304
00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:45.107
Either I revise it again or persuade him.

305
00:18:46.675 --> 00:18:47.776
What will you do?

306
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:53.082
I'll have to think about it and talk Joon Ha.

307
00:18:53.082 --> 00:18:54.517
Because he's the director.

308
00:18:57.853 --> 00:18:59.522
How's your restaurant?

309
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.060
Once the consultation result is out, it'll be run differently.

310
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.830
I can't...

311
00:19:08.964 --> 00:19:10.633
not see Mr. Park regarding work.

312
00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:14.603
Are you upset?

313
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.112
I'm not happy about it, but there's nothing I can do.

314
00:19:24.313 --> 00:19:25.814
Thanks for understanding.

315
00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:30.719
We can do it.

316
00:19:32.788 --> 00:19:34.056
We'll do great.

317
00:19:47.136 --> 00:19:48.404
I'm back.

318
00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:50.472
You're welcome anytime.

319
00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:54.443
Soo Jung. Aren't you being too pretentious?

320
00:19:56.212 --> 00:19:57.947
Think whatever you like.

321
00:19:58.147 --> 00:19:59.815
You do whatever you like anyway.

322
00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:04.620
Soo Jung.

323
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.323
Can you give me the wine list for the Christmas promotion?

324
00:20:07.823 --> 00:20:08.891
Okay.

325
00:20:10.826 --> 00:20:11.961
Aren't you saying hi to me?

326
00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:15.364
You say hi to me even when I don't.

327
00:20:21.403 --> 00:20:22.671
Are you mad at me?

328
00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:25.574
Why would I be mad? You always do whatever you like.

329
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:28.110
So you don't like me anymore?

330
00:20:28.277 --> 00:20:29.378
Hong Ah.

331
00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:32.047
Liking you is my problem, not yours.

332
00:20:32.514 --> 00:20:34.183
I didn't like you because you were nice to me.

333
00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.518
Are you dating Soo Jung?

334
00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:39.955
Dating a girl while liking someone else is bad.

335
00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:41.390
Don't you think it's a habit?

336
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:45.127
Because I've been liking you for a long time.

337
00:20:46.795 --> 00:20:48.631
These days, I think...

338
00:20:49.298 --> 00:20:50.633
a habit can be fixed.

339
00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:52.234
Don't think that.

340
00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.003
I'm bored without you.

341
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:56.038
If you say that I'll feel bad. I've already made up my mind.

342
00:20:56.038 --> 00:20:58.774
Why did you make up your mind? Just do as you please.

343
00:20:58.774 --> 00:21:00.709
I'm sick of unrequited love.

344
00:21:00.943 --> 00:21:02.678
Before Soo Jung told me her feelings,

345
00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:05.781
I didn't know how pathetic people thought of me.

346
00:21:08.751 --> 00:21:10.753
Chef, here you go.

347
00:21:10.753 --> 00:21:11.787
(Christmas Promotion Wine List)

348
00:21:11.787 --> 00:21:12.888
Thank you.

349
00:21:14.323 --> 00:21:15.391
Wait.

350
00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:19.261
I have something to tell you with Hong Ah here.

351
00:21:21.964 --> 00:21:24.533
Thank you for telling me your feelings in front of Hong Ah.

352
00:21:25.434 --> 00:21:27.503
But I overreacted because I was upset with Hong Ah.

353
00:21:29.138 --> 00:21:31.807
I told her to get your permission because I was yours.

354
00:21:33.676 --> 00:21:34.777
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:37.746 --> 00:21:38.847
It's okay.

356
00:21:39.448 --> 00:21:40.649
I'm sorry...

357
00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:43.352
for meddling with your life without your permission.

358
00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:45.988
Bye.

359
00:21:51.193 --> 00:21:53.262
There are so many good women out there.

360
00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:58.367
I'm trying to figure out how I can love a good woman.

361
00:22:02.338 --> 00:22:04.139
I brought my car. I can go by myself.

362
00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:05.941
I'll walk you to your car.

363
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.844
Hyun Soo.

364
00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:11.246
I thought you left earlier.

365
00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:13.182
Are you going home?

366
00:22:13.882 --> 00:22:15.250
Yes, I am.

367
00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:17.753
I want to go with you. I'm having a hard time.

368
00:22:17.786 --> 00:22:19.021
I need to talk to you.

369
00:22:23.325 --> 00:22:24.693
What's wrong?

370
00:22:25.327 --> 00:22:26.829
Won Joon has changed.

371
00:22:27.162 --> 00:22:28.530
He's become defiant.

372
00:22:29.064 --> 00:22:32.067
My work is going well. I don't know why he's doing that.

373
00:22:32.234 --> 00:22:34.703
Won Joon has been the same all along.

374
00:22:35.204 --> 00:22:36.405
It's about time he's tired of it.

375
00:22:37.239 --> 00:22:39.041
You're saying exactly what Won Joon said.

376
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:42.611
Liking a person isn't easy, though it looks easy.

377
00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:46.482
Be nice to him. Don't regret it after he leaves you.

378
00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:49.451
I think you're lucky in many ways.

379
00:22:50.152 --> 00:22:53.589
Your work seems to be in progress again.

380
00:22:54.323 --> 00:22:55.657
You have your love.

381
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:59.128
You have everything you need. Why do you compare yourself?

382
00:22:59.194 --> 00:23:01.563
It's not like I want to. I just can't help it.

383
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.866
I'm going to go inside now. It's cold.

384
00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:09.338
When's the second report going to come out?

385
00:23:09.338 --> 00:23:11.640
It'll be ready soon. He gets things done very quickly.

386
00:23:14.009 --> 00:23:16.178
But why is he doing this when it hasn't even been a year yet?

387
00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:18.414
I wonder if it's because of Hyun Soo.

388
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.716
Do you think he lost his judgment because he got shocked?

389
00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:22.484
He's not the type to lose his judgment.

390
00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:24.253
You're right.

391
00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:27.322
But I'm surprised that Hyun Soo never fell for him...

392
00:23:27.423 --> 00:23:30.392
when he made it obvious that he likes her.

393
00:23:31.693 --> 00:23:33.562
Hong Ah would've fallen for him a long time ago.

394
00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:36.198
Will you really be able to stop liking Hong Ah?

395
00:23:36.432 --> 00:23:38.267
I might not be able to, but I'm still going to try.

396
00:23:38.634 --> 00:23:40.469
I always supported your love.

397
00:23:41.069 --> 00:23:42.905
Hong Ah reminds me of my mom.

398
00:23:43.472 --> 00:23:45.441
I kind of feel sorry for her.

399
00:23:45.808 --> 00:23:46.875
Really?

400
00:23:47.376 --> 00:23:49.845
I understand why Soo Jung confessed her feelings for you.

401
00:23:49.912 --> 00:23:51.947
You're a very attractive guy.

402
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:57.052
You're the best, Chef On. You're making my heart feel warm.

403
00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:00.355
Anyway, what are you going to do?

404
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:04.293
Don't you think Hyun Soo would want to get a proposal from you?

405
00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.497
What does that matter?

406
00:24:08.497 --> 00:24:10.532
I'm sure she knows how much I love her.

407
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:13.068
You're right.

("Kind Soup Will Not Pick up His Calls")

409
00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:31.253
A happy ending. They won't break up.

410
00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:34.156
A sad ending. They'll break up.

411
00:24:34.957 --> 00:24:36.758
Which one is more realistic?

412
00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:39.394
Which one will be more popular?

415
00:25:14.496 --> 00:25:15.531
Hello?

416
00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:18.033
I have the second consultation report for Good Soup.

417
00:25:18.634 --> 00:25:20.469
I'm quite busy today.

418
00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:23.171
So I want you to come by my office during the break time.

419
00:25:24.406 --> 00:25:25.507
Okay.

420
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:31.113
Chef On is here to see you.

421
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.248
Sit down.

423
00:25:42.424 --> 00:25:43.492
You should read it.

(Good Soup, Problem Analysis)

425
00:25:57.005 --> 00:26:00.175
(A Change in Interior Design, Current Status)

426
00:26:07.182 --> 00:26:08.984
Do you want me to start by changing the interior?

427
00:26:10.118 --> 00:26:12.754
That's going to be inefficient since it'll cost a lot of money.

428
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:15.190
I want you to change the menu.

429
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:17.125
You want me to change the menu?

430
00:26:17.526 --> 00:26:19.261
The menu itself is great.

431
00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:20.896
But it doesn't go well with our culture.

432
00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:23.532
The food's too light, and the portions are too small.

433
00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:24.833
The ingredients are too pricey too.

434
00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:26.368
That's why you can't make any profits.

435
00:26:27.002 --> 00:26:28.837
So you want me to earn money by...

436
00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:30.973
using cheaper ingredients while we leave it at the same price?

437
00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:32.608
I'm not saying you should do that forever.

438
00:26:32.608 --> 00:26:34.543
You can go back to how things were once things become stable.

439
00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:37.646
Do you think the customers will wait until then?

440
00:26:37.913 --> 00:26:39.548
I can't lie to people who come to my restaurant...

441
00:26:39.548 --> 00:26:41.216
because they trust me and like my food.

442
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.785
I can't cook good quality food with cheap ingredients.

443
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.688
Then you need to fire a few employees.

444
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:48.824
What?

445
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.595
You have too many workers compared to the number of customers.

446
00:26:53.629 --> 00:26:57.099
You can fire two waiters and the youngest chef in the kitchen.

447
00:26:57.633 --> 00:27:00.168
Good Soup is a fine dining restaurant.

448
00:27:00.168 --> 00:27:02.971
The workers I have is the minimum number of employees I need...

449
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:04.439
in order to provide customers with a fine dining service.

450
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.009
How can I fire them when they're finally showing great teamwork?

451
00:27:07.142 --> 00:27:09.645
Is the allergy incident the result of great teamwork?

452
00:27:15.017 --> 00:27:17.919
You need to make alterations in either the ingredients or employees.

453
00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:19.488
What if I can't?

454
00:27:19.855 --> 00:27:21.289
Then...

455
00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:23.759
I might have to retrieve the investment I made.

456
00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:25.327
That's a breach of contract.

457
00:27:25.327 --> 00:27:27.029
Then I'll leave that to our friendship.

458
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:28.063
Jung Woo.

459
00:27:32.634 --> 00:27:33.735
Let me ask you one thing.

460
00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:36.138
Is this the immature fight for blind love...

461
00:27:36.138 --> 00:27:37.339
that you were talking about?

462
00:27:37.606 --> 00:27:39.107
Are you going to use work to sway us?

463
00:27:39.207 --> 00:27:40.409
Are you exhausted already?

464
00:27:40.876 --> 00:27:42.044
This is only the beginning.

465
00:27:44.646 --> 00:27:46.014
You can give up right now if you want to.

466
00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.819
Then I'll stop swaying you...

467
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.155
to get Hyun Soo.

468
00:27:55.791 --> 00:27:57.426
Do you have no affection for me?

469
00:27:57.793 --> 00:27:58.894
I do.

470
00:28:00.862 --> 00:28:03.098
I like you. But if I have to choose between the two of you,

471
00:28:06.101 --> 00:28:07.169
it's Hyun Soo.
