<i>[Episode 3]</i>
Joon, you're here to help me?

3
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.006
You came on your own?

4
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:27.348
So, you were worried about me,
weren't you?

5
00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:30.063
No, I'm here because of money.

6
00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.269
Huh?

7
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.302
<i>Joon.</i>

8
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:39.358
<i>Don't make important decisions
in your life based on money.</i>

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.090
You know, the world...

10
00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:47.257
it doesn't always work out
the way you think it will.

11
00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:53.531
I felt I had no choice and ended up
making a cowardly decision.

12
00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:59.027
I hope you don't live the way I do, Joon.

13
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.614
<i>I didn't know what
he had meant by that back then.</i>

14
00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:06.269
<i>Dad, you were right.</i>

15
00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:09.112
<i>The world doesn't always
work out the way I want.</i>

16
00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:13.493
<i>Young Ho got very injured.</i>

17
00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:15.563
<i>I need 10 million won.
What can I do?</i>

18
00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:18.462
<i>The only person
your mom can ask is you.</i>

19
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.075
I'm busy enough living my own life.

20
00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.069
Why would I worry about
some rich guy like you?

21
00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.110
I came because of money.
You have a lot of money.

22
00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:38.562
How much do you need?

23
00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:41.389
In return for getting you out of here...

24
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.300
I think I'll charge
about five million won.

25
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.401
How about it?

26
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.576
- Five million won?
- Yes, five million.

27
00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.680
Is that too much?

28
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.914
In return, I have a condition too.

29
00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:00.263
What's the condition?

30
00:02:00.263 --> 00:02:05.156
Until I can go home...
will you stay by my side, Joon?

31
00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:09.623
I have to be on the run for now.

32
00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:13.389
I'll pay you the average salary
of a Gangsu Group secretary.

33
00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:16.246
<i>How frustrated do you think
I am to be doing this?</i>

34
00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:18.539
<i>Think of it as helping me out.</i>

35
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.270
<i>Isn't there somewhere
you could get money?</i>

36
00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:22.131
<i>Joon.</i>

37
00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:27.354
<i>Don't make important decisions
in your life...</i>

38
00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.074
based on money.

39
00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.544
What do you think about my offer?

40
00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:42.354
<i>But, Dad...
Do you know what?</i>

41
00:02:43.153 --> 00:02:47.876
<i>Important decisions
don't exist in my life.</i>

42
00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:50.735
<i>I'm just trying to survive, day by day.</i>

43
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.322
I'm in.

44
00:02:59.338 --> 00:03:03.329
Then is today our first day?

45
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.368
Yes, our first day.

46
00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.717
<i>First day?</i>

47
00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:12.530
What are you guys talking about?

48
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.308
Byun Hyuk! Hey, Byun Hyuk!

49
00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.936
There's a back exit in the garage.

50
00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.612
Wait for us there.

51
00:03:18.612 --> 00:03:20.349
Wait, a back exit?

52
00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.258
Hey, Baek Joon.

53
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.992
We're heading down now.

54
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.610
Get in. Hurry, hurry.

55
00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:49.357
Excuse me.

56
00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:06.709
Joon? We're alone, right?

57
00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:09.194
- Are we in the elevator?
- Be quiet!

58
00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.572
I'll join you.

59
00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:27.355
What's going on?

60
00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:46.475
You know that suite room?

61
00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:47.699
Yes?

62
00:05:48.137 --> 00:05:51.959
Is this the guest staying there?

63
00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:55.439
Oh... I really don't know.

64
00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.300
Really? Please take a closer look.

65
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.574
Why look again?

66
00:05:59.574 --> 00:06:02.026
It's my first time seeing that person.

67
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.072
Sorry.

68
00:06:23.653 --> 00:06:24.716
It's all right.

69
00:06:30.812 --> 00:06:33.565
Oh, there must be a mosquito in here.

70
00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:37.615
Oh my.

71
00:06:38.293 --> 00:06:39.887
It's very hot.

72
00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.259
If you happen to see this guest,
could you please contact...

73
00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.858
Sorry, but it's against
the hotel rules to do so.

74
00:06:46.858 --> 00:06:49.014
Still, if you could cooperate...

75
00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:52.336
We're not allowed to talk about
guests to external parties.

76
00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:54.103
Think of it as doing a good thing...

77
00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:55.593
I said that I can't!

78
00:07:06.795 --> 00:07:10.156
I'm sorry... sorry.

79
00:07:51.307 --> 00:07:52.610
Hold up, there.

80
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:55.322
Wait!

81
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.692
Hold on!

82
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.846
Hey!

83
00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:06.011
Move. Get out of the way.

84
00:09:11.711 --> 00:09:12.836
Excuse me.

85
00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:15.567
What are you doing here?

86
00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:19.128
You can't just come in here.

87
00:09:19.128 --> 00:09:20.407
Sorry.

88
00:09:27.677 --> 00:09:29.215
- Where is he?
- Jae Hoon!

89
00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:30.902
Oh, where is Kwon Jae Hoon?

90
00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.721
Jae Hoon, Jae Hoon!

91
00:09:32.721 --> 00:09:34.250
- Hey, hey!
- Jae Hoon!

92
00:09:39.014 --> 00:09:40.225
Get in!

93
00:09:52.943 --> 00:09:55.361
You should've turned
your phone off beforehand.

94
00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.932
Who would message me at a time like that?

95
00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:00.552
<i>Hyuk, why can't I contact you?</i>

96
00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:03.216
<i>Let's meet up and talk. Huh, huh?</i>

97
00:10:03.216 --> 00:10:05.123
Chae Ri, why are you doing this to me?

98
00:10:05.123 --> 00:10:06.625
Chae Ri? Who's that?

99
00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.104
- You don't need to know.
- You don't need to know.

100
00:10:08.332 --> 00:10:11.442
Anyway, Baek Joon.
Why did you suddenly get involved?

101
00:10:11.442 --> 00:10:13.341
What's this about "first day"? Tell me.

102
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:16.089
Oh, Joon agreed to be
my personal secretary.

103
00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:17.298
Who said you can?

104
00:10:17.298 --> 00:10:19.115
She's my secretary,
so it's up to me.

105
00:10:19.115 --> 00:10:22.255
Hey, you're not in the position
to make decisions like that.

106
00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.264
I'm the one who's looking after you.

107
00:10:24.264 --> 00:10:26.265
I have to take responsibility
if anything happens.

108
00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:27.816
- So, I can't?
- You can't.

109
00:10:27.816 --> 00:10:29.634
That agreement is void.
There's no contract either.

110
00:10:29.634 --> 00:10:31.806
Don't you know that
verbal contracts are binding too?

111
00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:34.047
Yeah, we shook on it too, right?

112
00:10:34.047 --> 00:10:36.128
Joon, you can't handle Hyuk.

113
00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:37.620
You do it, so why can't I?

114
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.000
Drunk driving, disturbance
in clubs, public urination...

115
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.158
Can you handle that?

116
00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:42.558
What? Public urination?

117
00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:44.096
What happened with that was...

118
00:10:44.096 --> 00:10:45.482
I don't care. That's nothing.

119
00:10:45.482 --> 00:10:47.163
- Really?
- You still can't.

120
00:10:47.163 --> 00:10:48.332
I won't allow it.

121
00:10:48.332 --> 00:10:50.581
Are you looking down on me,
by any chance?

122
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:53.910
Why do you always twist
my words around like that?

123
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.052
Is it an inferiority complex?

124
00:10:55.052 --> 00:10:56.259
Inferiority?

125
00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:59.361
Hey, do you think anyone who doesn't
work for a big company feels inferior?

126
00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:01.437
Why bring up a big company?

127
00:11:01.437 --> 00:11:03.302
Why bring up inferiority?

128
00:11:03.302 --> 00:11:05.621
Hey, I'm sorry!
Sorry to interrupt here.

129
00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:07.509
Joon is an employee of
Gangsu Group today.

130
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:10.078
Joon, your inferiority
can go to the dogs.

131
00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:11.548
- Stay out of it!
- Stay out of it!

132
00:11:12.828 --> 00:11:15.808
Do you think we would've escaped
the hotel if weren't for me?

133
00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:17.859
I worked really hard
to get rid of that cop.

134
00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:20.433
I had to go endure
someone's gas too.

135
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.749
Joon is right about that.

136
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.570
The hotel escape was perfect.

137
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.850
If it was so perfect,
why is a police car following us?

138
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.283
- A police car?
- What?

139
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.245
What do we do?

140
00:11:46.892 --> 00:11:48.509
He followed us.

141
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:50.159
Step on it, Jae Hoon!

142
00:11:54.049 --> 00:11:55.701
Hold on tight.

143
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:05.173
What's with him? Is he a terminator?

144
00:12:05.173 --> 00:12:06.325
Why does he keep coming?

145
00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.965
What are you doing? Go faster.

146
00:12:07.965 --> 00:12:09.879
Jae Hoon is like that. He never speeds.

147
00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.537
Look at him now.
He's still not speeding.

148
00:12:11.537 --> 00:12:15.216
You want to leave your picture on the
speeding cameras when you're on the run?

149
00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:17.556
This isn't going to work.
Take a right around that corner.

150
00:12:17.556 --> 00:12:19.275
We'll get off at that intersection.

151
00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:21.125
I'll stop once I turn
so you can get out.

152
00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:23.337
No! I want to get out with Joon too.

153
00:12:23.337 --> 00:12:25.208
You're a wanted man.
Why would you go with her?

154
00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:26.485
He could safer with me.

155
00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:28.092
I'm his personal secretary
starting today.

156
00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:30.341
He's a third generation rich guy.
You're just a section chief.

157
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:31.821
- You can't say no.
- Just a section chief?

158
00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:34.633
Can you stop referring to me
as the third generation rich guy?

159
00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.692
He's telling us to stop, right?

160
00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:56.365
Step on it, Jae Hoon!

161
00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.092
What should we do?

162
00:13:03.092 --> 00:13:05.393
Should we all get caught,
or will you let us out?

163
00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:07.265
- Jae Hoon!
- Hurry.

164
00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:09.138
Gosh, seriously!

165
00:13:30.514 --> 00:13:32.028
Move your car!

166
00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:35.357
Mister, move your car!

167
00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:01.359
<i>Vehicle license plate 7684.
7684, pull over.</i>

168
00:14:02.018 --> 00:14:03.947
<i>7684, pull over.</i>

169
00:14:04.488 --> 00:14:05.817
<i>Pull over.</i>

170
00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:01.508
What's the problem?

171
00:15:02.009 --> 00:15:03.798
Please cooperate for a moment.

172
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.788
Could you please open your trunk?

173
00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:26.062
Where did they go?

174
00:15:26.062 --> 00:15:27.208
What do you mean?

175
00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:29.883
You picked up some people
from the hotel earlier.

176
00:15:29.883 --> 00:15:32.572
Picked up some people?
I never did that.

177
00:15:32.572 --> 00:15:35.587
If you're done with everything,
may I get going?

178
00:15:38.746 --> 00:15:42.062
You went over the speed limit.
May I see your ID?

179
00:15:42.062 --> 00:15:43.778
I don't think I was speeding.

180
00:15:43.999 --> 00:15:45.442
You were speeding.

181
00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:49.288
If I was speeding,
there was a camera.

182
00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:50.950
I'm sure I'll get a ticket notice.

183
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.769
I'll be careful in the future.
I'll be going, then.

184
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.523
Oh, what a relief.

185
00:16:10.523 --> 00:16:11.778
Oh...

186
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:23.698
It's finally just the two of us.

187
00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:25.408
Where are we going now?

188
00:16:25.408 --> 00:16:28.673
A perfect place for
a third generation rich guy to hide.

189
00:16:28.673 --> 00:16:30.127
Where's that?

190
00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:55.618
This is the good hiding place
you were talking about?

191
00:16:55.618 --> 00:16:58.618
Where else is a better hiding place
for a third generation rich guy?

192
00:16:58.618 --> 00:17:02.381
I'd rather go to prison than here.

193
00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:05.586
Yeah? Do what you want, then.

194
00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:10.296
Let's go to Han River instead.

195
00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:11.788
I have a yacht there.

196
00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:13.986
There aren't many people there,
so it's perfect.

197
00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:16.227
They even have champagne.
It's sparkling and--

198
00:17:16.227 --> 00:17:18.752
I'm late, right. I'm so sorry.

199
00:17:18.752 --> 00:17:20.659
- Joon.
- I'm sorry.

200
00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:25.880
Mister Byun, you came back.

201
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.221
I thought you'd quit after a day.
You're tougher than I thought.

202
00:17:29.221 --> 00:17:31.394
I'm glad you came back, young man.

203
00:17:31.394 --> 00:17:35.461
Of course, a young man
shouldn't give up after one day.

204
00:17:35.461 --> 00:17:37.695
Please stop that, Madam.

205
00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:40.673
Why do you keep touching
the butt of someone's precious son?

206
00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:43.913
That's right.

207
00:17:43.913 --> 00:17:46.682
I'm not the kind of person
who should work in a place like this.

208
00:17:46.682 --> 00:17:47.855
A place like this?

209
00:17:47.855 --> 00:17:49.172
Today, we're doing bricks.

210
00:17:49.173 --> 00:17:53.374
In order to move all those bricks today,
we can't waste any time.

211
00:17:54.154 --> 00:17:55.873
B... bricks?

212
00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:03.657
This isn't right, is it?

213
00:18:03.657 --> 00:18:06.167
Do I have to do this?
Please save me.

214
00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:08.028
You blend right in.

215
00:18:08.028 --> 00:18:09.608
It really suits you to be here.

216
00:18:09.608 --> 00:18:10.772
- Work hard.
- Work hard.

217
00:18:10.772 --> 00:18:12.962
- Work hard.
- Hurry up and get to it.

218
00:18:13.744 --> 00:18:14.933
What?

219
00:18:26.592 --> 00:18:28.170
What do I do?

220
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.363
I must be crazy.

221
00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:34.183
I helped a wanted criminal escape.

222
00:18:35.593 --> 00:18:40.376
Even if I needed money,
I shouldn't help a criminal.

223
00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:43.884
I held his hand in front a cop
and helped him run.

224
00:18:43.884 --> 00:18:46.652
At this rate,
will I end up being arrested?

225
00:18:55.834 --> 00:18:57.952
<i>[Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

226
00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:03.282
What? What is it?

227
00:19:03.282 --> 00:19:05.688
Where are you right now? Are you safe?

228
00:19:05.688 --> 00:19:06.953
Don't worry.

229
00:19:06.953 --> 00:19:09.042
I'm taking good care of the
third generation rich guy.

230
00:19:09.042 --> 00:19:11.204
Tell me where you are.
I'll pick him up now.

231
00:19:11.204 --> 00:19:13.772
You don't need to do that.
I'm busy, so I have to hang up.

232
00:19:14.634 --> 00:19:15.752
Busy?

233
00:19:17.512 --> 00:19:19.689
What are they doing that they're busy?

234
00:19:19.689 --> 00:19:22.196
So, where's Hyuk?

235
00:19:22.196 --> 00:19:24.214
He escaped for now.

236
00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.553
He escaped for now?

237
00:19:26.323 --> 00:19:27.393
Where to?

238
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:31.694
I used a third party to help out.

239
00:19:31.694 --> 00:19:34.789
That person will contact me
once he arrives at a safe place

240
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:35.843
so don't worry.

241
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:37.299
What third party?

242
00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:44.039
It's temporary, so don't worry about it.

243
00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:49.003
Come in.

244
00:19:52.323 --> 00:19:53.654
It's all ready to go.

245
00:19:59.463 --> 00:20:00.555
Didn't I tell you?

246
00:20:01.394 --> 00:20:03.092
We're having a press conference.

247
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:17.030
It's me.

248
00:20:17.464 --> 00:20:20.413
I need you to trace an IP for me,
as soon as possible.

249
00:20:20.413 --> 00:20:22.251
Make sure you keep this secure.

250
00:20:37.523 --> 00:20:38.525
Joon.

251
00:20:38.525 --> 00:20:41.688
What are you doing?
Move... move.

252
00:20:42.192 --> 00:20:43.878
- Okay.
- Move.

253
00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:49.276
Oh, it stings so much!

254
00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:52.106
Joon, Joon! Joon, Joon, Joon!

255
00:20:52.106 --> 00:20:54.696
I got hurt. I'm injured!

256
00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:02.785
Go.

257
00:21:15.496 --> 00:21:17.509
He's exactly like a mutt.

258
00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:20.628
He's a mutt that
follows his owner around.

259
00:21:29.798 --> 00:21:31.172
What are you doing?

260
00:21:34.063 --> 00:21:35.202
Follow me.

261
00:21:56.258 --> 00:21:57.398
Eat up.

262
00:21:58.088 --> 00:22:00.160
You want me to eat this?

263
00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:03.742
You have to eat in order to work.

264
00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:07.226
Is there anything that's grilled?

265
00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:09.097
I don't like meat in stews.

266
00:22:09.097 --> 00:22:10.746
Just eat it, would you?

267
00:22:13.047 --> 00:22:15.106
<i>These lumps I cannot identify.</i>

268
00:22:15.106 --> 00:22:18.237
<i>This soup that looks like
an excessive, jumbled mess.</i>

269
00:22:18.237 --> 00:22:20.636
<i>Is this also Joon's soul food?</i>

270
00:22:20.636 --> 00:22:24.786
<i>I do not want it,
but in order to bond with Joon</i>

271
00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:26.704
<i>I will just go for it.</i>

<i>[Exquisite]</i>

273
00:22:43.318 --> 00:22:44.412
What is this?

274
00:22:44.412 --> 00:22:48.885
This taste that is common,
yet has such incredible depth.

275
00:22:48.885 --> 00:22:52.616
What is this soup that
captures my appetite so easily?

276
00:22:52.616 --> 00:22:53.865
What else?

277
00:22:53.865 --> 00:22:56.868
It's the sweet taste of honey that
a person who sweats gets to have.

278
00:22:56.868 --> 00:22:59.412
Ah... oh my.

279
00:23:08.557 --> 00:23:11.262
Please turn up the volume on that.

280

<i>Gangsu Group is addressing the issue

<i>They are making an apology to the nation.
Here is the press conference.</i>

<i>We are very apologetic.</i>

We believe it is the right thing to
heal the wounds we have caused.

286
00:23:59.048 --> 00:24:02.261
Unfortunately,
the perpetrator of the incident...

287
00:24:02.261 --> 00:24:04.386
<i>has currently cut off communications.</i>

288
00:24:06.692 --> 00:24:09.855
Cut off communications?

As a representative of Gangsu Group...

292
00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:26.994
I want to apologize again.

293
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.787
The oldest son seems fine.

294
00:24:46.787 --> 00:24:50.209
It was always the younger son
who was the problem in that family.

295
00:24:51.229 --> 00:24:54.150
The apology is all a show, too.

296
00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.471
The rich are innocent,
the poor are guilty.

297
00:24:56.471 --> 00:24:59.209
You can do anything
with money in this world.

00:24:59.209 --> 00:25:03.103
What's the use of all that money?
Their child is a useless troublemaker.

299
00:25:03.103 --> 00:25:04.724
I don't envy them at all.

300
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.519
Even so, a useless troublemaker?

301
00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:11.554
Aren't you being too harsh?

302
00:25:11.554 --> 00:25:14.652
He might have his reasons
that he can't talk about.

303
00:25:14.652 --> 00:25:16.381
What kind of reasons?

304
00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:18.083
He should turn himself in if he's wrong.

305
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.934
He might've tried
and his father stopped him.

306
00:25:20.934 --> 00:25:24.076
He might have fists like Mike Tyson.

307
00:25:31.198 --> 00:25:34.375
What, you think he was beaten up?

308
00:25:34.876 --> 00:25:36.221
No...

309
00:25:37.425 --> 00:25:39.174
I'm just saying, he could've been.

310
00:25:39.174 --> 00:25:40.203
Hey.

311
00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:45.667
Are you the second son
of Gangsu Group's CEO?

312
00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:53.499
I don't think so!

313
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.057
You're just a part-timer
at a construction site.

314
00:25:57.057 --> 00:25:59.307
What do you know to take that guy's side?

315
00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:01.892
Whether that troublemaker
gets beaten up or not

316
00:26:01.892 --> 00:26:05.207
and whether he goes to prison or not,
just worry about your own future.

317
00:26:05.207 --> 00:26:06.286
Yeah.

318
00:26:10.824 --> 00:26:12.021
Everyone!

319
00:26:13.148 --> 00:26:15.328
The CEO will be here in 10 minutes.

320
00:26:15.328 --> 00:26:17.749
So, eat quickly and get out.

321
00:26:17.749 --> 00:26:19.308
- Hurry up!
- Gosh...

322
00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.827
Special treatment,
avoiding responsibility...

323
00:26:38.827 --> 00:26:40.903
"The rich are innocent,
the poor are guilty."

324
00:26:40.903 --> 00:26:43.008
Don't feel upset by it.

325
00:26:43.008 --> 00:26:47.038
That's just how you rich people
look to normal folks like us.

326
00:27:25.987 --> 00:27:27.848
You're Section Chief Kwon Jae Hoon.

327
00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:30.538
Why don't we go somewhere quiet?

328
00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.835
This seems quiet enough.

329
00:27:35.483 --> 00:27:38.025
It seems you've exclusively
been in charge of Mister Byun Hyuk.

330
00:27:39.743 --> 00:27:41.445
Where is he right now?

331
00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:43.606
It's the police.

332
00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.484
The police?

333
00:27:47.337 --> 00:27:49.900
He's not someone who officially
works in the company.

334
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.799
Why would I be in charge of him?

335
00:27:52.239 --> 00:27:55.675
It is his personal life.

336
00:27:55.675 --> 00:27:58.489
Isn't that why you were
at the hotel earlier today?

337
00:28:01.784 --> 00:28:05.039
I don't know anything more
than what was said at the briefing.

338
00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:08.951
I understand.

339
00:28:11.727 --> 00:28:17.778
Ah, if he is determined to be missing,
we will issue a warrant.

340
00:28:18.743 --> 00:28:20.103
I am aware.

341
00:28:20.103 --> 00:28:24.279
Do you realize that
you will become a witness soon?

342
00:28:29.689 --> 00:28:32.241
Goodbye, Officer Jang Chul Min.

343
00:28:40.277 --> 00:28:41.368
Oh yes.

344
00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.219
About that press conference...

345
00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:49.846
His brother apologized
on behalf of his younger brother.

346
00:28:49.846 --> 00:28:52.292
It's strange enough
for a family member to do it.

347
00:28:52.292 --> 00:28:56.425
Isn't it weird to apologize
on behalf of the employees?

348
00:28:57.188 --> 00:29:00.877
What did the hard-working
employees do so wrong?

349
00:29:00.877 --> 00:29:02.346
I don't really understand it.

350
00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:09.384
You're right.

351
00:29:10.025 --> 00:29:13.075
I found that point problematic, as well.

352
00:29:14.035 --> 00:29:17.306
Well... please make sure
to pay your fine.

353
00:29:31.932 --> 00:29:34.038
<i>Who are you to explain anything?</i>

354
00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:36.157
<i>Who would believe anything you say?</i>

355
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.782
<i>Don't say a single word
and don't do anything!</i>

356
00:29:40.922 --> 00:29:44.402
<i>Just do what I tell you to
and go shrivel up somewhere.</i>

357
00:29:51.506 --> 00:29:53.471
You are the most useless punk.

358
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:57.840
You are a punk who doesn't
know how to do anything!

359
00:29:58.344 --> 00:29:59.809
You little punk!

360
00:30:01.693 --> 00:30:04.711
Unfair? What could be unfair for you?

361
00:30:05.384 --> 00:30:07.744
<i>Unfortunately,
the perpetrator of the incident...</i>

362
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:10.434
<i>has currently cut off communications.</i>

363
00:30:12.153 --> 00:30:14.597
On behalf of Gangsu Group's employees

364
00:30:14.597 --> 00:30:17.384
I would like to apologize again.

365
00:30:20.413 --> 00:30:22.473
Special treatment,
avoiding responsibility...

366
00:30:22.473 --> 00:30:24.285
"The rich are innocent,
the poor are guilty."

367
00:30:24.824 --> 00:30:26.684
Don't feel upset by it.

368
00:30:26.684 --> 00:30:30.625
That's just how you rich people
look to normal folks like us.

369
00:30:42.095 --> 00:30:44.003
The weather sure is nice.

370
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.547
Oh. Wow.

371
00:31:02.548 --> 00:31:04.090
Gosh.

372
00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:10.518
The site is quite a mess.

373
00:31:10.518 --> 00:31:13.586
You have to hurry it up,
or how will we finish in time?

374
00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:28.824
I know you may not be happy,
but we're doing our best.

375
00:31:28.824 --> 00:31:32.076
Do you know how big my loss is
if our construction increases by a day?

376
00:31:32.076 --> 00:31:34.001
As the foreman of the
construction site...

377
00:31:40.071 --> 00:31:42.541
Don't talk to me about doing your best.

378
00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:45.250
Show me some determination and ambition.

379
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.260
Are there any people
who don't work hard and just get paid?

380
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.000
Are there those who steal materials?

381
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.221
There is no one like that
at our site, Chairman.

382
00:32:04.245 --> 00:32:07.477
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E03 Revolutionary Love ""</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

383
00:32:15.067 --> 00:32:17.305
Then why does it look
the same every time I come?

384
00:32:17.306 --> 00:32:19.496
The work is not progressing. It's not!

385
00:32:19.496 --> 00:32:21.904
That doesn't mean
we can do shoddy construction.

386
00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:26.395
It's more important to build it strong
than to build it quickly.

387
00:32:26.395 --> 00:32:28.414
- That's right.
- Of course.

388
00:32:28.414 --> 00:32:31.992
If we rush in order to meet deadlines
and things go wrong with the building

389
00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:34.201
what will you do if
the building crumbles later on?

390
00:32:36.001 --> 00:32:37.410
Nice to see you.

391
00:32:38.163 --> 00:32:39.243
Goodbye.

392
00:32:53.284 --> 00:32:55.490
Did I tell you to do shoddy construction?

393
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.415
I told you to do your best.

394
00:32:57.415 --> 00:33:00.461
You're pretty much telling us to.

395
00:33:00.461 --> 00:33:01.557
That's enough.

396
00:33:01.557 --> 00:33:03.074
Do you know this?

397
00:33:03.074 --> 00:33:06.255
It's against the law to push
for shoddy construction.

398
00:33:18.483 --> 00:33:20.913
How are you managing your employees?

399
00:33:20.913 --> 00:33:23.602
Can't you do construction without
using crazy people like that?

400
00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:25.781
- She works very hard.
- So, what?

401
00:33:26.736 --> 00:33:29.846
Will construction stop
if you get rid of that one girl?

402
00:33:34.132 --> 00:33:36.900
Baek Joon, leave this afternoon.

403
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.490
- How could he tell her to leave?
- What?

404
00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.597
For what reason?

405
00:33:41.597 --> 00:33:43.416
Are you firing me? Why?

406
00:33:43.416 --> 00:33:44.597
Be quiet.

407
00:33:44.597 --> 00:33:46.588
This is disruption of business.
Get rid of her.

408
00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:48.567
Hey, this is wrong.

409
00:33:48.567 --> 00:33:50.945
Hey, this isn't right!

410
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:55.552
What kind bullcrap is this?
Let go of me now!

411
00:33:55.922 --> 00:33:58.115
I may be a daily worker,
but I have my rights.

412
00:33:58.115 --> 00:33:59.697
This is illegal!

413
00:34:01.505 --> 00:34:04.106
You should've taken the law exam
if you like law so much.

414
00:34:04.106 --> 00:34:05.907
Why are you working here?

415
00:34:05.907 --> 00:34:08.257
Oh my goodness. What do we do?

416
00:34:08.257 --> 00:34:10.577
- You can't do this.
- Stop it.

417
00:34:11.246 --> 00:34:12.556
Joon!

418
00:34:59.398 --> 00:35:00.905
Chairman.

419
00:35:01.615 --> 00:35:03.179
Catch that punk!

420
00:35:06.518 --> 00:35:08.137
Byun.

421
00:35:21.485 --> 00:35:23.001
Give this to Hyuk.

422
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:27.364
He can't use cards under his name,
and he must need this and that.

423
00:35:27.364 --> 00:35:28.628
I will.

424
00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:33.034
I feel at peace knowing that he has you.

425
00:35:33.034 --> 00:35:36.434
I will make sure nothing happens to him.

426
00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:40.717
Is Hyuk still dating Chae Ri,
by any chance?

427
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.835
Ah, I don't really know.

428
00:35:44.835 --> 00:35:47.396
He's not dating anyone else, right?

429
00:35:47.396 --> 00:35:49.945
Who would he be dating at this time?

430
00:35:49.945 --> 00:35:52.257
Don't worry about that kind of thing.

431
00:35:56.943 --> 00:35:58.362
<i>[Byun Hyuk]</i>

432
00:36:00.581 --> 00:36:01.782
What's wrong?

433
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:03.987
Jae Hoon, my friend.

434
00:36:03.987 --> 00:36:06.262
My friend... my friend.
(In French and Japanese)

435
00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:13.382
Hurry up and come.

436
00:36:20.099 --> 00:36:21.471
Let's go.

437
00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:35.239
We got a call. What's going on?

438
00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:37.061
This is a case of attempted murder.

439
00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:38.164
What?

440
00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:43.987
This punk threw a brick this big
at me from the fifth floor.

441
00:36:43.987 --> 00:36:46.369
As you can see here, I nearly died.

442
00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:48.818
Attempted murder? That's ridiculous.

443
00:36:48.818 --> 00:36:51.737
Ah, they are accomplices.

444
00:36:51.737 --> 00:36:53.655
What a load of crap.

445
00:36:53.655 --> 00:36:55.101
What did our Joon do wrong?

446
00:36:55.101 --> 00:36:58.021
Joon was busy being
dragged off at that time.

447
00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:01.293
This guy was trying to screw me over
because that wench got fired!

448
00:37:01.293 --> 00:37:02.583
They're together.

449
00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:05.233
I don't appreciate how you keep
calling her a wench.

450
00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:08.005
What? You little...

451
00:37:08.005 --> 00:37:11.114
You attempted to murder me,
so who are you to talk?

452
00:37:11.114 --> 00:37:14.157
You keep saying attempted murder.

453
00:37:14.157 --> 00:37:16.304
Do you have evidence? Any witnesses?

454
00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:19.032
- You all saw, right?
- Yes.

455
00:37:19.032 --> 00:37:21.313
Did you see him
throw a brick at me or not?

456
00:37:21.313 --> 00:37:23.661
Yes, I saw. It hit me first.

457
00:37:23.661 --> 00:37:25.385
What attempted murder?

458
00:37:25.385 --> 00:37:27.833
Yeah, you really are overreacting.

459
00:37:27.833 --> 00:37:30.565
Who here saw Mister Byun throw a brick?

460
00:37:30.565 --> 00:37:32.304
- I didn't.
- Me neither.

461
00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:35.601
What's with all of you, seriously?

462
00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:38.072
Don't any of you want to work anymore?

463
00:37:38.701 --> 00:37:39.900
Listen here.

464
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.543
Is it not enough to fire me?
You're threatening to fire everyone?

465
00:37:43.543 --> 00:37:46.329
You're threatening us with our jobs.

466
00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:48.628
- You're trying to force false testimony.
- What?

467
00:37:48.628 --> 00:37:50.932
Anyway, no one here threw a brick.

468
00:37:50.932 --> 00:37:52.043
No one.

469
00:37:52.043 --> 00:37:55.161
My employees caught this punk
on the fifth floor.

470
00:37:55.161 --> 00:37:57.530
- That's correct.
- We caught him.

471
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.661
Were you on the fifth floor?

472
00:37:58.661 --> 00:38:01.728
- No, he was on the fourth floor.
- Yes, fourth floor.

473
00:38:01.728 --> 00:38:04.347
Yes, the fourth floor of the basement
and it was windy.

474
00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:05.871
Fourth floor of the basement, yeah right!

475
00:38:05.871 --> 00:38:08.590
Are you all going to continue lying?

476
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.742
You people are all too much.

477
00:38:10.742 --> 00:38:12.581
<i>What is it with these people?</i>

478
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:15.675
<i>Why are they standing up for me?</i>

479
00:38:15.675 --> 00:38:16.704
Be quiet!

480
00:38:16.704 --> 00:38:19.465
Why can't you make a decision?
Is this how you work?

481
00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:21.083
He's a criminal caught in the act!

482
00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:23.748
What do you mean?
Where's your evidence?

483
00:38:23.748 --> 00:38:25.882
Wearing protective gear
on site is critical.

484
00:38:25.882 --> 00:38:29.313
People who don't wear anything
are negligent too.

485
00:38:29.313 --> 00:38:30.864
Watch what you're saying, old man!

486
00:38:30.864 --> 00:38:33.304
Old man, old man?

487
00:38:33.304 --> 00:38:36.237
Who do you think you're talking down to?
How old are you?

488
00:38:36.237 --> 00:38:38.396
How old are you, kid!

489
00:39:02.326 --> 00:39:04.425
Stop, stop! That's enough.

490
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:07.827
Stop! All right, all right!

491
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:10.083
All right, everyone.

492
00:39:10.083 --> 00:39:11.833
Let's go in and talk.

493
00:39:11.833 --> 00:39:13.251
We are talking right now.

494
00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:15.791
No, I mean the police station.
Take them in.

495
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:17.641
No, no, no!

496
00:39:19.956 --> 00:39:23.572
Fine, I won't stand idly by
if you all behave this way.

497
00:39:23.572 --> 00:39:24.648
Joon.

498
00:39:25.983 --> 00:39:27.833
What will you do, then?

499
00:39:28.298 --> 00:39:31.487
You illegally disposed of industrial
waste in the middle of the night.

500
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:36.884
When it was raining last time,
you secretly disposed of it in the sewer.

501
00:39:36.884 --> 00:39:39.298
I'll report it to the ward office
and to city hall.

502
00:39:39.298 --> 00:39:41.463
What do you think
will happen then, CEO Min?

503
00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:44.021
Watch your mouth,
you little wench.

504
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:47.920
If I report illegal waste disposal,
he will get charged, right?

505
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.360
Yes, he will.

506
00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.088
It's the truth, isn't it?

507
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.313
You want to get mixed up with me?

508
00:39:55.313 --> 00:39:57.201
Then say it's not attempted murder.

509
00:39:57.201 --> 00:39:58.804
You little...

510
00:39:58.804 --> 00:40:00.490
Oh, what's this?

511
00:40:04.251 --> 00:40:05.425
Who are you?

512
00:40:05.425 --> 00:40:06.900
He... he's my friend.

513
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.998
Jae Hoon.

514
00:40:13.106 --> 00:40:14.266
Let go now.

515
00:40:15.965 --> 00:40:17.836
Why don't we go and talk?

516
00:40:26.971 --> 00:40:28.797
He looks very handsome.

517
00:40:28.797 --> 00:40:30.487
Is he Joon's boyfriend?

518
00:40:30.487 --> 00:40:33.141
No, he's my friend.

519
00:40:33.141 --> 00:40:36.153
He must work in a good place.
He looks very clean cut.

520
00:40:36.153 --> 00:40:38.543
Madam Ahn, you're really something.

521
00:40:38.543 --> 00:40:41.704
He could end up at the police station
and you're thinking about his looks?

522
00:40:41.704 --> 00:40:44.585
Don't worry. That won't happen.

523
00:40:44.585 --> 00:40:47.434
Jae Hoon is an expert.

524
00:40:47.963 --> 00:40:50.659
- An expert.
- Yes, an expert.

525
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.476
Gosh...

526
00:40:54.775 --> 00:40:59.003
Treatment cost and even money
for emotional distress damages.

527
00:40:59.003 --> 00:41:01.608
I will give you more
than enough settlement money.

528
00:41:02.181 --> 00:41:04.067
What are you talking about?

529
00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:06.454
We're the ones who need damages
for emotional distress.

530
00:41:06.454 --> 00:41:09.958
He always shows up during lunch
and rushes everyone.

531
00:41:09.958 --> 00:41:13.028
He ignores all labor laws and
fires people whenever he wants.

532
00:41:13.028 --> 00:41:15.510
We're the ones who deserve damages
for emotional distress.

533
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:19.820
Let's not leave any paperwork
and make things complicated.

534
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.583
CEO Min Sung Ho.

535
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:31.143
- Do you know me?
- No.

536
00:41:31.143 --> 00:41:32.721
Not very well.

537
00:41:32.721 --> 00:41:34.969
So I looked into you on my way here.

538
00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:40.161
You have a few paper companies
besides this construction company.

539
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.398
That's all for tax evasion, isn't it?

540
00:41:50.389 --> 00:41:54.094
You've used the supposed wages to
make a nice slush fund for yourself.

541
00:41:59.358 --> 00:42:00.436
Wow.

542
00:42:06.219 --> 00:42:09.608
You punk... who are you?

543
00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:12.768
There's no need for you to know.

544
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:15.878
Why don't you settle?

545
00:42:24.132 --> 00:42:26.507
Well, we understand then.

546
00:42:26.507 --> 00:42:27.601
Thank you.

547
00:42:39.608 --> 00:42:41.682
He really is skilled.

548
00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:43.510
He wasn't even in there for 10 minutes.

549
00:42:43.536 --> 00:42:45.724
How did he get CEO Min to stay quiet?

550
00:42:45.724 --> 00:42:48.454
What did I tell you?
I told you Jae Hoon would resolve it!

551
00:42:48.454 --> 00:42:51.204
That's the level my friend is at.

552
00:42:52.751 --> 00:42:54.900
What the heck were you thinking?

553
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.641
- Huh?
- What happened with the brick?

554
00:42:57.641 --> 00:43:00.871
Oh, it was actually because
of a dandelion seed flower.

555
00:43:00.871 --> 00:43:02.652
- What?
- Oh...

556
00:43:02.652 --> 00:43:05.244
It had grown even in the cement.

557
00:43:05.244 --> 00:43:07.762
You know how I like to blow on the seeds.

558
00:43:08.782 --> 00:43:10.789
I had no idea there was a brick there.

559
00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:13.425
So, it was just an accident.

560
00:43:13.425 --> 00:43:14.496
Accident.

561
00:43:15.094 --> 00:43:18.016
Just like drunk driving and
the club disturbances were?

562
00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:20.585
Of course, they all were accidents.

563
00:43:20.585 --> 00:43:23.311
The public urination
and Yeon Hee were accidents too?

564
00:43:25.231 --> 00:43:27.512
Joon, why are you being scary?

565
00:43:27.512 --> 00:43:29.273
They really were all accidents.

566
00:43:33.237 --> 00:43:35.175
- I was crazy.
- Huh?

567
00:43:35.175 --> 00:43:38.829
No matter how much I need the money,
I shouldn't have agreed to help you.

568
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.139
Why are you being this way?

569
00:43:41.139 --> 00:43:43.621
Forget it. Let's end it here.

570
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:44.920
End it?

571
00:43:45.492 --> 00:43:47.969
- What?
- I won't be your personal secretary.

572
00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:50.467
Let's just head down our own paths.

573
00:43:53.849 --> 00:43:54.947
Joon!

574
00:43:56.952 --> 00:43:58.289
That's enough.

575
00:43:59.088 --> 00:44:00.880
Joon seems really angry.

576
00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.068
Stop and get in the car!

577
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:23.172
<i>[Mom]</i>

578
00:44:31.018 --> 00:44:32.373
<i>[Mom]</i>

579
00:44:37.931 --> 00:44:41.489
Mom, I'm sorry.

580
00:44:42.672 --> 00:44:44.311
I can't give you that money.

581
00:44:45.548 --> 00:44:47.550
So, stop calling me.

582
00:45:06.246 --> 00:45:08.666
Why does everything I do
turn out this way?

583
00:45:09.983 --> 00:45:12.414
Even if someone set out to cause trouble

584
00:45:12.414 --> 00:45:14.503
it'd be hard to cause as much as you.

585
00:45:14.503 --> 00:45:17.574
I just wanted to
let the dandelion seeds fly.

586
00:45:19.594 --> 00:45:21.554
Was that so wrong?

587
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:25.349
You nearly ended up at the police
station because of dandelion seeds.

588
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:27.753
Those people almost
lost their livelihoods.

589
00:45:27.753 --> 00:45:29.427
Of course, she'd be mad.

590
00:45:31.393 --> 00:45:32.949
I was wrong.

591
00:45:34.483 --> 00:45:35.909
What do I do now?

592
00:45:36.722 --> 00:45:40.987
What do I do in order
to get Joon to forgive me?

593
00:45:44.094 --> 00:45:45.253
Dream on.

594
00:45:45.253 --> 00:45:47.563
Once Joon is done, she means it.

595
00:45:47.563 --> 00:45:50.907
It didn't even make sense that she
agreed to be your personal secretary.

596
00:45:50.907 --> 00:45:55.088
Unless she loses her mind,
she will probably never do it again.

597
00:45:55.956 --> 00:45:57.405
Is that right?

598
00:46:07.597 --> 00:46:09.146
This is from your mom.

599
00:46:18.831 --> 00:46:19.918
Jae Hoon!

600
00:46:19.918 --> 00:46:21.856
- What now?
- Joon.

601
00:46:21.856 --> 00:46:23.766
How to make her not angry...

602
00:46:23.766 --> 00:46:25.730
I thought of a way.

603
00:46:36.204 --> 00:46:37.630
Don't come here anymore.

604
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:38.983
- What?
- What?

605
00:46:39.992 --> 00:46:41.949
What do you mean by that?

606
00:46:41.949 --> 00:46:43.434
Stop coming tomorrow?

607
00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:44.753
It's CEO Min's orders.

608
00:46:44.753 --> 00:46:47.612
The three of you and Baek Joon
should not come in.

609
00:46:47.612 --> 00:46:51.384
Foreman, I thought
this issue was settled earlier.

610
00:46:51.384 --> 00:46:53.643
The brick issue was settled.

611
00:46:53.643 --> 00:46:55.416
But not all of you.

612
00:46:55.416 --> 00:46:56.858
But, still...

613
00:46:56.858 --> 00:46:59.264
how can you suddenly fire us like this?

614
00:46:59.264 --> 00:47:02.545
I'm supposed to pay for my daughter's
private academy this month.

615
00:47:02.545 --> 00:47:06.054
If you were worried about that,
you shouldn't have gotten involved.

616
00:47:06.054 --> 00:47:08.197
Why would you take that kid's side?

617
00:47:08.197 --> 00:47:09.822
What were we supposed to do?

618
00:47:09.822 --> 00:47:12.793
He's a young guy with a bright future
and it was an accident.

619
00:47:12.793 --> 00:47:15.384
Should we leave him to get
dragged off for attempted murder?

620
00:47:15.384 --> 00:47:18.152
Why don't you talk to CEO Min for us?

621
00:47:18.152 --> 00:47:20.376
I don't know anything.
That's just how it is.

622
00:47:20.376 --> 00:47:21.753
Don't come tomorrow.

623
00:47:21.753 --> 00:47:24.001
I'm short on labor as it is.

624
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:26.320
Foreman, Foreman.

625
00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.077
Of all the things I've seen in my life,
this is the worst case of abuse.

626
00:47:30.077 --> 00:47:32.385
Hey, you think this is
the only place to work?

627
00:47:32.385 --> 00:47:33.916
It is. This is the only place.

628
00:47:33.916 --> 00:47:36.063
That's why we stuck around here.

629
00:47:36.063 --> 00:47:39.735
Hey, I'll just eat less and live shorter.

630
00:47:39.735 --> 00:47:41.914
I won't bow down to you!

631
00:47:41.914 --> 00:47:46.592
Eat well and live well,
you awful bastards!

632
00:47:46.592 --> 00:47:49.467
What do we do?
Madam Ahn, Mister Kim, Mister Lee.

633
00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:51.994
I should never have brought him around.

634
00:47:51.994 --> 00:47:53.802
I am so sorry.

635
00:47:54.193 --> 00:47:57.144
Why are you sorry?
You don't have to be.

636
00:47:57.664 --> 00:48:00.503
We can find another job.

637
00:48:00.503 --> 00:48:01.856
Yes, yes.

638
00:48:01.856 --> 00:48:05.327
He said it was
because of dandelion seeds.

639
00:48:06.958 --> 00:48:10.690
Even though it was an excuse,
wasn't it cute and naive?

640
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.507
Anyway, they say you should rest
when things go wrong.

641
00:48:14.507 --> 00:48:16.043
Since things have gone wrong...

642
00:48:16.043 --> 00:48:18.445
I'll just rest and look for a new job.

643
00:48:18.445 --> 00:48:20.425
Yeah, don't worry too much.

644
00:48:20.425 --> 00:48:22.681
- Don't worry.
- Yes, yes.

645
00:48:22.681 --> 00:48:25.860
Life is about earning
and living day to day.

646
00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.494
Yeah, that's true.

647
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:30.322
It's okay.

648
00:48:55.277 --> 00:48:56.442
All right.

649
00:49:00.494 --> 00:49:01.675
Okay.

650
00:49:17.731 --> 00:49:20.623
One, two, three.

651
00:49:32.371 --> 00:49:33.416
What is it?

652
00:49:34.385 --> 00:49:38.275
Are you here to beg
on your knees and say sorry?

653
00:49:38.856 --> 00:49:41.094
Kim Ki Sub, Lee Tae Kyung,
and Ahn Mi Yeon...

654
00:49:41.317 --> 00:49:43.235
please reinstate the three of them.

655
00:49:43.896 --> 00:49:45.282
Who are they?

656
00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:47.764
The three people you fired earlier today.

657
00:49:47.764 --> 00:49:49.880
Give them their jobs back.

658
00:49:50.226 --> 00:49:53.947
Otherwise, I'll go through with
my threat on the illegal waste disposal.

659
00:49:53.947 --> 00:49:55.983
I will officially report you.

660
00:49:56.726 --> 00:50:00.333
So, you won't report me
if I give them their jobs back?

661
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:04.465
You have evidence?

662
00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:07.070
You think I'd come to make a deal
without evidence?

663
00:50:13.485 --> 00:50:16.210
You know that punk
who threw a brick at me?

664
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.211
I hear he's the second son
of Gangsu Group.

665
00:50:21.476 --> 00:50:24.442
I was so shocked by that.

666
00:50:26.572 --> 00:50:28.311
Go on and report me.

667
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:32.016
I can send him into a cave
with just one call.

668
00:50:33.871 --> 00:50:35.324
Do as you please.

669
00:50:35.324 --> 00:50:37.420
He has nothing to do with me.

670
00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.516
Oh...

671
00:50:39.117 --> 00:50:42.177
You don't care even if his life ends?

672
00:50:42.177 --> 00:50:45.137
Getting the jobs of those three people
back is more important to me.

673
00:50:45.137 --> 00:50:46.324
Really?

674
00:50:46.324 --> 00:50:47.922
Yes, it is.

675
00:50:50.996 --> 00:50:53.923
What are you doing with my phone?

676
00:50:54.416 --> 00:50:56.431
Let me go.
I said let me go!

677
00:50:56.431 --> 00:50:58.612
Give it back. Give it back!

678
00:50:58.612 --> 00:50:59.697
There's nothing.

679
00:51:01.137 --> 00:51:02.601
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

680
00:51:03.061 --> 00:51:05.150
I'm sure there's nothing regarding that.

681
00:51:05.985 --> 00:51:07.382
Wow.

682
00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:13.003
You threatened me with a lie?

683
00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:14.744
It's enough just to fire me.

684
00:51:14.744 --> 00:51:17.103
Give the three people their jobs back!

685
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.172
Then tell me where that punk is.

686
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.496
Then I'll give those
three people their jobs back.

687
00:51:33.079 --> 00:51:35.722
Tell me where he is.

688
00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:41.534
Do you understand, kid?

689
00:51:41.882 --> 00:51:44.559
This is a real deal.

690
00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:52.431
I can go out on my own.

691
00:51:55.963 --> 00:51:58.295
How can you throw my phone like that?

692
00:52:01.478 --> 00:52:02.527
Buy a new one.

693
00:52:02.527 --> 00:52:05.416
Use the rest of the money
for candy, you baby.

694
00:52:08.831 --> 00:52:10.907
Hey... hey!

695
00:52:13.291 --> 00:52:16.019
You think money is everything? Hey!

696
00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:17.474
Open the door!

697
00:52:18.143 --> 00:52:21.153
Open the door now. Hey!

698
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:44.762
Make a decision.

699
00:52:45.572 --> 00:52:48.181
You want to get
their jobs back, or is it him?

700
00:52:53.376 --> 00:52:55.695
Do you think Gangsu Group will stand by

701
00:52:55.695 --> 00:52:58.250
if they know you
threatened Hyuk like this?

702
00:52:58.925 --> 00:53:01.806
You came to ask for their jobs back.

703
00:53:03.074 --> 00:53:04.989
Now you're worried about him?

704
00:53:05.581 --> 00:53:06.786
Who are you?

705
00:53:07.835 --> 00:53:09.568
Are you his girlfriend?

706
00:53:15.579 --> 00:53:17.391
I'm sorry...

707
00:53:18.507 --> 00:53:20.025
Madam Ahn.

708
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:22.358
Mister Kim.

709
00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:25.213
Mister Lee.

710
00:54:44.307 --> 00:54:45.701
How much do you need?

711
00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:54.054
Tell me. I'll lend it to you.

712
00:54:54.054 --> 00:54:55.338
Why would you?

713
00:54:56.217 --> 00:54:58.688
Who are you to lend me money?

714
00:54:58.688 --> 00:55:00.599
You said you did it for money.

715
00:55:00.599 --> 00:55:02.844
That's why you took a crazy job
like being Hyuk's secretary.

716
00:55:02.844 --> 00:55:05.311
I said I won't do it. I'm quitting.

717
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:08.402
So, I'll lend it to you.
How much do you need?

718
00:55:10.465 --> 00:55:13.958
Hey... I don't want it.

719
00:55:15.114 --> 00:55:18.204
You run errands for
a third generation rich guy.

720
00:55:18.204 --> 00:55:21.085
I refuse to take money
that's earned like that.

721
00:55:21.085 --> 00:55:22.487
Got it?

722
00:55:45.478 --> 00:55:47.271
Ta-da!

723
00:55:54.822 --> 00:55:56.356
What do you think?

724
00:55:56.356 --> 00:55:57.922
You're surprised, right?

725
00:55:59.088 --> 00:56:00.289
Thanks to you

726
00:56:00.289 --> 00:56:03.949
I was able to know the special sweet
taste of food after working up a sweat.

727
00:56:03.949 --> 00:56:06.789
So, I wanted to give you a gift.

728
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:09.427
For you, after you've had
a tiresome day...

729
00:56:09.427 --> 00:56:12.269
a romantic and heavenly taste.

730
00:56:17.936 --> 00:56:20.199
These are grade A ribs.

731
00:56:20.199 --> 00:56:23.005
This is the chef, Mister Yoon.

732
00:56:23.005 --> 00:56:26.099
This is wine from the year we were born.

733
00:56:28.465 --> 00:56:32.322
I didn't know which roses
you liked, so I got pink.

734
00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:34.018
There are probably about a thousand.

735
00:56:34.018 --> 00:56:37.393
Quite a lot, right? I know.

736
00:56:38.445 --> 00:56:40.311
Do you like it?

737
00:56:40.311 --> 00:56:42.931
Come here, Joon. Come here.

738
00:56:47.909 --> 00:56:49.934
What's wrong, Joon?

739
00:56:50.646 --> 00:56:54.170
Are those tears
because you're so touched?

740
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:55.577
Are they not?

741
00:56:55.577 --> 00:56:59.896
Because of a guy who only knows
how to spend his damn money...

742
00:56:59.896 --> 00:57:02.865
Because I was trying to save you...

743
00:57:02.865 --> 00:57:07.516
Because I was trying to hide you,
do you know what I just did?

744
00:57:09.947 --> 00:57:12.733
Joon, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

745
00:57:12.733 --> 00:57:17.275
Mister Kim, who got fired because of you,
has three kids to raise.

746
00:57:17.275 --> 00:57:21.023
Mister Lee pays more than one million won
of his mother's hospital fees a month.

747
00:57:21.023 --> 00:57:25.445
Madam Ahn's husband had a stroke
and she's taking care...

748
00:57:26.005 --> 00:57:30.498
She's taking care of her entire family.

749
00:57:30.498 --> 00:57:31.527
Joon.

750
00:57:31.527 --> 00:57:36.108
This may be nothing
but a lowly job to you.

751
00:57:36.108 --> 00:57:39.407
It was a desperately needed source
of livelihood for them.

752
00:57:39.407 --> 00:57:43.788
They were worried that
you would lose that livelihood!

753
00:57:43.788 --> 00:57:46.358
They put everything on the line.

754
00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:53.266
I thought you would, at least,
have a conscience about that.

755
00:57:53.266 --> 00:57:56.168
Is this all you could think to do?

756
00:57:57.777 --> 00:58:01.525
If they knew they got fired for taking
sides with a some rich troublemaker

757
00:58:01.525 --> 00:58:04.248
they'd feel so taken aback by it all.

758
00:58:10.257 --> 00:58:11.742
To tell you the truth, Joon...

759
00:58:11.742 --> 00:58:14.101
I was thankful to them too.

760
00:58:14.101 --> 00:58:18.262
I prepared an envelope for each of them.

761
00:58:18.262 --> 00:58:19.954
Here.

762
00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:23.492
You think you can
solve everything with money?

763
00:58:23.492 --> 00:58:25.693
Huh? Why not money?

764
00:58:25.693 --> 00:58:28.032
Everyone likes it.

765
00:58:28.032 --> 00:58:32.454
Why did someone like you
appear in front of me?

766
00:58:32.454 --> 00:58:34.199
Why did you show up?

767
00:58:34.199 --> 00:58:37.175
Why did you destroy everything? Why!

768
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.480
Destroy?

769
00:58:39.998 --> 00:58:41.360
I did?

770
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.849
I'm asking you this favor.

771
00:58:42.849 --> 00:58:46.269
Please... please return
to the world you came from.

772
00:58:46.269 --> 00:58:48.389
Stop making things hard
for so many people.

773
00:58:48.389 --> 00:58:50.983
Please just get lost!

774
00:59:15.273 --> 00:59:16.840
Get lost?

775
00:59:46.746 --> 00:59:49.980
Who said you can run this business here?

776
00:59:52.605 --> 00:59:54.188
Who are you people?

777
00:59:54.954 --> 00:59:56.829
Where are you from?

778
00:59:59.465 --> 01:00:01.916
Look here, Baek Sung Ki.

779
01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:05.949
You can't do this
to CEO Byun Gang Su.

780
01:00:05.949 --> 01:00:09.914
You made a living off
of him for this long.

781
01:00:09.914 --> 01:00:15.001
When you left the company,
you got a nice retirement package.

782
01:00:15.001 --> 01:00:18.360
You should be repaying him for that.

783
01:00:19.141 --> 01:00:22.431
Why would you be tackling work
that the head office does?

784
01:00:27.795 --> 01:00:29.338
Take this.

785
01:00:29.338 --> 01:00:34.030
Don't cause a problem
out of this issue anymore.

786
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.507
The CEO...

787
01:00:37.061 --> 01:00:38.925
is watching you.

788
01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:41.336
Stay in line, punk.

789
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.664
Oh, aren't you pretty?

790
01:00:55.778 --> 01:00:57.936
Listen to your dad.

791
01:01:11.641 --> 01:01:13.452
Joon.

792
01:01:13.983 --> 01:01:19.943
Don't make important
decisions in your life...

793
01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:23.789
based on money.

794
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:29.262
I felt I had no choice and ended up
making a cowardly decision.

795
01:01:29.262 --> 01:01:31.309
But, Joon...

796
01:01:33.851 --> 01:01:36.949
I hope you don't live the way I do.

797
01:02:40.286 --> 01:02:45.693
<i>I was so happy to meet you
that I insisted it was fate.</i>

798
01:02:45.693 --> 01:02:47.990
Stop making things hard
for so many people.

799
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:50.452
Please just get lost!

800
01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:28.202
You run errands for
a third generation rich guy.

801
01:03:28.202 --> 01:03:30.721
I refuse to take money
that's earned like that.

802
01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:31.940
Got it?

803
01:03:42.836 --> 01:03:45.701
