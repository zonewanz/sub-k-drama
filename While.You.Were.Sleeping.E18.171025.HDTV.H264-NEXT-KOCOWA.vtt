1
00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:10.449
I'm telling you. Ms. Yoo was
such a kind, upright person.

2
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.560
She was never full of herself
even though she was famous,

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.659
and she always made sure
to get me gifts for the holidays.

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.030
And I never had much work to do
at her place.

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.000
I felt bad that she was paying me.

6
00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.000
Gosh, I can't believe
that he killed someone like her.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.770
That man, Do Hak Young,
must be punished.

8
00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.510
How many times a week
did you visit Ms. Yoo's place?

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.139
Three times.
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

10
00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:35.840
What did you usually do
when you were at her place?

11
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.449
I did laundry and cooked for her.

12
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.850
You didn't clean her place?

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.979
She was very clean and neat.

14
00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.250
There was never really
anything to clean.

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.750
She always cleaned her couch
with a lint roller,

16
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.060
and she had a robot vacuum cleaner
that cleaned the floor every day.

17
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.199
Hang on a second.
A robot vacuum cleaner?

18
00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.000
What is that?

19
00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.199
Is that what happened when a robot
vacuum went over a dog's poop?

20
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.370
That's hilarious.

21
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.840
This isn't just a funny photo.

22
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.340
This pattern.
Doesn't it remind you of something?

23
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.340
What?

24
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.909
Gosh, this.

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.719
My gosh! Hey. Could this be...

26
00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.459
What do you think?
Don't they look similar?

27
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.100
Hey, does this mean the blood
at the scene could've been...

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.030
What if the drawing was done
by the robot vacuum?

29
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.469
- Sorry? The robot vacuum?
- The robot vacuum?

30
00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.939
Yes, that will put
the pieces of the puzzle together.

31
00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.340
We've been having a hard time
because we couldn't figure out...

32
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.639
how that blood pattern was created.

33
00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:42.510
Gosh, you're right.

34
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.610
Well, you said Ms. Yoo fainted often
due to cupulolithiasis, right?

35
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.120
Yes, she was even taken
to the emergency room once.

36
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.489
So, this must've been what happened.

37
00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.790
She must've fainted
because of her cupulolithiasis...

38
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.199
and died from a head injury.

39
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.669
Then her robot vacuum must've
made that pattern with her blood.

40
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.340
Gosh, I just got goosebumps.

41
00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.070
We didn't find any robot vacuum
at her place though.

42
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.379
She has one.
Did you look everywhere?

43
00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.580
Of course. I even know what kinds
of plates she has in her cupboards.

44
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.320
Did you search everywhere
including outside of her place?

45
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.620
Outside?

46
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.889
I have a robot vacuum as well,

47
00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.459
but it can keep moving around.

48
00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.260
It goes outside
if I leave the door open.

49
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
It's even fallen off my balcony.

50
00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.330
It's possible that her robot vacuum
is somewhere outside.

51
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.370
What's the color
of her robot vacuum?

52
00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:43.870
It's red.

53
00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.010
Have you seen a robot vacuum
moving around...

54
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.879
in the hallway or the elevator?

55
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.250
Well, I don't think I've seen any
in the hallway or the elevator.

56
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.689
But sometime last month,
kids found one on the flowers...

57
00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.489
in front of Building 103
and brought it to me.

58
00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.489
Building 103?

59
00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.389
Oh, that must be the one.

60
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.100
Ms. Yoo lived in Unit 2009
in Building 103.

61
00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.229
What color was it?

62
00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.070
I think it was red.

63
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.239
Perfect. It'll be game over
if we can find her blood on it.

64
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.239
Where is it now?

65
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.010
I threw it out a long time ago.

66
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.139
It's probably at the e-waste
disposal facility by now.

67
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.719
How on earth are we going
to find that robot vacuum here?

68
00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.189
It'll be easier than trying to find
narcotics at a flour milling plant.

69
00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.989
Goodness, we won't be able
to find it.

70
00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.530
If anyone actually finds
that robot vacuum here,

71
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.830
I'll address that person with an
honorific for the rest of my life.

72
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.739
Seriously? My gosh, I'm suddenly...

73
00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.439
feeling so motivated.
I'm getting a rush of motivation.

74
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.510
Wait, Mr. Jung. Mr. Jung!

75
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.979
Let's go back to the office
and ask for backup again, okay?

76
00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.219
We can ask other senior
assisting officers for help and...

77
00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.419
Goodness gracious.
Hey, be quiet! That little...

78
00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.449
Gosh, why...

79
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.159
For goodness' sake.
I'm wearing new shoes today.

80
00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.429
Gosh, I'm so annoyed right now.

81
00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.159
What is the matter with him?

82
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.129
My goodness.

83
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.899
Oh, my gosh.

84
00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:26.810
Where could it be?

85
00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.949
Someone threw this out
with kimchi inside.

86
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.679
Hong Joo,
I found another robot vacuum.

87
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.459
- How many times have I told you?
- That voice...

88
00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:42.659
It's red, not green. Red, okay?

89
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.659
Oh, right. I keep forgetting that.

90
00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.199
Hong Joo.

91
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.469
My gosh, Jae Chan.

92
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.439
I was going to call you when I
find it. How did you figure it out?

93
00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:00.909
What are you doing here, Hong Joo?

94
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.409
When I was reading comments
on the internet,

95
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.109
I stumbled upon a picture of a mess
made by a robot vacuum.

96
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.350
My gosh, it looked so much like
the blood pattern at the scene.

97
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.190
Netizens in this country
are so impressive.

98
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.719
They're really
like an investigation squad.

99
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.190
I'm certain that the blood pattern
at the scene of Ms. Yoo's death...

100
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.960
was made by her robot vacuum.

101
00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:18.960
We've already found a few,

102
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.659
so if you analyze any blood
found on them...

103
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.000
Thank you.

104
00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:38.810
Goodness, all of us here
have been working hard.

105
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.719
You can't give special treatment
to just one of us.

106
00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.049
You're hurting our feelings here.

107
00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.949
Don't be like that. Be fair.

108
00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:47.389
You should thank all of us,

109
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.960
- okay?
- All right. Thank you.

110
00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:52.259
Go away. You reek of sweat.

111
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600
Thank you.

112
00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.170
No problem.
This will clear Hak Young's name.

113
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.370
I should thank you.

114
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.270
All of you guys should
thank me the most!

115
00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.630
Du Hyun.

116
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.159
Amazing.

117
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.460
He found three.

118
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.139
After the blood analysis... Gosh.

119
00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:43.139
Sorry about that.
After the blood analysis is done,

120
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.710
you have to let SBC
cover it exclusively.

121
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.020
All right, I will.

122
00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:51.520
Amazing job, sir.

123
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.190
Pardon me?

124
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.989
Sir, you too.

125
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.589
You too, ma'am.

126
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.429
And you too, my obese fellow.
Great work, everyone.

127
00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:03.770
What? You'll find it
hard to believe,

128
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.100
but my belly isn't sticking out.
It's my chest that's sunken in.

129
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.699
Woo Tak, let's go.

130
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.480
Goodbye, sir.

131
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.259
Have we heard anything
from the forensic unit?

132
00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.190
No. They said they'd call us
as soon as the results are out.

133
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.330
It's taking pretty long.

134
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.199
What if Yoo Su Kyung's DNA...

135
00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.029
isn't found in the blood?

136
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:40.870
Well, then I guess we'll have to go
back there to find another one.

137
00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.699
You want me to go there again?

138
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.040
My apologies. Gosh, I dozed off...

139
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.940
and had a dream
where I got a draft notice.

140
00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.710
Why aren't you saying anything?
Help me out here, please.

141
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.989
Hello? Yes, that's right.

142
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:59.049
Oh, the results are out?

143
00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:00.620
Yes.

144
00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:04.730
Oh, is that right? Okay. Thank you.

145
00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:11.330
They found blood
on 1 of the 6 robot vacuums,

146
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.230
and according to the DNA analysis,

147
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.139
it is Yoo Su Kyung's blood!

148
00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:18.670
Yes! Amazing! We did it!

149
00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:23.339
Oh, what are you doing?

150
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.250
Great work.

151
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.049
Thanks. You too.

152
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.560
Are you sure?

153
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:41.159
Thank goodness. Okay, I'll start
writing an article right away.

154
00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.270
They found Yoo Su Kyung's blood!

155
00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:46.029
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

156
00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:47.870
Which one of us found
the one with the blood?

157
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.699
Is it the one I found?

158
00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:51.969
Gosh, Kyung Han.
That's not even important.

159
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.239
I have to go back to work
to write the article. Bye.

160
00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:55.710
All right. Bye.

161
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380
Hong Joo.

162
00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:03.719
Yes. What's up?

163
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:07.319
About the man who attacked
Jae Chan in your dream...

164
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:09.690
I think it was Hak Young.

165
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.429
How do you know that?

166
00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:13.799
I met him a few days ago,

167
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.630
and he was wearing a black hat.

168
00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.400
But he's been acquitted, so what you
saw in your dream won't happen.

169
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.940
I want to ask you for a favor though
just in case.

170
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.370
What is it?

171
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.639
Can you interview Hak Young
for the article you're writing?

172
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.179
People have been cursing him
like there's no tomorrow, you know.

173
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.350
I bet there are many things
he wants to say.

174
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.679
He'll regret it if he never
gets them off his chest.

175
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.520
That may make him do
something stupid out of anger.

176
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.319
You're right.

177
00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:41.960
Don't worry. I'll listen
to everything he wants to say.

178
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:44.389
Thanks, Hong Joo.

179
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.460
What are you so excited about?

180
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.630
I'm on my way to get my decision
on the Do Hak Young case approved.

181
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.830
Not guilty. And we won't indict him.

182
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.900
Mr. Jung.

183
00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:57.969
Please spare me a second.

184
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.710
You want me to indict him
when he's not guilty?

185
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:03.810
Are you out of your mind?

186
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.819
No, I'm in my right mind. And I know
that he shouldn't be indicted.

187
00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:07.980
And you're spewing such nonsense?

188
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.719
If you let him go like this,

189
00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:12.089
reporters will criticize
the investigation once again.

190
00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:14.319
Hey, what's there to criticize?

191
00:10:14.319 --> 00:10:16.960
We found evidence to prove that
he's not guilty. The robot vacuum!

192
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.830
We even found
Yoo Su Kyung's blood on it.

193
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.460
Do you think reporters
will spin things that way?

194
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.069
"Actually, we were wrong. The
prosecution was right all along."

195
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.100
Do you think they'll write that?

196
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.810
Let's just say that he's been
acquitted.

197
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.739
Make sure it doesn't go over
15 seconds.

198
00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:34.779
Then what about the robot vacuum?

199
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.980
We need to tell people about it...

200
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.250
to make sure they won't criticize
the prosecution and its decision.

201
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.850
Why do we have to worry about that?

202
00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:43.690
Just keep it brief.

203
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.750
Then people will keep treating
Do Hak Young as a murderer.

204
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.060
What do you want me to do, then?

205
00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:51.029
All we've been doing
is criticizing the prosecution.

206
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.929
It'll be too embarrassing
to change our words like that.

207
00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:54.100
We must change our words.

208
00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:56.460
How can we ignore it
fully knowing the truth?

209
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.600
Just ignore it.

210
00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.100
That's much better
than dealing with embarrassment.

211
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.170
- Captain!
- Captain!

212
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.770
There's a thing called the Law
of Motion in the news industry.

213
00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:08.380
If we suddenly make a U-turn
after going straight for a while,

214
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.909
what will people think of us?

215
00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:11.480
Hey, I used to be
just like you guys.

216
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.580
If we keep changing our direction,

217
00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:16.580
no one will want to watch our news
because it'll make them dizzy.

218
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.819
No media outlet
will report the truth...

219
00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:22.290
about the Do Hak Young case. Never.

220
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.429
Don't jinx it, will you?

221
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.130
I'm not trying to jinx it.
I'm telling you the reality.

222
00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:29.330
The media will never take our side.

223
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.130
The public's view
won't change either.

224
00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:33.940
The protesters will continue
to protest and curse at you.

225
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.069
And they'll criticize the work
you do...

226
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:38.609
for every case you take on
from now on.

227
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.790
Hey, you! Why don't you
have lunch with Seung Won?

228
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.690
Yes, you should be friends with him.

229
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.859
His brother is a prosecutor,
you know. Who knows?

230
00:11:59.859 --> 00:12:02.759
His brother might be able
to let your dad out of jail.

231
00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:04.569
Yes, that's right!

232
00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:06.969
As we all know, his brother's
specialty is releasing criminals.

233
00:12:07.969 --> 00:12:09.040
Hey!

234
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.609
Hey, stop it!

235
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.839
- Guys, break it up!
- That's enough!

236
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.409
- You jerk!
- Gosh!

237
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:19.109
Come here, jerk!
Apologize immediately, you punk!

238
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.980
- Hey, who do you think you are?
- Stop him!

239
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.719
Stop, please.

240
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.489
- Hey.
- What's he doing?

241
00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:25.889
Hey! Stop it.

242
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.060
- Gosh, stop!
- That's enough!

243
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.690
- Hold him.
- Hey, please.

244
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.190
So, you should indict him.

245
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.529
If Do Hak Young gets a lawyer
to handle the trial,

246
00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:37.069
he'll get acquitted anyway.

247
00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:39.370
Then he'll be released,

248
00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:42.739
and those who have been criticizing
you will start targeting the judge.

249
00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:45.909
Everyone will say that
the prosecution has done its best.

250
00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:50.040
Why are you volunteering
to take all the blame?

251
00:12:50.409 --> 00:12:53.109
Just indict him, and take your hands
off of it once and for all.

252
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.529
(Assistant Chief Prosecutor
Park Dae Young)

253
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.179
Are you okay?

254
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.920
Yes.

255
00:13:34.219 --> 00:13:37.489
I'm sorry I punched you earlier.

256
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.259
Let me go!

257
00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:43.159
Why did you bring me back to life?

258
00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:45.299
Why did you save my life?

259
00:13:45.469 --> 00:13:48.040
You should've just let me die.
Why did you save my life?

260
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.299
- Let go!
- Bring Ultram!

261
00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:50.609
- Yes, Doctor.
- Let go of me!

262
00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:52.940
Just let me die, please!

263
00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:54.080
I said, let go!

264
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.339
You should live, sir.

265
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.790
I...

266
00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:08.790
I don't resent you.

267
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.089
I'm glad...

268
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.259
that you're alive.

269
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.299
So, please.

270
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.170
Just live.

272
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.250
My dad told me...

273
00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:40.580
that anger can make even things
that are right feel unbearable.

274
00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:43.819
Saving a life is the right thing
to do, of course.

275
00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:46.250
But I couldn't stand the situation
earlier because I was too angry.

276
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.359
Thanks.

277
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.659
Hadn't it been for you, I would've
had to live with regrets forever.

From Chestnut.

279
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.850
Are you still torn?

280
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.319
No, I've made up my mind.

281
00:16:22.989 --> 00:16:24.630
- Will you indict him?
- No.

282
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:26.429
I won't indict him
because he's not guilty.

283
00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:27.630
Isn't it obvious?

284
00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:30.060
Gosh, you're so dumb.

285
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.830
You never listen to a word I say,
do you?

286
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.639
I heard everything you said,

287
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.600
and I know
what you're worried about.

288
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.670
But who knows?

289
00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:40.540
There might be some reporters
who are as dumb as me.

290
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.380
Does anyone have
anything else to discuss?

291
00:16:43.179 --> 00:16:44.409
Not you guys!

292
00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:46.310
The news that Do Hak Young
has been acquitted.

293
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.150
I want to give it
a full minute and a half.

294
00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.219
Guys, enough is enough, okay?

295
00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.290
We'll look ridiculous
if we cover that story in full.

296
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:56.889
Who'd want to watch a news program
that keeps changing its words?

297
00:16:56.889 --> 00:16:59.130
Even navigation systems
search for the best route again...

298
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.799
when the driver takes the wrong way.

299
00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:03.429
Can you drive with a navigation
system that keeps telling you...

300
00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:04.830
to take the wrong way?

301
00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:07.739
When something is wrong,
we need to correct it.

302
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.940
Who'd trust a news program that
insists what's wrong is right?

303
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.069
Goodness, fine.

304
00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:14.839
Are you my supervisor or what?

305
00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.409
Just be glad that she's not
your supervisor.

306
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.380
If she had
more seniority than you...

307
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:22.580
What?

308
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.449
My gosh, I must be losing my mind.

309
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.870
We'll do the interview over there.

310
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.370
Okay, thank you.

311
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.770
You should eat this
on your way back.

312
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.639
The yellow one is salad gimbap,
and the blue one is beef gimbap.

313
00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:45.870
No, it's okay.

314
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.210
I wanted to do something to show you
how much I appreciate everything.

315
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.179
Thank you.

316
00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.150
Hey, that jacket makes you look
like a punk. Wear mine instead.

317
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.350
Really?

318
00:17:57.089 --> 00:17:58.350
Hey, thanks.

319
00:18:01.489 --> 00:18:05.060
Dozens of reporters surrounded me
when I got arrested.

320
00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:06.730
Now that I've been acquitted,

321
00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:09.359
only that one team showed up.

322
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400
I know, right?

323
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.549
Are you ready?

324
00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:25.650
Yes.

325
00:18:39.389 --> 00:18:42.699
Well... Gosh, Woo Tak.

326
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.170
What should I say?

327
00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:54.980
Please feel free to say
everything you've wanted to say.

328
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.900
So...

329
00:19:19.969 --> 00:19:21.000
I'm...

330
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.480
I'm...

331
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.969
Well, I...

332
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.429
didn't kill her.

333
00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:57.639
I really didn't kill her.

334
00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:03.650
I...

335
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.449
did not kill the archer,

336
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.020
Yoo Su Kyung.

337
00:20:17.489 --> 00:20:20.630
Since being suspected of killing Ms.
Yoo Su Kyung and getting arrested,

338
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.469
Mr. Do has been the target of
collective rage at a national level.

339
00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:26.370
Upon hearing about the prosecution's
decision to acquit him,

340
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.440
he publicly spoke
of his innocence...

341
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.940
but soon got choked up
and couldn't continue.

342
00:20:30.739 --> 00:20:32.040
Hey, did you watch the news?

343
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.109
I'm watching it now.

344
00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:35.839
Her death was an accident,
not homicide.

345
00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:36.949
That is crazy.

346
00:20:36.949 --> 00:20:38.279
Is this really true?

347
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.350
Yes, it's true.

348
00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:44.350
The blood pattern on the floor was
made by a robot vacuum, not him.

349
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.750
What? A robot vacuum?

350
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.560
- That's right!
- My gosh.

351
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.659
The prosecution did an excellent job
with the investigation.

352
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.359
From now on, we should trust
everything the prosecution does.

353
00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:55.529
Gosh, this is...

354
00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:57.500
- Goodness.
- The sky is so clear today.

355
00:21:07.009 --> 00:21:10.179
Since the robot vacuum
with Ms. Yoo's blood was found,

356
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.850
the criticism
against the prosecution...

357
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.380
has been dying down.

358
00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:18.319
The prosecution acquitted
the accused, Mr. Do,

359
00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.889
and the case has been closed.

360
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.520
Unbelievable.

361
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.460
Because Ms. Yoo was a sports star
loved by the entire nation,

362
00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:28.199
Mr. Do, who was
suspected of killing her...

363
00:21:28.199 --> 00:21:30.670
I must say, Ms. Nam is
the only reporter...

364
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.130
who is trying
to clarify our intentions.

365
00:21:32.929 --> 00:21:34.000
I know, right?

366
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.909
Anger made even things
that are right feel unbearable.

367
00:21:37.969 --> 00:21:41.139
Anger made even things
that are right feel unbearable.

368
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.509
My dad told me...

369
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:47.819
that anger can make even things
that are right feel unbearable.

370
00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.690
You look so much
like someone I know.

371
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.889
Who?

372
00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:02.699
A jerk who punched me
when I was a kid.

373
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.839
The prosecution's investigation...

374
00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:09.370
revealed that Ms. Yoo's death
was an accident, not homicide.

375
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.810
We would like to correct
our previous report.

376
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.639
We sincerely apologize to Mr. Do
and all of our viewers.

377
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.339
This was Reporter Nam Hong Joo
of "SBC News".

378
00:22:22.449 --> 00:22:23.520
That can't be.

379
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.219
What's wrong?

380
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.219
Excuse me. Where did Ms. Yoon go?

381
00:22:28.219 --> 00:22:30.790
She stepped out to go to the
pharmacy to pick up digestive aids.

382
00:22:32.989 --> 00:22:34.500
Wait, Mr. Jung.

383
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.770
It's because I'm having those
dreams too.

384
00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:45.440
Why did you give it to me?

385
00:22:45.609 --> 00:22:46.710
Why me?

386
00:22:48.639 --> 00:22:49.839
I have no idea...

387
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.949
why it's happening to you.

388
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:55.650
There must be a reason why...

389
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.920
it has to be you and me.

390
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.239
The kid who saved your life...

391
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.469
Wasn't it Hong Joo?

392
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.750
You keep seeing Hong Joo
in your dreams,

393
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.520
so she must be
the one who saved your life.

394
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.989
The kid who saved me was a boy.

395
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.889
It wasn't Hong Joo.

396
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.469
Thank you.

397
00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:50.710
(Pharmacy)

398
00:23:51.239 --> 00:23:52.339
My gosh!

399
00:23:54.839 --> 00:23:55.940
Mr. Jung.

400
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.279
Was Hong Joo's nickname...

401
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.449
Chestnut by any chance?

402
00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.980
Gosh, how do you know?

403
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.319
She wanted to become
a baseball player as a kid,

404
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:07.520
so she got a buzz cut, which
made her head look like a chestnut.

405
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.659
Thank you. Thank you so much.

406
00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:12.060
- All right.
- Thank you again.

407
00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.359
- Okay.
- Thank you!

408
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.400
You're welcome!

409
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.270
Thank you!

410
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.969
Why is he thanking me?

411
00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:26.109
(Mr. Yoo Man Ho)

412
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:30.449
Yes, Mr. Yoo. I saw the news.

413
00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:33.449
The prosecution found
something totally useless...

414
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.480
and acquitted Do Hak Young.

415
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.350
Please don't worry.

416
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.819
I'm going to meet
with the reporters and drop a bomb.

417
00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:43.830
Did you see the pictures
I gave you the other day?

418
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.859
He's Lieutenant Han Woo Tak.

419
00:24:45.889 --> 00:24:48.259
He's Prosecutor Jung's close friend.

420
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.170
I found out that Lieutenant Han...

421
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.900
and Do Hak Young used to be
roommates.

422
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.810
Does that mean the prosecutor
let Do Hak Young go...

423
00:24:57.069 --> 00:24:58.770
because they're acquainted?

424
00:24:59.239 --> 00:25:01.540
Well, I was hoping that Jae Chan...
I mean,

425
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.549
Prosecutor Jung wouldn't
go that low,

426
00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:07.049
but he did acquit him,

427
00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:08.779
so it must be the case.

428
00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:25.630
Oh, I'll go with the second one
from the left, the ring with ruby.

429
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.170
You have a good eye.

430
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.210
What's your girlfriend's ring size?

431
00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:33.909
I don't really know her ring size.

432
00:25:35.639 --> 00:25:36.779
What is this?

433
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.650
Just something small.
I thought you'd need it.

434
00:25:43.179 --> 00:25:45.250
She must have seen this
in her dream.

435
00:25:47.989 --> 00:25:49.460
Here. Please match this size.

436
00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:53.659
Sure. You picked ruby. Are you going
to profess your feelings to her?

437
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.969
I'm meeting a friend whom
I've known for a very long time.

438
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:09.179
Where are you? There's something
I want to tell you in person.

439
00:26:17.949 --> 00:26:20.920
Woo Tak, it's me. Do you know
where Do Hak Young is now?

440
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.130
Woo Tak.

441
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:30.529
To tell you the truth,

442
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.670
I was...

443
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.139
not in my right mind
for a little while.

444
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.739
From the jerk that vandalized
my mom's restaurant...

445
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.940
to the police and the prosecutor,

446
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:44.179
I contemplated killing them all.

447
00:26:47.179 --> 00:26:48.880
I just thought about it.

448
00:26:50.989 --> 00:26:52.219
Oh, boy.

449
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.690
Why did I think like that?

450
00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:02.100
I'm glad to know
that you've come to your senses.

451
00:27:08.139 --> 00:27:11.609
Your secret is safe with me,
so don't leave the police force.

452
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.210
That's... I'd say it's luck.

453
00:27:16.779 --> 00:27:19.109
Luck created by a misunderstanding.

454
00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.389
Hak Young and I are having
drinks together now.

455
00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.389
You don't need to worry
about that dream anymore.

456
00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:31.290
(Youngdeok Crab)

457
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.529
Where should I meet you?

458
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.850
If I really
changed the future earlier...

459
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.580
I mean, let's just say that I did.

460
00:27:52.949 --> 00:27:54.449
Then what's going to happen?

461
00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.120
I'm not sure.

462
00:28:01.659 --> 00:28:06.159
Kyung Han, Mr. Yoo Man Ho's personal
firearm hasn't been returned yet.

463
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.600
Have you tried contacting him?

464
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.529
Yes, I can't get a hold of him.

465
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:10.569
Really?

466
00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:12.699
Yoo Man Ho...

467
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.000
That name rings a bell.

468
00:28:17.009 --> 00:28:20.279
When you stop a flowing stream,
it diverts its course.

469
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.580
We stopped things
that were supposed to happen,

470
00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.009
so time will probably divert
from its predetermined course now.

471
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.120
If time changes its direction,

472
00:28:30.319 --> 00:28:31.949
which way will it go?

473
00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.420
Will things be better or worse?

474
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.589
I don't know because I haven't
tried to change things yet.

475
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:43.159
One thing I know for certain is...

476
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.130
that time will flow differently
from now on,

477
00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:47.100
whether it's good...

478
00:28:48.139 --> 00:28:49.500
or bad.

479
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.230
He's been shot!

480
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.730
- Gosh!
- How did that happen?

481
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.770
- Help!
- Call an ambulance!

482
00:29:53.969 --> 00:29:55.739
- He got shot!
- He needs help!

483
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.409
Jae Chan, Jae Chan!

484
00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:00.239
Please call an ambulance.

485
00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:02.210
Can somebody call an ambulance?
Please...

486
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.080
Call an ambulance right away,
please.

487
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.219
Jae Chan. Hang in there, Jae Chan.

488
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.350
Jae Chan, no...

489
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.690
Please call an ambulance!

490
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.819
Please help!

491
00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:15.389
Jae Chan...

492
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.429
Please call an ambulance!

493
00:31:07.089 --> 00:14:22.900
(While You Were Sleeping)

494
00:31:09.259 --> 00:31:10.960
I couldn't change the dream.

495
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:14.330
I did,
but it turned out to be worse.

496
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.969
You're Chestnut.

497
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.500
Why didn't I recognize you?

498
00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:21.370
If this is the end, you'll keep
blaming yourself for everything.

499
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.440
Did I shoot him?
Did I abet or aid the murder?

500
00:31:23.469 --> 00:31:24.910
What are you
going to charge me with?

501
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.109
You 13 years ago is a scar to me.

502
00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.310
Jae Chan.

503
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.649
There's something I want
to tell you.

504
00:31:32.919 --> 00:31:36.419
It's much more than telling you
that it's nice to see you.
