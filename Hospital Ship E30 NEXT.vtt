00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.050
(Episode 30)

2
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.190
Darn it.

3
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.260
What happened?

4
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.190
Doctor Kwak. How did the surgery go?

5
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.199
What's that?

6
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.100
Untie it, and press here with this.

7
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.770
Now.

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.109
Goodness. Fine.

9
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.750
Take this to the operating room.

10
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.659
Hurry up.

11
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.859
Go.

12
00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.229
What...

13
00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.899
What are you doing?

14
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.500
We need blood.

15
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.270
We need more than 10 packs of B-type and O-type blood.

16
00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.040
Are you telling us to donate our blood?

17
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.069
Yes.

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.810
How could you ask us that when we're like this?

19
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.879
No.

20
00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.609
- I won't let anyone do that. - Hey.

21
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.150
What? You're going to hit me again?

22
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.019
Go on. Hit me, and kill me too.

23
00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:22.420
You little...

24
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.390
- My blood type is B. - Doctor Kim.

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.659
Mine is O.

26
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.260
Don't do it. Even if you do, they won't thank you.

27
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.799
Do you think they won't kill us if we save that patient?

28
00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.870
- So... - That's why we have to do it.

29
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.670
You know the reason better than I do.

30
00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.909
We help anyone who is hurt...

31
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.840
even if they're robbers or serial killers.

32
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.480
- In battlefield, we even... - I know.

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.079
I know that too.

34
00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.719
I know we even have to save the enemies...

35
00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.560
who killed our men.

36
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.560
That's our duty as a medical team.

37
00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.799
I know all that,

38
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.370
but this is infuriating.

39
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.199
- It's just so infuriating. - That's enough.

40
00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.340
This is a hospital ship after all.

41
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.210
They can't donate blood like this.

42
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.620
Untie them.

43
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.780
Now.

44
00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.759
Girls first then.

45
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.360
Ji Young, draw their blood.

46
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.930
- You can do it, right? - Yes, I'll do it.

47
00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.900
Do me first. My blood type is O too.

48
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.439
Hey.

49
00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.000
All right. Thank you.

50
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.780
Gauze.

51
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.750
It's almost done.

52
00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.300
Thank you.

53
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.780
- Does he have enough blood? - Not yet.

54
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.629
We can't get any more blood from our staff.

55
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.699
So?

56
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.000
What now?

57
00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:20.629
How much time do we have?

58
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.129
We still have 40 minutes.

59
00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.829
We only need to do the anastomosis now.

60
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.500
Take your time. We still have enough time.

61
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.490
On your knees. I said on your knees!

62
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.019
How did the surgery go?

63
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.629
- It went well. It's Doctor Song. - And?

64
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.860
And what? Don't you get it?

65
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.300
Did you think they would...

66
00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.899
leave us once we save the patient?

67
00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:03.269
Why are only three of you back?

68
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.339
What about Doctor Song and Hyun?

69
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.410
What happened to Eun Jae and Hyun?

70
00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:15.680
Ah Rim.

71
00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:19.319
We don't know either.

72
00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:49.250
- Let go of me. - What do you think you're doing?

73
00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:54.649
Stay quiet, and pack his medicine.

74
00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.019
Doctor Song will be coming with us.

75
00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:00.389
That's not what we agreed on.

76
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.199
We saved the patient in three hours as we promised.

77
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.370
That's why we're letting you all live.

78
00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.839
We need some kind of an insurance, don't you think?

79
00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.540
Remember.

80
00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:16.709
If we see any signs of the police chasing us...

81
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.480
Right here.

82
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.350
We'll put a hole in her head...

83
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.279
and throw her out into the sea.

84
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.519
That won't happen. I promise.

85
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.019
That's right, it won't. Good boy.

86
00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:33.889
- So... - We still need her.

87
00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.959
We need a doctor who will take care of our boss on our way!

88
00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:40.100
Take me instead then. I'll go with you.

89
00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.500
An internal medicine doctor is better for post-operative care.

90
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.639
Doctor Kwak.

91
00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:49.610
Let her go.

92
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.639
Take me instead.

93
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.649
You just won't stop talking.

94
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.319
Are you going to keep acting up?

95
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.290
- Do you think this is a toy? - Stop!

96
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.300
I'll pack the medicine, so please stop.

97
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.399
Don't do anything to him!

98
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.170
Is anyone out there?

99
00:08:23.209 --> 00:08:24.839
Come in, and tie him up first.

100
00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:29.779
What is it?

101
00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.250
Sir, we have a problem.

102
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.639
Stay right here.

103
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.950
That little...

104
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.559
Open it. Open it, you punk!

105
00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:02.440
Darn it.

106
00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.059
Doctor Kwak.

107
00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:58.129
Do you hear me?

108
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.399
Get up.

109
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.299
Wake up.

110
00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:15.210
Good.

111
00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:17.179
Well done.

112
00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:21.789
Hold onto me.

113
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.389
Don't let go.

114
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.659
Don't lose consciousness.

115
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.559
Don't go anywhere.

116
00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:35.370
Don't go.

117
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.539
Okay?

118
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.049
Doctor Kwak.

119
00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:01.789
Wake up.

120
00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:04.700
Wake up!

121
00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:07.269
Don't go anywhere!

122
00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:09.929
Don't go, okay?

123
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.139
Don't go!

124
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.820
(Coast Guard)

125
00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:25.419
Come on out.

126
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.789
Watch your step.

127
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.889
Are you okay, Nurse Pyo?

128
00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:04.289
What are you doing here?

129
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:06.730
What do you think?

130
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.590
I'm checking if anything's broken.

131
00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:12.200
Leave it for now. Do it tomorrow.

132
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.399
I'm not going anywhere.

133
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.000
I need to take her back.

134
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.740
Let's just go.

135
00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.169
We've been through too much tonight.

136
00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:23.379
That's why I should stay.

137
00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:24.980
Captain.

138
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.340
Don't call me that.

139
00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:30.049
I'm ashamed and embarrassed.

140
00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:31.519
About what?

141
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.720
I'm the captain,

142
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:35.720
yet I sat in that chair...

143
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.559
and did nothing.

144
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.259
If I think about what my crew went through...

145
00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:44.429
You didn't do nothing.

146
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.000
You turned off the AIS.

147
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.730
That's what tipped off the Coast Guard.

148
00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:52.100
Now come with me.

149
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.509
Okay, okay, I will.

150
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.440
You take the others to safety first.

151
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.809
I'll stay for just a while longer.

152
00:13:59.909 --> 00:14:02.080
There's something I must stay and do.

153
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.080
Goodness.

154
00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:28.710
Who could it be so early?

155
00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:35.250
Hello?

156
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.620
Are you Doctor Kwak Hyun's mother?

157
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.190
Yes. Who is this?

158
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.460
I'm Bang Sung Woo, the captain of the hospital ship.

159
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.889
I see. Why are you calling me?

160
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:52.929
Something happened on board the ship last night.

161
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.299
Doctor Kwak was badly hurt,

162
00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:59.070
and they're transporting him to a hospital on land.

163
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.740
What?

164
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.049
Last night, hospital ship Geoje 505...

165
00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:13.220
was hijacked by drug smugglers.

166
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.620
The Internal Medicine doctor was shot...

167
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.559
and gravely wounded.

168
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.700
My goodness, what happened? How are you?

169
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.129
Are you okay?

170
00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:31.370
Where to? Straight to an OR?

171
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.169
No, go to Intensive Care.

172
00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:41.110
It went through his right pelvis.

173
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.120
It could have damaged his left kidney.

174
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.820
Doctor Kim's in surgery, and Doctor Oh's off.

175
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.519
It's the weekend.

176
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.820
What do you mean?

177
00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:53.120
- You're saying... - Right now...

178
00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:56.559
we have no surgeon to operate on him.

179
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:02.799
Will you do it?

180
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.899
Can you?

181
00:16:05.169 --> 00:16:06.870
We'll send him up if you can.

182
00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:11.909
You can't, can you?

183
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.110
Not after what happened last night.

184
00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.419
I shouldn't have asked.

185
00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:20.620
Let's see what we can do to stabilize him.

186
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.620
I'll see if we can transfer him.

187
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720
No.

188
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:29.559
I'll do it.

189
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Doctor Song.

190
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.230
His operation.

191
00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:35.870
I'll do it.

192
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.639
Are you sure?

193
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:41.509
Call an anesthesiologist.

194
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.639
Let's move him to the OR immediately.

195
00:16:53.663 --> 00:16:56.895
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] Episode 30 Hospital Ship "Why Should We?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

196
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.769
It's not your fault.

197
00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.009
It's not your fault.

198
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.019
Let me help.

199
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:30.920
Forget other times,

200
00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:34.130
but like now,

201
00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:35.829
when you're struggling.

202
00:17:38.829 --> 00:17:39.829
No.

203
00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:43.839
I don't need you.

204
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.970
Stay out of my business.

205
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.710
Even if my brother calls,

206
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.450
even if my dad dies, or...

207
00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.750
even if I die.

208
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:03.789
Don't ever...

209
00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:07.029
get involved.

210
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.269
Still, thank you.

211
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:54.410
For thinking of me...

212
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.309
first when you're hurting.

213
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.750
Remember one thing.

214
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.420
What's between us could be a door, not a wall.

215
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.450
You just have to open it and walk through.

216
00:19:43.589 --> 00:19:45.420
I'll wait by the door.

217
00:20:53.829 --> 00:20:54.930
Scalpel.

218
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.069
What? Doctor Song's doing what?

219
00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:04.170
Operating.

220
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.910
This is just insane.

221
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.740
What's wrong with you? Why is everyone making her...

222
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.579
She wanted to do it.

223
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.920
- So you let her? - Yes.

224
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.519
I feel terrible about what happened on board.

225
00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:23.019
If you think about it, Doctor Song's a patient too.

226
00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:25.390
I know she's suffering from mental trauma.

227
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.589
But she's also...

228
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:30.730
a talented and experienced surgeon.

229
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.299
For a colleague,

230
00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:34.930
- she should overcome... - A colleague?

231
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.299
Says who?

232
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.339
They're colleagues.

233
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.940
Oh dear.

234
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.289
Look.

235
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.730
She's doing just fine, nice and calm.

236
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:07.470
That's why she is who she is.

237
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.200
They don't call her a genius for nothing.

238
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.650
Where's Hyun?

239
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.779
Where is he?

240
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.019
How is he?

241
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.220
He's in surgery. Doctor Song's operating.

242
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.460
Doctor Song's operating on him...

243
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.400
personally?

244
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:16.740
After what happened,

245
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.170
after all she went through,

246
00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:21.509
she's operating on him?

247
00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:27.980
What is she thinking?

248
00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.750
What do you think?

249
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.410
Even the best surgeon...

250
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.710
can't bear to operate on a family member, especially...

251
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.009
their loved one.

252
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.980
In case they...

253
00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:04.220
lose their cool?

254
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.160
What do you think...

255
00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:13.759
Doctor Song is like?

256
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.130
Did she lose her cool?

257
00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:20.569
No.

258
00:24:21.829 --> 00:24:25.099
Was she calm and collected?

259
00:24:26.369 --> 00:24:27.809
More than that.

260
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.349
Is that what it sounds like to cry inwardly?

261
00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:14.049
She's crying inside,

262
00:25:16.089 --> 00:25:19.359
keeping all the tears bottled up inside.

263
00:25:21.329 --> 00:25:22.730
That is how...

264
00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:26.299
she is fighting right now.

265
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.039
Fiercely, like a warrior.

266
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.180
If there is a deity,

267
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.880
if there really is such a being,

268
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.150
then today,

269
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.289
today of all days, he should take her side.

270
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.460
Can you win?

271
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.099
Do you think...

272
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.599
you can beat her?

273
00:26:11.809 --> 00:26:13.579
I gave up.

274
00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:15.910
There's no way I can beat that.

275
00:26:16.819 --> 00:26:18.980
You can't. No one can.

276
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.259
So, as of today,

277
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.890
I give up completely.

278
00:26:31.599 --> 00:26:34.470
I do give up, but...

279
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.569
But what?

280
00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:40.609
I find it somewhat disappointing.

281
00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:47.980
That it's Hyun on the operating table...

282
00:26:50.619 --> 00:26:52.650
and not me.

283
00:26:59.789 --> 00:27:01.430
I'm so disappointed.

284
00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:07.359
(Geoje Jeil Hospital)

285
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.910
Where...

286
00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:03.619
am I?

287
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.589
Am I at a hospital?

288
00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.269
Are you okay?

289
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.079
Are you...

290
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.119
hurt anywhere?
