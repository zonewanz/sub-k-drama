00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:11.658
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:51.421
Doctor Song.

3
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.762
He... He's still alive.

4
00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:00.772
Doctor Song!

5
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:06.772
What about him next?

6
00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:09.882
Shall I blow his head off too?

7
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.112
No.

8
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:14.052
Take them.

9
00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:34.972
Boss.

10
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:37.142
You're back.

11
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:38.972
I brought the doctors.

12
00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:41.142
You'll feel better soon.

13
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.041
Hurry up.

14
00:01:46.912 --> 00:01:48.112
Are you okay?

15
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.522
I have to be.

16
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:32.791
He got two gunshot wounds on the abdomen.

17
00:02:32.932 --> 00:02:34.962
He didn't get shot in his lungs or heart,

18
00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:37.101
but his breathing is too unstable.

19
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:38.532
Let's turn him over.

20
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:44.301
There is only one exit wound.

21
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:45.342
Based on the position of the wound,

22
00:02:45.342 --> 00:02:48.312
it looks like the bullet that went through damaged his right kidney.

23
00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:50.981
How is his blood pressure?

24
00:02:57.622 --> 00:02:59.252
It fell below 70.

25
00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:00.791
It's highly likely that...

26
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.861
the bullet damaged major vessels as it penetrated or ricocheted.

27
00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:11.462
We have to put in a central line, get him on an IV,

28
00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.372
and move him to the hospital ship quickly.

29
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.331
Move him?

30
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.671
He will die without a surgery.

31
00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:21.611
Do it here.

32
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:23.942
What did you say?

33
00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:27.581
I said to do the surgery here.

34
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:29.821
I have to put him under general anesthesia and open him up.

35
00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:32.122
This place is unsanitary, and we don't have anesthetics.

36
00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:33.421
I can't operate on him here.

37
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.891
Take out your scalpel now!

38
00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:39.562
Do you want me to kill this patient?

39
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.831
Do the surgery.

40
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.162
If I do, he will die.

41
00:03:46.532 --> 00:03:50.171
Scalpel is a tool we use to save people's lives.

42
00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:52.972
I can't use it recklessly and make it a weapon.

43
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:56.382
Start the surgery right now.

44
00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:00.611
First of all,

45
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.351
please put that gun down.

46
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:08.592
Do you think you can fool me?

47
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.222
You're trying to take us all to the hospital ship...

48
00:04:11.222 --> 00:04:13.292
and work something out, aren't you?

49
00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:16.531
You know that if you drag out the surgery until the morning,

50
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:19.132
we won't be able to escape. Isn't that right?

51
00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:22.031
That's not true.

52
00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:23.942
An abdominal operation is a major surgery.

53
00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:25.971
We need a lot of equipment for it.

54
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:28.612
But the patient's condition is too critical...

55
00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:31.612
that we're not even sure if we can save him on the ship.

56
00:04:31.612 --> 00:04:35.352
Then why do you want to take him there then?

57
00:04:36.112 --> 00:04:39.122
Would you move him to a big hospital if we suggest it?

58
00:04:40.492 --> 00:04:41.792
You can't, can you?

59
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:44.422
If you could,

60
00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:47.161
you wouldn't have broken into our ship in the first place.

61
00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:52.401
We have to go back to the hospital ship.

62
00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:54.901
Although we don't have every equipment,

63
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.502
but we have people whom we've worked together with.

64
00:04:57.742 --> 00:05:01.372
We've worked together to save people's lives. They will...

65
00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:12.451
He's not breathing. Intubation.

66
00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:45.521
Please.

67
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:48.321
Let us take him to the hospital ship.

68
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:49.622
It's the only way to save him.

69
00:05:53.132 --> 00:05:54.362
Maybe we should do as they say.

70
00:05:58.002 --> 00:05:59.232
Fine.

71
00:06:01.372 --> 00:06:03.172
Let's go back to the ship.

72
00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:05.442
But...

73
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:08.042
on one condition.

74
00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:11.312
- What is it? - Three hours.

75
00:06:13.312 --> 00:06:15.951
Finish the surgery in three hours.

76
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.052
What?

77
00:06:19.552 --> 00:06:22.821
If it goes for even a minute longer than that,

78
00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:27.331
we will kill everyone on your ship.

79
00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:31.831
What do you say?

80
00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:34.201
Doctor Song.

81
00:06:35.302 --> 00:06:36.641
Can you do it?

82
00:07:22.682 --> 00:07:24.721
- It's strange. - What?

83
00:07:25.122 --> 00:07:26.622
The hospital ship disappeared.

84
00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:28.752
What do you mean?

85
00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:32.091
It was anchored at Kukdo Dock five minutes ago.

86
00:07:32.192 --> 00:07:33.461
And it isn't now?

87
00:07:36.232 --> 00:07:38.901
It's strange. I wonder if something happened to it.

88
00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:02.451
What do you think happened to Doctor Song and Hyun?

89
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:06.122
I guess there is a way out of every situation indeed.

90
00:08:06.362 --> 00:08:07.632
What do you mean?

91
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:14.031
That's...

92
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:16.872
Yes. It's a cellphone we have on the ship for emergency use.

93
00:08:17.542 --> 00:08:19.302
How can we get to it?

94
00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:28.212
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:31.622
You're coming back here?

96
00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:34.391
Yes. Okay.

97
00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:39.632
Who are Pyo Go Eun and Yoo Ah Rim?

98
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:45.161
- That's me. - Me.

99
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:46.801
Get up, and come with us.

100
00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:50.671
- Move it! Now! - No!

101
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.811
- Nurse Pyo! - Nurse Yoo!

102
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:54.372
- Nurse Pyo! - Get up now!

103
00:08:54.872 --> 00:08:57.582
Why do you need them? Where are you taking them?

104
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.791
(Geoje 505)

105
00:09:26.212 --> 00:09:27.411
(Geoje 505)

106
00:09:28.712 --> 00:09:29.742
Get in.

107
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:34.811
What a mess.

108
00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:41.992
Cut her free, and prepare to operate.

109
00:09:44.921 --> 00:09:47.561
To operate?

110
00:09:48.592 --> 00:09:50.132
What operation?

111
00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:52.301
To sew up a man with bullets in his stomach.

112
00:09:53.732 --> 00:09:55.702
Come on, get moving.

113
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.941
For a surgery like that,

114
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:03.141
you need more people than the two of us.

115
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:07.051
Get Cha Joon Young, the dentist.

116
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:09.482
Shut your mouth, and do as you're told.

117
00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:11.252
Move it.

118
00:10:12.521 --> 00:10:14.191
I told you clearly.

119
00:10:15.722 --> 00:10:17.322
If your patient dies,

120
00:10:18.822 --> 00:10:19.862
it's...

121
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:22.092
all on you.

122
00:10:54.132 --> 00:10:55.161
Our boss.

123
00:10:56.161 --> 00:10:57.431
How is he?

124
00:10:57.431 --> 00:10:58.962
They said they'll operate.

125
00:11:00.102 --> 00:11:01.372
Let's see what happens.

126
00:11:01.372 --> 00:11:03.171
Shouldn't we get out of here?

127
00:11:03.702 --> 00:11:04.941
Forget about loyalty.

128
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:08.141
If this were about loyalty, I'd have gone long ago.

129
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:10.311
The money we sent overseas.

130
00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:12.041
Only our boss knows where it is.

131
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:16.222
He's also the only one who knows who to sell today's stash to.

132
00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:18.352
We barely killed them off yesterday.

133
00:11:19.151 --> 00:11:21.952
It's a matter of time before the gang knows they're dead.

134
00:11:21.952 --> 00:11:23.921
They'll just send stronger fighters after us.

135
00:11:24.862 --> 00:11:25.962
At 4am tomorrow...

136
00:11:26.691 --> 00:11:29.391
a boat to take us to international waters will come to Biryeon.

137
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:31.561
This might be our last shot.

138
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:33.171
I told them...

139
00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:38.171
to end the operation by 2:30am.

140
00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:40.472
- And if they can't? - We kill them all and leave.

141
00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:42.671
- Our boss too? - Him too.

142
00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:55.921
Hospital ship.

143
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:58.822
Hospital ship, come in. Come in.

144
00:12:00.931 --> 00:12:02.161
Come in, hospital ship.

145
00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:04.102
Hospital ship.

146
00:12:05.862 --> 00:12:06.901
Come in.

147
00:12:08.002 --> 00:12:09.072
No answer?

148
00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:11.742
Call the captain.

149
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.612
The phone is turned off.

150
00:12:23.622 --> 00:12:24.781
His phone is off.

151
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:28.322
I can't get him on the radio,

152
00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:30.161
and his phone is off?

153
00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:51.417

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

154
00:13:08.592 --> 00:13:09.931
Doctor Song.

155
00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:13.072
Keep in mind.

156
00:13:13.872 --> 00:13:14.931
You have three hours.

157
00:13:16.472 --> 00:13:19.712
Finish the operation by 2:30am sharp.

158
00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:23.811
After 2:30am,

159
00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:25.742
I will kill...

160
00:13:26.612 --> 00:13:28.452
a member of the crew...

161
00:13:28.882 --> 00:13:30.551
for every minute after that.

162
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:32.852
Okay?

163
00:14:27.072 --> 00:14:28.072
Doctor Song.

164
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:29.411
What now?

165
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:34.082
Why did we...

166
00:14:36.222 --> 00:14:38.181
suggest bringing him on board?

167
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:41.921
The bullet has probably torn his blood vessels and organs,

168
00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:46.531
and we can't get any blood for the transfusion.

169
00:14:47.862 --> 00:14:48.862
Look at me.

170
00:14:49.132 --> 00:14:50.431
What if we fail?

171
00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:53.372
- The crew... - Look at me.

172
00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:54.832
They'll die.

173
00:14:55.872 --> 00:14:57.141
Like the men we saw.

174
00:15:03.941 --> 00:15:05.411
Don't think about anything.

175
00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.311
Don't think about the deadline they set...

176
00:15:09.882 --> 00:15:13.391
or what will happen to the crew if we go over that deadline.

177
00:15:14.992 --> 00:15:16.561
You don't need to think about anything.

178
00:15:19.592 --> 00:15:20.632
Just...

179
00:15:22.661 --> 00:15:24.761
think about the patient in front of you.

180
00:15:25.962 --> 00:15:27.301
All you need to do...

181
00:15:28.301 --> 00:15:29.972
is your best to save the patient.

182
00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:35.311
Whatever happens after that...

183
00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:41.411
is not your fault.

184
00:15:53.092 --> 00:15:54.161
Can we...

185
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:59.671
stay like this for a while?

186
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:29.161
Shall we...

187
00:16:29.962 --> 00:16:31.232
begin now?

188
00:16:36.002 --> 00:16:37.002
Scalpel.

189
00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:58.322
(Emergency Numbers)

190
00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:01.491
Up.

191
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:03.001
(Coast Guard, 122)

192
00:17:07.072 --> 00:17:08.171
(Fire Department, 119)

193
00:17:23.322 --> 00:17:25.251
The bullet that went through his side...

194
00:17:25.852 --> 00:17:27.751
ruined his right kidney. Just as we expected.

195
00:17:29.052 --> 00:17:30.762
The bullet left inside...

196
00:17:34.661 --> 00:17:35.661
Here it is.

197
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:37.501
The other bullet.

198
00:17:51.342 --> 00:17:53.582
The bullet ricocheted off his spine...

199
00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:55.052
and ruptured a vein.

200
00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:56.651
Then...

201
00:17:56.651 --> 00:17:59.181
We'll remove the clot, excise his right kidney,

202
00:17:59.352 --> 00:18:00.491
and repair the blood vessel.

203
00:18:00.491 --> 00:18:01.522
(Excise: To cut out)

204
00:18:01.522 --> 00:18:03.122
Without any complications,

205
00:18:03.461 --> 00:18:05.961
we should be able to finish in two-and-a-half hours.

206
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:10.961
Sounds great.

207
00:18:12.102 --> 00:18:13.602
You're as good as I heard.

208
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:15.471
Don't touch anything.

209
00:18:16.572 --> 00:18:17.701
This is an OR.

210
00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:20.072
We must keep everything as clean as possible...

211
00:18:21.012 --> 00:18:22.072
to save the patient.

212
00:18:22.572 --> 00:18:23.582
Sure, sure.

213
00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:25.842
I'll be more careful.

214
00:18:26.582 --> 00:18:28.411
Get back to work.

215
00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:30.751
The clock's ticking.

216
00:18:46.901 --> 00:18:48.572
Don't worry too much. Take your time.

217
00:18:49.572 --> 00:18:50.572
Stay calm.

218
00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:52.941
The patient's stable.

219
00:19:08.052 --> 00:19:09.491
Just a bit more.

220
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:12.592
Up.

221
00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:14.691
A little up.

222
00:19:15.032 --> 00:19:16.961
Yes, that's it.

223
00:19:23.042 --> 00:19:24.241
You punk.

224
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:27.241
You're dead meat.

225
00:19:28.711 --> 00:19:30.941
You deserve a kick. Darn it.

226
00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:32.741
- Stop it. - Mr. Chu.

227
00:19:32.741 --> 00:19:34.882
How dare you?

228
00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.181
Darn it.

229
00:19:37.481 --> 00:19:38.681
Come here.

230
00:19:40.552 --> 00:19:42.092
- Darn it. - Please stop.

231
00:19:42.092 --> 00:19:43.362
What's going on?

232
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:46.391
What are you doing to our team?

233
00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:48.332
They probably deserve it.

234
00:19:48.332 --> 00:19:50.901
We still have two more hours.

235
00:19:51.062 --> 00:19:53.401
You promised to let us go...

236
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.431
if the operation goes well. But...

237
00:19:56.032 --> 00:19:57.671
what is going on?

238
00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:00.612
What are you doing to our staff?

239
00:20:00.612 --> 00:20:03.411
Gosh, what a nuisance.

240
00:20:04.382 --> 00:20:05.911
What is it?

241
00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:08.382
We found a phone.

242
00:20:09.312 --> 00:20:10.522
A phone?

243
00:20:11.122 --> 00:20:13.191
Did you check the list of calls?

244
00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:18.161
Did they report us?

245
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.001
Are you okay?

246
00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:29.032
No, they didn't report us yet.

247
00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:33.241
If that's the case, stop it.

248
00:20:36.612 --> 00:20:39.911
The sensitive Dr. Song says...

249
00:20:40.481 --> 00:20:43.582
she can't perform an operation because it's too loud!

250
00:20:50.362 --> 00:20:51.391
What are you doing?

251
00:20:51.891 --> 00:20:53.231
Aren't you going to continue the surgery?

252
00:20:54.332 --> 00:20:55.632
The clock is ticking.

253
00:21:14.352 --> 00:21:16.552
(Coast Guard)

254
00:21:18.921 --> 00:21:20.191
Yes, sir.

255
00:21:21.921 --> 00:21:24.822
Pardon? The hospital ship disappeared?

256
00:21:24.822 --> 00:21:27.532
- What does that mean? - The GPS can't track it.

257
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:32.431
The hospital ship is docked safely. Yes.

258
00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:36.401
Perhaps there is a problem with the automatic identification system.

259
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:38.602
Try calling the captain.

260
00:21:38.602 --> 00:21:40.671
I already tried.

261
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:43.382
I can't contact the captain or Mr. Chu.

262
00:21:43.382 --> 00:21:45.911
There's no response on the emergency line.

263
00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:47.782
Is that so?

264
00:21:48.681 --> 00:21:50.221
That's very strange.

265
00:21:51.451 --> 00:21:53.822
Okay, we'll go and take a look.

266
00:21:54.552 --> 00:21:55.552
Yes, sir.

267
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:12.001
Dr. Song. The blood pressure is decreasing too fast.

268
00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:17.181
What's going on?

269
00:22:18.312 --> 00:22:20.211
What have you done to him?

270
00:22:21.312 --> 00:22:23.151
Are you going to kill him?

271
00:22:23.852 --> 00:22:25.481
Answer me now!

272
00:22:31.822 --> 00:22:34.262
Stop. Put that gun away.

273
00:22:35.632 --> 00:22:37.431
If you want the patient alive,

274
00:22:38.001 --> 00:22:39.461
move that gun right away.

275
00:22:44.772 --> 00:22:48.112
It's okay. Don't listen to him.

276
00:22:48.612 --> 00:22:52.181
Don't worry about anything else except the patient.

277
00:22:53.812 --> 00:22:56.251
What happened to the patient just now?

278
00:23:03.122 --> 00:23:04.792
I think the bullet in the stomach...

279
00:23:05.691 --> 00:23:08.562
tore the inferior vena cava.

280
00:23:08.562 --> 00:23:10.332
I didn't notice due to a hematoma.

281
00:23:10.332 --> 00:23:12.062
What must we do now?

282
00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:25.941
Think.

283
00:23:26.512 --> 00:23:29.382
Don't worry about anything. Stay calm, and think.

284
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:32.721
I'm suppressing it from bleeding.

285
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:36.721
Stay calm, and think.

286
00:23:37.592 --> 00:23:38.792
If you think,

287
00:23:39.391 --> 00:23:40.762
you can...

288
00:23:41.731 --> 00:23:42.862
find the solution.

289
00:23:53.141 --> 00:23:56.342
Year 2013. We're in terrible state.

290
00:23:56.342 --> 00:23:58.211
The civil war continues.

291
00:23:58.211 --> 00:24:01.251
We have several dozens of patients injured by gunshots every day.

292
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:04.322
There are many injured soldiers younger than 12.

293
00:24:04.481 --> 00:24:07.792
However, we don't have a sufficient supply of blood.

294
00:24:07.951 --> 00:24:10.362
As such, during our operation...

295
00:24:10.362 --> 00:24:11.921
as our last resort...

296
00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:14.991
Autologous blood transfusion.

297
00:24:16.931 --> 00:24:18.231
Nurse Yoo.

298
00:24:18.532 --> 00:24:21.532
Prepare silicon tubes and empty a saline solution bag.

299
00:24:21.532 --> 00:24:23.471
- What for? - Please hurry.

300
00:24:23.941 --> 00:24:25.102
Go on.

301
00:24:26.941 --> 00:24:29.141
- Hang in there. - What will you do?

302
00:24:30.941 --> 00:24:32.181
Syria.

303
00:24:33.082 --> 00:24:34.211
Syria?

304
00:24:35.852 --> 00:24:38.022
Will you go to a war zone?

305
00:24:38.382 --> 00:24:41.592
No. My workplace can get...

306
00:24:42.122 --> 00:24:45.062
as dangerous as a war zone.

307
00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:48.191
In Korea in the 21st century?

308
00:24:48.532 --> 00:24:49.532
Yes.

309
00:24:56.971 --> 00:25:00.042
During the operation, as our last resort,

310
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:02.842
we perform autologous blood transfusion.

311
00:25:02.842 --> 00:25:05.582
Despite all the risks,

312
00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:08.052
we choose this method...

313
00:25:08.052 --> 00:25:10.322
because there is no other way to save the patients.

314
00:25:26.102 --> 00:25:28.901
When the bag is full, transfuse it back to the patient.

315
00:25:29.302 --> 00:25:32.201
- Keep changing the bag, okay? - Yes, doctor.

316
00:25:36.312 --> 00:25:38.911
It'll keep him alive for now.

317
00:25:38.911 --> 00:25:40.382
But it's only temporary.

318
00:25:41.012 --> 00:25:44.221
We need at least 10 bags if his inferior vena cava is torn.

319
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:47.251
The patient has lost too much blood already.

320
00:25:47.552 --> 00:25:50.122
Autologous blood transfusion won't suffice, right?

321
00:25:53.132 --> 00:25:54.231
What should we do?

322
00:25:56.201 --> 00:25:59.102
We need all the blood from the people onboard.

323
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:01.102
I'll start.

324
00:26:01.572 --> 00:26:03.201
The patient's blood type is B.

325
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:05.241
My blood type is O, so I can give mine to anyone.

326
00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:08.272
- Nurse Pyo, please come here. - Okay.

327
00:26:13.012 --> 00:26:16.151
Hold the blood vessel in my hand.

328
00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:17.522
Okay.

329
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:20.921
Nurse Pyo will help you from now on.

330
00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:23.221
I'll be back soon.

331
00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:22.082
Nurse Yoo, come back after a scrub.

332
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:26.082
You practiced a lot.

333
00:27:26.082 --> 00:27:28.991
This is your place now.

334
00:27:30.461 --> 00:27:32.622
Can you do it?

335
00:27:32.832 --> 00:27:35.362
Yes, of course, Doctor.

336
00:27:35.632 --> 00:27:36.731
Doctor Cha.

337
00:27:38.102 --> 00:27:39.201
Here you go.

338
00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:44.272
Joon Young, act as a circulating nurse and monitor the patient.

339
00:27:44.272 --> 00:27:47.411
