Ms. Min.

11

What is this?

12
00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:46.400
It has nothing to do with you.

13
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.870
Yes,

14
00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.709
it does.

Baek Sang Ho speaking.

20
00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.119
I told you that I'd call you.

21
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.299
You should go.

22
00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.549
Hi. You should've called first.

23
00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.549
Did you eat?

24
00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.190
Yes, I ate.

25
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.489
Is something wrong?

26
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.360
You look terrible.

27
00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.799
It's nothing. I'm fine.

28
00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.299
Mom.

29
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.839
About Kim Mi Jung whom we mentioned earlier.

30
00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:29.940
I found her medical report earlier.

31
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.980
But some things were strange.

32
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.110
I searched the ID number on her chart,

33
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.420
and it was someone else.

34
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.119
Her name and address are all different too.

35
00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.089
Really?

36
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.860
Was there anything odd...

37
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.320
when she was in the hospital?

38
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.329
Like what you see in the news...

39
00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.529
about people who fake...

40
00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.130
someone's identity and send them...

41
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.499
to a mental institution to take their money.

42
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.269
If Kim Mi Jung was also in such a situation,

43
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.140
the Kim Mi Jung that you know...

44
00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:02.709
may not really be Kim Mi Jung.

45
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040
Right?

46
00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.279
Don't you have something to say to me?

47
00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.330
The Hyungjae factory.

48
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.960
The sexual torture of female factory workers.

49
00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:27.170
You've heard of it, right?

50
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.670
In 1986,

51
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.369
when Cho Gap Soo was a detective.

52
00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.340
The sexual assault of female workers...

53
00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.179
who had gone on strike.

54
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.020
I was the prosecutor on the case.

55
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.049
I dragged Cho Gap Soo to trial...

56
00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:51.420
based on the victims' testimonies,

57
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.290
but we lost...

58
00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.860
for insufficient evidence.

59
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.499
So?

60
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.670
What does that have to do with my mom?

61
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.869
The one victim from the incident...

62
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.939
who could not be located.

63
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.980
Seo Jung Soon died,

64
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.210
and the day after he was found not guilty...

65
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.210
I want to file a report.

66
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.720
Yes, go ahead.

67
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.720
It's regarding Cho Gap Soo.

68
00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.549
I have a tape...

69
00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.720
where Cho Gap Soo admits...

70
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.030
what he did 10 years ago.

71
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.230
Back then,

72
00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.629
I was sure that informant was Kwak Young Shil.

73
00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:36.069
But I couldn't meet her.

74
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.470
Instead,

75
00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.939
I saw someone else.

76
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.270
Look who it is.

77
00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:47.679
It's the just prosecutor,

78
00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.150
Min Ji Sook.

79
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.650
Kwak Young Shil, who had the evidence,

80
00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:54.520
and Cho Gap Soo,

81
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.549
who wanted to hide it, were at the same hospital.

82
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.790
Then Kwak Young Shil disappeared.

83
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.230
Do you think that was a coincidence?

84
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.960
Do you think Cho Gap Soo had nothing to do with it?

85
00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:08.900
Are you saying that man abducted my mom?

86
00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:11.369
It's a reasonable deduction.

87
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.910
So I investigated it as an abduction for a while,

88
00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.139
but there weren't enough leads.

89
00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:21.110
No way. My mom wouldn't...

90
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.610
Sexual torture?

91
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.020
No way.

92
00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:28.850
That can't be.

93
00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.389
My mom is a cheerful person.

94
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.090
I never once saw her...

95
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.889
cry, cringe, or even sigh.

96
00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.830
And she's a crybaby.

97
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.799
She'd freak out about a tiny cut.

98
00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:43.030
How could she...

99
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.670
Sexual torture?

100
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.280
If she really experienced something like that,

101
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.920
she couldn't have survived a single day.

You remember.

107
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.420
The hospital computer was so old...

108
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.220
that it would break all the time.

109
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.360
The nurses struggled, always having to input...

110
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.889
the patients' information over and over.

111
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.470
It must've been inputted incorrectly back then.

113

saved your life. I owed her big.

114

Sure, a doctor. That would be nice.

For future Yeongpa mayor, Cho Gap Soo.

173
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.860
- Cheers. - Cheers.

174
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.110
Mr. Oh, when you stood in front of Heo...

175
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.909
and told him he'd get 10 years for the bribe...

176
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.210
along with getting disfranchised,

177
00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:55.450
I felt so good.

178
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.830
You're flattering me.

179
00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:04.860
I only told him we should do it by the law.

180
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.899
He should be flattering you.

181
00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:09.970
It's thanks to you he got to unify everyone.

182
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:11.570
He'll be elected for sure.

183
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.739
Am I right, Mayor Cho?

184
00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:17.639
I'll be serving you for the rest of my life.

185
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.379
Will I get to see such beauties all my life?

186
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.749
Of course!

187
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.220
You're just my style.

(Witch's Court)

190
00:18:49.389 --> 00:18:51.429
- What? - Hey, Ahn Tae Kyoo.

191
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.659
Bottoms up.

192
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.439
Honey!

193
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.240
What a man! You're crazy.

194
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:05.280
You have something on you.

195
00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:09.110
Is it a cut?

196
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.879
I'm sorry.

197
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.020
It's not like you got hit. Where did you get that?

198
00:19:16.649 --> 00:19:18.020
I did get hit.

199
00:19:19.189 --> 00:19:20.360
Really?

200
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.159
That's amazing.

201
00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:27.129
Do someone like you get beat up too?

202
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.840
Are you that amazed?

203
00:19:42.209 --> 00:19:44.919
It must be good to be so easily amused.

204
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.060
Come on, we're having fun. Don't mess it up.

205
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.560
Come on.

206
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.889
I'm just playing.

207
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.500
Are you done being amazed now?

208
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.840
Then smile a little.

209
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.840
Smile.

210
00:20:09.869 --> 00:20:10.879
Go.

211
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.149
You smiled.

212
00:20:15.209 --> 00:20:16.310
Happy?

213
00:20:16.379 --> 00:20:17.619
Yes.

214
00:20:24.219 --> 00:20:26.090
I enjoyed it so much.

215
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.790
- Yes. - It's nothing.

216
00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:30.399
- I enjoyed it a lot. - I'm glad.

217
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.860
All right.

218
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:35.800
- Please invite me again. - I will.

219
00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:37.540
Take care.

220
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.080
What's going on?

221
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.350
It's nothing.

222
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.820
Ma'am, please come down!

223
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.119
- Come down. - We'll help you!

224
00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.260
What are you doing? Come down!

225
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.189
Be careful, it's dangerous!

226
00:21:03.189 --> 00:21:05.729
She should come down.

227
00:21:05.729 --> 00:21:07.270
I said, come down!

228
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.399
Please come down!

229
00:21:09.399 --> 00:21:13.070
Cho Gap Soo! Bring Cho Gap Soo!

230
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.040
I...

231
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.240
I won't go down until he comes here!

232
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.679
Bring Cho Gap Soo!

233
00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:23.149
Isn't that Prosecutor Ma Yi Deum?

234
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:24.820
What does she have to do with Cho Gap Soo?

235
00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:27.189
Let's report it to the news desk first.

236
00:21:27.189 --> 00:21:29.790
Call Cho Gap Soo right now!

237
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:31.719
Bring him here!

238
00:21:31.719 --> 00:21:33.619
Bring Cho Gap Soo!

239
00:21:35.429 --> 00:21:36.729
Cho Gap Soo!

240
00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.959
Get down!

241
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.169
Please come down!

242
00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:43.369
You have to get down!

243
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.199
Mr. Yeo.

244
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.610
Okay. I'll come right now.

245
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.679
What? Ma Yi Deum?

246
00:21:56.879 --> 00:21:57.879
Yes.

247
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.250
I don't know what it's about,

248
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.990
but he's adamant about seeing you.

249
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.459
She'll jump if you don't show up.

250
00:22:04.459 --> 00:22:06.919
She's been making a scene for two hours.

251
00:22:08.229 --> 00:22:10.929
What does that have anything to do with me?

252
00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:13.659
Are you telling me to pull her back in?

253
00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:15.129
Sir...

254
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:19.669
You visited her at the hospital,

255
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:22.409
and she's even in your campaign video.

256
00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:24.209
If something bad happens,

257
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.179
they'll draw you in.

258
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.780
I'm worried.

259
00:22:31.479 --> 00:22:33.149
Before I go,

260
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:35.389
I should at least know what it's about.

261
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.719
I can't go there to have feces...

262
00:22:37.719 --> 00:22:38.919
thrown at me.

263
00:22:38.919 --> 00:22:39.919
I still think...

264
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.159
you should go.

265
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:55.110
Ms. Ma.

266
00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.310
What is it?

267
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.510
Why are you putting yourself in danger?

268
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:03.149
You might get hurt.

269
00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:06.449
Please come down so we can talk.

270
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.550
Okay.

271
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.229
Cho Gap Soo!

272
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.530
What did you do to my mom?

273
00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:20.429
What did you do to Kwak Young Shil?

274
00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:24.369
Ms. Ma.

275
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.300
Why are you...

276
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.510
asking me about your mother?

277
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.169
Then who should I ask?

278
00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:32.179
In 1986,

279
00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:34.010
you raped her during interrogation,

280
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.409
and in 1996,

281
00:23:36.209 --> 00:23:39.179
you abducted her before she could report you.

282
00:23:39.179 --> 00:23:40.790
The criminal is right in front of me.

283
00:23:49.229 --> 00:23:50.800
Now that I know you're safe,

284
00:23:51.459 --> 00:23:53.100
I'll be going.

285
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.110
What is this?

286
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:12.350
On the day my mom disappeared,

287
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.889
you were also at the same place...

288
00:24:14.889 --> 00:24:16.090
my mom was...

289
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.860
last seen before she disappeared.

290
00:24:19.389 --> 00:24:20.689
Is it a coincidence?

291
00:24:30.439 --> 00:24:32.669
What are you trying to say,

292
00:24:32.869 --> 00:24:34.570
Ms. Ma?

293
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.570
Isn't it spelled out for you?

294
00:24:37.479 --> 00:24:38.909
That day,

295
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:41.979
my mom went to report to Ms. Min Ji Sook,

296
00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:43.719
and you saw her.

297
00:24:44.379 --> 00:24:45.979
You figured leaving her alone...

298
00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:48.619
would ruin everything you did to get acquittal.

299
00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:50.149
Of course you can't just watch.

300
00:24:50.459 --> 00:24:52.260
That's why you kidnapped her...

301
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.959
and got rid of the evidence.

302
00:24:54.189 --> 00:24:57.159
Shamelessly, you became a commissioner general,

303
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.159
and then a politician.

304
00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:01.899
Now, you're eyeing to become a mayor!

305
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.000
Do you have evidence?

306
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:06.699
I'll find it soon.

307
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.060
Do you know why...

308
00:25:25.889 --> 00:25:27.860
your mother disappeared?

309
00:25:29.889 --> 00:25:31.300
Because she tried...

310
00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:33.560
to reveal things.

311
00:25:34.229 --> 00:25:36.199
If you don't want to turn out like her,

312
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.169
it'd be best to remain quiet.

313
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.610
Great.

314
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.340
This is the way you should act.

315
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.850
This makes me a reason to live.

316
00:25:49.879 --> 00:25:51.780
I'll find the evidence soon...

317
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.790
and get a warrant to arrest you.

318
00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:56.750
You can look forward to it, Cho Gap Soo.

319
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.869
What an exclusive.

320
00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:12.939
Can she find the evidence?

321
00:26:12.939 --> 00:26:15.570
Ms. Ma's mother's name is Kwak Young Shil?

322
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:16.709
Is that her mother?

323
00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:19.840
We'll interview those around Cho Gap Soo first.

324
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.979
Where is Ms. Ma?

325
00:26:22.979 --> 00:26:24.250
It's over.

326
00:26:24.719 --> 00:26:26.619
She's safe, so don't worry.

327
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.760
I think the disappearance of Ms. Ma's mother...

328
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.990
has something to do with Cho Gap Soo.

329
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.990
(Cho Gap Soo Returns to Work After 12 Days...)

330
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.479
Anyway, I feel sorry about what happened...

331
00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:55.350
to her mother.

Can you take me home?

334
00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.139
You said you have something to say to me...

335
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:01.850
at the hospital, right?

336
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:10.659
I'll tell you later.

337
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.909
I'll give you exactly one hour.

338
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.379
No matter what you do, stop them!

339
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.250
If they mention kidnapping on the internet,

340
00:28:34.709 --> 00:28:36.479
you will never set foot...

00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:39.350
in Yeouido again.

342
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.050
Understand?

343
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:43.149
Yes.

344
00:28:45.889 --> 00:28:48.689
Mr. Baek, where are you?

345
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.840
I told you...

346
00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:02.540
not to let Tae Kyoo come in here.

347
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.280
I'm sorry, sir.

348
00:29:04.879 --> 00:29:05.979
Who did he come with?

349
00:29:06.939 --> 00:29:07.979
Did he come alone?

350
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.520
Play it.

351
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.520
Okay.

352
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.139
(Min Ho)

353
00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:42.250
The number you're calling is not available.

354
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.080
You'll be connected to voicemail after...

355
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.459
Hand me all CCTV footages.

356
00:29:50.459 --> 00:29:53.119
Check if he was caught on any other cameras.

357
00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.129
Yes, sir.

358
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.899
- Hey. - This is bad.

359
00:30:10.979 --> 00:30:12.110
Where did you go?

360
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:13.810
I'm sorry.

361
00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:16.010
Did popping champagne for a few days...

362
00:30:16.679 --> 00:30:18.050
make you go soft?

363
00:30:18.379 --> 00:30:21.350
I heard. What should I do about that prosecutor?

364
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:25.219
I suggest having Mr. Oh pressure...

365
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:29.490
If we're gentlemanly, she won't get it.

366
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.570
If she wants to throw turd in my face,

367
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.699
I will...

368
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.500
throw turd in hers.

369
00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:41.639
I'll look into it.

370
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.810
(Ms. Min)

371
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.139
Hello, Ms. Min.

372
00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:19.909
So?

373
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.379
Do you feel better after causing a ruckus?

374
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:27.090
I heard from the reporters about last night.

375
00:31:28.619 --> 00:31:30.119
It was a personal matter.

376
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.590
You don't need to make excuses.

377
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.290
I understand how you felt and why you did it.

378
00:31:35.889 --> 00:31:38.530
I'm sure you couldn't stop thinking about your mom...

379
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.659
after talking with me.

380
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.770
It was obvious Cho Gap Soo would play dumb.

381
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:45.699
I'm sure you wanted to throw the reporters bait,

382
00:31:46.199 --> 00:31:48.310
and find out where your mom was.

383
00:31:50.979 --> 00:31:52.139
But sorry.

384
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.350
Some got the hidden camera videos of you...

385
00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:04.719
from Kim Sang Gyoon's case.

386
00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:07.360
They didn't upload the entire video,

387
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.360
but just a few screen shots,

388
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.399
to make you trending online.

389
00:32:11.959 --> 00:32:13.560
It's obvious who's behind it.

390
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.040
I feel terrible...

391
00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:19.699
about your mother too.

392
00:32:20.709 --> 00:32:22.070
But Ms. Ma.

393
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:24.979
Cho Gap Soo won't be caught that easily.

394
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.439
You need to be rational.

395
00:32:26.709 --> 00:32:28.810
You can take a few days off if you need.

396
00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:30.550
No.

397
00:32:31.379 --> 00:32:32.780
I'll go work.

398
00:32:45.399 --> 00:32:46.959
That makes no sense.

399
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.199
How could you print that?

400
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.600
This is a violation of human rights...

401
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.669
and defamation.

402
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.639
- Take it down now. - Sir. Sir?

403
00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.740
Even the president is concerned...

404
00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.540
with digital sexual crimes.

405
00:32:58.879 --> 00:33:02.010
How could you write an article like this?

406
00:33:02.949 --> 00:33:05.750
Yes. Please delete it.

407
00:33:05.879 --> 00:33:06.979
Thank you.

408
00:33:09.189 --> 00:33:10.689
Thank you for your help.

409
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.219
Not at all.

410
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:15.760
This is all for the CAGU family.

411
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.659
Mr. Koo.

412
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.300
Yes?

413
00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:28.040
What is all of this?

414
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.240
I was thankful and felt bad for last time.

415
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.649
You must miss home cooking since you live alone.

416
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.119
I showed off my skills a little.

417
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.149
- You made all of this? - Yes.

418
00:33:41.649 --> 00:33:43.719
It isn't much. Please eat.

419
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.490
But I don't know if I deserve this.

420
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.030
Well...

421
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.000
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Son.

422
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.830
Thank you.

423
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.500
What should I eat first?

424
00:33:57.639 --> 00:33:59.699
Are we having a feast or something?

425
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.010
Look how pretty the food looks.

426
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.939
It looks like banquet food.

427
00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:08.780
I packed a lunch.

428
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:11.220
You haven't eaten yet?

429
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.079
I wish you could join us, but I made two servings...

430
00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:14.419
Can we join you?

431
00:34:14.749 --> 00:34:16.820
- We'd love to. - Here.

432
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.620
It's two servings.

433
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.959
I haven't had home cooking in ages.

434
00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:24.260
I get home too late to even cook for myself.

435
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.399
- Thank you, Ms. Son. - Sure.

436
00:34:27.629 --> 00:34:30.700
- Mr. Koo. Please eat. - Sure.

437
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.070
Ms. Seo. Eat up.

438
00:34:33.439 --> 00:34:34.939
Eat up.

439
00:34:35.269 --> 00:34:37.610
- You too, Ms. Son. - It's so yum.

440
00:34:38.379 --> 00:34:40.039
- This is incredible. - Try this.

441
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:41.849
Kong Soo Ah is missing.

442
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:46.419
What happened?

443
00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:49.249
This is her call record for yesterday and today.

444
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:51.720
The highlighted number is Eel's burner phone.

445
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.760
It looks like she went out after getting his call.

446
00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.930
She couldn't have...

447
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.740
(Call, or your granny will be in danger.)

448
00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:08.539
So she disappeared after the trafficking.

449
00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:10.269
Yes. We couldn't find...

450
00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:12.610
any communication thereafter.

451
00:35:12.809 --> 00:35:14.010
Anywhere she could've gone?

452
00:35:14.249 --> 00:35:16.180
Her grandmother and friends...

453
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.450
have no idea where she is either.

454
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.189
So there's no way of locating her?

455
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.760
That's why I called you.

456
00:35:25.419 --> 00:35:28.459
There's someone she called at the end.

457
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:29.660
(Domestic call)

458
00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.240
(Ma Yi Deum)

459
00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:11.039
Yi Deum, please help me.

460
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.899
I'm at Hyungjae Hotel, K...

461
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.740
Bring me Cho Gap Soo!

462
00:36:17.979 --> 00:36:19.379
Cho Gap Soo!

463
00:36:19.379 --> 00:36:22.149
I won't go down until he comes here!

464
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.680
Ms. Ma.

465
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.289
Yi Deum, please help me.

466
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.260
I'm at Hyungjae Hotel, K...

467
00:36:34.789 --> 00:36:36.030
Hyungjae Hotel?

468
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.970
There is no room with K in the name.

469
00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:50.740
Did you check that right? Check again.

470
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:53.079
Are you sure it's our hotel?

471
00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.809
There must be a mistake.

472
00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:58.649
We tracked her cell phone, and it was Hyungjae Hotel.

473
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.620
I'm sorry I can't be of assistance.

474
00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:02.950
Then may we check the security videos?

475
00:37:03.189 --> 00:37:06.160
We need to check from 7pm to this morning.

476
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.490
I'm sorry.

477
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.700
It violates our clients' privacy.

478
00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:14.070
We're looking for someone. Please.

479
00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:17.700
There's nothing else I can assist you with.

480
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.700
- My apologies. - Look.

481
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.470
Something may have happened to a kid.

482
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.570
I'm sorry, but...

483
00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.479
we have our situation as well.

484
00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:28.849
Are you kidding me? What situation?

485
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:31.249
A person's life is at stake, but you won't help?

486
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.579
Bring a warrant.

487
00:37:33.249 --> 00:37:35.220
Then we'll cooperate.

488
00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:37.220
We will, so wait.

489
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.919
If anything is missing or destroyed,

490
00:37:38.919 --> 00:37:40.189
you'll be accountable.

491
00:37:40.189 --> 00:37:42.289
I'll add on your refusal to cooperate...

492
00:37:42.289 --> 00:37:43.800
and hold you legally accountable.

493
00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:45.129
Got that?

494
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.860
Let's go.

495
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.999
Do you know how important the situation is?

496
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.579
What?

497
00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:05.680
He always gets out of any trap we set.

498
00:38:09.919 --> 00:38:11.320
- I have a question. - Yes?

499
00:38:11.519 --> 00:38:12.820
Last night...

500
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.229
What's that?

501
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.240
That's him, right? Eel!

502
00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:27.610
Get over here!

503
00:38:34.709 --> 00:38:35.749
Eel.

504
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.620
Who are you?

505
00:38:41.149 --> 00:38:42.550
Darn it.

506
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.189
Stop chasing me.

507
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.660
You're dead!

508
00:38:55.329 --> 00:38:57.769
I'm a prosecutor. Sorry.

509
00:38:58.439 --> 00:38:59.669
Excuse me.

510
00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:04.479
Manual? I can't do it.

511
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:06.379
Okay.

512
00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:09.680
Wait. Hold on. Prosecutor. Sorry.

513
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.289
Let's take a break!

514
00:39:17.189 --> 00:39:19.160
Stop. Mr. Eel!

515
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.189
Mr. Eel. I need to talk to you. Hold on.

516
00:39:23.229 --> 00:39:24.459
You must be tired.

517
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.039
Mr. Koo!

518
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.769
Sorry. Go. Go already.

519
00:39:34.769 --> 00:39:37.079
Leave... Leave me. Go!

520
00:39:38.439 --> 00:39:40.709
You can do it! Go!

521
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.809
Bicycle.

522
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.849
Stop coming! Darn it.

523
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:58.729
Hold on.

524
00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.729
Where's Soo Ah?

525
00:39:59.729 --> 00:40:01.070
Who are you?

526
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.300
Where's Kong Soo Ah?

527
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.740
- Hold on. - Seriously.

528
00:40:12.379 --> 00:40:14.479
Did you get him?

529
00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:16.510
Yes.

530
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.349
The phone has been turned off.

531
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:21.550
Please leave....

532
00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:26.519
(Heo Yoon Kyung)

533
00:40:29.629 --> 00:40:32.059
Did Min Ho come to work?

534
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.129
As you can see.

535
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.629
Okay.

536
00:40:37.169 --> 00:40:38.970
He said he was going to the kingdom yesterday.

537
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.809
You should check there.

538
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.240
Please watch what you say.

539
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.649
Did you forget...

540
00:40:50.649 --> 00:40:52.479
that the 100,000 dollars...

541
00:40:52.479 --> 00:40:54.820
incorporated confidentiality?

542
00:40:55.919 --> 00:40:58.220
Of course, I know that.

543
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.459
I just wondered...

544
00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:02.590
if I could help like last time.

545
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.640
(Min Ho)

546
00:41:27.019 --> 00:41:28.019
No.

547
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:29.849
No.

548
00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:32.890
No.

549
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.660
No.

550
00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.930
No.

551
00:41:42.129 --> 00:41:43.470
(Uninstall)

552
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.470
No.

553
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240
No.

554
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.379
No.

555
00:41:52.879 --> 00:41:54.450
Hey, hey. Wake up.

556
00:42:00.249 --> 00:42:01.249
Hey.

557
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.950
Tae Kyoo.

558
00:42:04.919 --> 00:42:08.430
Hey. If you were drunk, you should've gone home.

559
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.689
Why did you drive?

560
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.160
Will we...

561
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.499
be okay?

562
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.269
It was too dark last night...

563
00:42:16.269 --> 00:42:17.439
It was dark.

564
00:42:17.439 --> 00:42:19.439
So where did you drive my car in the dark?

565
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.269
You dragged me here with you too.

566
00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:22.709
If there's a single scratch,

567
00:42:22.709 --> 00:42:23.879
you're dead.

568
00:42:24.979 --> 00:42:25.979
Hey.

569
00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:27.550
Don't you...

570
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.110
remember?

571
00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:34.919
- Last night, we... - "We"?

572
00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:37.660
You and I aren't on par to be lumped together.

573
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.629
Don't you agree?

574
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.430
Just because I partied with you,

575
00:42:44.099 --> 00:42:46.160
you think you're on my level.

576
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:49.030
Yes, but...

577
00:42:50.999 --> 00:42:53.470
Last night, what you and I did...

578
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.769
What about last night?

579
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.180
Other than you...

580
00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.879
drinking expensive drinks thanks to me, what?

581
00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.110
What else?

582
00:43:03.379 --> 00:43:04.379
Hey.

583
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.519
- Ahn Tae Kyoo. - Seriously.

584
00:43:08.189 --> 00:43:09.749
Chicks or dudes.

585
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.820
Those without money are all the same.

586
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.360
If you're good to them,

587
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.200
they think they're special and get annoying.

588
00:43:17.959 --> 00:43:18.959
What?

589
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.180
Hey. Get out.

590
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.349
What are you doing? Get out, you rat.

591
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.669
Hi, Sang Ho.

592
00:44:04.979 --> 00:44:05.979
It's me.

593
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.479
She took off with my precious money.

594
00:44:11.479 --> 00:44:12.780
That witch.

595
00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:14.720
You had a sick minor...

596
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.860
do that just to make a few bucks?

597
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:18.890
"Just"?

598
00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:21.530
"Just"?

599
00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:24.660
It was one large.

600
00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.800
And to be honest, Soo Ah was the one...

601
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.070
who got excited when I mentioned money.

602
00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.910
- What? - That wench...

603
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:35.269
was blinded by greed...

604
00:44:35.269 --> 00:44:36.769
and took off with the money.

605
00:44:36.769 --> 00:44:38.979
Hold on. Isn't this...

606
00:44:38.979 --> 00:44:41.510
embezzlement or something?

607
00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280
Look.

608
00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:46.050
How could so much money...

609
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.220
exchange hands for a sex trafficking done via chat?

610
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.260
How could you trust him enough to send her there?

611
00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.360
I sent her after making sure he checked out.

612
00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:57.729
She's my ace.

613
00:44:57.729 --> 00:44:59.729
I wouldn't have sent her just anywhere.

614
00:44:59.729 --> 00:45:02.570
I see. You checked him out.

615
00:45:03.499 --> 00:45:06.499
That means you have the client's information.

616
00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.570
Come on.

617
00:45:08.709 --> 00:45:10.479
What information do you have?

618
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.849
If I tell you,

619
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:16.550
what will you do for me?

620
00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:20.419
You seem to be confused.

621
00:45:20.419 --> 00:45:21.689
I mean,

622
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.349
I should gain something...

623
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:26.059
to give you information or something.

624
00:45:26.459 --> 00:45:27.459
Look.

625
00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:29.829
All of this is being recorded.

626
00:45:30.459 --> 00:45:32.899
Everything you say. Your attitude.

627
00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:35.729
They may be held against you later.

628
00:45:35.729 --> 00:45:37.470
Are you threatening me?

629
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.169
You don't know how to make deals.

630
00:45:43.169 --> 00:45:45.939
You should be begging me right now.

631
00:45:45.939 --> 00:45:47.879
Aren't you going to find Soo Ah?

632
00:45:47.879 --> 00:45:49.610
Wait.

633
00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:51.149
Look, sir.

634
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.749
I'll drop the charge for...

635
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.120
sex trafficking of a minor.

636
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:05.860
This is being recorded, right? Clearly?

637
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.999
Clearly.

638
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.800
Finding Soo Ah is more important.

639
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.340
We need to save a life.

640
00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.570
Gosh. Soo Ah. Okay.

641
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.510
We have to save Soo Ah.

642
00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:19.709
Here.

643
00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.349
This psycho sent me his ID.

644
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:29.120
And he said Hyungjae Hotel was his.

645
00:46:29.149 --> 00:46:31.959
Doesn't it seem like there's something huge?

646
00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.959
Okay. That was clear. Now get me out.

647
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.329
Clearly.

648
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:40.229
Your cell phone will be taken as evidence.

649
00:46:40.229 --> 00:46:42.930
And if anything happened to Soo Ah,

650
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.399
I'll tack on aiding and abetting to your charges.

651
00:46:45.399 --> 00:46:47.240
Shut your trap and wait.

652
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.039
Wait. Hold on. It was all recorded...

653
00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:53.479
Hey!

654
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:57.749
This is why no one trusts people in law!

655
00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.550
Don't delete this recording!

656
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.149
I'll check it all!

657
00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.919
I'll check all of it!

658
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.160
Did you check Baek Min Ho's identity?

659
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.559
Yes. No sign of forgery,

660
00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:09.129
and I confirmed his identity.

661
00:47:09.229 --> 00:47:11.559
I texted you his current address.

662
00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:12.559
Okay.

663
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.919
Baek Min Ho.

664
00:48:15.689 --> 00:48:16.760
Baek Min Ho.

665
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.430
You're inside, right? We're prosecutors.

666
00:48:19.499 --> 00:48:20.499
Baek Min Ho?

667
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840
Baek Min Ho.

668
00:48:34.149 --> 00:48:35.249
Baek Min Ho.

669
00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.579
You're inside, right? We're prosecutors.

670
00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:39.680
Baek Min Ho?

671
00:48:43.959 --> 00:48:44.959
Hey.

672
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.660
Hey.

673
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:48.890
What are you doing?

674
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.959
You are trespassing.

675
00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:54.269
A high school girl went missing last night.

676
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.370
Your cooperation will be appreciated.

677
00:48:57.899 --> 00:48:58.939
Missing?

678
00:49:00.709 --> 00:49:01.910
You know her, right?

679
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.050
I don't know.

680
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.050
You saw her last night.

681
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.479
But you don't know her?

682
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.820
I don't think so.

683
00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.260
(My big bro)

684
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.360
You chatted with her around 8pm last night...

685
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.599
and checked her photo.

686
00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.930
Then you promised to meet an hour later.

687
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:31.740
I said I don't know.

688
00:49:32.899 --> 00:49:34.140
What about this?

689
00:49:36.169 --> 00:49:39.180
You even sent your ID via chat.

690
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.379
How could you not know?

691
00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:43.820
You met Kong Soo Ah, didn't you?

692
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.390
Why don't you take that?

693
00:50:07.709 --> 00:50:08.809
Did you find her?

694
00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:12.140
Not yet.

695
00:50:13.709 --> 00:50:14.879
Min Ho.

696
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:17.579
Do you remember anything other than...

697
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.550
that it was in the woods?

698
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.490
Hey. Prosecutors...

699
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.419
are here right now.

700
00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.430
You must find her first.

701
00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.160
No matter what.

702
00:50:33.999 --> 00:50:34.999
What?

703
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:25.379
(Danger: Fall Risk)

704
00:51:25.379 --> 00:51:26.919
(Danger: Fall Risk)

705
00:52:46.729 --> 00:52:49.030
Where were you between 8pm and 2am last night,

706
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.700
and what were you doing?

707
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.309
I was at my law office.

708
00:52:56.209 --> 00:52:58.110
You were working until that late?

709
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.180
Yes. I focus better when it's quiet.

710
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.390
You can go and check what time I left.

711
00:53:08.689 --> 00:53:09.919
Which law firm?

712
00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.959
Hyungjae in Gangnam.

713
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.169
Happy now?

714
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:23.229
Goodbye.

715
00:53:24.769 --> 00:53:25.970
I said to leave.

716
00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:42.789
Yes. I focus better when it's quiet.

717
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:45.419
Hyungjae in Gangnam.

718
00:53:45.459 --> 00:53:46.820
Cho Gap Soo!

719
00:53:46.919 --> 00:53:48.760
Bring me Cho Gap Soo!

720
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.499
Bring Cho Gap Soo!

721
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.959
Hyungjae's office was quite?

722
00:53:53.629 --> 00:53:56.099
Although I created that ruckus last night?

723
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.879
- Yes? - We found Kong Soo Ah.

724
00:55:28.329 --> 00:55:31.329
This was found next to her body.

725
00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:36.769
(Baek Min Ho)

726
00:55:46.879 --> 00:55:47.879
Gap Soo.

727
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:51.180
Please...

728
00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:54.550
save Min Ho.

729
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.870
(Witch's Court)
