3
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.600
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:40.361
What are you...

5
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:43.000
doing here,

6
00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:47.271
Han Wu?

7
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.551
Kang Woo, what happened is...

8
00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.250
Traitor.

9
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.490
Detective Jo, who do you work for?

10
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.490
You've betrayed your friend.

11
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.691
I didn't betray him.

12
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.861
Han Wu.

13
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:09.831
It's not you, is it?

14
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.230
Kang Woo.

15
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:17.740
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:31.721
Why aren't they saying anything?

17
00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:33.451
How long will they just stand there?

18
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.620
Ha Ri. Why did you turn it off?

19
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:39.990
That's Detective Jo.

20
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:41.861
Mr. Choi's friend of 22 years.

21
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:43.331
Let's them have a talk.

22
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.201
Then you should leave now.

23
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:53.570
This isn't your office.

24
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.911
Let me get some sleep.

25
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.220
Since when did this happen?

26
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:15.291
I first met him...

27
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.261
at Mi Sook and Ju Won's funeral...

28
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.560
two years ago.

29
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.671
Met who?

30
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.410
Hey. How dare you come here?

31
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.611
I'm still a cop.

32
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:35.081
I know.

33
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.551
You're Detective Jo of Intellectual Crimes...

34
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:38.851
Unit at Daemyeong Police Station.

35
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.391
You should pay back...

36
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:42.821
the money you owe even if you're a cop.

37
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.190
Taking out a huge underground loan,

38
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.960
isn't that against Public Service Ethics Act?

39
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:51.930
I'll pay it back,

40
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.470
so just leave quietly.

41
00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:07.111
Chairman Cha of Taeyang Insurance.

42
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.851
Nothing happened.

43
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.750
I just...

44
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:14.720
ran errands for him time to time.

45
00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:16.990
Kang Woo.

46
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.220
After Hwan Hee's surgery failed, you know...

47
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.261
how much her monthly medical bill became.

48
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:26.201
I didn't tell him much about you guys.

49
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.740
What did you tell him?

50
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.840
I told him that Ko Jin Chul's DNA...

51
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.141
was found on Kim Min Joon's clothes.

52
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.250
- What's this? - Min Joon was wearing...

53
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.951
those clothes when Ko Jin Chul attacked him.

54
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.951
There's Ko Jin Chul's DNA on it.

55
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.851
The troubleshooter's DNA...

56
00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:51.861
was found on the small fry you missed.

57
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.660
The dog bit it.

58
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.590
It was you.

59
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.900
It wasn't Moo Shin then?

60
00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:00.831
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:03.271
What about Shin Ji Woong?

62
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.801
Did you tell him about that as well?

63
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:08.141
- Shin Ji Woong... - Shin Ji Woong!

64
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:11.440
You heard that Shin Ji Woong...

65
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:12.810
told us the truth.

66
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.280
I got his phone call, but...

67
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.720
Yes.

68
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.951
Where are you?

69
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.960
I didn't tell him.

70
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.191
I'm at the hospital.

71
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:29.761
Did you hear?

72
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:32.660
Your daughter Hwan Hee's transplant surgery...

73
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.400
will be scheduled soon.

74
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.501
Yes. Thank you, Chairman Cha.

75
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:40.071
Thanks to you, I caught the leaker.

76
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.571
Good job, Detective Jo.

77
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.011
What's happening to them?

78
00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:46.441
They hit a dead-end.

79
00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:49.581
They won't find anything.

80
00:04:51.321 --> 00:04:52.381
Why?

81
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.451
The leaker was Ko Jin Chul.

82
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:56.290
What if you end up like him?

83
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.821
You know I'm your friend...

84
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:58.891
My friend?

85
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:01.561
You call yourself my friend?

86
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:03.061
I'm...

87
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:05.600
I'm sorry, but...

88
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:08.501
Kang Woo, please....

89
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:11.871
Could you please keep quiet for a few days?

90
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:14.771
Hwan Hee is...

91
00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:18.141
getting surgery soon.

92
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:20.850
If this surgery goes well,

93
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:22.751
I'll investigate this...

94
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.821
and confess everything.

95
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:27.121
Investigate and confess?

96
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.561
Do you think Chairman Cha bribed you only?

97
00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:34.360
Ko Jin Chul died in a police station.

98
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.600
Abiding by the law, my foot.

99
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.141
I'll take care of it my way.

100
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.900
Kang Woo.

101
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.011
Mi Sook and Ju Won are dead anyway.

102
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.011
- What? - They won't come back...

103
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:53.441
even if you behave this way.

104
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.110
But Hwan Hee...

105
00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:58.280
If she doesn't...

106
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:00.350
have this surgery,

107
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.790
she'll die.

108
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.511
Okay. So what will you do now, Mr. Choi?

109
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:27.210
You won't be shaken up again, will you?

110
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.980
Tell him...

111
00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:31.850
that there's nothing here.

112
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.021
We'll keep quiet too.

113
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.660
Kang Woo.

114
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:41.730
From now on, I'll...

115
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.431
It's only until she gets her surgery.

116
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.001
Get lost.

117
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.641
Never show up again.

118
00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:09.391
What an idiot.

119
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:15.061
Mr. Choi.

120
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.960
You're hopeless.

121
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:21.400
(Episode 9)

122
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:23.631
There.

123
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.371
Where's Dr. Kim?

124
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.681
He went out for a run.

125
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:32.241
- He's jogging. - Jogging?

126
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.050
When did he go out?

127
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.110
More than two hours ago.

128
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.050
He's running for a long time.

129
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:49.761
Dr. Kim, where are you?

130
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.561
Well...

131
00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:54.470
I got hurt while I was running.

132
00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:56.131
I need to go to a hospital.

133
00:07:56.131 --> 00:07:57.300
(Hanju Hospital)

134
00:07:58.201 --> 00:07:59.300
Okay.

135
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.681
- Hey. - Hospital?

136
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:11.850
Check if anyone watched Mr. Choi and...

137
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.951
Detective Jo having a conversation.

138
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:15.021
Okay.

139
00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:19.391
(Blue Security Solution)

140
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:23.230
It looks like Dr. Kim was watching the surveillance.

141
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.931
What?

142
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:26.931
I told him not to.

143
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:28.400
Check if the video of...

144
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.900
the original insurance policy...

145
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.400
from Joo Hyun Ki's safe has been copied.

146
00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:35.040
It has. One hour ago.

147
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.070
(Downloaded: Yes)

148
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.810
Did Dr. Kim make a copy and leave?

149
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:40.511
Why would he?

150
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:42.450
Which hospital is Detective Jo's...

151
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.751
daughter Hwan Hee at?

152
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.150
She's at Hanju Hospital.

153
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:55.261
(Jo Hwan Hee)

154
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.891
The cafeteria food...

155
00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:24.121
smelled like disinfectant at first,

156
00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:25.991
but now I'm used to it.

157
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.231
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.530
I can't help myself but talk to the families...

159
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.631
of long-stay patients.

160
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.900
Who's in the hospital?

161
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:38.170
My brother is.

162
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.641
He's 35 years old.

163
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:41.810
It's been two years.

164
00:09:42.641 --> 00:09:45.080
I'm used to it now.

165
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.050
"Used to it".

166
00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:50.851
That's a scary phrase.

167
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.991
My 13-year-old daughter is here.

168
00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:56.950
She's been hospitalized...

169
00:09:58.461 --> 00:09:59.891
for four years already.

170
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.231
Mrs. Jo.

171
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.800
Good. I found you.

172
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.771
Hwan Hee just woke up.

173
00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:09.800
Did she?

174
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.341
- Good luck. - Thank you.

175
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.280
Please.

176
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.290
You seem fine.

177
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.721
I heard you got injured.

178
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:32.761
You know...

179
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:34.030
why I'm here.

180
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.830
How long will you keep this up?

181
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.300
Do you really want to use a mother who's been...

182
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.030
waiting for her daughter's transplant for four years?

183
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:47.741
Do I look like that kind of person?

184
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.241
Did Cheetah tell you?

185
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:53.780
You two are going out, aren't you?

186
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:56.611
What nonsense.

187
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.621
Hey, Dr. Kim.

188
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.221
He's not my type.

189
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.491
Pardon?

190
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.430
Ma'am!

191
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.111
Kim Min Joon.

192
00:11:21.741 --> 00:11:22.810
Give it to me.

193
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:24.011
Give you what?

194
00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:26.111
The copy of the insurance policy video.

195
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:27.111
What?

196
00:11:27.881 --> 00:11:28.950
Kim Min Joon.

197
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.580
Ms. Jang.

198
00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:34.650
- Hey. - Hey.

199
00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:36.690
Do you know him?

200
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.521
Well...

201
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:40.961
You are Detective Jo's wife?

202
00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:44.330
Then is your daughter's name Hwan Hee?

203
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.030
- Hey. - Do you know my husband?

204
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.231
- That's... - Of course.

205
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:49.501
He helped me...

206
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.601
find my brother when he went missing.

207
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.810
Are you threatening me now?

208
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.111
That's not it.

209
00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:02.680
You're right. I came to threaten you.

210
00:12:05.721 --> 00:12:07.491
But I'm not going to.

211
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.121
I feel too bad for your wife.

212
00:12:11.461 --> 00:12:12.861
You must have your daughter...

213
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.461
get a surgery anyhow. Don't you agree?

214
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.400
Give this to Chairman Cha...

215
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.271
in order to make them keep believing...

216
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:24.101
that you're a traitor.

217
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.971
That's the certain way to get the financial support.

218
00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:27.971
What?

219
00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:29.940
Think about it.

220
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.680
Chairman Cha sent you to spy on Mad Dog,

221
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.310
so he must've known that something was suspicious.

222
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.450
Do you think he'd believe you...

223
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.180
if you told him you couldn't find anything?

224
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:43.991
Hold on. Let's discuss this with Mr. Choi first.

225
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:45.391
Until when will you just follow...

226
00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:46.790
what he tells you to do?

227
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.190
What?

228
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.601
Mr. Choi is no good...

229
00:12:51.361 --> 00:12:53.930
because he tries to take all the risk alone.

230
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:56.971
Detective Jo.

231
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:00.040
Don't you feel sorry for what you've done...

232
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.341
to your friend?

233
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:03.310
Do you think you'll be happy...

234
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.141
if you betray your friend and save your daughter?

235
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.180
I'll do it.

236
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:13.021
Give that to me.

237
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:17.790
Ms. Jang.

238
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.320
I haven't been able to tell you this until now.

239
00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:22.430
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.400
I'll hand this to him.

241
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:34.341
What?

242
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:36.170
Do you feel bad?

243
00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:38.440
I'm not sure why...

244
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.481
all the members of Mad Dog are softies.

245
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.780
Ms. Jang.

246
00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.721
Come to your senses.

247
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.251
Otherwise, you might let another man rip you off.

248
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.190
Did you realize that you clench the other fist...

249
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.330
right before you throw a punch?

250
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
I got you.

251
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:01.231
Hey, Kim Min Joon!

252
00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:06.440
(Mr. Choi)

253
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.511
Let's have lunch together.

254
00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:17.521
Why don't you have a proper meal?

255
00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:20.021
I don't have much appetite.

256
00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:22.621
I can't drink because I'm on my duty.

257
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.721
Did something happen?

258
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.170
Detective Jo is on the move.

259
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.170
- What? - Mr. Kim instigated him.

260
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.570
That punk...

261
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.670
Why didn't you stop him?

262
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.940
I left him be.

263
00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:43.111
Detective Jo should do at least that much.

264
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.511
He's an adult...

265
00:14:44.511 --> 00:14:45.780
and a detective.

266
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.180
He'll pull it off.

267
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.981
What if Chairman Cha finds out?

268
00:14:48.981 --> 00:14:50.150
What if Hwan Hee can't get a surgery?

269
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.180
I won't let that happen. I'll be responsible...

270
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.320
Stop him. I'll do it myself.

271
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.351
Mr. Choi.

272
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.820
Do you know that you and Min Joon are similar?

273
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.891
- What? - You never listen...

274
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:02.330
to others and try to do everything by yourself.

275
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.930
You try to take responsibility alone.

276
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.361
You two are exactly the same.

277
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.271
He's like that because he can't trust people.

278
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:10.030
But why are you like that?

279
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.271
Can't you trust me?

280
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:14.540
I wouldn't have joined Taeyang if I couldn't.

281
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.971
But you're anxious, right?

282
00:15:20.611 --> 00:15:21.680
So you are.

283
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.521
At least Mr. Kim is honest.

284
00:15:24.851 --> 00:15:27.121
Ha Ri, I'm anxious...

285
00:15:27.121 --> 00:15:28.290
not because I can't trust you.

286
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.420
I'm not reliable enough.

287
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.261
I'll call you later.

288
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.680
How did you...

289
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:01.690
How was your talk with Mr. Choi?

290
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.091
What did he say? Did he give his approval?

291
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.521
Why don't you ask him yourself?

292
00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:07.491
I'm worried he might scold me if I did.

293
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:10.060
He's the type that nags too much.

294
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.261
He can't seem to trust others well either.

295
00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:17.030
What?

296
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.601
I got you on this. What is it?

297
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.670
Does he not trust you 100 percent either?

298
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:25.241
Poor you.

299
00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:26.741
You must feel hurt.

300
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.351
Do you like Mr. Choi?

301
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:34.391
- As a man? - You want to die?

302
00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:35.621
I know you don't.

303
00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:39.320
You two are more like a father and daughter.

304
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.420
Get out.

305
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.530
Goodness, you and him...

306
00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:49.371
What's the problem with you two?

307
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:51.471
How did you first meet him?

308
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:54.971
Did he catch a con artist who preyed on you?

309
00:16:54.971 --> 00:16:57.810
He caught a con artist who led my dad to die.

310
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.351
My dad got involved in an insurance fraud.

311
00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:03.851
He was falsely accused of all the blame.

312
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:05.951
He died of cancer...

313
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:08.191
in a detention center.

314
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.860
He got conned because of me.

315
00:17:13.261 --> 00:17:14.961
He wanted to help his only daughter...

316
00:17:14.961 --> 00:17:17.231
become a gymnast.

317
00:17:17.761 --> 00:17:20.431
He had no money because he raised his girl alone...

318
00:17:20.431 --> 00:17:22.070
by running a car center.

319
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:24.840
That's how he got fooled by a con artist.

320
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.840
You know, they target those with weaknesses.

321
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:31.780
Con artists like you.

322
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:34.380
You people endlessly look around...

323
00:17:34.481 --> 00:17:36.050
- and sound people out. - Ms. Jang.

324
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.151
You think they're fools to get tricked, don't you?

325
00:17:38.521 --> 00:17:40.181
"I'm not sure why..."

326
00:17:40.181 --> 00:17:41.820
"all the members of Mad Dog are softies."

327
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.090
Right, Mr. Kim?

328
00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:48.060
Look.

329
00:17:48.661 --> 00:17:50.360
I don't take con artists like you...

330
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.261
as humans.

331
00:17:53.261 --> 00:17:55.701
You're not even a human to me.

332
00:17:57.741 --> 00:17:58.901
So...

333
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.070
Okay, okay.

334
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:02.711
I'll get off.

335
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.731
(Mad Dog: Traitor)

336
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.211
Kang Woo took the bait?

337
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.810
Yes, sir.

338
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.451
Your daughter's surgery is this weekend, right?

339
00:19:22.491 --> 00:19:25.021
Yes. Thank you, sir.

340
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.021
I didn't do much.

341
00:19:27.231 --> 00:19:29.191
I only made a few phone calls.

342
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:30.231
Bye.

343
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.380
Aren't you eating?

344
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.810
I ate already.

345
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.310
Then why did you want to see me here?

346
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.310
Then what?

347
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:50.780
Where else would I see you?

348
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.890
Just eat your food.

349
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.060
Don't skip meals, you jerk.

350
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.130
Kang Woo.

351
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.471
I'll call you.

352
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:12.171
Don't, you punk.

353
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.790
Shall I go...

354
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.820
see Chairman Cha Joon Kyu now?

355
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.731
(Contractor: Kim Bum Joon)

356
00:20:34.731 --> 00:20:37.300
Did he just leave it there?

357
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:38.560
They started constructing...

358
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.001
the study where the vault was hidden.

359
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:41.771
I think they're changing the vault's location.

360
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:43.671
I know how Hyun Ki is.

361
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:45.140
He wouldn't leave it the same...

362
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.441
when Kang Woo got into his vault.

363
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:48.310
Should I go check...

364
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.411
There's no need.

365
00:20:49.411 --> 00:20:51.280
You might ruin everything if you did.

366
00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:52.840
Let's wait quietly...

367
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.810
until next week.

368
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:56.181
Yes, sir.

369
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:07.530
Did the dog's teeth go blunt?

370
00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:11.100
Should I bring him to his senses?

371
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.431
Sir, Mr. Choi is here to see you.

372
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.901
It's better for you not to run into him yet.

373
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.380
Tell him to come to my greenhouse.

374
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.110
He wants to see you in his greenhouse.

375
00:21:30.721 --> 00:21:31.780
All right.

376
00:22:00.441 --> 00:22:01.711
What brings you here?

377
00:22:01.711 --> 00:22:04.620
The ex-special force broker is indicted.

378
00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:06.521
Really?

379
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:08.251
Then...

380
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:10.320
is everything over?

381
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.890
Yes, and the documents are stored in the depository.

382
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.360
Okay.

383
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.060
Is something going on?

384
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.800
Why?

385
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.370
I've been seeing some people from JH at work.

386
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.570
Since Jung Pil has collapsed,

387
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.570
I've been helping out my friend's son.

388
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:29.370
Who did you see?

389
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.511
On the first day I returned,

390
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:33.241
I saw Vice President Joo Hyun Ki.

391
00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:35.310
Oh, is that so?

392
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.350
Yes.

393
00:22:37.951 --> 00:22:39.921
- I'll do it, sir. - No, don't touch it.

394
00:22:42.951 --> 00:22:44.820
You'll get dirty.

395
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.120
I'll do it.

396
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:48.390
Then I'll go back down.

397
00:22:48.691 --> 00:22:49.731
Sure.

398
00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.941
He didn't say, "Stop it." It was "Don't touch it."

399
00:23:34.971 --> 00:23:36.570
Gosh, I had no idea...

400
00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:39.481
you would be willing to meet me,

401
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:40.911
Mr. Jan Gebauer.

402
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.320
I hope you aren't secretly recording me.

403
00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.550
Of course not.

404
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:49.890
Anyway,

405
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.961
are you really going to make a report about JH?

406
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:55.431
I'm thinking about it.

407
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:57.661
If I'm going to do it, I should do it soon.

408
00:23:57.661 --> 00:24:01.100
But it looks like JH can't be the talk of the town.

409
00:24:01.271 --> 00:24:03.271
They can't be the talk of the town?

410
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.870
Something is going on within JH, right?

411
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.471
It's just a rumor.

412
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.211
I heard President Joo Jung Pil's...

413
00:24:11.211 --> 00:24:12.941
funeral will be held very soon.

414
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.681
How do they know when he'll die?

415
00:24:16.681 --> 00:24:17.921
Well, to be honest,

416
00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:20.820
the rumor is that he died two years ago,

417
00:24:21.151 --> 00:24:23.721
but they refrained from...

418
00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:25.320
reporting his death...

419
00:24:25.721 --> 00:24:29.360
because of Vice President Joo's succession.

420
00:24:38.441 --> 00:24:39.840
Vice President Joo...

421
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.870
finally obtained the last seven percent...

422
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.080
of the shares of friendly investors...

423
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.411
he needed for the succession last week.

424
00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:48.211
If President Joo has really passed away,

425
00:24:48.211 --> 00:24:50.411
there's no reason for him to lawfully live anymore.

426
00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:51.981
He first appeared in the world...

427
00:24:51.981 --> 00:24:53.580
after the Flight 801 crashed,

428
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.890
then he rises above after his dad's death.

429
00:24:58.521 --> 00:24:59.961
(Voice recording in the flight deck of JH801)

430
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:01.761
Kim Bum Joon!

431
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.501
No!

432
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.001
Kim Bum Joon!

433
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.330
I don't hear...

434
00:25:08.971 --> 00:25:09.971
Bum Joon's voice.

435
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:14.411
Did you fabricate...

436
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.971
the voice recorder to take JH for yourself,

437
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.511
Mr. Joo Hyun Ki?

438
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.491
We will release an article about...

439
00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:32.390
the president's condition tomorrow at 10pm.

440
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560
Good.

441
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.961
Was yesterday the beginning of winter?

442
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.161
Right, when winter comes...

443
00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:40.530
and the wind gets colder,

444
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.100
the condition of the sick and old tend to worsen.

445
00:25:49.271 --> 00:25:50.271
Mr. Lee.

446
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.481
Were you hurt because I said...

447
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:56.651
I didn't trust you the last time?

448
00:25:58.451 --> 00:25:59.550
No, sir.

449
00:26:00.521 --> 00:26:01.651
I'm disappointed.

450
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.191
I wanted you to be hurt.

451
00:26:06.161 --> 00:26:08.231
What's happening with Kim Bum Joon's brother?

452
00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:10.560
He wasn't there on the day of our meeting.

453
00:26:10.961 --> 00:26:11.961
Is that so?

454
00:26:13.261 --> 00:26:14.671
Why are you telling me this now?

455
00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:23.110
You have a message.

456
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.120
There's a problem.

457
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.050
("The Family of Flight 801's Co-pilot")

458
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.790
("Reports the Truth About JH Air to the World")

459
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.300
(I accuse JH Air of my brother's depression.)

460
00:26:54.941 --> 00:26:58.681
(I accuse JH Air of my brother's depression.)

461
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.320
Remove him.

462
00:27:11.961 --> 00:27:12.961
You.

463
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.661
How dare you try to accuse anyone...

464
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:17.231
as a brother of a criminal?

465
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:19.300
You crazy idiot.

466
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.771
What kind of a situation is this?

467
00:27:21.771 --> 00:27:23.300
Darn you, jerk.

468
00:27:24.971 --> 00:27:26.140
What should we do?

469
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.471
What do you think?

470
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:29.941
We should stop him.

471
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.380
- Stop him. - You.

472
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.151
Don't you dare show yourself again.

473
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:38.921
Don't you dare come near me again.

474
00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:40.951
Scumbag.

475
00:27:43.191 --> 00:27:44.221
Let go of me.

476
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.171
I apologize.

477
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:03.810
I made a scene because of my personal grudge.

478
00:28:04.011 --> 00:28:06.280
No, it's all right.

479
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.221
I heard you lost your family...

480
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.820
on an accident of our flight.

481
00:28:14.751 --> 00:28:16.890
I'm not sure what I can say.

482
00:28:17.021 --> 00:28:18.290
Did you know?

483
00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.221
Well, yes.

484
00:28:21.231 --> 00:28:23.461
It looked like you went to school with Hong Joo.

485
00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.560
I became a bit interested in you.

486
00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:28.731
Director Cha was part of my team...

487
00:28:28.731 --> 00:28:30.100
when she first began.

488
00:28:31.671 --> 00:28:32.741
I heard that.

489
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:34.771
You were her immediate superior.

490
00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:39.441
But I wonder if there was something more going on.

491
00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:44.751
I'm just joking.

492
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.350
Anyway,

493
00:28:47.751 --> 00:28:50.451
what brings an employee of Taeyang Insurance...

494
00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.560
to JH today?

495
00:28:59.001 --> 00:29:00.001
(JH 801 Claims Settlement)

496
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:01.931
After I returned to work,

497
00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:04.971
I began to check the settlement histories.

498
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.271
In the claims settlement file of the accident...

499
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.511
of Flight 801 which happened 2 years ago,

500
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.380
I do not see a record of the black box.

501
00:29:15.411 --> 00:29:16.850
What do you mean?

502
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.350
I needed to see a copy of the black box,

503
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:21.991
but it's missing from the case file.

504
00:29:22.751 --> 00:29:24.390
This can be problematic...

505
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.060
if someone finds this during an inspection.

506
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.290
I was wondering if I may obtain...

507
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.530
a copy of the black box unofficially.

508
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.171
If that's the case,

509
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.070
I'll send it to you.

510
00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:40.501
Thank you, Vice President Joo.

511
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:41.640
Don't mention it.

512
00:29:42.171 --> 00:29:43.171
Have some tea.

513
00:29:47.511 --> 00:29:48.810
That's odd.

514
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.421
I wonder why that's missing.

515
00:29:58.445 --> 00:30:01.677
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E09 Mad Dog "The Traitor & Trap"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

516
00:30:09.471 --> 00:30:10.471
Are you all right?

517
00:30:10.741 --> 00:30:12.370
Do I look okay?

518
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.501
Why couldn't you be more gentle?

519
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:15.211
That wasn't what you promised.

520
00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:18.340
That's why I told you to live quietly.

521
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.911
I ended up punching you with my heart.

522
00:30:20.911 --> 00:30:23.050
Don't waste your heart on me.

523
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.181
You should look out for Ms. Jang.

524
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.651
Hey, Mr. Kim.

525
00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:29.320
It's not because of you.

526
00:30:30.151 --> 00:30:32.860
I hurt her a bit.

527
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.830
What?

528
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.060
It's nothing, but...

529
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.130
Gosh, I'm clueless about this useless stuff.

530
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.530
Useless stuff?

531
00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.130
I have no idea how I can comfort someone...

532
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.941
when they are hurt.

533
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:48.110
And don't mention a thing about showing my heart.

534
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.271
I don't have one.

535
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:51.780
Hey, leave Ha Ri alone.

536
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.481
What did I do?

537
00:30:53.481 --> 00:30:55.110
I didn't do anything.

538
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.221
You people at Mad Dog are all very weird.

539
00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:00.620
Did you talk to him about the black box?

540
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.491
He pretended like he wasn't shaken,

541
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.691
but now that he heard it, he'll talk to him.

542
00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:08.360
It looks like Chairman Cha will become busy now.

543
00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.530
He rested well for the last two years.

544
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.060
It's about time he got busy.

545
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600
And you.

546
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.870
Okay, fine.

547
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.701
I'll apologize to Ms. Jang.

548
00:31:17.701 --> 00:31:18.741
Darn you.

549
00:31:23.271 --> 00:31:25.040
Did they fight one another?

550
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.380
(Chairman Cha Joon Kyu)

551
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.590
- What? - What's up your sleeve?

552
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.890
What are you saying?

553
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.860
Why is he asking for the black box?

554
00:31:41.931 --> 00:31:44.100
Make it up and edit it or something.

555
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.401
What do you mean?

556
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:49.570
Ask Manager Choi Kang Woo.

557
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.540
Is this some kind of comedy?

558
00:31:51.901 --> 00:31:54.211
You have the original file.

559
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:56.610
You didn't lose...

560
00:31:56.941 --> 00:31:58.411
the original file, did you?

561
00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.550
Chairman Cha has...

562
00:32:06.021 --> 00:32:07.590
the original record.

563
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:09.451
What are you talking about?

564
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:12.721
Don't yap before cracking down on the snitch.

565
00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:14.290
I cracked down on it of course.

566
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.661
You don't have to tell me twice.

567
00:32:15.661 --> 00:32:17.901
Stop your nonsense...

568
00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:19.701
and just clampdown on mine.

569
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800
As promised,

570
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.870
we'll exchange them after the meeting.

571
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.241
Okay. Don't worry,

572
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.870
Chairman Cha.

573
00:32:31.011 --> 00:32:32.540
What's up your sleeve?

574
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.251
Why is he asking for the black box?

575
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.721
Make it up and edit it or something.

576
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.320
Ask Manager Choi Kang Woo.

577
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.151
Is this some kind of comedy?

578
00:32:43.151 --> 00:32:45.491
You have the original.

579
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.761
You didn't lose the original, did you?

580
00:32:57.741 --> 00:33:00.971
Chairman Cha has the original black box record.

581
00:33:00.971 --> 00:33:02.471
After the investigation,

582
00:33:02.471 --> 00:33:04.380
what happens to the black box?

583
00:33:05.411 --> 00:33:07.350
Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation...

584
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.911
Act 19, Article 3.

585
00:33:08.911 --> 00:33:11.651
Detention of a black box must be lifted...

586
00:33:11.651 --> 00:33:14.120
as soon as it is no longer needed for investigation.

587
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:17.021
Detention? Lifted?

588
00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:19.761
It has to be returned to the airline.

589
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:22.231
Why does the insurance company have it then?

590
00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:24.130
- With the insurance... - It's the insurance.

591
00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.530
Joo Hyun Ki has the original insurance policy.

592
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.931
Cha Joon Kyu has...

593
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.040
the airline's black box.

594
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.610
It's a way to prevent...

595
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.711
a betrayal.

596
00:33:37.711 --> 00:33:39.040
You're smart, Dr. Kim.

597
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.280
That means...

598
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.481
both companies are...

599
00:33:42.481 --> 00:33:44.580
responsible for the accident.

600
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.221
How is that possible?

601
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:47.451
The most likely cause...

602
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:49.251
is the problem with the airplane.

603
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:50.860
That's the airline's fault.

604
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.661
Yes. The insurance company...

605
00:33:52.661 --> 00:33:54.731
has to pay when there's an accident.

606
00:33:54.731 --> 00:33:55.860
That's a crazy amount of money.

607
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.661
It's not that much.

608
00:33:57.661 --> 00:34:00.630
In big cases like aviation insurance,

609
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:04.201
they get re-insured through a foreign company.

610
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:05.570
Out of...

611
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:08.140
the total payout of 200 million dollars,

612
00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:12.040
Taeyang Insurance only paid 5 million.

613
00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.251
And they gave 3.4 million to me...

614
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:17.551
after fabricating the insurance.

615
00:34:19.651 --> 00:34:20.790
Something is suspicious.

616
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:21.790
What?

617
00:34:23.521 --> 00:34:24.521
Then...

618
00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:27.120
where's the black box now?

619
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.060
Since he's the chairman,

620
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.100
he must've kept it in a high security safe or...

621
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.531
No. Something nobody would touch.

622
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:35.771
A place where no one should touch.

623
00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:37.700
- I'll do it, sir. - No, don't touch it.

624
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:42.611
You'll get dirty.

625
00:34:42.841 --> 00:34:43.981
I'll do it.

626
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.410
It's the green house...

627
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:47.910
inside the chairman's office.

628
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:48.910
- What? - What?

629
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.180
Shall we check it out then?

630
00:34:56.321 --> 00:34:58.990
Pentium, pull up the tracker number five.

631
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.191
It's in the office...

632
00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.760
Dr. Kim.

633
00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:03.660
Did you touch my work again?

634
00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:06.801
I'll install an electric shocker.

635
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:07.870
Sorry.

636
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.901
Where did you put the tracker?

637
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.910
On the USB you gave Detective Jo.

638
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.341
You should've told me you put it on there.

639
00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:21.711
Well, I was going to,

640
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:23.751
but you got mad at me.

641
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.091
- Sorry. - I got the location.

642
00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:34.890
It's an office in Taeyang Insurance.

643
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.830
It's very likely that it's the greenhouse.

644
00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.401
(Indoor gardening)

645
00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:45.140
Then shall we fish in a grass field?

646
00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.010
Mr. Choi, when should the D-Day be?

647
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:50.010
Chairman Cha is in his office...

648
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.910
even on the weekends.

649
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.510
Let's check the schedule. Goodnight.

650
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.510
- Okay. - Okay.

651
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.611
Goodnight.

652
00:35:57.821 --> 00:35:58.921
Do you want to grab a beer?

653
00:35:59.751 --> 00:36:01.950
- Yes. - Let's go have soju.

654
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.751
- Okay. - Sure.

655
00:36:19.001 --> 00:36:21.470
Where are you going, Hong Joo?

656
00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.640
What? Are you going to go eat chicken feet?

657
00:36:26.381 --> 00:36:27.680
Did you learn...

658
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.251
to eat that kind of trash from Kang Woo?

659
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.981
Go home quietly...

660
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.251
if you're drunk.

661
00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:35.850
Do you like that guy?

662
00:36:37.191 --> 00:36:38.220
You don't, do you?

663
00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.930
You shouldn't. He was...

664
00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.060
a married man with a kid.

665
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.560
Mr. Joo Hyun Ki.

666
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.501
Stop...

667
00:36:49.001 --> 00:36:50.131
your nonsense.

668
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.071
You must really like him.

669
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:54.711
But you know what?

670
00:36:55.271 --> 00:36:56.540
I think he's...

671
00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.211
digging into...

672
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.211
the accident from two years ago.

673
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.521
Insurance policy...

674
00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:07.390
and black box.

675
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.290
Insurance policy...

676
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:11.691
and black box.

677
00:37:14.361 --> 00:37:15.790
It was a slip of the tongue.

678
00:37:19.731 --> 00:37:20.970
Insurance policy...

679
00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:22.970
and black box?

680
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.171
I asked you what's not there.

681
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.180
Kim Bum Joon's original insurance policy.

682
00:37:32.381 --> 00:37:34.580
The contract screening team is holding...

683
00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.010
Not the fabricated one.

684
00:37:36.711 --> 00:37:37.921
I mean the original, Director Cha.

685
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:39.981
Has his insurance policy been fabricated?

686
00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:41.990
What's your ground?

687
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.290
Why?

688
00:37:43.421 --> 00:37:45.120
I think that's my question.

689
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.490
Did you...

690
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.461
fabricate the policy?

691
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.830
How did you know?

692
00:37:53.361 --> 00:37:54.970
Did the old man tell you?

693
00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.870
What have you...

694
00:37:59.501 --> 00:38:02.040
and my dad done?

695
00:38:02.171 --> 00:38:04.481
What do you mean? We just did what we needed to.

696
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.481
Hong Joo,

697
00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:13.521
you didn't actually believe that...

698
00:38:14.321 --> 00:38:15.691
pilot Kim Bum Joon was...

699
00:38:15.691 --> 00:38:17.760
depressed and crashed the plane...

700
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.591
with 190 people on it,

701
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:22.861
did you?

702
00:38:25.131 --> 00:38:26.231
You believed it?

703
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.370
Hey.

704
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.080
Your dad and I made that up, Hong Joo.

705
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.260
Kim Bum Joon's original insurance policy.

706
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:56.490
Not the fabricated one.

707
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.260
- I mean the original. - Planner Lee Mi Ran.

708
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.700
Was she...

709
00:39:01.771 --> 00:39:03.470
- alive? - She was...

710
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.240
alive, but not anymore.

711
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.370
Your dad and I made that up, Hong Joo.

712
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.540
If it's not in our memory,

713
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.240
then it isn't true.

714
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.111
We just have to...

715
00:39:15.111 --> 00:39:16.551
make that not true.

716
00:39:21.591 --> 00:39:22.651
Hong Joo.

717
00:39:23.091 --> 00:39:24.490
Don't cry now.

718
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.490
You'll have to cry tomorrow.

719
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.260
Because my dad will pass away in the morning.

720
00:39:33.231 --> 00:39:34.271
See you tomorrow.

721
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.180
- Cheers. - Cheers.

722
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:48.251
Dr. Kim. Come here.

723
00:39:50.281 --> 00:39:51.981
He worked hard today.

724
00:39:51.981 --> 00:39:53.680
Mr. Choi wants him fed.

725
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.620
I'm leaving.

726
00:39:57.151 --> 00:39:58.921
You don't have to do that.

727
00:39:58.921 --> 00:40:00.390
Aren't you overreacting?

728
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:01.390
Me?

729
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.390
I don't overreact.

730
00:40:16.441 --> 00:40:17.481
Pentium.

731
00:40:17.781 --> 00:40:19.740
I'm craving sausage right now.

732
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.910
Are you? They should have some here. Excuse me!

733
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.180
No, not that kind of sausage.

734
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.950
But the big ones...

735
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:27.950
like the ones made in Germany.

736
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.151
Rindwurst? Currywurst?

737
00:40:30.151 --> 00:40:32.821
Yes. Something like that. Let's go get some.

738
00:40:32.821 --> 00:40:34.160
- Okay. - Where are you going?

739
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.361
Those will be hard to find.

740
00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.031
- Hey. - Pardon?

741
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.740
I don't drink soju.

742
00:40:46.801 --> 00:40:47.810
Okay, ma'am.

743
00:40:56.211 --> 00:40:57.821
- I'm sorry. - Pardon?

744
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.091
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you. I'm sorry.

745
00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:02.350
What's this?

746
00:41:03.151 --> 00:41:05.060
Why are you apologizing to me?

747
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.191
I'm the one who pricked you.

748
00:41:09.691 --> 00:41:12.001
Gosh, you're so clueless.

749
00:41:12.001 --> 00:41:13.330
That's why men...

750
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.031
That's why men...

751
00:41:17.031 --> 00:41:18.941
That's why men...

752
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.810
Is it just one?

753
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.870
Have you only dated one guy?

754
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.240
That's none of your business.

755
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.281
You're right.

756
00:41:32.551 --> 00:41:34.691
It's bitter. Why is it so bitter?

757
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.220
What, JH?

758
00:41:40.591 --> 00:41:41.790
Juhan Air?

759
00:41:42.361 --> 00:41:44.330
The airline that caused accident two years ago?

760
00:41:44.501 --> 00:41:46.160
The crazy assistant pilot crashed the plane...

761
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.301
for money.

762
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:48.370
That's right.

763
00:41:49.631 --> 00:41:50.671
Mr. Kim.

764
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.200
There.

765
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.310
It's said that Chairman Joo of JH Group,

766
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:58.180
the mother company of Juhan Air,

767
00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.481
is in a critical condition.

768
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:02.711
Two years ago, Chairman Joo collapsed...

769
00:42:02.711 --> 00:42:03.810
right after the JH 801 crash incident...

770
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.881
and has been under medical treatment.

771
00:42:05.881 --> 00:42:08.990
It was known his condition got better recently.

772
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.290
However, according to the staff,

773
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.821
it seems like he might not get through tonight.

774
00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.961
Meanwhile, Vice President Joo,

775
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:16.290
the only son of the chairman,

776
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.560
is said to be staying...

777
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.131
by his father's side at Hanju Hospital...

778
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:22.031
where the chairman is hospitalized in.

779
00:42:22.031 --> 00:42:24.870
"Nothing has to happen until next week."

780
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.040
Nothing has to happen until next week.

781
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.470
Because his father's funeral...

782
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:32.111
is scheduled to take place.

783
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:57.671
Announce the news of his death.

784
00:42:58.901 --> 00:42:59.970
Yes, sir.

785
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:15.751
Goodness, Father.

786
00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:17.490
Father.

787
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:20.760
Father.

788
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.160
Father.

789
00:43:25.501 --> 00:43:28.571
Father.

790
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.470
Father.

791
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.910
At 2:23am today,

792
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.910
the chairman of JH Group passed away.

793
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.881
Since early in the morning,

794
00:43:40.881 --> 00:43:42.950
politicians and business people are gathering...

795
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.881
at his funeral in Hanju Hospital...

796
00:43:45.881 --> 00:43:48.620
to mourn over his sudden death.

797
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.251
His body is expected to pass through...

798
00:43:50.251 --> 00:43:51.961
his house and the JH Group headquarters...

799
00:43:51.961 --> 00:43:54.760
and to be buried in Hansung Memorial Park.

800
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.430
Meanwhile, Chairman Joo is...

801
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.760
the leading person who developed...

802
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.401
Juhan Air to be the top airline.

803
00:44:02.401 --> 00:44:03.771
He's recognized as a person...

804
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:06.071
who marked a new era in the industry.

805
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.540
It must've been hard to stay alive...

806
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:13.281
for the last two years, my friend.

807
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.251
Vice President Joo is out on business today.

808
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:42.970
There are three security doors to pass in Taeyang.

809
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:45.680
You need a given pass to open the doors.

810
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:47.410
Outsiders must leave their ID cards...

811
00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:49.151
and get a visitor's pass.

812
00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:55.290
(Taeyang Insurance)

813
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:59.091
"Kim Cheol Soo" and "Park Young Hee"?

814
00:45:01.091 --> 00:45:03.131
Cheol Soo and Young Hee. Doesn't it sound nice?

815
00:45:03.131 --> 00:45:04.200
- I'm Young Hee? - Yes.

816
00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:06.600
You used my picture without permission.

817
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:08.930
What about you, Ms. Jang?

818
00:45:09.731 --> 00:45:11.301
I worked there for more than two years.

819
00:45:11.301 --> 00:45:13.100
They know my face.

820
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.671
Then just show them your face and walk in.

821
00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:30.560
Mr. Choi.

822
00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.930
I have something to talk about...

823
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.631
the insurance policy which you mentioned last time.

824
00:45:38.901 --> 00:45:40.200
I have to attend the funeral...

825
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.231
with the chairman today.

826
00:45:42.501 --> 00:45:43.531
Let's talk tomorrow.

827
00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:45.071
Okay, ma'am.

828
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.410
What's that file?

829
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.981
It's the files regarding Ko Jin Chul's case.

830
00:45:51.981 --> 00:45:53.711
I found some omitted information.

831
00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:57.321
Was the person in charge Ms. Jang?

832
00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.281
She was the person in charge of his case, right?

833
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.251
Yes, that's right.

834
00:46:02.651 --> 00:46:04.361
Then you better call her.

835
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.461
Tell her to give it back if she leaked...

836
00:46:08.461 --> 00:46:09.990
any more of our company's data.

837
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.660
Since you're here,

838
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.131
she wouldn't need it anymore.

839
00:46:15.401 --> 00:46:17.341
It could cause trouble if my dad finds out.

840
00:46:17.571 --> 00:46:19.470
Understood, ma'am.

841
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.350
You heard her, right?

842
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.680
Come in with all the data.

843
00:46:30.551 --> 00:46:31.850
Okay, sir.

844
00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.751
Drink one each before you go out to work.

845
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.260
Let's get this done.

846
00:46:39.091 --> 00:46:40.490
What's left is...

847
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.560
how Cheol Soo and Young Hee should sneak in.

848
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:47.060
I want to wear a lab coat and act intellectual too.

849
00:46:47.501 --> 00:46:50.031
It's always Mr. Kim who gets to wear a white coat.

850
00:46:50.571 --> 00:46:52.540
Do you want me to help you wear it?

851
00:46:52.941 --> 00:46:54.640
Yes, is there any way?

852
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:56.040
Whom do you look for...

853
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.580
- when someone's sick? - A doctor.

854
00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.381
When a plant is sick?

855
00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:02.881
There's a doctor to treat plants?

856
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.251
Plant protection engineers...

857
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:07.051
analyze and distinguish the cause of...

858
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:08.390
crop diseases and vermination.

859
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:10.151
They prescribe chemicals based on their analysis.

860
00:47:10.151 --> 00:47:13.160
It's a very important job position.

861
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.560
He needs patients to pay a visit.

862
00:47:16.031 --> 00:47:18.901
They must be suffering from their illness by now.

863
00:47:22.401 --> 00:47:24.401
It's around time they call me.

864
00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:28.970
Yes, Dr. Han.

865
00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.040
Really?

866
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.281
I know a famous engineer...

867
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:35.151
who can revive even dead orchids,

868
00:47:35.151 --> 00:47:36.781
but he's very busy.

869
00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.591
I'll ask if he has time...

870
00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:42.950
and call you again. Bye.

871
00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:45.120
What was that call about?

872
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.361
He's Dr. Han,

873
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:49.290
and he's well-known among orchid specialists.

874
00:47:49.731 --> 00:47:52.231
They're looking for an orchid doctor...

875
00:47:52.231 --> 00:47:54.700
at the secretary's office of the Taeyang chairman.

876
00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:56.870
Me?

877
00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.001
Is it a coincidence...

878
00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:01.611
that the orchids are sick at a perfect timing?

879
00:48:01.611 --> 00:48:02.711
Ms. Jang.

880
00:48:03.111 --> 00:48:04.810
You're too naive.

881
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.381
There's no such thing as coincidence in this world.

882
00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:12.021
That's called Sumonzan.

883
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.620
It was discovered in Niigata, Japan in 1933.

884
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.390
It's quite rare,

885
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.890
so it's tens of thousands of dollars per each.

886
00:48:21.731 --> 00:48:23.830
What? That one?

887
00:48:25.231 --> 00:48:26.600
But that looks like a bud...

888
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.271
growing from a leftover onion in a fridge.

889
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:29.930
Because you don't know how it becomes.

890
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:32.001
Its leaves grow to have a tiger pattern.

891
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.711
That's totally my style.

892
00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.680
Chairman Cha only collects rare orchids.

893
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.080
I bought one more...

894
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.220
and sent him as a gift while I was buying mine.

895
00:48:50.051 --> 00:48:51.890
Are you here to deliver the orchid?

896
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.961
Yes, but it's expensive,

897
00:48:53.961 --> 00:48:55.490
so I have to deliver it myself.

898
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:56.830
I'm the secretary of the chairman's office.

899
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:57.830
Give it to me.

900
00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.660
Can you sign here then?

901
00:49:03.501 --> 00:49:04.540
Here.

902
00:49:08.571 --> 00:49:10.580
And I put a nice fertilizer...

903
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.410
on it for free.

904
00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.981
Sumonzan.

905
00:49:15.381 --> 00:49:18.180
Its name stands for a mountain...

906
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:20.251
that protects the door.

907
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.890
This precious orchid...

908
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:24.091
will keep my greenhouse safe.

909
00:49:25.191 --> 00:49:27.160
Chloroethylphosphonic acid.

910
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.890
It's also called ethephon.

911
00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:32.031
It releases ethylene gas.

912
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.430
Ethylene gas?

913
00:49:33.631 --> 00:49:36.231
It catalyzes the aging of plants.

914
00:49:36.531 --> 00:49:38.841
It's often found in apples and bananas.

915
00:49:39.801 --> 00:49:42.140
So people don't keep them with other fruits.

916
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.211
What? Gosh.

917
00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:48.010
So the gas has the effect on the orchid as well?

918
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:49.051
Of course.

919
00:49:49.051 --> 00:49:51.120
Orchids are delicate plants.

920
00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:53.720
I'm sure their leaves are drooping by now.

921
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.961
All right.

922
00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:04.060
Shall we begin?

923
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.930
Mr. Kim, good job.

924
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:14.040
Not bad.

925
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:26.421
You two have met Chairman Joo before, right?

926
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.751
Yes, a few times.

927
00:50:28.751 --> 00:50:29.890
Me too.

928
00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:31.361
Go home, get dressed,

929
00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:32.921
and meet me at the funeral.

930
00:50:33.961 --> 00:50:35.361
He should have...

931
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:36.990
as many visitors as possible,

932
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.961
so that people think he led a good life.

933
00:50:39.631 --> 00:50:41.370
Go get changed, and come right to the funeral.

934
00:50:41.501 --> 00:50:42.501
Yes, sir.

935
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:43.970
Yes, sir.

936
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:54.211
What are you talking about?

937
00:50:54.211 --> 00:50:56.981
There's a black suit and tie in my closet.

938
00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:58.521
Get them ready.

939
00:50:58.521 --> 00:50:59.620
I'm on my way now.

940
00:51:00.521 --> 00:51:02.091
Why is she making so much fuss?

941
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.890
Is she excited that a mere employee like me...

942
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.760
is going to a chairman's funeral?

943
00:51:06.861 --> 00:51:07.990
What is it?

944
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.631
What?

945
00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.801
You were spacing out just now.

946
00:51:12.461 --> 00:51:13.531
What's it about?

947
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.771
Nothing.

948
00:51:15.171 --> 00:51:17.131
Can you give me a ride to my house?

949
00:51:32.321 --> 00:51:33.890
Mr. Choi, where are you going?

950
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.051
Yes, I suddenly have to go to a funeral.

951
00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:37.260
I told the lobby about you.

952
00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:41.390
Can you leave the files in my room now, or later?

953
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.191
No, I'll leave it in there today.

954
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:44.430
Don't worry about it.

955
00:51:45.031 --> 00:51:46.200
Sure, Mr. Choi.

956
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:47.531
Okay.

957
00:51:55.441 --> 00:51:56.571
Mad Dog is out.

958
00:51:56.671 --> 00:51:58.941
We're on our own for tonight's plan.

959
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.810
What's going on?

960
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.120
He suddenly has to go to a funeral.

961
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.220
A funeral?

962
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:07.990
President Joo's funeral?

963
00:52:08.551 --> 00:52:10.490
Why would Mr. Choi get invited there?

964
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.560
He is a man of competence,

965
00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.731
but he's not powerful enough to be there.

966
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:18.660
You're right.

967
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.430
Something is fishy.

968
00:52:30.341 --> 00:52:32.140
I'm Doctor Kim of Hoban Plant Center.

969
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.841
I'm his assistant, Kim Cheol Su.

970
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.580
Thanks.

971
00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:51.031
The chairman's room has radio jamming...

972
00:52:51.031 --> 00:52:52.930
when the president isn't in his room.

973
00:52:53.501 --> 00:52:55.071
Mr. Kim, Cheetah,

974
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:57.341
we can't communicate in the greenhouse.

975
00:52:57.341 --> 00:52:59.140
Don't worry. We have Ms. Jang.

976
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:01.571
Ms. Jang, keep an eye on us,

977
00:53:01.571 --> 00:53:02.611
and when something happens,

978
00:53:02.611 --> 00:53:04.310
you can shout, "Help me."

979
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:06.180
Help me, my foot.

980
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:09.651
Both of your lives are in my hands.

981
00:53:10.821 --> 00:53:14.620
(Taeyang Insurance)

982
00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.890
I'm Doctor Kim of Hoban Plant Center.

983
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.421
I'm his assistant, Kim Cheol Su.

984
00:53:18.421 --> 00:53:19.890
Yes, I've been expecting you.

985
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.031
Hello.

986
00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:22.430
Goodness, Ms. Jang.

987
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.830
I got some of your favorite black tea.

988
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:25.930
Give me a moment.

989
00:53:26.231 --> 00:53:27.271
This way, please.

990
00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:28.301
- Sure. - Sure.

991
00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:40.080
Can you revive it?

992
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.551
You have to.

993
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:42.810
I'm not sure.

994
00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.620
It's not the lack of water,

995
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.781
excessive moisture,

996
00:53:45.921 --> 00:53:47.720
or a ventilation problem.

997
00:53:47.921 --> 00:53:49.091
Doctor Kim.

998
00:53:49.151 --> 00:53:51.191
Don't you think it's mold or germs?

999
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:54.031
- It's a virus. - A virus?

1000
00:53:55.861 --> 00:53:57.361
This is bad.

1001
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.760
Don't worry about it.

1002
00:53:59.031 --> 00:54:00.401
Hoban Plant Center will...

1003
00:54:00.401 --> 00:54:02.930
check the entire facility for you.

1004
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:05.001
Should we use some medicine as well?

1005
00:54:05.001 --> 00:54:06.071
Deep into the roots.

1006
00:54:06.341 --> 00:54:08.470
Yes, please make sure you get everything.

1007
00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:22.490
What's going on?

1008
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.120
An orchid Chairman Cha loves is sick.

1009
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:27.191
You should take care of it...

1010
00:54:27.191 --> 00:54:28.660
before he comes back.

1011
00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:29.830
It'll be okay for today.

1012
00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.060
Didn't you see the news?

1013
00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.330
President Joo Jung Pil passed away.

1014
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.631
Which one do you want?

1015
00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:37.700
Earl Grey? Breakfast tea?

1016
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:40.571
Let's go with Earl Grey.

1017
00:54:46.481 --> 00:54:47.950
It's weird, isn't it?

1018
00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:49.580
What is?

1019
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.051
A mere employee of his partner company...

1020
00:54:51.051 --> 00:54:52.881
is heading over to the chairman's funeral.

1021
00:54:52.881 --> 00:54:54.591
It is weird.

1022
00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.321
Why? Is something going on again?

1023
00:55:00.091 --> 00:55:01.560
(Jo Han Wu)

1024
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:03.861
Aren't you going to take it?

1025
00:55:08.771 --> 00:55:10.430
I told you not to call me.

1026
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:12.001
I'll just pay you back for the beef soup.

1027
00:55:12.501 --> 00:55:14.271
Kang Woo, right now...

1028
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:18.341
What?

1029
00:55:20.711 --> 00:55:22.111
- Turn the car around. - What?

1030
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:24.350
Turn the car around.

1031
00:55:24.981 --> 00:55:26.051
Turn the car around!

1032
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.531
He told him not to touch the fertilizer bucket.

1033
00:55:35.531 --> 00:55:37.731
Then shall we touch it?

1034
00:55:53.981 --> 00:55:56.010
Where could it be?

1035
00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:15.231
Hello.

1036
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:19.001
The chief mourner shouldn't be out here.

1037
00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:21.271
My dad's best friend just came.

1038
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:22.771
Of course I have to come and greet you.

1039
00:56:22.941 --> 00:56:25.140
I think you were just curious to see my face.

1040
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.850
- Pardon? - You're out here...

1041
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:30.651
because you wanted to see...

1042
00:56:30.651 --> 00:56:32.180
how I would react when I heard the news...

1043
00:56:32.521 --> 00:56:33.990
about my greenhouse getting robbed.

1044
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:38.821
In the claims settlement file of the accident...

1045
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.961
of flight 801 which happened 2 years ago,

1046
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.691
I did not see a record of the black box.

1047
00:56:43.861 --> 00:56:45.060
What do you mean?

1048
00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:47.870
I needed to see a copy of the black box,

1049
00:56:48.771 --> 00:56:50.470
but it's missing from the case file.

1050
00:56:51.001 --> 00:56:54.441
This can be problematic during an inspection.

1051
00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:57.441
I was wondering if I may obtain...

1052
00:56:57.441 --> 00:56:59.881
a copy of the black box unofficially.

1053
00:57:01.281 --> 00:57:02.310
I'll send it to you.

1054
00:57:03.281 --> 00:57:04.981
Thank you, Vice President Joo.

1055
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.930
Mr. Choi Kang Woo.

1056
00:57:16.861 --> 00:57:18.861
Do you want to find the black box?

1057
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:25.571
Then you need find the real thing.

1058
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:47.120
(Chairman Cha Joon Kyu)

1059
00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.531
Why is he asking for the black box?

1060
00:57:50.531 --> 00:57:51.861
What are you talking about?

1061
00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:55.271
You should ask Mr. Choi Kang Woo.

1062
00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:57.341
Is this some kind of comedy?

1063
00:57:57.671 --> 00:57:59.970
You have the original file.

1064
00:58:01.671 --> 00:58:03.240
You didn't lose...

1065
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:05.040
the original file, did you?

1066
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.080
Stop your nonsense...

1067
00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.180
and just clampdown on mine.

1068
00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:11.850
Okay. Don't worry,

1069
00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.381
Chairman Cha.

1070
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.830
Stop trying to play a game,

1071
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.640
and bring my stuff.

1072
00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.200
You aren't...

1073
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.611
the owner of JH yet.

1074
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:41.680
Hong Joo.

1075
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.021
What if Mr. Choi finds out...

1076
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:50.660
that you made...

1077
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:53.591
his family get on that flight?

1078
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:56.591
I didn't know.

1079
00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:00.231
Of course you didn't know Flight 801 was weak.

1080
00:59:00.231 --> 00:59:01.330
But...

1081
00:59:01.631 --> 00:59:02.830
you did know...

1082
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:05.841
that we had a deficient airplane.

1083
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.071
You let us get into an insurance contract...

1084
00:59:08.071 --> 00:59:10.040
knowing that we had deficient airplanes.

1085
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.180
So what?

1086
00:59:18.881 --> 00:59:20.921
So if Mr. Choi finds out...

1087
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:21.990
It's all right.

1088
00:59:22.651 --> 00:59:24.290
I'll catch the dog...

1089
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.760
before he finds out.

1090
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:36.370
What were you talking to him about?

1091
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:37.901
Nothing much.

1092
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.040
Great job on setting up a trap.

1093
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.010
This is Ko Jin Chul's file,

1094
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:47.751
and I'm missing some documents.

1095
00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.751
The person in charge was...

1096
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:50.981
Jang Ha Ri.

1097
00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:54.120
Ms. Jang was in charge of Ko Jin Chul's case.

1098
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.850
Yes, it was Ms. Jang.

1099
00:59:56.321 --> 00:59:57.961
Then you should call her.

1100
00:59:58.861 --> 01:00:02.231
If she has any other documents she took out,

1101
01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.660
tell her to bring them back.

1102
01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.560
Yes, Director Cha.

1103
01:00:06.131 --> 01:00:07.700
Why did you call...

1104
01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.901
Mr. Choi here?

1105
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:13.100
- You can catch him... - Kang Woo...

1106
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.310
really loves his juniors.

1107
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:17.711
He'll back down...

1108
01:00:17.711 --> 01:00:19.981
and lie down flat to save his juniors,

1109
01:00:19.981 --> 01:00:21.410
and he'll bring me...

1110
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.450
Hyun Ki's stuff just as I say.

1111
01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.021
We're from Intellectual Crime Unit...

1112
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:34.330
of Daemyeong Police Station.

1113
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.631
We received a report...

1114
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:37.401
about a break-in on the 20th floor.

1115
01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:39.501
We were told to take care of this quietly.

1116
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:40.700
Please come in.

1117
01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:46.441
I have to go to the bathroom. Excuse me.

1118
01:00:46.441 --> 01:00:47.441
Sure.

1119
01:01:00.151 --> 01:01:02.091
Something is really weird.

1120
01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:14.801
Get them.

1121
01:01:16.531 --> 01:01:17.540
Mr. Choi.

1122
01:01:17.671 --> 01:01:19.600
- Get out. - Mr. Choi.

1123
01:01:25.111 --> 01:01:26.240
Get out of here!

1124
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.510
(Mad Dog)

1125
01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.580
Not Mad Dog.

1126
01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.810
It'll cause too much damage.

1127
01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.510
It was a trap.

1128
01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:04.720
Mr. Choi. What are you doing?

1129
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.781
Mr. Choi!

1130
01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:07.720
Stay put?

1131
01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.321
I'm putting a leash on a mad dog.

1132
01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:12.060
Be more dangerous, punk.

1133
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.231
That way they'll know we're mad dogs.

1134
01:02:14.591 --> 01:02:16.091
It must've been Kang Woo.

1135
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:17.301
I used to like him.

1136
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.861
But you sent him away.

1137
01:02:19.401 --> 01:02:22.001
I think he's making things big.

1138
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:24.271
Should I catch the dog?

1139
01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.001
Until the work is done,

1140
01:02:26.001 --> 01:02:27.711
until I come to you,

1141
01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:29.410
I won't get killed.

1142
01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:31.240
Min Joon, you punk.
