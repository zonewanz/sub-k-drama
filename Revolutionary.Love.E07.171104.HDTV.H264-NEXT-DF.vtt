2
00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:20.524
Our Gangsu Group...

3
00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:23.591
<i>[Episode 7]</i>
cherishes our cleaning employees.

4
00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:25.954
We are considerate of them.

5
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.972
Therefore, CEO Byun Gang Su...

6
00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:38.856
has decided to not use external
contractors for cleaning services.

7
00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:40.429
He will hire them directly.

8
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.576
He decided to make that
announcement on this very day.

9
00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:47.409
What? Is that true?

10
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:49.417
Hyuk didn't mention that.

11
00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:50.912
I never heard that.

12
00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:54.683
Hyuk.

13
00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:56.380
- What's going on?
- Hey.

14
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.445
What's happening?

15
00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:01.087
Is it true?

16
00:01:01.087 --> 00:01:03.200
Is that true?

17
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:06.603
Changing temporary
employees to full-time?

18
00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:08.822
All of those employees?

19
00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.274
CEO Byun Gang Su.

20
00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:18.560
I truly thank you for this
very meaningful decision.

21
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.989
- It's true?
- Really? Oh my.

22
00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:25.405
CEO Byun Gang Su!
Thank you!

23
00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:27.634
Thank you!

24
00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:29.730
Give him a round of applause!

25
00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:38.243
That little punk.

26
00:01:41.414 --> 00:01:43.490
CEO Byun! CEO!

27
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.406
Is that true?

28
00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:47.983
Please give us a comment.

29
00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:51.007
Just one comment.

30
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.984
Hyuk, you little rascal.

31
00:02:04.058 --> 00:02:05.456
Come here.

32
00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:10.143
Hey, you insane little punk.

33
00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:14.456
When did I ever decide that?

34
00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:18.568
Who said you could say that?

35
00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:22.359
They clean the Gangsu Group building.

36
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.195
It's strange that they're not
employees of Gangsu Group.

37
00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.343
So, what?

38
00:02:27.343 --> 00:02:30.127
You dare to protest your
father's company?

39
00:02:30.127 --> 00:02:32.126
I wasn't there as your son.

40
00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:34.139
I was there as the cleaner,
Byun Hyuk.

41
00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.937
So...

42
00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:38.588
you're going to become
a fighter for rights overnight?

43
00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:39.902
It's not that.

44
00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:41.247
I know what's going on.

45
00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:43.576
The main contractor abuses
its power over contractors.

46
00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:45.737
Service contractors
abuse power over the employees.

47
00:02:45.737 --> 00:02:49.396
It's never-ending.
That's how it is.

48
00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:51.318
I know it all too.

49
00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:57.950
You don't know what you're talking about.

50
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.068
What were you doing?
What were you doing!

51
00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:11.111
- Father!
- You should've stopped it!

52
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:12.818
Stop it, Father!

53
00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:15.277
Oh, you'd better let go.
Let go of me!

54
00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:16.657
Don't hit Jae Hoon, please.

55
00:03:16.657 --> 00:03:18.328
- Just hit me.
- Hey!

56
00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:20.548
- Don't hit other people.
- Let go!

57
00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:23.137
I said don't hit others!

58
00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:46.210
How dare you?

59
00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:58.281
Why, you little...

60
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:03.074
All right, let's both die here today.

61
00:04:03.074 --> 00:04:04.403
You rascal.

62
00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:06.663
Get up now, punk.

63
00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.153
I... I have something to say.

64
00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:10.868
Joon.

65
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:17.500
Who are you?

66
00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.995
Hey, Secretary Park.
What were you doing!

67
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.019
Please leave.

68
00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:25.774
Just a moment.
I just need one moment.

69
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.209
Didn't Gangsu Group contract out the
cleaners in order to save labor costs?

70
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:36.850
But, when the contractors hire cleaners,
you pay a high commission fee.

71
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.954
Meanwhile, the cleaners get poor
benefits, pay, and unfair dismissal.

72
00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:46.266
So? What does that
have to do with me?

73
00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:48.199
What I'm trying say is...

74
00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.221
if Gangsu Group hired cleaners directly,
there would be no difference in cost.

75
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:55.940
Also, the cleaning staff
wouldn't suffer under contractors.

76
00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.538
If the costs are the same,
why would I have to do such a thing?

77
00:05:00.538 --> 00:05:03.922
"A person's heart is more
important than money."

78
00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:06.120
"To create employees who care"

79
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.319
"owners must first
understand their hearts."

80
00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.718
Third line on page 470 of your
book, "Human Management."

81
00:05:12.718 --> 00:05:15.682
Didn't you write that yourself, CEO Byun?

82
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:19.911
You read my book?

83
00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:22.552
Between employees
who think of it as their company

84
00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:25.331
and those who consider it temporary...

85
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.283
who do you think would work harder?

86
00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:37.067
Are you a cleaner, as well?

87
00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:40.093
No, I got fired yesterday.

88
00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:43.317
Then I have no reason to listen to you.

89
00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:48.548
You should work here, at the least,
to request something from me.

90
00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:51.617
You're nothing here.

91
00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:56.105
You can talk all you want and show off,
but what's the use?

92
00:05:56.105 --> 00:06:02.115
If you're so great,
you should become an employee here.

93
00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:06.680
Full-time employment is silly.

94
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.846
What?

95
00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:13.567
You work so hard to get it,
but you lose your job in your 40s.

96
00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:19.004
People waste time, money,
and their lives just to get that job.

97
00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:39.384
You're a coward.

98
00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:42.471
A coward?

99
00:06:43.718 --> 00:06:45.593
- Are you talking about me?
- Yes.

100
00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:48.473
You're scared and running
before even starting.

101
00:06:48.473 --> 00:06:53.557
You have lots of excuses,
and you haven't even tried.

102
00:06:54.502 --> 00:06:56.446
Coward.

103
00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:13.999
Joon, I'm so sorry.

104
00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:15.696
I'll apologize on behalf of my father.

105
00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:17.391
Joon.

106
00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:47.348
Was this it?

107
00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:49.915
Your plan to do whatever you could?

108
00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:54.244
At least, I didn't die.

109
00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:59.360
Since things worked out like this,
I'll keep trying.

110
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.031
I mean it.

111
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:07.728
No, this is more than enough.

112
00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:14.062
Don't get yourself hit over
something that won't work out.

113
00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:17.519
I'll get going.

114
00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:36.214
- This is Strategic Planning.
- This is Strategic Planning.

115
00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:37.322
There will be an announcement.

116
00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:39.501
Please wait for
the official announcement.

117
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.424
Our department doesn't handle that.

118
00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:44.316
Yes, I'm sorry.

119
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:49.644
I'm sorry I couldn't put a stop to it.

120
00:08:49.644 --> 00:08:52.774
Wasn't it your job before to
keep an eye on that second son?

121
00:08:52.774 --> 00:08:57.332
That guy came and
caused a scene at your event.

122
00:08:57.332 --> 00:08:59.654
Does it make sense
that you didn't know about it?

123
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.104
Hey, do you know how much money
we spent on this project?

124
00:09:05.104 --> 00:09:09.803
Yet, no one is interested
in the new food item.

125
00:09:09.803 --> 00:09:11.714
Everyone is asking about
the cleaners instead.

126
00:09:11.714 --> 00:09:16.142
What are you going to do?
What are you going to about it!

127
00:09:16.142 --> 00:09:17.421
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:19.868
Is "sorry" going to cut it?

129
00:09:19.868 --> 00:09:21.047
Oh.

130
00:09:22.198 --> 00:09:23.657
Yes.

131
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:28.124
We are not responsible for the cleaners.

132
00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:32.037
Nothing's been confirmed, so please
wait for an official announcement.

133
00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:33.413
Yes.

134
00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:37.951
Move!

135
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:46.028
Are you all crazy?

136
00:09:46.028 --> 00:09:49.163
What were you thinking going up there?

137
00:09:49.163 --> 00:09:52.510
You trusted in the CEO's son
and caused that scene?

138
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.758
I could lose my job
because of you people!

139
00:09:56.758 --> 00:09:59.649
Hey, stop thinking so negatively.

140
00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:01.078
He is the CEO's son.

141
00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:02.158
You never know.

142
00:10:02.158 --> 00:10:04.472
CEO Byun might do everything
that his son asked for.

143
00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:07.703
- That is true.
- He might.

144
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.941
Oh, what's wrong?

145
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:15.951
Did someone hit you?

146
00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:21.019
Do what his son asked for?
Yeah, right.

147
00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:23.866
It's all over. It's over.

148
00:10:26.652 --> 00:10:28.495
So annoying.

149
00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:30.020
To his own son!

150
00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:49.804
Even if he's angry,
how could he do this to his son?

151
00:10:49.804 --> 00:10:52.806
I guess it was a part of the process.

152
00:10:52.806 --> 00:10:54.596
I tried doing what I could.

153
00:10:54.596 --> 00:10:57.056
I'm sorry things worked out this way.

154
00:10:57.056 --> 00:11:01.121
Why would you be sorry? We're fine.

155
00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:07.773
Telling all those people that
we are important was more than enough.

156
00:11:07.773 --> 00:11:10.942
Yeah, you were cool.

157
00:11:10.942 --> 00:11:12.481
Thank you.

158
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:14.761
Where did Joon go, anyway?

159
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:16.923
She followed you to the CEO's office.

160
00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:18.731
Didn't you see her?

161
00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:24.296
Eat this.

162
00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:27.735
- You eat one too, Honey.
- Okay.

163
00:11:27.735 --> 00:11:29.256
Here you go.

164
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:32.503
Yum. It's sweet.

165
00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:37.193
Oh, it's winter already.

166
00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:38.966
Every day, it's colder.

167
00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:40.309
- Good, right?
- Yes.

168
00:11:40.309 --> 00:11:41.716
Is it good?

169
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:44.503
Here.

170
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.149
I'm here, Dad.

171
00:12:15.243 --> 00:12:17.783
Sorry it's been so long.

172
00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:21.668
<i>You're a coward.</i>

173
00:12:22.677 --> 00:12:25.828
You're scared and running
before even starting.

174
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.164
You have lots of excuses,
and you haven't even tried.

175
00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:38.241
Coward.

176
00:12:39.433 --> 00:12:41.493
Am I really?

177
00:12:44.922 --> 00:12:50.254
Am I really... a coward?

178
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.740
Jae Hoon.

179
00:13:42.817 --> 00:13:45.269
Joon's not home yet.

180
00:13:46.461 --> 00:13:49.621
Why are you like that?

181
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.971
You only think about yourself, don't you?

182
00:13:51.971 --> 00:13:56.322
You don't care if others get hurt
or have a hard time because of you.

183
00:13:56.322 --> 00:13:58.912
Only your life matters to you.

184
00:13:58.912 --> 00:14:01.182
I'm really sorry, Jae Hoon.

185
00:14:01.182 --> 00:14:05.173
I didn't mean to ruin the event.

186
00:14:05.173 --> 00:14:11.660
It was really important
to the cleaning employees.

187
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.567
Cleaning employees?

188
00:14:13.567 --> 00:14:16.339
Since when did you care
about people like that?

189
00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:17.403
Jae Hoon.

190
00:14:17.403 --> 00:14:19.916
If you're going to cause problems...

191
00:14:19.916 --> 00:14:21.870
do it outside the company.

192
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.765
Don't cause a headache
for so many people.

193
00:14:25.748 --> 00:14:29.870
I'm getting really tired of you.

194
00:14:37.937 --> 00:14:39.714
<i>About Hyuk...</i>

195
00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:42.966
What do you think of him?

196
00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.363
I don't know much,
but he sure has a lot of spirit.

197
00:14:45.363 --> 00:14:46.797
Yeah?

198
00:14:47.772 --> 00:14:50.100
You think so too, right?

199
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.020
That kid...

200
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.248
I wondered what he would be able to do.

201
00:14:55.248 --> 00:14:59.938
He has a more ambitious spirit
than I thought.

202
00:15:02.706 --> 00:15:05.869
While we're on the topic...

203
00:15:05.869 --> 00:15:10.453
why don't you take him into your
Strategic Planning team?

204
00:15:10.947 --> 00:15:13.466
See if he can make it or not.

205
00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:17.539
Take him in and put him to work.

206
00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:22.764
I can't do that, CEO Byun.

207
00:15:22.764 --> 00:15:24.464
You can't?

208
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.032
Why not?

209
00:15:27.032 --> 00:15:31.317
If you want him on my team,
do it officially.

210
00:15:31.317 --> 00:15:36.078
As it turns out,
we're hiring new interns.

211
00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:41.128
Getting hired fairly
by his own merits into Gangsu

212
00:15:41.128 --> 00:15:44.408
is what's best for you and Hyuk.

213
00:15:44.408 --> 00:15:46.423
Oh, no.

214
00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:49.782
He couldn't even graduate
college in the US.

215
00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:53.551
He's only a high school graduate
and has no experience.

216
00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:58.365
How can he get hired by our company?

217
00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:02.902
We won't be looking at academics,
gender, or age this time.

218
00:16:02.902 --> 00:16:05.865
We won't be looking at the
resume they've built up.

219
00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:10.871
We'll be choosing based on
their capabilities and character.

220
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:12.864
So...

221
00:16:12.864 --> 00:16:15.833
you're saying Hyuk can get in?

222
00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.971
You're curious to know
if he can make it or not.

223
00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:23.293
If he can make it,
he should get in.

224
00:16:45.264 --> 00:16:49.217
<i>The intern applications start today.
Don't be stubborn.</i>

225
00:17:01.441 --> 00:17:04.152
Is it true that you won't be
looking at the resume?

226
00:17:04.152 --> 00:17:08.292
- Yes.
- Oh, Gangsu Group's doing good work.

227
00:17:08.292 --> 00:17:10.301
Go on.

228
00:17:12.137 --> 00:17:14.914
What? You want me to what?

229
00:17:14.914 --> 00:17:18.654
Apply for the open call for interns.

230
00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:23.661
If you pass everything
and become an intern

231
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:27.162
I'll think about hiring
the cleaning staff directly.

232
00:17:27.162 --> 00:17:31.356
Apply today if you want to be
held responsible for your words.

233
00:17:31.356 --> 00:17:34.801
Father, this isn't right.

234
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.973
- Why not?
- An intern?

235
00:17:39.964 --> 00:17:44.137
How could I get in?
You know my education and resume.

236
00:17:44.137 --> 00:17:45.691
This isn't a proper negotiation.

237
00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:48.781
You're basically saying you won't do it.

238
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:51.432
A person who makes claims
without even knowing a thing.

239
00:17:51.432 --> 00:17:53.942
Is that a proper negotiation?

240
00:17:53.942 --> 00:17:56.343
- Father.
- I'm done talking.

241
00:17:56.343 --> 00:18:00.568
It's up to you if you
want to accept it or not.

242
00:18:17.117 --> 00:18:18.653
Hello?

243
00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:23.419
Wh... what? Intern?

244
00:18:24.852 --> 00:18:27.193
Who? You?

245
00:18:27.193 --> 00:18:29.055
Yes, me.

246
00:18:29.055 --> 00:18:30.786
Does this make sense?

247
00:18:30.786 --> 00:18:32.893
He wants me to apply to be an intern.

248
00:18:32.893 --> 00:18:37.334
He says I need to pass so he'll
consider hiring the cleaners.

249
00:18:37.334 --> 00:18:39.273
What do you think this means?

250
00:18:39.273 --> 00:18:43.019
What else? He's saying screw off.

251
00:18:43.942 --> 00:18:47.349
Well, there's no need
to say it so directly.

252
00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:48.721
Your education is lacking.

253
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:53.076
All you have going for you
is that you're the CEO's son.

254
00:18:53.076 --> 00:18:55.535
It's not like the CEO
is giving you the position.

255
00:18:55.535 --> 00:18:58.579
He wants you to fight fairly
with others and pass on your own.

256
00:18:58.579 --> 00:19:00.259
Yes.

257
00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:02.574
He must be telling me to screw off.

258
00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:04.689
I heard they're not looking at
the resume this time.

259
00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:07.307
Even so, there's a limit to it.

260
00:19:07.307 --> 00:19:10.938
At the final stages, what would
they look at if not the resume?

261
00:19:10.938 --> 00:19:12.127
Hold on.

262
00:19:12.127 --> 00:19:18.723
So, this whole thing about "no resumes"
was all about the company's image?

263
00:19:18.723 --> 00:19:21.026
Yet, you were pushing me to apply?

264
00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.683
Even though you knew it was all a lie.

265
00:19:22.683 --> 00:19:25.035
Joon, you're going to
apply to be an intern too?

266
00:19:25.035 --> 00:19:27.035
Don't be ridiculous.

267
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:30.403
You and Hyuk are on a different level.

268
00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:34.394
Yes, Joon is on a different level
of intelligence than me.

269
00:19:34.394 --> 00:19:35.644
I'm glad that you know.

270
00:19:35.644 --> 00:19:37.664
There's no need for you
to be conflicted.

271
00:19:37.664 --> 00:19:39.844
You will fail that intern interview.

272
00:19:39.844 --> 00:19:42.384
Gangsu Group will re-sign
with the cleaning contractors.

273
00:19:42.384 --> 00:19:47.517
Then CEO Min will continue
to reap the benefits.

274
00:19:47.517 --> 00:19:50.384
Well, then there's
nothing to think about.

275
00:19:50.384 --> 00:19:51.925
Just apply.

276
00:19:51.925 --> 00:19:53.959
Yes, right?

277
00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:55.294
What?

278
00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.753
- Do what?
- Hey, Baek Joon.

279
00:19:56.753 --> 00:19:58.929
You said you'd get them hired.

280
00:19:58.929 --> 00:20:01.196
Their lives are in your hands right now.

281
00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:02.867
You're quitting without even trying?

282
00:20:02.867 --> 00:20:04.730
No, that's not it.

283
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.959
Don't egg him on to do things
he can't be responsible for.

284
00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:11.398
Then you shouldn't have done that
performance at the event at all, Hyuk.

285
00:20:11.398 --> 00:20:12.874
That is true.

286
00:20:12.874 --> 00:20:15.943
No. Don't even think about it.
You can't do it.

287
00:20:15.943 --> 00:20:17.469
Yes, I can't.

288
00:20:17.469 --> 00:20:20.155
A man is giving up before trying?

289
00:20:20.155 --> 00:20:22.540
Yes, that's not right.

290
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.538
I told you not to do it.

291
00:20:24.538 --> 00:20:27.142
I told you to do it.

292
00:20:38.567 --> 00:20:42.567
Your father told Hyuk
to apply for an internship?

293
00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:44.064
I know, right?

294
00:20:44.064 --> 00:20:47.263
Even if he is angry,
why would he tell Hyuk to intern?

295
00:20:47.263 --> 00:20:48.957
It's a bit too much.

296
00:20:49.634 --> 00:20:51.971
What in the world is he thinking?

297
00:20:54.069 --> 00:20:56.772
Is there anything you know, Mother?

298
00:20:56.772 --> 00:20:58.334
<i>You told me to give him wings.</i>

299
00:20:58.334 --> 00:21:00.680
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

300
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.824
If he has wings, he'll fly.

301
00:21:03.824 --> 00:21:06.003
I don't know if he's a phoenix.

302
00:21:06.003 --> 00:21:11.479
I need to throw him to know
if he's an eagle or a baby chick.

303
00:21:13.413 --> 00:21:15.343
Father said that?

304
00:21:15.343 --> 00:21:20.186
I wondered what that meant, at the time.

305
00:21:21.144 --> 00:21:22.493
Hey, Woo Sung.

306
00:21:22.493 --> 00:21:27.131
Do you think your father is trying
to help train Hyuk right now?

307
00:21:27.772 --> 00:21:31.888
Shouldn't you help Hyuk
as his older brother, then?

308
00:21:31.888 --> 00:21:33.776
Come on, Mother.

309
00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:36.224
You know he's just a troublemaker.

310
00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:38.044
How could I help?

311
00:21:38.044 --> 00:21:41.897
Hey, Hyuk didn't turn
his back on you back then.

312
00:21:41.897 --> 00:21:45.176
That young thing was
protecting his older brother...

313
00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:52.240
Never mind. Let's not talk about it.

314
00:21:59.037 --> 00:22:01.486
Oh, I can't do it. I can't.

315
00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:05.203
How can I do it?
Even if they're not looking at resumes.

316
00:22:05.203 --> 00:22:07.555
I need to know something
to pass the tests.

317
00:22:07.555 --> 00:22:10.105
Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it.

318
00:22:26.042 --> 00:22:29.862
Is Hyuk that poorly educated?

319
00:22:29.862 --> 00:22:32.662
I don't really know.

320
00:22:32.662 --> 00:22:35.608
How much of a bad student was he?

321
00:22:35.608 --> 00:22:37.421
It can't be just that.

322
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:40.429
Yeah, it can't just be about that.

323
00:22:40.429 --> 00:22:42.654
What would happen if he doesn't pass?

324
00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:46.222
That determines whether
we become direct hires or not.

325
00:22:46.222 --> 00:22:49.894
It must be such
an emotional burden, right?

326
00:22:49.894 --> 00:22:51.692
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:23:18.635 --> 00:23:20.634
What brings you by?

328
00:23:20.634 --> 00:23:24.413
I was just curious about where you lived.

329
00:23:24.994 --> 00:23:27.715
It's not as bad as I thought it'd be.

330
00:23:27.715 --> 00:23:29.355
My home is very shabby.

331
00:23:29.355 --> 00:23:31.275
Would you like to go to a cafe nearby?

332
00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:32.964
It's okay, Jae Hoon.

333
00:23:32.964 --> 00:23:35.105
Don't worry about that.

334
00:23:35.105 --> 00:23:38.365
There's a cafe five minutes away.

335
00:23:38.365 --> 00:23:41.217
He says he was curious
about where I lived.

336
00:23:42.012 --> 00:23:44.286
Then I should show him.

337
00:23:47.484 --> 00:23:49.230
Come on, Brother.

338
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:58.586
Wait here.

339
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:36.086
Are you okay with coffee, Woo Sung?

340
00:24:36.086 --> 00:24:39.861
No, I don't drink coffee after 6:00 p.m.

341
00:24:40.506 --> 00:24:42.844
Then I'll drink alone.

342
00:24:45.656 --> 00:24:48.835
Ah, okay. I'm recharged.

343
00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:51.259
It’s a bit small, right?

344
00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:54.369
Sit wherever you feel comfortable.

345
00:24:59.635 --> 00:25:02.527
So, Father told you
to apply for the internship.

346
00:25:02.527 --> 00:25:03.844
That's what I heard.

347
00:25:03.844 --> 00:25:05.396
Yes.

348
00:25:13.384 --> 00:25:14.842
What is it?

349
00:25:15.935 --> 00:25:18.432
You said you needed money.

350
00:25:18.432 --> 00:25:20.965
I gave you more than enough in there.

351
00:25:20.965 --> 00:25:23.207
Take it and leave Korea for a while.

352
00:25:23.207 --> 00:25:27.548
Go on vacation
and give your mind a break.

353
00:25:27.548 --> 00:25:33.102
Also, don't take Father's offer
too seriously.

354
00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:36.595
Don't act up, kid.

355
00:25:37.978 --> 00:25:40.968
You wouldn't even
pass the intern interview.

356
00:25:40.968 --> 00:25:44.406
What are you rambling on about
direct hiring of cleaners?

357
00:25:45.137 --> 00:25:49.696
Just shut your mouth and live quietly.

358
00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:53.545
That's what he means by it.

359
00:26:02.332 --> 00:26:03.893
Hyuk.

360
00:26:06.154 --> 00:26:08.166
You've done enough.

361
00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:11.273
You've shown your presence enough.

362
00:26:12.829 --> 00:26:17.351
Stop now and go have fun
somewhere outside of this country.

363
00:26:17.351 --> 00:26:21.721
I'll give you whatever you need
while you're there, okay?

364
00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:28.960
<i>Please, Hyuk.</i>

365
00:26:29.651 --> 00:26:33.154
I'll do whatever you need.

366
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.771
Save me just this once.

367
00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:39.277
You know I'll die if our father knows.

368
00:26:39.277 --> 00:26:41.963
You're the only person who can help me.

369
00:26:41.963 --> 00:26:44.500
You're the only one...

370
00:26:46.369 --> 00:26:49.978
I'll do anything you want, okay?

371
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:56.594
So, Hyuk. Save me this once.

372
00:26:57.228 --> 00:26:59.074
I'm begging like this.

373
00:27:03.607 --> 00:27:07.042
My goodness. I can't believe this.

374
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.912
You little bastard.

375
00:27:08.912 --> 00:27:10.596
Honey!

376
00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:12.955
Have you no fear?

377
00:27:12.955 --> 00:27:17.308
You took the car out tonight
and hit a person?

378
00:27:18.502 --> 00:27:20.690
What? What happened?

379
00:27:23.146 --> 00:27:25.501
Hyuk... Hyuk.

380
00:27:26.922 --> 00:27:28.270
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.076
Turn yourself in!

382
00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:34.257
Take responsibility
for the things you've done!

383
00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:39.310
Honey, please. Our Hyuk is still young.

384
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.340
He still has his future.
Please help him this once.

385
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.557
I don't know.

386
00:27:47.096 --> 00:27:49.143
Honey!

387
00:27:49.143 --> 00:27:52.342
Honey, Honey!

388
00:27:52.342 --> 00:27:54.126
Honey!

389
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:12.969
This is amusing.

390
00:28:15.076 --> 00:28:17.838
When you say you'll do anything for me...

391
00:28:20.388 --> 00:28:22.931
it means you're desperate.

392
00:28:23.676 --> 00:28:25.113
Right?

393
00:28:30.097 --> 00:28:32.779
Now that I think about it...

394
00:28:34.382 --> 00:28:36.977
there was only one thing
you could do for me.

395
00:28:36.977 --> 00:28:40.597
Ah, I'm not upset by it though.

396
00:28:43.592 --> 00:28:46.002
For one thing, it's not fun anymore.

397
00:28:47.342 --> 00:28:52.189
Whatever it is...
people doing things for me.

398
00:28:55.037 --> 00:28:59.755
You're not saying you're really going
to apply for this internship, are you?

399
00:29:04.082 --> 00:29:07.340
Honestly, I wasn't up for the task.

400
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.303
But you showed up here
worrying about me.

401
00:29:11.303 --> 00:29:15.805
I feel pathetic at the fact
that I was scared.

402
00:29:16.413 --> 00:29:18.405
So, you're doing it?

403
00:29:18.952 --> 00:29:21.625
You'll cheer me on, right, Brother?

404
00:29:51.788 --> 00:29:56.000
Tell him he doesn't need
to feel too burdened by us.

405
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.598
Everyone has to make his own living.

406
00:29:57.598 --> 00:30:00.020
People have to live their own lives.

407
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.816
Of course, he doesn't need
to feel responsible for us at all.

408
00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:05.243
That's right.

409
00:30:17.836 --> 00:30:19.888
Are you just leaving like that?

410
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.049
What is he thinking?

411
00:30:23.049 --> 00:30:24.585
Do you know anything?

412
00:30:24.585 --> 00:30:27.311
Thinking? Nothing, really.

413
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:30.519
I just got mad on my own
and got upset.

414
00:30:31.569 --> 00:30:33.979
Is that really it?

415
00:30:33.979 --> 00:30:35.336
Hm?

416
00:30:35.336 --> 00:30:36.832
I'm sure that's all it is.

417
00:30:36.832 --> 00:30:41.539
He probably only said it out of
embarrassment in front of his brother.

418
00:30:42.284 --> 00:30:45.451
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
- No.

419
00:30:45.451 --> 00:30:47.376
Don't do a single thing.

420
00:30:48.063 --> 00:30:51.192
Let him go for the internship.

421
00:30:51.192 --> 00:30:56.021
He needs to see how low and
how much of a nobody he is.

422
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:57.946
He needs to get out there to see.

423
00:31:13.461 --> 00:31:15.760
Joon, what did you just say?

424
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.046
Let's do it together, that intern test.

425
00:31:18.046 --> 00:31:20.386
Really? You too?

426
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.497
Why, suddenly?

427
00:31:23.497 --> 00:31:26.714
I can't leave you
to get screwed by yourself.

428
00:31:26.714 --> 00:31:27.778
Joon.

429
00:31:27.778 --> 00:31:30.171
Of course, it's not free,
so don't expect too much.

430
00:31:30.171 --> 00:31:32.378
Intern tests all have three rounds.

431
00:31:32.378 --> 00:31:34.821
First round, human resources
screening test.

432
00:31:34.821 --> 00:31:36.579
Second round, a practical skills test.

433
00:31:36.579 --> 00:31:38.141
Third round, a personal interview.

434
00:31:38.141 --> 00:31:40.670
For every round you pass,
200,000 won and you get special training.

435
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:44.039
If you pass the whole thing,
I get a bonus of 100,000 on top.

436
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:46.556
How about it?

437
00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:49.250
That doesn't matter to me.

438
00:31:50.095 --> 00:31:52.806
Special training though? What's that?

439
00:31:52.806 --> 00:31:55.387
They won't accept just anyone,
even if they don't look at resumes.

440
00:31:55.387 --> 00:31:58.855
That means they need
other means to evaluate you.

441
00:31:58.855 --> 00:32:00.304
Language.

442
00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:02.890
Math.

443
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.037
Deduction.

444
00:32:04.613 --> 00:32:07.964
Spatial perception, current events.

445
00:32:08.828 --> 00:32:11.143
You need master all of these things.

446
00:32:11.143 --> 00:32:12.397
All of this?

447
00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:14.105
Yes.

448
00:32:14.105 --> 00:32:18.715
Last of all... this one too.

449
00:32:21.263 --> 00:32:22.885
<i>[Human Management]</i>

450
00:32:31.647 --> 00:32:35.269
<i>[Interning is my path to survival!]</i>

451
00:32:41.814 --> 00:32:43.696
You think that will work?

452
00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:52.163
You agree, right?

453
00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:01.515
<i>Hey, Byun Hyuk.</i>

454
00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:03.906
You're not studying, are you?

455
00:33:03.906 --> 00:33:05.623
Get back to studying now!

456
00:33:05.623 --> 00:33:08.311
Oh, oh. Okay, I will.

457
00:33:08.311 --> 00:33:11.230
I'll study. I will.

458
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.498
Joon knows me so well.

459
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.992
Eat while you study.

460
00:33:55.595 --> 00:33:57.451
Yum, this rice.

461
00:33:57.451 --> 00:33:59.535
It's so good.

462
00:34:00.173 --> 00:34:02.837
The ramen noodles are really great.

463
00:34:17.538 --> 00:34:21.378
These are the questions they've used
in the past three years.

464
00:34:21.378 --> 00:34:23.755
It's a study guide of past exams.

465
00:34:23.755 --> 00:34:26.398
It was very hard to get this.

466
00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:27.565
Use this to study.

467
00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:29.394
We'll make good use of it, Madam Ahn.

468
00:34:29.394 --> 00:34:30.797
Here.

469
00:34:30.797 --> 00:34:34.447
It's a study guide that Madam Ahn
worked hard to get, so memorize it.

470
00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:38.740
There's so much I have to memorize, Joon.

471
00:34:43.068 --> 00:34:45.550
Ah... yum.

472
00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:48.958
- Keep it up.
- Okay.

473
00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:26.262
I managed to get
these documents from the company.

474
00:35:32.527 --> 00:35:33.793
Thank you, Mister.

475
00:35:33.793 --> 00:35:35.659
No need to thank me.

476
00:35:38.588 --> 00:35:40.876
Oh, you're resting.

477
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:12.364
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E07 Revolutionary Love</font>

478
00:36:36.078 --> 00:36:37.796
Is it going well?

479
00:36:39.652 --> 00:36:41.277
I don't know.

480
00:36:42.031 --> 00:36:45.982
I'm just doing what Joon tells me to.

481
00:36:45.982 --> 00:36:48.585
It's so hard, my friend.

482
00:36:52.129 --> 00:36:56.616
I've been pooping blood.

483
00:36:59.955 --> 00:37:01.919
<i>Why are you pushing so hard?</i>

484
00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:04.897
No matter how much you rile him up,
Hyuk won't make it.

485
00:37:04.897 --> 00:37:06.071
He won't pass.

486
00:37:06.071 --> 00:37:09.980
Even if he passes rounds one and two,
he won't make it past round three.

487
00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.491
Why?

488
00:37:14.955 --> 00:37:17.080
Chief Byun Woo Sung will fail him.

489
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.710
Why does he go that far
to keep Hyuk in check?

490
00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:25.643
He's not keeping him in check.
He looks down on him.

491
00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:27.692
A younger brother is giving it a try.

492
00:37:27.692 --> 00:37:29.873
The older brother
purposely gets in the way.

493
00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:31.654
Is that merely looking down on him?

494
00:37:31.654 --> 00:37:33.035
I think differently.

495
00:37:33.035 --> 00:37:36.558
Are you getting involved in
Hyuk's sibling fights too?

496
00:37:36.558 --> 00:37:40.393
You could even end up being in charge
of taking care of Hyuk instead of me.

497
00:37:40.393 --> 00:37:42.473
What? Can't I do that?

498
00:37:42.473 --> 00:37:45.584
You do it, so why can't I do it?

499
00:37:45.584 --> 00:37:48.274
Are you serious about that nonsense?

500
00:37:48.274 --> 00:37:51.035
You said you've been friends
with Hyuk since kindergarten.

501
00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:53.435
Don't you know Hyuk at all?

502
00:37:53.435 --> 00:37:56.299
Then what about you?
What do you know about him?

503
00:37:56.299 --> 00:37:57.939
You haven't known him that long.

504
00:37:57.939 --> 00:38:02.140
At least, I know the burden of
responsibility he's carrying.

505
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:06.511
Do you think Hyuk knows what
the word "responsibility" means?

506
00:38:06.511 --> 00:38:08.580
If he didn't know,
why would he be doing this?

507
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.062
He could live life in comfort.

508
00:38:10.062 --> 00:38:12.844
Do you really not know?
It's all because of you.

509
00:38:12.844 --> 00:38:16.265
Because you keep telling him to do it
and encouraging him.

510
00:38:16.265 --> 00:38:21.089
He doesn't even know what he's doing
and he's running in head first.

511
00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:27.069
What if it is because of me?
Is that wrong?

512
00:38:29.806 --> 00:38:33.094
What do you mean by that?

513
00:38:33.094 --> 00:38:36.727
Whatever the reason,
he's doing something with sincerity.

514
00:38:36.727 --> 00:38:38.727
Isn't that good enough?

515
00:38:40.694 --> 00:38:42.757
<i>What is it?</i>

516
00:38:42.757 --> 00:38:45.116
That burden of responsibility?

517
00:38:52.306 --> 00:38:54.995
Hey, Byun Hyuk. Are you sleeping?

00:39:41.477 --> 00:39:44.283
<i>We are staying strong, thanks to you.</i>

523
00:39:45.506 --> 00:39:47.719
<i>Hyuk, it's okay if you fail.
Don't feel burdened.</i>

524
00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:50.502
<i>Whatever happens, thank you.</i>

Hello.

532
00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:31.587
Thank you.

533
00:41:32.147 --> 00:41:36.957
Joon, you know the new guy
who moved in next door?

534
00:41:36.957 --> 00:41:38.908
Is it a guy that moved in?

535
00:41:38.908 --> 00:41:40.297
Yes.

536
00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:44.777
From what I can tell,
he's around our age.

537
00:41:44.777 --> 00:41:48.988
Anyway, he looks kind of simple.

538
00:41:48.988 --> 00:41:51.488
But I think he's interested in me.

539
00:41:51.488 --> 00:41:54.613
Whenever I run into him,
he never says a single word.

540
00:41:54.613 --> 00:41:57.902
Then he carries my luggage
up the stairs for me.

541
00:41:57.902 --> 00:42:01.663
Well, you do have
great visuals, Yeon Hee.

542
00:42:01.663 --> 00:42:02.779
I know.

543
00:42:02.779 --> 00:42:06.209
I'm so pretty that it's an annoyance.

544
00:42:06.209 --> 00:42:08.033
Okay, it's ready. Let's eat.

545
00:42:08.033 --> 00:42:09.792
Let's give it a try.

546
00:42:13.571 --> 00:42:15.723
It's so good.

547
00:42:15.723 --> 00:42:20.922
As always, the rice you mix
is the best, Joon.

548
00:42:20.922 --> 00:42:22.837
It's the red chili paste that's good.

549
00:42:22.837 --> 00:42:27.701
Gangsu Foods does make really
great red chili paste, right?

550
00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:29.227
I suppose so.

551
00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.498
Joon.

552
00:42:40.323 --> 00:42:42.453
Try this red chili paste.

553
00:42:42.453 --> 00:42:44.009
Your dad developed this.

554
00:42:44.009 --> 00:42:45.881
- Really?
- Yes.

555
00:42:49.837 --> 00:42:51.678
Oh, it's spicy.

556
00:42:51.678 --> 00:42:53.359
So spicy!

557
00:42:54.848 --> 00:42:57.355
Joon, don't forget this taste.

558
00:42:57.355 --> 00:43:00.096
This will become the
base of Gangsu Foods.

559
00:43:00.096 --> 00:43:02.163
So spicy, so spicy.

560
00:43:10.556 --> 00:43:12.169
By the way...

561
00:43:12.169 --> 00:43:14.564
how are the preparations
for the intern test going

562
00:43:14.564 --> 00:43:15.875
with the third generation punk?

563
00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:17.747
Not bad.

564
00:43:18.308 --> 00:43:20.323
When is it?

565
00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:23.210
Tomorrow.

566
00:43:25.267 --> 00:43:27.774
- You can do it!
- We can!

567
00:43:31.815 --> 00:43:33.248
We're not late, are we?

568
00:43:33.248 --> 00:43:35.198
- We still have five minutes.
- Okay.

569
00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:40.350
<i>[Gangsu Food Intern Screening Test]</i>

Yes, Madam.

576

Young Master Hyuk has
safely arrived at the company.

577

579
00:44:12.616 --> 00:44:14.377
All right.

580
00:44:57.473 --> 00:44:59.955
You don't need to be scared or nervous.

581
00:44:59.955 --> 00:45:02.517
Practice like a battle

Don't worry. I'll be there with you.

583
00:45:04.988 --> 00:45:06.192

<i>Huh? I can see the answers too.</i>

591

596
00:46:04.712 --> 00:46:07.165
There's a disaster.

597
00:46:07.165 --> 00:46:13.107
They say that Byun Hyuk
has passed the first round test.

598
00:46:24.312 --> 00:46:27.145
Wow, this is great.

599
00:46:27.145 --> 00:46:30.160
No need to be so happy.
It's only the first round.

600
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.098
The first round is not so easy.

601
00:46:33.685 --> 00:46:37.265
Wait, what happens after first round?

602
00:46:37.265 --> 00:46:40.522
What else?
He takes the second round test.

603
00:46:40.522 --> 00:46:42.768
What is the second round test?

604
00:46:42.768 --> 00:46:45.971
The second round test is a blind test.

605

You need to find the Gangsu Food product
from the products in front of you.

Carefully taste the food in front of you

Okay, let's get started then.

00:48:01.067 --> 00:48:02.873
<i>Don't forget it.</i>

612
00:48:02.873 --> 00:48:04.634
<i>I'm going to test you on it.</i>

613
00:48:09.629 --> 00:48:13.486
<i>In the 18th century,
he started the realist movement.</i>

614
00:48:13.486 --> 00:48:15.908
<i>A realist and reformist?</i>

00:48:15.908 --> 00:48:17.660
Ha Nam Hee.

616
00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.714
A realist and reformist?

617
00:48:20.714 --> 00:48:22.562
Post Joseon era, it's Oh Seon Jong.

618
00:48:22.562 --> 00:48:23.888
Yes.

619
00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:05.594
Yum.

620
00:49:06.283 --> 00:49:07.692
Yes, yes.

621
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:10.102
This is the taste.

622
00:49:20.022 --> 00:49:22.036
Yeah!

623
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:25.805
No, Joon.

624
00:49:25.805 --> 00:49:27.748
Just one second, no five seconds.

625
00:49:27.748 --> 00:49:29.033
People are watching.

626
00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:31.877
Three, four, five.

627
00:49:31.877 --> 00:49:32.959
I did well, right?

628
00:49:32.959 --> 00:49:34.430
You did. That was great.

629
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.232
I really didn't think
a hot bar would be there.

630
00:49:37.232 --> 00:49:39.004
The cup ramen confused me a little.

631
00:49:39.004 --> 00:49:42.815
- D, D, D, D!
- D, D, D, D!

632
00:49:42.815 --> 00:49:45.625
Let's go to round three now.

633
00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:47.399
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

634
00:49:47.399 --> 00:49:49.288
Good job.

635
00:49:49.288 --> 00:49:53.098
What? My Hyuk passed round two?

636
00:49:53.098 --> 00:49:56.276
Really? He even passed round two?

637
00:49:57.069 --> 00:50:01.419
May I ask you one more question?

638
00:50:01.419 --> 00:50:05.598
Did a girl named Baek Joon pass too?

639
00:50:06.839 --> 00:50:09.728
Ah, I see.

640
00:50:10.645 --> 00:50:14.227
All right. Thank you, Secretary Park.

641
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:18.040
Baek Joon? Who's that?

642
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.910
You don't need to know.

643
00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:23.453
What's going on?

644
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.968
Is she really Pyunggang?

645
00:50:28.424 --> 00:50:30.602
Really? Yes.

646
00:50:30.602 --> 00:50:34.201
So, Hyuk even passed round two?

647
00:50:34.201 --> 00:50:37.772
So, you had a good idea,
Managing Director Seol.

648
00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:44.263
Well, then...

649
00:50:44.263 --> 00:50:48.201
Who's going into the final interview?

650
00:51:22.332 --> 00:51:25.145
Tell us your positive traits.

651
00:51:25.145 --> 00:51:28.926
My positive traits?

652
00:51:28.926 --> 00:51:31.440
An abundance of sensitivity.

653
00:51:32.794 --> 00:51:34.977
I happen to like poems a lot.

654
00:51:34.977 --> 00:51:37.977
I have over 100 poems memorized.

655
00:51:37.977 --> 00:51:40.643
Should I recite one?

656
00:51:42.292 --> 00:51:44.524
"When looking at me
disgusts you and you leave"...

657
00:51:44.524 --> 00:51:46.109
That's fine.

658
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.406
Next question.

659
00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:52.087
I could give you
10 billion won right now.

660
00:51:52.087 --> 00:51:53.718
Oh, really?

661
00:51:53.718 --> 00:51:56.109
You can split that with your friend.

662
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:59.040
It's up to you how you split it.

663
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.710
However...

664
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:06.540
you need your friend's agreement in order
to receive that 10 billion won from me.

665
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.716
How will you split it?

666
00:52:15.372 --> 00:52:18.076
I will split it 50:50.

667
00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:22.181
Are you saying you're not
confident in negotiating?

668
00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:25.770
Think of a way you could negotiate
to maximize your profits.

669
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:28.103
Then answer again.

670
00:52:28.103 --> 00:52:31.011
How would that make me happy?

671
00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:35.163
You said the person was a friend.

672
00:52:35.163 --> 00:52:39.261
If I negotiated at my best
and split it 70:30 or 90:10

673
00:52:39.261 --> 00:52:41.707
my friendship with that person would end.

674
00:52:41.707 --> 00:52:44.560
Then I wouldn't be happy.

675
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:50.741
I would choose to split it evenly
and be happy together.

676
00:53:04.991 --> 00:53:07.209
What is this strange mood?

677
00:53:13.317 --> 00:53:14.975
Good job.

678
00:53:24.207 --> 00:53:27.239
You did a good job today,
so I'll treat you to dinner.

679
00:53:27.239 --> 00:53:28.549
- Really?
- Yes.

680
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:30.308
- Joon, you're paying?
- Of course.

681
00:53:30.308 --> 00:53:32.522
What should we eat?

682
00:53:40.518 --> 00:53:42.009
What is this?

683
00:53:42.009 --> 00:53:43.819
What should we do?

684
00:53:55.038 --> 00:53:58.042
When did you all prepare this?

685
00:54:04.837 --> 00:54:07.227
I'd better film this.

686
00:54:21.319 --> 00:54:23.370
<i>Good job!</i>

687
00:54:24.308 --> 00:54:27.366
<i>We are already so grateful.</i>

688
00:54:28.123 --> 00:54:30.857
<i>Even if you don't pass...</i>

689
00:54:32.446 --> 00:54:34.997
<i>we won't ever forget this.</i>

690
00:54:38.315 --> 00:54:41.643
You put in so much work for us.

691
00:54:47.123 --> 00:54:49.692
Hurry. Come on.

692
00:54:50.605 --> 00:54:52.607
Put it there.

693
00:54:53.167 --> 00:54:57.529
- Is it done?
- Okay.

694
00:54:57.529 --> 00:54:59.317
Wow.

695
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:03.178
We're done. We're done.

696
00:55:05.283 --> 00:55:10.116
We're treating you to pork belly.

697
00:55:10.116 --> 00:55:11.319
Treating you!

698
00:55:11.319 --> 00:55:13.118
Let's go eat some hot pork belly!

699
00:55:13.118 --> 00:55:15.236
- Pork belly?
- Hot?

700
00:55:15.236 --> 00:55:16.886
- So hot.
- Oh...

701
00:55:16.886 --> 00:55:20.261
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

702
00:55:20.261 --> 00:55:23.446
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

703
00:55:23.446 --> 00:55:26.915
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

704
00:55:26.915 --> 00:55:29.294
<i>In front of love, I am melting.</i>

705
00:55:29.294 --> 00:55:30.772
Wow.

706
00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:34.609
They're not my family or friends.

707
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:37.392
Not even the woman I love.

708
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:42.616
Why are they making me so emotional?

709
00:55:43.569 --> 00:55:45.408
They're your colleagues.

710
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:51.605
Yes, coming!

711
00:55:52.799 --> 00:55:55.647
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

712
00:55:55.647 --> 00:55:57.886
Why aren't you coming?

713
00:55:57.886 --> 00:55:59.658
I'm coming.

714
00:55:59.658 --> 00:56:04.448
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

715
00:56:11.428 --> 00:56:14.745
Then with a unanimous vote...

716
00:56:18.774 --> 00:56:20.500
<i>[Pass]</i>

717
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.850
Next is Byun Hyuk.

718
00:56:35.312 --> 00:56:38.051
- Hey.
- Let's say a cheer.

719
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:40.198
From battle to practice!

720
00:56:40.198 --> 00:56:42.257
From practice to battle!

721
00:56:42.257 --> 00:56:44.165
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

722
00:56:50.759 --> 00:56:52.618
Wow.

723
00:56:52.618 --> 00:56:54.748
Was soju always this good?

724
00:56:54.748 --> 00:56:56.718
It's much cleaner than liquor.

725
00:56:56.718 --> 00:56:58.928
Did you just figure that out now?

726
00:56:58.928 --> 00:57:01.257
Here. Have this.

727
00:57:08.632 --> 00:57:12.913
Mister Kim, thank you for
buying the pork belly today.

728
00:57:12.913 --> 00:57:15.145
Is that what's going on?
All right, I'll treat.

729
00:57:15.145 --> 00:57:17.058
Wow. Yeah!

730
00:57:17.058 --> 00:57:19.638
Yeah!

731
00:57:20.761 --> 00:57:22.850
He's not a normal applicant.

732
00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:25.020
Splitting his money in half.

733
00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.696
That's ridiculous humanism.

734
00:57:27.696 --> 00:57:30.239
This doesn't suit Gangsu Foods.

735
00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:34.870
If we try to keep a monopoly,
we will fall into ruin one of these days.

736
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:38.689
It's important to be
sensitive and ethical.

737
00:57:38.689 --> 00:57:41.339
I think it's a good mindset to have.

738
00:57:44.692 --> 00:57:49.093
Then since it is not unanimous...

739
00:57:49.093 --> 00:57:51.774
I will put him in the fail pile.

740
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:16.189
So, have the decisions been made?

741
00:58:16.189 --> 00:58:18.962
What happened to Hyuk?

742
00:58:32.426 --> 00:58:35.431
<i>He failed in the unanimous vote.</i>

743
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:49.047
So, I used my wild card.

744
00:58:49.047 --> 00:58:50.908
Wild card?

745
00:58:52.681 --> 00:58:54.739
Then that means...

746
00:58:55.683 --> 00:58:59.569
I don't think re-signing
your contract will work out.

747
00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:02.741
Did Byun Hyuk, that kid, pass?

748
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:06.154
That's how it worked out.
See you next time.

749
00:59:06.154 --> 00:59:07.868
Wait.

750
00:59:42.093 --> 00:59:45.522
Here it is, Father. I passed.

751
00:59:46.899 --> 00:59:50.440
Please directly hire the cleaning staff
just as you promised.

752
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.152
- Also...
- What now?

753
00:59:53.152 --> 00:59:56.419
Allow them to eat in the cafeteria.

754
01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:10.632
Shall we go?

755
01:00:51.176 --> 01:00:52.430
Hello.

756
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:57.366
I'm the Strategic Team intern, Byun Hyuk.

757
01:00:57.366 --> 01:00:59.823
Let's work well together.

758
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.018
Good morning.

759
01:01:10.018 --> 01:01:12.859
I'm Baek Joon,
who has been re-instated today.

760
01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:17.151
Let's work well together, Manager.

761
01:01:22.756 --> 01:01:24.785
Oh, that's great!

762
01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:27.962
You two really did it.

763
01:01:27.962 --> 01:01:30.957
I'm glad to see you back.

764
01:01:31.692 --> 01:01:34.823
It would've been good if you got
the internship too though.

765
01:01:34.823 --> 01:01:35.841
Yeah.

766
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:43.857
Hello. I'm Baek Joon.

767
01:01:44.602 --> 01:01:45.768
Please sit.

768
01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:52.705
Tell us your positive trait.

769
01:01:52.705 --> 01:01:56.535
Mine is that I have
many types of work experience.

770
01:01:56.535 --> 01:01:57.825
What kind of experience?

771
01:01:57.825 --> 01:02:02.584
I have paid my own tuition and
expenses since first year of college.

772
01:02:02.584 --> 01:02:05.433
I've had many part-time jobs.

773
01:02:05.433 --> 01:02:10.174
From tutoring students, being a
hotel maid, and a catering server...

774
01:02:10.174 --> 01:02:12.975
Tiling at construction sites,
designated driving

775
01:02:12.975 --> 01:02:15.776
doing sales at the mall,
and being a barista.

776
01:02:15.776 --> 01:02:18.672
I think I've had more experience
than most my age.

777
01:02:20.171 --> 01:02:23.332
Perhaps, you're not good at
sticking at one thing.

778
01:02:23.332 --> 01:02:28.511
I like to think I'm a multi-player
who can do many things at once.

779
01:02:29.471 --> 01:02:32.214
What's your motivation
for applying for Gangsu Foods?

780
01:02:33.399 --> 01:02:36.968
I had to prove that I wasn't a coward.

781
01:02:37.556 --> 01:02:40.430
Not to anyone else, but myself.

782
01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.507
You're a coward.

783
01:02:49.205 --> 01:02:51.435
I've done that now.

784
01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.643
Coming this far was enough.

785
01:02:53.643 --> 01:02:56.051
Do you have any last words
you want to say?

786
01:02:57.118 --> 01:02:59.207
Do not choose me.

787
01:03:02.384 --> 01:03:05.388
I will not be an intern here.

788
01:03:12.879 --> 01:03:14.716
Why are you being so stubborn?

789
01:03:14.716 --> 01:03:15.770
About what?

790
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.739
You got notice that you passed,
so why didn't you go into work?

791
01:03:18.739 --> 01:03:21.103
Why did you go back there?

792
01:03:21.788 --> 01:03:24.326
I told you that I think
full-time work is silly.

793
01:03:24.326 --> 01:03:27.147
And working as
a contract cleaner is okay?

794
01:03:27.147 --> 01:03:30.647
I'm different than the others.
I'm only a part-time contract worker.

795
01:03:30.647 --> 01:03:33.049
It's just about freedom. That's all...

796
01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:36.198
I can leave whenever I want.

797
01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.962
How sincere are you?

798
01:03:41.498 --> 01:03:43.897
- What do you mean?
- With Hyuk.

799
01:03:43.897 --> 01:03:47.303
I'm asking if you're interested in him
as more than a friend.

800
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.497
Why do I have to tell you that?

801
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.772
Because it bothers me.

802
01:03:57.837 --> 01:03:59.239
Why?

803
01:03:59.774 --> 01:04:02.009
Why would it bother you?

804
01:04:08.997 --> 01:04:11.984
Did you forget?
I'm in charge of looking after Hyuk.

805
01:04:11.984 --> 01:04:14.792
I should know what the people
around Hyuk are thinking.

806
01:04:14.792 --> 01:04:19.335
So, you need to know
my feelings on Hyuk too?

807
01:04:19.335 --> 01:04:20.951
Is that it?

808
01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.006
Answer me.

809
01:04:24.006 --> 01:04:27.484
Do you... like Hyuk?

810
01:04:27.484 --> 01:04:30.114
<i>Yes, I do like it.</i>

811
01:04:30.114 --> 01:04:33.294
Mix coffee, drip coffee,
espresso. I like it all.

812
01:04:33.294 --> 01:04:36.114
Oh, really? Then go make some.

813
01:04:36.114 --> 01:04:38.085
- Me?
- Yes, you.

814
01:04:38.085 --> 01:04:40.674
The intern should go.
Should I do it, then?

815
01:04:40.674 --> 01:04:42.596
Yes, I will.

816
01:05:04.178 --> 01:05:07.024
Here you go. Recharge yourself.

817
01:05:09.151 --> 01:05:11.540
- Oh, Byun Hyuk.
- Yes?

818
01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.160
This is one of the companies
we work with.

819
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.960
Get them to stamp this with their seal.

820
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.100
I should do it?

821
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.951
Yes, it's not hard at all.
Just get them to stamp it.

822
01:05:19.951 --> 01:05:23.460
Think of it as
your first job as the intern.

823
01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:24.750
You can do a good job, right?

824
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.910
Of course. I can do a good job.

825
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:29.308
Take a look here.

826
01:05:29.308 --> 01:05:33.218
Here, here, and here.

827
01:05:33.218 --> 01:05:35.415
Get them to stamp it
with their legal seal.

828
01:05:36.618 --> 01:05:39.292
- You know what that is, right?
- Yes.

829
01:05:42.027 --> 01:05:43.547
I'll succeed and return.

830
01:05:43.547 --> 01:05:47.113
So, the factory is
in Gyeonggi-do, Anseong?

831
01:05:47.113 --> 01:05:49.460
Get a car from the admin team.

832
01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.138
Yes, I will.

833
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.978
This is your first task?

834
01:05:59.978 --> 01:06:02.480
Yes, I just need them
to stamp their seal.

835
01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.089
Still, they gave this to an intern?

836
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:07.529
Yes, I just need to get it stamped.

837
01:06:07.529 --> 01:06:12.330
I just don't think this will be
easy to get resolved on your own.

838
01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:15.464
It's okay. I just
need to get it stamped.

839
01:06:16.728 --> 01:06:18.430
Why are you here anyway?

840
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.190
Could you possibly be
my designated driver?

841
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:22.390
A driver? Why?

842
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:26.174
My license is suspended
until the end of the month.

843
01:06:26.174 --> 01:06:27.745
Could you help me?

844
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.772
Answer me.

845
01:06:31.772 --> 01:06:35.062
Do you... like Hyuk?

846
01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:39.805
Okay. 50,000 won, deal?

847
01:06:39.805 --> 01:06:41.301
Deal.

848
01:07:00.569 --> 01:07:02.879
I think this is the right place.

849
01:07:03.892 --> 01:07:05.765
No one's here though.

850
01:07:10.535 --> 01:07:12.094
Joon.

851
01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:14.924
You shouldn't just go in there.

852
01:07:14.924 --> 01:07:16.560
Is anyone here?

853
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.839
Joon...

854
01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:19.725
Excuse me!

855
01:07:27.089 --> 01:07:28.611
Anyone here?

856
01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:31.036
Is no one here?

857
01:07:31.036 --> 01:07:32.245
Joon.

858
01:07:36.343 --> 01:07:37.596
It's open.

859
01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.453
Hello.

860
01:07:47.622 --> 01:07:50.902
Is it okay to just go in? Is this okay?

861
01:07:50.902 --> 01:07:52.794
Is no one here?

862
01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:07.319
What's wrong, Joon?

863
01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:28.480
