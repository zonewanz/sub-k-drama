1
00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.500
Get along well, and don't forget to eat.

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.699
Don't worry.

3
00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.529
- You don't have to come out. - Okay.

4
00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.539
- Goodbye. - Have fun.

5
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:40.359
Did you leave something?

6
00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.700
Yes, I'm so forgetful.

7
00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.270
Gosh, it's here.

8
00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.399
Where's Jin Jin?

9
00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.200
Is that all? Did you leave anything else behind?

10
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.539
No. Eat up.

11
00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.310
You should eat more. Have some kimchi too.

12
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.209
- I'm going. - All right. Bye.

13
00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.850
- Take care. - All right.

14
00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:16.259
Sa Jin Jin, let's eat together.

15
00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.199
(Message)

16
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.539
Let's have dinner together.

17
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.679
(Let's have dinner together.)

18
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.359
(Okay!)

(The eighth story: Stand by Me)

20
00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:50.859
(Episode 15)

21
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.940
- Good morning. - Hi.

22
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.720
Lawyer Jang.

23
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.090
Do you remember the 2 dollar 40 cent embezzlement case?

24
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.489
The bus driver who was fired because he couldn't...

25
00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.919
account for 2 dollars and 40 cents?

26
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.389
I want you to represent him in court.

27
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.630
What? Me? On my own?

28
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.400
Yes. It'll be your first court case.

29
00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.430
Thank you.

30
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.039
I'll do my best.

31
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.509
How should I structure his defense?

32
00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.049
He worked faithfully for 20 years,

33
00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.410
and it's a small amount.

34
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.150
Let's say it's wrong to punish him...

35
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.280
for mistaking an adult for a student.

36
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.949
Okay, I'll do that.

37
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.460
Will you be back at 1pm as usual?

38
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.190
- Yes. Go have lunch. - I will.

39
00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.370
What's all this?

40
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.370
I told you I'm going to lose weight.

41
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.139
You'll never stick to your plan.

42
00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.210
This time, I'll lose weight and become like Jin Jin.

43
00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.379
Mom, you know me.

44
00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:20.809
I gained a lot of weight after my last diet.

45
00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.479
I had a great figure when I first became a flight attendant.

46
00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.020
I may be shorter,

47
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.390
but if I lose weight, I have a ratio similar to Jin Jin's.

48
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.520
Don't you think, objectively speaking,

49
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.260
that I have a prettier face?

50
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.729
I guess, if Jin Jin scrunched up her face.

51
00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.100
I gave birth to you myself,

52
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.369
but what's wrong is wrong.

53
00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:40.369
Then what? Should I not lose weight?

54
00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:42.770
Gosh, do. Please do lose weight.

55
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.910
I beg of you. I have been for ages.

56
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.410
Lose weight, and move out.

57
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.179
- I need money. - What?

58
00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:56.379
- I want to move out. - What?

59
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.520
I gave you 500 dollars a month to save up for my wedding.

60
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.150
Give me the 50,000 dollars.

61
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.090
I think it's wrong for someone who's anti-marriage...

62
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.090
to live with her parents.

63
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.600
Anti-marriage, my foot.

64
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.129
I'll live independently and as a proud, single woman.

65
00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:13.530
I'll prove it to you.

66
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.340
I'm really sorry I won't be giving you a grandchild,

67
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.939
but I made up my mind.

68
00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.580
Don't stop me. You can't. I'll be independent.

69
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.580
Why would I stop you? I'd rather celebrate.

70
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.950
You can move out or move in with someone else.

71
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.049
It's up to you.

72
00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:32.720
I'd love to not have to clean up after you.

73
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.220
Really? Do you mean that?

74
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.720
But I can't give you any money. Figure your own way out.

75
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.789
- Why not? - Stop it.

76
00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.330
You love nothing more...

77
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.229
than to spend money, so I don't trust you.

78
00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.100
You've been working for 10 years now.

79
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.200
Don't tell me that 50,000 dollars is all you have saved up.

80
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.679
It's not.

81

(Hangeum-dong)

82
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.650
(Current balance)

83
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.289
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

84
00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.989
7. 7 digits.

85
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.869
Forget it. I'll move out. I'll move out.

86
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.770
How about it?

87
00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.640
She should go back to her true calling.

88
00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:26.910
We're looking for a good project.

89
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.210
"I Live Alone" is a great project.

90
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.450
- It's very popular these days. - The thing is,

91
00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.780
Jin Jin doesn't live alone.

92
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.179
She lives with her parents.

93
00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.590
She has a separate room above her parents' house.

94
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.850
We did all the necessary research.

95
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.119
That's true but...

96
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.760
I'll be honest for your show's sake.

97
00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:48.030
It'll be very boring.

98
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.030
She can't cook like Park Na Rae...

99
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.129
or enjoy the single life like Han Hye Jin.

100
00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.270
She's like a child who can't...

101
00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.499
do anything without her parents.

102
00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.739
Who cares about that?

103
00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:01.640
Her looks make up for it.

104
00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:24.129
I'll cook dinner. I'm not bad.

105
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.530
No. I should cook.

106
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.640
(Mr. Baek's recipes)

107
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.210
Let me see...

108
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:37.479
Okay.

109
00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:39.549
(What to cook for a boyfriend)

110
00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:33.970
I'm moving out. Do you want some noodles?

111
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.070
(Do you want some noodles?)

112
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.290
This is perfect.

113
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.590
The deposit is 30,000 dollars. You said you have 3,000.

114
00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:04.999
Oh, there's one more zero. No wonder.

115
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.869
Out of clothes, food, and shelter, shelter is the trendiest.

116
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.210
I need a nice place.

117
00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:20.050
2,000 dollars a month in rent?

118
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.050
I'll move in. You can rent my room.

119
00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:25.350
It's too expensive, right?

120
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.029
The best place to live alone would be...

121
00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:39.700
the Hongdae or Sangsu area.

122
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.970
Hongdae, the street of youth. Sounds good.

123
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.109
It's Sa Jin Jin. Hurry up.

124
00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:48.239
Come on.

125
00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:49.509
Hello?

126
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:53.649
I saw the apartment on the Tinkerbell application.

127
00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:56.249
The Hongdae one with a 3,000-dollar deposit and 380-dollar rent.

128
00:09:56.249 --> 00:09:58.220
I think someone wants it.

129
00:09:58.619 --> 00:10:01.249
- Already? - They disappear so quickly.

130
00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:04.119
You know apartments like that are hard to find.

131
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.489
Are you a student?

132
00:10:05.489 --> 00:10:08.859
Talk to your parents, and call me back as soon as possible.

133
00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:12.800
Okay.

134
00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:20.369
I don't believe this.

135
00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:25.279
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

136
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.710
Let's go upstairs.

137
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.749
- There's a loft? - I'm amazed.

138
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:37.119
- Tada. - You succeeded, Ah Reum.

139
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:40.330
- Cheers. - Cheers.

140
00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:44.100
I have Chinese bush clover wine.

141
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:48.700
My skin is so soft the day after I drink.

142
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.100
Let's drink to our smooth skin.

143
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.979
- To our new hangout. - Cheers.

144
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.989
Hi, I'm the person who just called.

145
00:11:10.989 --> 00:11:13.729
I'll wire you the deposit.

146
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.470
I'm not able to come over right now.

147
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.499
It's fine as long as it looks like the photos.

148
00:11:22.499 --> 00:11:23.670
Okay.

149
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.279
(Bombed Jung Woo Sung)

150
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.149
What are you doing?

151
00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:36.350
I can't play. I must work to feed myself.

152
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.149
Okay. Are you flying?

153
00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:39.790
You sound so ancient.

154
00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:42.590
- Where are you headed? - Busan.

155
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.930
Oh, Busan?

156
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.629
- A quick-turn again? - Yes.

157
00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:50.499
- What time do you return? - 8pm.

158
00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:52.100
8pm? Okay.

159
00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:55.639
What'll you do then? Eat dinner or go home?

160
00:11:56.869 --> 00:11:59.269
Woo Sung, are you bored?

161
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.109
No, not at all.

162
00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:05.450
You have social status as a doctor.

163
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.310
You couldn't be bored.

164
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.950
Eat some snacks if you are.

165
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.720
Ji Hye, there you are.

166
00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.790
Ah Reum. Ah Reum? Han Ah Reum.

167
00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:18.489
She hung up again.

168
00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:20.190
(OBGYN, Jung Woo Sung)

169
00:12:21.229 --> 00:12:24.100
Why does she always hang up on me?

170
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.869
(Make her curious.)

171
00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:34.009
What do you mean "make her curious"?

172
00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:35.639
Curious about what?

173
00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:42.119
No. This isn't right.

174
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.460
The tire is the problem. You need a new one.

175
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.800
Do I? Change it, then. How long will it take?

176
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.100
I'll need a while to find the model. Maybe by tomorrow morning?

177
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.399
Tomorrow?

178
00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:05.470
- Excuse me. - Sure.

179
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.139
Hey, I saw you pick chestnuts on "Hometown Report".

180
00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:11.680
I was going to call you.

181
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.409
Hey, I'm sorry to jump right to the point.

182
00:13:14.409 --> 00:13:16.119
But you were the only one I could think of.

183
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.090
What is it?

184
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.149
My dad got stung by a bee, and he needs to get to a hospital.

185
00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:23.359
But I have a pre-scheduled event.

186
00:13:23.859 --> 00:13:26.259
- Can you help me out? - Of course.

187
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:29.159
Where is it?

188
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.009
- Wow, a celebrity! - Wow, a celebrity!

189
00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:40.670
- Can we get an autograph? - Can we get an autograph?

190
00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.479
Do you know who I am?

191
00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:46.580
- Yes, you're Sa Jin Jin. - Yes, you're Sa Jin Jin.

192
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:49.820
- Wow, it's Sa Jin Jin. - Wow, it's Sa Jin Jin.

193
00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:54.690
Hey, kids. I have a quiz for you. Listen carefully.

194
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.220
Someone who's big...

195
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.529
or someone who can be responsible for their own life.

196
00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:01.830
What do you call an adult who's over 20 years old?

197
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.499
If you know, raise your hand.

198
00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:05.330
- Me. - You.

199
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.700
- A grown-up. - Bingo.

200
00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:11.340
Listen carefully. I'm 35, so I'm a grown-up.

201
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.570
You're all below the age of 10, so you're children.

202
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.810
Now, question two. Should a child call a grown-up by their name?

203
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.749
If you call me Sa Jin Jin, is that a good kid or a bad kid?

204
00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:22.720
- A bad kid. - A bad kid.

205
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.649
You're all very smart. Now, one more time.

206
00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:28.519
- Who am I again? - Ms. Sa.

207
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.859
You were all good kids. Give me those. I'll sign them.

208
00:14:33.489 --> 00:14:35.930
Are you married?

209
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.769
I heard you truly grow up after you get married. But you aren't.

210
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.970
- But she's 35 years old. - That's a pity.

211
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.509
I'm married. I'm on "We Got Married".

212
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:48.680
- What? - I'm married on "We Got Married".

213
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.379
- No way. - She's not married.

214
00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:52.249
Stop. What's your name?

215
00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:53.710
I'm Song Ji Wu.

216
00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:57.680
There has been a change in the fan signing event...

217
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.619
of the popular reporter, Wang Yong.

218
00:14:59.619 --> 00:15:01.560
Due to unforeseen circumstances, Wang Yong cannot be here.

219
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.619
Instead, an actor who recently played Oh Gwi Nam...

220
00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:06.989
in the popular drama "Two Husbands",

221
00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:09.229
a former member of the popular group Boys Be Ambitious,

222
00:15:09.229 --> 00:15:12.100
Anthony will be here for the fan signing event.

223
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.440
I hope you all receive him enthusiastically.

224
00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:19.810
Again, the fan signing event of the popular reporter Wang Yong...

225
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.210
- has been changed... - Hey, good kids.

226
00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:25.149
- due to unforeseen circumstances. - Where are your moms and aunts?

227
00:15:30.149 --> 00:15:31.920
I'm cutting off Chul Min.

228
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.119
What is it?

229
00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:36.889
He's on "We Got Married" with Sa Jin Jin. I hate the show and her.

230
00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:42.100
Ji Won, it's nothing to laugh at.

231
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.999
I remember telling him that she's a fox.

232
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.509
I knew it. He's been saying that she's pretty and stuff.

233
00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:55.310
Did he say she was pretty? Chul Min did?

234
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.279
Yes, that's nonsense.

235
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.109
- She is pretty though. - You're insane.

236
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.220
Both you and Chul Min have no eyes. You're both insane.

237
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.550
What's wrong with men?

238
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.560
It's because men can't lie.

239
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.060
Who says so? "We Got Married" is completely scripted.

240
00:16:15.729 --> 00:16:17.529
- Right? - Of course.

241
00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:20.729
They pretend to like and love each other.

242
00:16:21.739 --> 00:16:23.100
Isn't that repulsive?

243
00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:28.139
If it's all scripted, why do you hate that he's on it with Jin Jin?

244
00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:30.739
You're not making any sense.

245
00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:33.249
He's my brother.

246
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:37.420
I don't want to see him be all lovey-dovey with Jin Jin.

247
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.519
How am I not making any sense?

248
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.859
You're right.

249
00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:47.930
Oh, I thought you needed to buy something.

250
00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:51.729
Right, I almost forgot.

251
00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:54.499
- Let's eat quickly and go. - Okay.

252
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.040
We thank you for visiting Hanaggot Market...

253
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.149
every season of the year.

254
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:07.179
We want to pay you back for the love and support...

255
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.619
you have shown us for the last 10 years.

256
00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:10.980
We're holding a fan signing event...

257
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.050
with Anthony who played Oh Gwi Nam on "Two Husbands".

258
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.189
Hello, welcome. Yes, it's fine.

259
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.189
You'll get to see...

260
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:20.830
Oh Gwi Nam's broad shoulders...

261
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.800
- with your own eyes. - Anthony's doing a fan signing...

262
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.770
at Hanaggot Market in Hangeum-dong. There aren't many people here.

263
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.869
Candies, if you're nearby, come and see him right now.

264
00:17:29.869 --> 00:17:31.510
By Candy 1055.

265
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.010
Yes, come here.

266
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.379
Hello. Good for you!

267
00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:39.050
Yes, come around, everyone. Thank you.

268
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.250
I'm giving it to my dear Jeon Seol, so make it look pretty.

269
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.889
I'm his sunflower.

270
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.830
Make this one bigger. Make it look as fancy as possible.

271
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.240
That's a dracaena. If it flowers, good things will happen to you.

272
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.139
Is it also called "the lucky plant"?

273
00:18:08.139 --> 00:18:09.609
You know your plants.

274
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.580
The stem has grown. It looks like it'll bloom soon.

Excuse me, are you checking out right now?

277
00:18:31.629 --> 00:18:33.969
If not, get out of the way. I'm busy.

278
00:18:33.969 --> 00:18:35.699
- I'm sorry. - Hurry.

279
00:18:44.209 --> 00:18:46.050
I'm sorry, I'll pay for that.

280

(Anthony's Fan Signing Event)

281
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.659

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:07.730
Thank you for your support for Anthony and Hanaggot Market.

288
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.260
We thank you very much.

289
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.500
Thank you. Thank you. I love you. Thank you so much.

290
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.270
There are many men, but only one Oh Gwi Nam.

291
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:19.570
- Hold my hands. - Your one and only Anthony.

292
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.209
Oh, right.

293
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.409
We're holding an event right now. After you get his autograph,

you can come right in and purchase our products.

Thank you.

- Goodness. - Oh my gosh.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.320
- Everyone, be patient. - Hey.

You know me, right? I'm Candy 2437.

299

- Please wait one moment. - Give us a moment.

300
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.359
Anthony is so nice, isn't he?

301
00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:45.800

Bye.

306
00:21:01.449 --> 00:21:02.580
Anthony, look.

307
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.419
Goodness, you're adorable.

308
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.189
This is unbelievable, Anthony.

309
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.129
I'm Candy 913.

310
00:21:13.429 --> 00:21:14.490
- Candy 913. - Yes.

311
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.300
- It's hard to be within 1000. - I know.

312
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.369
I'm a huge fan of yours.

married another guy, but you're my only love.

"I love you, Anthony."

317

- Can you hold my hand too? - Of course.

318
00:21:38.219 --> 00:21:40.020
Oh, he just pooped. I should go.

319
00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:42.659
- I'll take that. - Thank you.

320
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.459
- See you. Bye. - Bye.

321
00:21:47.129 --> 00:21:48.429
- Hello. - Hello.

I'm Lee Jae Sook.

(Anthony)

324
00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:01.409
There's our superstar.

325
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:04.409
- Great job today. - Great job.

326
00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:07.949
You brought all the women to our market today.

327
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.250
Our sales went up by 50 percent.

328
00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:13.949
You're truly the fairy of TV ratings.

329
00:22:13.949 --> 00:22:16.590
- Oh, gosh. - I can't believe you're here today.

330
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.399
Oh, right. Ms. Sa Jin Jin came to shop for groceries during the day.

331
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.659
It's a great day for our market.

332
00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:25.469
Oh, Jin Jin was here?

333
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.969
Yes, she was.

334
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.270
She has such a tiny face.

335
00:22:29.439 --> 00:22:34.139
But her eyes, nose, and lips completely filled up that tiny face.

336
00:22:34.609 --> 00:22:36.810
- Anyway, thank you. - Sure.

337
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.250
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

338
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.149
(Wang Yong's Fan Signing)

339
00:22:56.929 --> 00:22:59.100
(To-do list)

340
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:01.969
Dad. Dad!

341
00:23:02.469 --> 00:23:03.540
All right.

342
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.510
Why would we need to take pictures at this age?

343
00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:08.879
Dad, can you take a picture of me with Mom?

344
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.709
What? All right.

345
00:23:12.209 --> 00:23:13.350
Come here.

346
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.320
Make sure the cathedral looks cool. Don't forget to include our legs.

347
00:23:17.179 --> 00:23:18.619
- Let's make a heart. - How?

348
00:23:18.619 --> 00:23:20.919
- Like this. - Like this?

349
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.159
Here.

350
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.129
Where is it?

351
00:23:28.129 --> 00:23:30.530
Mom, you look so pretty.

352
00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:32.669
Gosh, you look prettier.

353
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:34.869
My face doesn't even look like a face.

354
00:23:35.139 --> 00:23:38.000
- You're really pretty. - Where?

355
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.280
I'm so hungry.

356
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.250
Me too. I'm hungry.

357
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.810
What should we eat?

358
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.719
I heard that Nambu Market is famous for bean sprout soup.

359
00:23:51.719 --> 00:23:53.990
Bean sprout soup? It sounds nice.

360
00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.590
Gosh, we came so far. Why would we go to a market?

361
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.459
There are so many restaurants here.

362
00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:01.030
What do you want, Mom?

363
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.260
What kind of restaurants are there? It's Jeonju. There must be a lot.

364
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.369
Yes, there must be.

365
00:24:08.899 --> 00:24:11.340
(Good restaurants in Jeonju)

366
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.139
- Look. - Oh, my. There are so many.

367
00:24:14.139 --> 00:24:16.280
- There are so many here. - There's bibimbap too.

368
00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:28.389
I should get going first.

369
00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:31.530
All right. I'll leave after I finish this.

370
00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:35.560
- Good luck. - Thank you. See you tomorrow.

371
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.800
Goodbye.

372
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.109
The plaintiff has been working at this company diligently...

373
00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:54.350
and has never caused any problems with the...

374
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.949
With the...

375
00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.820
Has never caused any problems with the cargo rate.

376
00:25:02.189 --> 00:25:03.760
The unpaid charge of 2 dollars and 40 cents...

377
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.230
was caused because he mistook the price of four adults'...

378
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.530
bus fare for student's bus fare.

379
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.030
Do you think that his mistake...

380
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.399
caused such a severe social problem...

381
00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:15.699
that it was necessary to discontinue his employment?

382
00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:17.770
Your Honor. Your Honor.

383
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.469
Your Honor. Honorable...

384
00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:23.540
No, this is not it. Let's do it again.

385
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.010
Your Honor. Gosh.

386
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.679
Honorable...

387
00:25:29.949 --> 00:25:31.889
Lawyer Kang...

388
00:25:31.889 --> 00:25:33.320
I left some documents.

389
00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:38.590
I... I know this is a written statement...

390
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.859
and that it's not necessary.

391
00:25:39.859 --> 00:25:42.359
This is a civil case, so it might not be necessary.

392
00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:44.199
But maybe at the end,

393
00:25:44.199 --> 00:25:47.500
I might need to make a final statement.

394
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.010
So if I practiced, I thought it may be helpful. But maybe not...

395
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.409
Of course, it would be helpful.

396
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.980
I'll be back tomorrow afternoon after the trial in Suwon.

397
00:25:58.649 --> 00:25:59.850
I'm really leaving now.

398
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.750
All right. Goodbye.

399
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.330
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

400
00:26:19.699 --> 00:26:21.330
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

401
00:26:23.199 --> 00:26:24.500
I'm so embarrassed.

402
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.939
I fell flat on my face because of the turbulence.

403
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.740
I'm going to eat some tteokbokki. Prepare soju and beer for me.

404
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.050
Your Honor.

405
00:26:37.649 --> 00:26:42.560
(I'm going to eat some tteokbokki. Prepare soju and beer for me.)

406
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.459
I have some work left. I'll be there when I'm done.

407
00:26:45.459 --> 00:26:47.429
You should eat first with Ji Won.

408
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.399
(You should eat first with Ji Won.)

409
00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:50.760
Is that okay with you?

410
00:26:51.429 --> 00:26:52.969
He was your first love.

411
00:26:53.369 --> 00:26:55.939
The second place is coming. Prepare yourselves.

412

(Answer)

414
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.969
Yes?

415
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.359
- Who is it? - It's me.

416
00:27:50.689 --> 00:27:51.859
Hold on.

417
00:27:55.659 --> 00:27:57.359
Hello.

418
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.830
- Come in. - I have a present for you.

419
00:28:01.439 --> 00:28:02.800
You should give it to me inside.

420
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.770
Just come outside for a bit. It's too big to carry inside.

421
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.109
What is it?

422
