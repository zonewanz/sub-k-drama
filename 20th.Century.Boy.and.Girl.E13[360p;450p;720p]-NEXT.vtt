1
00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:24.508
Ji Won.

2
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.327
Your phone has been ringing inside your bag. 
I came here just in case.

3
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:48.665
I knew she'd be sleeping.

4
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.867
Did she attack you?

5
00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:52.569
You're not hurt, right?

6
00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:55.138
Of course not.

7
00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.808
Let's go. I'm cooking noodles.

8
00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.119
When do you think it began...

9
00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.190
to feel like I haven't seen you in ages?

10
00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:20.797
The feelings that I tried to hide 
cannot be kept a secret anymore.

11
00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:22.499
Goodnight.

12
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.869
It feels like the whole universe 
is filled with your warmth.

13
00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:30.807
You become curious about that person,

14
00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.578
and you want that person 
to stay next to you...

15
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.379
as your mind starts to grow.

16
00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:40.817
Hello, it's Jeong Ji Yeong
 from "Movie Tonight".

17
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.388
The fact that you want that 
person to be right next to you...

18
00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:49.159
doesn't necessarily mean 
that you're being greedy.

19
00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:53.430
As a character from an 
animation movie said,

20
00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.666
"We weren't together 
because we were in love."

21
00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.505
"We are together so that 
we can love each other more."

22
00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:05.909
(The seventh story: P.S. I Love You)

23
00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:16.620
(Episode 13)

24
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:47.717
I thought summer would never end,

25
00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:50.654
but the weather's cooling at last.

26
00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:52.589
I love the cool breeze.

27
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.725
That won't last for long.

28
00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.229
The things we like tend
 to think highly of themselves.

29
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:03.466
I still prefer the bright sunshine.

30
00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:07.237
The cold weather makes my bones ache.

31
00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:10.340
Only wine is good when aged.

32
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.309
I'm worth less than wine.

33
00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.079
Ms. Kim, there's something I'd always wanted to ask you.

34
00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.147
What is it?

35
00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:20.617
Do people believe you when you say you're Jin Jin's mom?

36
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.718
What?

37
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.388
Because you look more like her older sister.

38
00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:29.759
I should take the beef out to thaw.

39
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.629
- Why? - For breakfast tomorrow,

40
00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.664
I'll cook your favorite beef and radish soup.

41
00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:37.767
Great. Thank you very much.

42
00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:39.836
Are these for the living room?

43
00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:42.539
- Give them to me. - No, I'll take them.

44
00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.508
I can carry this much on my own.

45
00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.278
Wrap up so you don't catch a cold.

46
00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:51.114
I will. Thank you. Goodnight.

47
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.237
(The Four Bongos)

48
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:19.869
A shark got pinched by a lobster

49
00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:21.037
Sa Jin Jin.

50
00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:47.063
Sorry.

51
00:05:47.664 --> 00:05:50.367
I found this and got so excited...

52
00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:53.737
that I lost my mind and rushed up here.

53
00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:57.407
- Sorry, I'll leave. - Wait.

54
00:05:58.775 --> 00:05:59.976
Give me a moment.

55
00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:25.168
Where are my noodles?

56
00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:27.203
The water's boiling.

57
00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.639
You drank too much.

58
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.108
I'm allowed to drink on a day like this,

59
00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:34.077
you close-minded witch.

60
00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.647
- I got a job. - What?

61
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.150
Over in Yangjae-dong.

62
00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:43.486
The biggest building there.

63
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.687
As a security guard?

64
00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:47.357
They'll give me 1,300 dollars a month.

65
00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:49.359
You can keep it all.

66
00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:50.994
Thanks so much.

67
00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.763
You can stop looking down on me.

68
00:06:53.763 --> 00:06:55.765
When did I look down on you?

69
00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:58.067
Then why aren't you bringing me my noodles?

70
00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:00.069
I'll bring you 100 bowls.

71
00:07:00.537 --> 00:07:02.939
I like the sound of that.

72
00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:08.578
"I, Jang Young Shim, will now jaywalk whenever I want."

73
00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:10.280
"I don't care if people stop me."

74
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.348
"I'll ignore the lights and run like crazy."

75
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.685
"No to studying late in the library. We're going to sing."

76
00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:18.188
Young Shim was...

77
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.857
such a troublemaker in school.

78
00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:25.595
Just look who texted me right now.

79
00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:28.998
- She'll be at the playground in 10. - Okay.

80
00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:33.136
Were you preparing for a competition?

81
00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:34.737
What?

82
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.707
You sound like people trying to gain weight.

83
00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:39.209
Look, every single day.

84
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.278
Here, here, here.

85
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.013
You know the place.

86
00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:46.516
"Cheeky Snacks" across the footbridge.

87
00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:47.717
I know the place.

88
00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:53.756
Their tteokbokki, dumplings, and jjolmyeon were the best.

89
00:07:54.357 --> 00:07:56.626
I hated waking up, but I went to school...

90
00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:58.328
just to eat there.

91
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.598
The atmosphere was great.

92
00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:04.367
There was a huge Titanic poster.

93
00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:08.037
Right. Didn't you like DiCaprio before you liked my brother?

94
00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:10.340
They have nothing in common.

95
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.676
They both have soulful eyes and looked young for their age.

96
00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:14.878
Did they?

97
00:08:15.778 --> 00:08:18.648
Right. DiCaprio's new movie is out.

98
00:08:19.115 --> 00:08:21.317
- They said it's fun. - Is it?

99
00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:24.888
- Shall we watch it if you're free? - Sure.

100
00:08:27.323 --> 00:08:29.125
"Tteokbokki, dumplings, jjolmyeon, gimbab,"

101
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.527
"soondae, ramyeon, and pork cutlet."

102
00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:32.195
That's 1 meal for you 3?

103
00:08:32.195 --> 00:08:34.297
You were trying to bulk up.

104
00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:35.865
Yes.

105
00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:38.768
What? Did you take a break this day?

106
00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.703
We couldn't have. We skipped everything,

107
00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:42.839
but we never skipped eating tteokbokki.

108
00:08:44.908 --> 00:08:46.409
Girls, pray for me.

109
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:50.079
I want my sister, Ho Sung, to end up in a firepit.

110
00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:53.550
I never thought someone could be so cruel.

111
00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:56.119
I bet you'll get sick, Ho Sung.

112
00:08:57.253 --> 00:08:59.389
I'll curse you so you do.

113
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.958
I'll never forgive you.

114
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:08.798
- Did you wear her clothes again? - Yes.

115
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.366
You even wrote a will.

116
00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:12.969
Asking us to bury her alive with you.

117
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.205
Did I?

118
00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:19.208
Right. How is your sister doing?

119
00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.578
Does she still paint? Is she married?

120
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:28.284
You know...

121
00:09:29.218 --> 00:09:30.587
My sister...

122
00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:40.563
Ji Won.

123
00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:42.765
Do you know the kind of love...

124
00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:47.036
that can never end even when...

125
00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:49.639
one person ends it...

126
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.976
and announces their farewell?

127
00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:01.517
My parents searched every main street...

128
00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:04.487
and bus terminal to find my sister.

129
00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:09.559
They went on looking for years.

130
00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:13.596
Min Ho says he grew tall because he ate so much noodles.

131
00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:19.469
I became a celebrity because of my sister.

132
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:22.438
When Mr. Jang first came to see me,

133
00:10:22.438 --> 00:10:24.207
I said I didn't want to act.

134
00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:26.676
Me? No way.

135
00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:30.046
But Dad told me to have a go.

136
00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:32.749
Mom was against all the hard work,

137
00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:34.717
but Dad told me to do it.

138
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:35.985
I bet he thought...

139
00:10:35.985 --> 00:10:38.688
seeing me on TV would make her change her mind.

140
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.058
That it would make her come home.

141
00:10:44.027 --> 00:10:47.296
Mom and Dad still live with that burden.

142
00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:52.568
We don't know if she's dead or alive.

143
00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:56.339
Mom survives with the one belief that...

144
00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:57.874
no news is good news.

145
00:11:01.277 --> 00:11:03.646
Ho Sung was such a model student.

146
00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:06.349
That good girl...

147
00:11:07.316 --> 00:11:09.218
What is love?

148
00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:13.856
What is love? As you know, I don't know about such things.

149
00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.459
I'm not qualified to give an answer.

150
00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:20.663
What?

151
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.468
My engagement fell apart.

152
00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:31.074
A week before the wedding.

153
00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:40.349
Sorry.

154
00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:43.986
I said that to comfort you.

155
00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:50.927
The people we love all leave us.

156
00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:53.196
I hate that.

157
00:12:01.904 --> 00:12:04.373
Married life is like living with Hades.

158
00:12:04.707 --> 00:12:08.177
That's why I announced never to marry.

159
00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:09.779
Why all of a sudden?

160
00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:11.514
It's not sudden.

161
00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:13.883
- I thought about it... - And gave up?

162
00:12:13.883 --> 00:12:15.384
Or she's being silly.

163
00:12:15.384 --> 00:12:17.854
Wrong, wrong. You're both wrong.

164
00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:20.957
Ji Won. What do you think of me, objectively speaking?

165
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:23.326
- Aren't I capable? - Of course, you are.

166
00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.328
- Aren't I smart? - A genius.

167
00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.464
My looks and figure?

168
00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:33.736
- Very admirable. - See? See?

169
00:12:33.736 --> 00:12:37.173
I lack nothing, but it all means nothing once you marry.

170
00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:40.576
I'll use what few eggs I have left to produce a child,

171
00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:42.178
raise the wailing offspring,

172
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.913
ad cook a feast on every holiday.

173
00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:48.117
Then I'll fry jeon all day long, feeling empty. Instead of that,

174
00:12:48.384 --> 00:12:49.719
I choose not to get married.

175
00:12:50.887 --> 00:12:53.856
I'll keep a dog, travel the world,

176
00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.658
and use my credit card to my limit.

177
00:13:05.568 --> 00:13:06.969
Sounds great.

178
00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:08.638
Really?

179
00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:13.176
In that case, can you buy me a bag?

180
00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:16.279
- What? - Get me one. I don't have anything.

181
00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:20.817
You do have one. I thought you bought one last month in Hong Kong.

182
00:13:20.817 --> 00:13:22.218
That's a shoulder bag.

183
00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.188
You got another one two months ago with your bonus.

184
00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:28.558
That's a tote bag. I need something casual.

185
00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:30.726
Get me one. You're rich.

186
00:13:30.827 --> 00:13:32.228
All of a sudden?

187
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.897
- Get me one. Do you want one too? - What?

188
00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:38.868
Okay, get one for both me and Young Shim.

189
00:13:44.307 --> 00:13:47.343
She's this woman from church. She's a teacher,

190
00:13:47.443 --> 00:13:49.745
tall enough, and good-looking.

191
00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:53.549
I've been keeping my eyes on her to set her up with you.

192
00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:55.284
Do you want to meet her?

193
00:13:56.886 --> 00:13:58.154
No, thanks.

194
00:13:58.154 --> 00:14:00.089
Why not? You should.

195
00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:03.259
- I'm sorry. - You must have someone.

196
00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:06.629
- No. - I think you do.

197
00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:08.698
Who is it?

198
00:14:09.398 --> 00:14:10.533
No one.

199
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.576
This is good.

200
00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:23.946
Is it okay?

201
00:14:24.013 --> 00:14:25.147
It's awesome.

202
00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:30.620
- Mom, don't make your own son sad. - What's wrong?

203
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.488
After he came, you made different soup every single morning,

204
00:14:32.488 --> 00:14:34.757
made meat dishes, and started using all these plates.

205
00:14:35.057 --> 00:14:36.759
I thought I was at the Palace of Versailles.

206
00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:40.997
How do I look? Do I look like a French prince?

207
00:14:40.997 --> 00:14:41.998
Goodness.

208
00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:44.967
Oh, right. Make some time on Wednesday.

209
00:14:45.568 --> 00:14:46.569
Why?

210
00:14:46.569 --> 00:14:48.738
I want to go on a trip with you two.

211
00:14:48.738 --> 00:14:53.009
What kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into?

212
00:14:53.209 --> 00:14:54.777
I can already tell.

213
00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:56.345
Ji Won.

214
00:14:56.379 --> 00:14:58.848
He won a travel voucher at his part-time job.

215
00:14:58.848 --> 00:15:00.316
He said he'll take you two on a trip.

216
00:15:01.183 --> 00:15:02.818
My goodness.

217
00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:10.626
Don't you have any dried seaweed?

218
00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:12.495
We're completely out.

219
00:15:13.095 --> 00:15:15.197
- I'll get some later. - Dried seaweed.

220
00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:18.768
We have other side dishes.

221
00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:20.536
Dried seaweed!

222
00:15:22.138 --> 00:15:23.539
I'll buy some now.

223
00:15:24.106 --> 00:15:25.708
I'll go.

224
00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:27.843
No, I'll be quick. You can eat.

225
00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:29.979
No, I'll go.

226
00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:35.885
Look at what you've done.

227
00:15:36.786 --> 00:15:40.389
How can you serve seaweed soup to someone who's going out to work?

228
00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.867
- Goodness. - Look at her.

229
00:15:52.268 --> 00:15:53.636
Stop.

230
00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:55.338
She'll get fat.

231
00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:58.207
Mom.

232
00:15:58.574 --> 00:16:01.978
I'm halfway to 70 right now. Can you show me some respect?

233
00:16:02.745 --> 00:16:05.214
It's very cheap of you to do this with food.

234
00:16:05.348 --> 00:16:06.549
Right, Dad?

235
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.518
Of course. She has a very Asian face,

236
00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:12.288
so she won't be as pretty if she loses weight.

237
00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:15.958
- I'm still pretty, right? - Of course, you're my daughter.

238
00:16:16.525 --> 00:16:20.796
Goodness, look at you. The two Hans have teamed up.

239
00:16:21.998 --> 00:16:24.266
You weigh over 60kg, don't you?

240
00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:25.634
A bit.

241
00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:30.139
I've never weighed over 50kg over the course of my life.

242
00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:34.176
You aren't even married. How can you weigh over 60kg?

243
00:16:36.178 --> 00:16:37.813
I'm not eating this anymore.

244
00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:40.049
What's gotten into you? I'm glad.

245
00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:41.384
What's with you?

246
00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:43.319
I'm eating bread.

247
00:16:48.824 --> 00:16:50.359
I'm going to Busan for a seminar.

248
00:16:51.027 --> 00:16:52.795
Don't worry about it. You're always too concerned.

249
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:55.698
Yes, I love you too.

250
00:16:56.065 --> 00:16:58.167
Tell my other sisters I love them too.

251
00:16:58.868 --> 00:17:00.369
Oh, right, and to Seok.

252
00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:07.243
Ms. Han, Song Joong Ki just boarded onto the flight to Hong Kong.

253
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.378
They said he's not human. He's like a sculpture.

254
00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:10.780
Really? That's amazing.

255
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.549
And Jung Yun Ho will be on their night flight.

256
00:17:13.883 --> 00:17:16.318
Good for them. Tell them to treat us to dinner.

257
00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:18.387
Exactly. I envy them.

258
00:17:18.587 --> 00:17:20.389
I hope someone gets on our flight too.

259
00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:23.259
How about Kang Daniel? Ji Sung? Or Jo In Sung?

260
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:27.563
That's Jung Woo Sung.

261
00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:30.666
Where? Where's Jung Woo Sung?

262
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:32.134
Over there.

263
00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:49.018
Ah Reum!

264
00:17:50.686 --> 00:17:52.388
- Hello. - Why are you here?

265
00:17:52.955 --> 00:17:55.224
Are you on this flight today? That's amazing.

266
00:17:56.358 --> 00:17:57.693
You're here?

267
00:18:03.966 --> 00:18:05.267
Who's that?

268
00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:07.937
- Forget about it. - How can I?

269
00:18:08.037 --> 00:18:09.839
I saw the way you two looked at each other.

270
00:18:10.473 --> 00:18:12.808
I got you, Ms. Han.

271
00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:14.677
He was definitely...

272
00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:17.346
flirting.

273
00:18:17.446 --> 00:18:20.015
You! You're doing it again.

274
00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.794
Jin Jin. Sa Jin Jin.

275
00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:33.095
Yes, come in.

276
00:18:39.068 --> 00:18:42.238
- These are from Ms. Kim. - You can eat those. I'm busy.

277
00:18:51.013 --> 00:18:52.248
Eat it all.

278
00:18:52.948 --> 00:18:54.183
Okay.

279
00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:57.553
Make sure you chew well. Chew 10 times each.

280
00:18:58.053 --> 00:18:59.255
Okay.

281
00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:01.557
What's your plan today? Do you want to go watch...

282
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.858
I have to go to the press conference.

283
00:19:05.928 --> 00:19:07.062
What?

284
00:19:07.963 --> 00:19:09.198
What are you doing today again?

285
00:19:09.198 --> 00:19:10.766
The press conference for "We Got Married".

286
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:14.703
Make sure you do well.

287
00:19:15.004 --> 00:19:16.238
What did you say?

288
00:19:16.705 --> 00:19:18.807
I have meetings all day long.

289
00:19:19.108 --> 00:19:21.377
- Make sure you do well. - Okay.

290
00:19:41.897 --> 00:19:46.569
While you're seated, keep your seatbelts on for safety.

291
00:19:46.835 --> 00:19:49.738
If you have any questions, let our flight attendants know.

292
00:19:50.139 --> 00:19:53.275
And smoking is completely prohibited on flight.

293
00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:54.643
Thank you.

294
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.316
That pervert is making me so angry.

295
00:20:00.749 --> 00:20:01.917
The guy at 18D?

296
00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:14.296
Could you please keep the window open?

297
00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:20.636
Sir, do you need anything?

298
00:20:22.438 --> 00:20:23.772
Never mind.

299
00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:30.479
I have your newspaper.

300
00:20:33.249 --> 00:20:35.684
The same guy who always complains, right?

301
00:20:35.718 --> 00:20:37.186
He's infamous.

302
00:20:37.753 --> 00:20:40.889
He complained for our response time and for our facial expressions.

303
00:20:41.257 --> 00:20:43.559
Then he said we were only nice to the person next to him.

304
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:46.595
I wonder what he'll complain about today.

305
00:21:16.258 --> 00:21:17.826
(We Got Married)

306
00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:29.338
There are a lot of reporters here.

307
00:21:30.105 --> 00:21:31.106
Really?

308
00:21:32.508 --> 00:21:33.676
Did you take your medication?

309
00:21:34.109 --> 00:21:35.177
Sure.

310
00:21:35.244 --> 00:21:37.579
How can you not take it? I even got it for you.

311
00:21:37.646 --> 00:21:39.748
Should I even put it in your mouth then?

312
00:21:39.848 --> 00:21:41.517
All right.

313
00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:44.086
Take the medication. That's my wish.

314
00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:45.888
Sure, sure.

315
00:21:46.488 --> 00:21:47.823
You're impossible.

316
00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:55.497
Jin Jin, you need to get ready.

317
00:21:55.698 --> 00:21:57.566
- Okay. - Okay.

318
00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.474
Where's your ring?

319
00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:10.145
I don't remember where I put it. Do you have it?

320
00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:13.716
It's not like it has legs. I couldn't find it.

321
00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:17.019
Goodness.

322
00:22:18.887 --> 00:22:19.988
Okay, then.

323
00:22:20.989 --> 00:22:22.024
Hello, Jin Jin.

324
00:22:22.858 --> 00:22:25.494
Hello.

325
00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:28.497
Oh, my gosh.

326
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:32.935
Have you been well?

327
00:22:34.002 --> 00:22:35.337
Yes, very well.

328
00:22:36.805 --> 00:22:39.708
Could you excuse me? I left my pen in there.

329
00:22:39.908 --> 00:22:43.479
Your pen? I have a pen right here. Jin Jin!

330
00:22:56.258 --> 00:22:58.594
That's why she couldn't find it.

331

This fall,

334
00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:09.438
the popular program, "We Are Married",

335
00:23:09.438 --> 00:23:13.976
will return to the viewers with season five.

336
00:23:14.676 --> 00:23:18.547
Who do you think would be the couples...

337
00:23:18.547 --> 00:23:21.216
that will be in love with each other during this love-filled season?

338
00:23:21.216 --> 00:23:23.752
We will reveal...

339
00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:26.588
the hidden couples right now.

340
00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:29.124
Please give them a big hand.

They're entering one by one.

343
00:23:38.767 --> 00:23:39.968
Yes.

344
00:23:40.636 --> 00:23:41.703
I'm sure...

345
00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:45.374
you wouldn't have expected to see some of them here.

346
00:23:45.374 --> 00:23:47.443
We'll introduce them first.

347
00:23:47.443 --> 00:23:49.645
I'm sure you wouldn't have...

348
00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:53.015
expected to see this couple.

349
00:23:53.449 --> 00:23:57.186
This is Anthony from Boys Be Ambitious,

350
00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:58.687
one of the first boy bands in Korea.

351
00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:01.957
And this is Sa Jin Jin, the best actress in Korea.

352
00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:08.497
Please show us some affectionate poses.

353
00:24:08.497 --> 00:24:09.765
- Yes. - Right.

354
00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:11.934
They look adorable.

355
00:24:11.934 --> 00:24:13.902
Can you pose for us arm in arm?

356
00:24:14.336 --> 00:24:16.004
Yes.

357
00:24:17.406 --> 00:24:20.876
They're an enthusiastic couple.

358
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:23.912
I'm looking forward to watching...

359
00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:26.548
their episodes on the program.

362
00:24:51.673 --> 00:24:53.509
What are you looking at?

363
00:24:54.877 --> 00:24:57.880
- Why are you here? - I was just passing by.

364
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:01.016
Why did you come to work on a Sunday?

365
00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:03.519
It's because you don't have a girlfriend.

366
00:25:04.853 --> 00:25:07.456
- What about you then? - Ji Won.

367
00:25:07.456 --> 00:25:10.659
I just came back from a blind date.

368
00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:14.096
I had pasta and drank coffee with her.

369
00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:18.267
But she left after only an hour and 25 minutes.

370
00:25:21.737 --> 00:25:24.773
Gosh, I don't feel well. Do you want to go see a movie?

371
00:25:24.873 --> 00:25:27.342
More than four million people watched DiCaprio's new movie.

372
00:25:30.078 --> 00:25:31.547
I don't want to.

373
00:25:31.547 --> 00:25:34.783
I know. It's not your kind of movie.

374
00:25:35.918 --> 00:25:38.153
I'd have to watch in between couples by myself then.

375
00:25:39.087 --> 00:25:41.456
Let me see. When should I go there?

376
00:25:41.557 --> 00:25:43.458
- Do you want the tickets? - What?

377
00:25:45.394 --> 00:25:48.463
I have tickets for this evening. Wait a moment.

378
00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:50.832
Thank you.

380
00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:56.939
Where did you get it? It's an advance ticket...

381
00:25:59.107 --> 00:26:00.275
for two.

382
00:26:04.346 --> 00:26:06.448
Gosh, is this...

383
00:26:13.055 --> 00:26:16.758
Between your fellow actress Jung Da Young and your wife Ji Soo,

384
00:26:16.758 --> 00:26:18.226
who's closer to your ideal type?

385
00:26:20.295 --> 00:26:23.098
Well, this is a secret.

386
00:26:24.766 --> 00:26:28.236
I was just joking. Of course, it's Ji Soo.

387
00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:32.407
Don't you think Jung Da Young would get jealous because of this?

388
00:26:33.942 --> 00:26:36.244
I won't let her read the article.

389
00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:38.714
I want to ask you one more question.

390
00:26:38.714 --> 00:26:40.782
Did you perhaps exchange numbers...

391
00:26:40.782 --> 00:26:42.584
or meet privately?

392
00:26:43.619 --> 00:26:46.455
As we are married,

393
00:26:46.455 --> 00:26:49.725
we do meet privately and contact each other often.

394
00:26:51.927 --> 00:26:54.496
I want to ask something to the Anthony and Sa Jin Jin couple.

395
00:26:54.496 --> 00:26:58.133
Jin Jin, you revealed recently that you've never dated anyone before.

396
00:26:58.133 --> 00:26:59.968
But you got married first.

397
00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:02.638
There's no middle ground for me.

398
00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:07.376
They say living 10,000 days without dating anyone turns you into...

399
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:09.244
a dragon.

400
00:27:09.244 --> 00:27:11.947
I've been single for 12,000 days.

401
00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:15.917
I couldn't date someone nor become a dragon.

402
00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:20.422
Thank you for saving me from becoming a python.

403
00:27:21.089 --> 00:27:22.557
It's a great honor.

404
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:29.197
I'm Reporter Jung Yong Jin from "Datchpatch".

405
00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:32.634
I've heard that you have been a fan of Anthony for a long time.

406
00:27:32.634 --> 00:27:36.805
It's a well-known story that you debuted because of him.

407
00:27:36.805 --> 00:27:37.873
Yes.

408
00:27:38.306 --> 00:27:40.876
When I refused President Jang's offer,

409
00:27:40.876 --> 00:27:43.578
he suggested a special offer.

410
00:27:44.946 --> 00:27:48.917
He told me he'd let me take a photo with him. Just the two of us.

411
00:27:50.986 --> 00:27:52.688
How could I refuse that offer?

412
00:27:52.688 --> 00:27:56.758
I still have that photo in my room.

413
00:27:58.794 --> 00:28:00.896
Anthony, you must feel so happy...

414
00:28:00.896 --> 00:28:03.465
to have a fan like Jin Jin.

415
00:28:04.032 --> 00:28:06.835
You're ranked first on real-time search ranking.

416
00:28:07.202 --> 00:28:09.404
It's been a while since you've been on real-time search ranking, right?

417
00:28:09.638 --> 00:28:11.006
Yes, that's true.

418
00:28:11.673 --> 00:28:14.242
At this rate, I think you would have thought...

419
00:28:14.242 --> 00:28:15.677
at least once...

420
00:28:15.677 --> 00:28:18.346
that you should just get a free ride alongside her.

421
00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:20.348
What do you think?

422
00:28:41.837 --> 00:28:44.706
Yes, I have.

423
00:28:46.208 --> 00:28:47.609
I know well enough.

424
00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:50.078
Even if we're not really getting married,

425
00:28:50.078 --> 00:28:52.714
I know that I don't deserve to be Jin Jin's partner.

426
00:28:53.248 --> 00:28:55.517
Jin Jin is one of the most popular stars in Korea,

427
00:28:55.517 --> 00:28:56.918
but I...

428
00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:01.823
But you know how often I've been...

429
00:29:02.257 --> 00:29:04.259
given the role of a manager in morning dramas.

430
00:29:04.626 --> 00:29:07.162
I'm like Exo to older women.

431
00:29:10.966 --> 00:29:12.634
When I was first cast in this program,

432
00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:16.037
I was surprised that I was paired up with Jin Jin.

433
00:29:16.037 --> 00:29:18.807
And seeing as I couldn't sleep at all that night,

434
00:29:19.474 --> 00:29:21.109
I must have had...

435
00:29:21.777 --> 00:29:24.446
such an ambition.

436
00:29:24.946 --> 00:29:29.084
But after I met Jin Jin, I didn't think about that at all.

437
00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:31.119
I had no time to think about that.

438
00:29:31.987 --> 00:29:33.088
Why not?

439
00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:41.296
It's because I became her fan.
