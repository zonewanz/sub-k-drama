(Episode 5)

4
00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:25.682
Hello.

5
00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:27.452
Thank you.

6
00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:29.582
Hello.

7
00:00:30.182 --> 00:00:31.193
Thank you.

8
00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:33.052
Hello.

00:00:33.423 --> 00:00:34.423
Thank you.

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:35.622
Please, sit.

(Yeongpa Mayoral Candidates Debate)

12
00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:43.802
Hello.

13
00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:47.802
Who will be the new leader of Yeongpa?

14
00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.843
We have the three candidates here,

15
00:00:49.843 --> 00:00:50.912
to hear...

16
00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:53.573
their pledges and test their abilities.

17
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.743
First, we have...

18
00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:57.912
Kim Moon Sung with the United People's Party.

19
00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:05.822
Next, from the Future Party, Cho Gap Soo.

20
00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:12.132
The independent candidate Heo Jung Yup.

21
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.962
To start, we'll let you ask anything you'd like.

22
00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:18.632
First, I ask Mr. Cho.

23
00:01:19.132 --> 00:01:20.132
Where is...

24
00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:21.742
your wife?

25
00:01:23.373 --> 00:01:25.572
I'm flustered. The first question...

26
00:01:25.572 --> 00:01:27.313
is about my wife?

27
00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:28.513
Answer me.

28
00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:32.783
She's being a good supportive wife.

29
00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:35.183
She has never shown herself...

30
00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:37.522
during the entire campaigning period.

31
00:01:38.253 --> 00:01:39.552
There's talk about her...

32
00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:41.662
gambling and fleeing the country.

33
00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:44.662
Mr. Heo.

34
00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:48.033
Let's not touch each other's families.

35
00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.572
There is much talk about your view of womanhood.

36
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.972
There is nothing wrong with my view of womanhood.

37
00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:57.112
While we're on the topic,

38
00:01:57.772 --> 00:01:59.242
let me ask a question.

39
00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:01.382
(Yeongpa Mayoral Candidates Debate)

40
00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:04.183
Goodness. Let's go easy on each other.

41
00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.882
Injuries caused by contact with an external object,

42
00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:10.153
uterine hemorrhage,

43
00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:11.753
ruptured rectum.

44
00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:15.192
Do you know what this is?

45
00:02:17.563 --> 00:02:18.892
Please tell me.

46
00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:24.132
It's the medical record of the late Seo Jung Soon,

47
00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:27.972
who was sexually tortured by Mr. Cho 30 years ago...

48
00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:30.072
when he was a detective, and lived in pain...

49
00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:32.373
for 10 years until she committed suicide!

50
00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:42.683
(Cho Gap Soo)

51
00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:45.653
Let me ask you a question as well.

52
00:02:45.653 --> 00:02:49.593
You seem to have done your research on me.

53
00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:52.232
I guess you couldn't find anything,

54
00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:54.003
seeing how you...

55
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.933
are bringing up something from 30 years ago,

56
00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:00.602
something I was acquitted for, at that.

57
00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:02.572
You have nothing to be ashamed of?

58
00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:05.012
There's no reason to be ashamed.

59
00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:06.373
Fine.

60
00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:09.942
The victims who were sexually tortured...

61
00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:11.852
by Mr. Cho and their families...

62
00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:14.753
are here with us today!

63
00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:29.363
Imagine that they were.

64
00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:33.702
Would you be able to say that in front of them?

65
00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:42.982
Oh my gosh.

66
00:03:43.382 --> 00:03:44.553
What's that?

67
00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:47.852
(Cho Gap Soo)

68
00:03:52.192 --> 00:03:53.553
They're like...

69
00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:55.363
newborns...

70
00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:57.863
who can't control when and where they poop.

71
00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:00.863
Was this...

72
00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:03.232
Min Ji Sook's work?

73
00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.333
I'll look into it.

74
00:04:07.243 --> 00:04:08.343
Forget it.

75
00:04:09.873 --> 00:04:11.243
What about that prosecutor?

76
00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:13.472
I looked into her,

77
00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:15.083
and Ma Yi Deum...

78
00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:16.543
is Kwak Young Shil's daughter.

79
00:04:20.012 --> 00:04:21.022
What?

80
00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:27.522
Kwak Young Shil's daughter...

81
00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:31.532
became a prosecutor, is that it?

82
00:04:36.603 --> 00:04:38.832
How interesting.

83
00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:40.202
That isn't all.

84
00:04:40.743 --> 00:04:42.603
The male prosecutor in the department...

85
00:04:43.402 --> 00:04:44.543
is the son...

86
00:04:45.212 --> 00:04:46.212
of Ko Jae Sook.

87
00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:49.442
Ko Jae Sook?

88
00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:50.652
It disturbs me...

89
00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:53.512
that they're working with Min Ji Sook.

90
00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:02.522
There's no need.

91
00:05:03.663 --> 00:05:05.733
It depends on how you use them.

92
00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:09.733
Even a tiger is nothing but a kitty cat...

93
00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:11.902
if you declaw it.

94
00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:13.572
Also,

95
00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:15.373
Chairman Ahn...

96
00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:18.442
keeps asking about selling of Hyungjae Hotel.

97
00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:25.512
I have no one around me that helps.

98
00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:26.882
I'm surrounded...

99
00:05:27.782 --> 00:05:28.952
by those biting at me...

100
00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:31.723
or looking for a chance to bite me.

101
00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:35.123
He knows that the hotel...

102
00:05:35.123 --> 00:05:37.832
is the only connection I have.

103
00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:40.303
Isn't that right?

104
00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.132
Yes, sir.

105
00:05:42.902 --> 00:05:45.303
I'll figure out a way to cancel the sale.

106
00:05:48.842 --> 00:05:50.572
(Prosecutor, 5 years ago)

107
00:05:50.572 --> 00:05:51.572
So?

108
00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:54.512
What did your step-dad do to you, Ah Reum?

109
00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:00.322
He kissed me...

110
00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:03.223
and rubbed my face, but...

111
00:06:07.563 --> 00:06:09.423
He didn't just kiss you.

112
00:06:09.493 --> 00:06:10.632
Tell us more detail.

113
00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:20.173
Daddy kept taking off my clothes.

114
00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:24.813
He took off your clothes, and?

115
00:06:27.043 --> 00:06:28.082
Ah Reum.

116
00:06:28.712 --> 00:06:30.082
Daddy...

117
00:06:31.753 --> 00:06:33.652
pressed me down hard with his feet...

118
00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:35.952
so that I couldn't get up, and...

119
00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:41.092
And?

120
00:06:43.962 --> 00:06:46.163
What did he do after?

121
00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:47.933
Tell us.

122
00:06:56.342 --> 00:06:57.543
Where are you looking?

123
00:06:57.543 --> 00:06:58.973
You have to look here.

124
00:07:01.113 --> 00:07:03.853
Prosecution. Can she testify like this?

125
00:07:03.853 --> 00:07:05.012
Take her off the stand.

126
00:07:13.762 --> 00:07:14.762
Witness.

127
00:07:15.462 --> 00:07:17.532
What is your relationship with the victim?

128
00:07:19.563 --> 00:07:21.532
I'm Ah Reum's psychiatrist.

129
00:07:21.863 --> 00:07:23.303
At what age...

130
00:07:23.303 --> 00:07:26.332
do most children develop an interest in sex?

131
00:07:26.332 --> 00:07:28.173
What is it you want to ask?

132
00:07:28.173 --> 00:07:29.173
Isn't age 10...

133
00:07:29.603 --> 00:07:32.173
old enough to have an interest in sex?

134
00:07:32.442 --> 00:07:33.442
So...

135
00:07:33.882 --> 00:07:36.313
she could've had a sexual relationship voluntarily.

136
00:07:36.313 --> 00:07:38.983
I'm sorry for using foul language in court,

137
00:07:39.113 --> 00:07:41.123
but that's a load of garbage.

138
00:07:41.423 --> 00:07:42.423
Your Honor.

139
00:07:43.022 --> 00:07:46.053
Witness. Please choose your words wisely.

140
00:07:50.223 --> 00:07:51.332
Children...

141
00:07:52.063 --> 00:07:53.493
often confuse desire for affection...

142
00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:55.163
with sexual desire.

143
00:07:55.163 --> 00:07:56.632
What does that mean?

144
00:07:57.233 --> 00:07:59.233
Pushing a child who has strong attachment...

145
00:07:59.673 --> 00:08:01.043
into doing sexual activity...

146
00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:02.772
then complimenting her...

147
00:08:03.402 --> 00:08:06.913
will make her think that it's affection.

148
00:08:07.442 --> 00:08:09.043
Then how can you prove...

149
00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:12.582
such a child did it due to their attachment?

150
00:08:13.253 --> 00:08:16.082
Isn't that a personal opinion?

151
00:08:16.223 --> 00:08:18.322
Then should I tell you what's been proven?

152
00:08:19.522 --> 00:08:21.762
Ah Reum is only 10. You saw her, right?

153
00:08:21.892 --> 00:08:23.632
She's not even 130cm tall.

154
00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:26.332
She's physically and emotionally young.

155
00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:28.632
Her uterus was damaged from venereal infection.

156
00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:30.733
It might cause infertility.

157
00:08:30.733 --> 00:08:32.772
The sexual trauma will haunt her forever.

158
00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:35.743
Even an adult would have a hard time with this.

159
00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.512
She hasn't even hit puberty.

160
00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:43.652
Are you saying it's okay because she was curious...

161
00:08:44.853 --> 00:08:46.282
and that it was voluntary?

162
00:08:46.453 --> 00:08:49.983
You're being emotional and the claim is one-sided.

163
00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:52.593
Do you have any proof that the accused...

164
00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:57.193
intended on harming her physically and mentally?

165
00:09:01.032 --> 00:09:03.833
Case No. 2012GO328.

166
00:09:04.132 --> 00:09:06.902
This is the verdict for Choi Hyun Tae.

167
00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:09.542
The defendant does not have a criminal record,

168
00:09:09.902 --> 00:09:12.473
and he has a respected career.

169
00:09:13.272 --> 00:09:15.713
The only evidence is the victim's testimony.

170
00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:19.012
Taking that into mind, this is the verdict.

171
00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:23.792
Defendant is sentenced to five years in prison.

172
00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:45.373
You!

173
00:09:47.512 --> 00:09:49.542
Why didn't you use the DNA evidence?

174
00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:53.152
The clothing you gave me was soiled.

175
00:09:53.253 --> 00:09:54.723
We could not get it tested.

176
00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:57.392
It couldn't be used as an evidence.

177
00:09:57.953 --> 00:09:59.353
Then what about Ah Reum?

178
00:10:00.223 --> 00:10:02.323
You said she just has to show up at court.

179
00:10:03.493 --> 00:10:05.262
I had to persuade her to come.

180
00:10:06.032 --> 00:10:07.532
Why did you treat her like that?

181
00:10:07.532 --> 00:10:09.463
She should have talked properly.

182
00:10:09.762 --> 00:10:13.203
She was shaking. What can I do?

183
00:10:23.243 --> 00:10:24.652
I tried my best.

184
00:10:25.652 --> 00:10:28.522
To put it bluntly, he's a famous doctor.

185
00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:30.792
I hear his brother-in-law is a mayor.

186
00:10:31.892 --> 00:10:34.463
I think I did well by getting him five years.

187
00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:43.162
You don't know anything about the law.

188
00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:47.973
You can't win a case just with a temper.

189
00:10:53.912 --> 00:10:54.983
Doctor.

190
00:11:03.552 --> 00:11:04.723
What do we do?

191
00:11:06.552 --> 00:11:07.892
In five years,

192
00:11:08.422 --> 00:11:10.632
Ah Reum will only be in middle school.

193
00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:47.363
Ah Reum!

194
00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:57.343
Ah Reum.

195
00:11:57.743 --> 00:11:59.343
Ah Reum!

196
00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:37.312
Is this a haunted house?

197
00:12:50.022 --> 00:12:52.892
Okay, I'm ready for war.

198
00:13:03.272 --> 00:13:06.073
The number you called is not registered.

199
00:13:06.512 --> 00:13:07.943
Please check again...

200
00:13:07.943 --> 00:13:09.113
(Yoon Ah Reum)

201
00:13:12.953 --> 00:13:14.083
Good morning!

202
00:13:18.522 --> 00:13:21.422
You're looking well. Especially the lips.

203
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.123
I better look good if I don't want to be...

204
00:13:23.123 --> 00:13:25.363
seen as a wreck after the camera incident.

205
00:13:26.233 --> 00:13:27.262
Let's go.

206
00:13:42.743 --> 00:13:44.882
Hey, did you use my perfume?

207
00:13:45.552 --> 00:13:46.713
It suits me, right?

208
00:13:49.623 --> 00:13:52.022
I had the caviar in the fridge for a snack.

209
00:13:54.262 --> 00:13:55.493
You had that as a snack?

210
00:13:55.993 --> 00:13:58.593
It wasn't bad. It was a little bland.

211
00:13:59.193 --> 00:14:00.863
While we're on that,

212
00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:03.603
I think I'll keep on getting...

213
00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:05.302
the victim escorting service.

214
00:14:07.302 --> 00:14:09.073
The service expired.

215
00:14:09.343 --> 00:14:13.073
One can extend it if the victim asks.

216
00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:16.812
It can only be extended if necessity is proven.

217
00:14:17.483 --> 00:14:19.113
I'm having a hard time.

218
00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:22.682
I've become intimidated ever since the incident.

219
00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:23.693
So?

220
00:14:23.693 --> 00:14:26.522
I need to rest in a safe residence...

221
00:14:26.723 --> 00:14:28.392
until I can win a huge case.

222
00:14:28.392 --> 00:14:30.062
Once my pride is back up,

223
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:31.762
I'll be able to go back home.

224
00:14:31.762 --> 00:14:32.863
Please be understanding until then.

225
00:14:32.863 --> 00:14:34.432
I'm going to change my passcode.

226
00:14:34.432 --> 00:14:36.632
I need to rest in a stable residence too.

227
00:14:36.973 --> 00:14:38.733
Seriously.

228
00:14:57.353 --> 00:14:58.522
Ah Reum.

229
00:15:04.762 --> 00:15:06.093
What are you doing here?

230
00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:07.632
Doctor...

231
00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:18.542
(Witch's Court)

232
00:15:18.642 --> 00:15:20.312
A teenager turned herself in after stabbing...

233
00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:22.583
a man that used to be her adoptive father.

234
00:15:23.443 --> 00:15:26.412
Choi was released after a five-year sentence...

235
00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:28.682
for sexually assaulting Yoon. After the release,

236
00:15:28.682 --> 00:15:30.652
he came to harass Yoon and her mother.

237
00:15:30.753 --> 00:15:33.453
When she couldn't handle it, she stabbed him.

238
00:15:33.963 --> 00:15:37.093
Meanwhile, Choi was found to be a brother-in-law...

239
00:15:37.093 --> 00:15:39.963
of candidate Kim Moon Sung of United People's Party,

240
00:15:39.963 --> 00:15:41.333
causing a stir.

241
00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:43.873
Future Party's Cho Gap Soo...

242
00:15:43.873 --> 00:15:46.132
made a statement about it in today's briefing.

243
00:15:46.432 --> 00:15:50.103
I want to ask who deserves to criticize who.

244
00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:54.012
The mayor must put safety of citizens first.

245
00:15:54.713 --> 00:15:57.753
How can Mr. Kim have a criminal family?

246
00:15:59.012 --> 00:16:01.353
I cannot hide how shocked I am.

247
00:16:03.123 --> 00:16:06.323
He must be responsible for neglecting his family.

248
00:16:07.223 --> 00:16:08.493
He should step down.

249
00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:11.932
This morning, a teenager turned herself in...

250
00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:13.432
and shocked everyone.

251
00:16:13.493 --> 00:16:16.662
It turns out Yoon was sexually harassed...

252
00:16:16.662 --> 00:16:19.672
by Choi when she was young.

253
00:16:20.073 --> 00:16:22.802
When Choi was released after five years,

254
00:16:22.802 --> 00:16:24.743
he came to harass her every day...

255
00:16:31.253 --> 00:16:33.552
This is what happens when they give...

256
00:16:33.552 --> 00:16:35.223
a child molester just five years.

257
00:16:35.353 --> 00:16:36.483
Exactly.

258
00:16:36.652 --> 00:16:38.493
The adults are at fault,

259
00:16:38.493 --> 00:16:40.292
but the kid is the one getting the punishment.

260
00:16:40.522 --> 00:16:42.093
The internet is on fire.

261
00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:45.132
Most searched topic is "knifing teenager",

262
00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:46.932
and just below it is "raped teenager".

263
00:16:47.262 --> 00:16:49.932
- What happened? - All right.

264
00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:53.743
The rape case is already closed.

265
00:16:53.973 --> 00:16:55.172
What we have to do...

266
00:16:55.802 --> 00:16:57.743
is determine if it's attempted murder...

267
00:16:57.812 --> 00:16:59.642
or self-defense.

268
00:17:00.382 --> 00:17:02.613
- Did you get the record? - Yes.

269
00:17:02.713 --> 00:17:05.552
How should we go about it? Do you want go with Jang?

270
00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:08.723
Ms. Min, I'll take this case.

271
00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:11.592
You?

272
00:17:31.112 --> 00:17:32.413
Ah Reum...

273
00:17:33.443 --> 00:17:35.883
gets into a fit whenever I mention him.

274
00:17:37.383 --> 00:17:40.983
I don't want to do a court testimony.

275
00:17:47.423 --> 00:17:48.463
Ah Reum.

276
00:17:49.762 --> 00:17:51.292
You don't miss Dad, do you?

277
00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:57.032
How much do you not want to see him?

278
00:17:58.572 --> 00:17:59.933
For a long time.

279
00:18:00.473 --> 00:18:03.042
For a very long time...

280
00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:04.542
until I die.

281
00:18:10.312 --> 00:18:11.913
I think...

282
00:18:12.713 --> 00:18:14.153
you should go up...

283
00:18:14.723 --> 00:18:16.723
and tell everyone what he did.

284
00:18:16.753 --> 00:18:19.453
Then you won't have to see him for a long time.

285
00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.032
You won't be there alone.

286
00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:27.733
I'll be there, and so will Mom.

287
00:18:29.332 --> 00:18:31.003
It'll be fine.

288
00:18:31.673 --> 00:18:32.872
Just trust me.

289
00:18:43.012 --> 00:18:45.312
Are you the prosecutor?

290
00:18:48.522 --> 00:18:49.522
Yes.

291
00:18:49.723 --> 00:18:52.122
Did you take my case?

292
00:18:58.332 --> 00:19:00.062
He's the one that stabbed Mom.

293
00:19:02.463 --> 00:19:04.503
That's why I stabbed him.

294
00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:08.542
You...

295
00:19:09.703 --> 00:19:10.842
stabbed him?

296
00:19:11.372 --> 00:19:12.372
Yes.

297
00:19:21.022 --> 00:19:23.453
I know you didn't.

298
00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:26.223
No, I stabbed him.

299
00:19:26.723 --> 00:19:30.163
That's why you have to put him in jail.

300
00:19:30.163 --> 00:19:31.163
Ah Reum.

301
00:19:31.893 --> 00:19:34.062
I know your situation,

302
00:19:34.862 --> 00:19:37.473
and I know what Choi Hyun Tae is like.

303
00:19:38.673 --> 00:19:41.243
I know why you're doing this,

304
00:19:42.143 --> 00:19:43.772
so just trust me...

305
00:19:45.012 --> 00:19:46.542
and tell me the truth.

306
00:19:50.883 --> 00:19:52.852
You told me to trust you last time too.

307
00:20:05.193 --> 00:20:06.893
Will you trust me just one more time?

308
00:20:08.532 --> 00:20:10.372
I want to make up...

309
00:20:11.673 --> 00:20:13.473
for my mistakes last time.

310
00:20:28.253 --> 00:20:29.282
Mom!

311
00:20:35.122 --> 00:20:36.933
When I woke up,

312
00:20:38.233 --> 00:20:40.433
Mom was stabbing him.

313
00:20:40.963 --> 00:20:42.062
But...

314
00:20:42.233 --> 00:20:44.072
it's his fault she got her depression...

315
00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:45.532
and had to take tranquilizers.

316
00:20:45.532 --> 00:20:46.973
This is self-defense.

317
00:20:51.243 --> 00:20:53.042
Once he got out,

318
00:20:53.812 --> 00:20:54.842
Mom and I...

319
00:20:55.413 --> 00:20:57.812
had trouble just stepping outside.

320
00:20:59.082 --> 00:21:00.723
Whenever I went out, he somehow knew...

321
00:21:00.723 --> 00:21:02.423
and chased me around.

322
00:21:03.052 --> 00:21:04.753
He would call me and text me.

323
00:21:07.463 --> 00:21:08.822
If it wasn't for Mom,

324
00:21:10.693 --> 00:21:12.832
I would have killed him first.

325
00:21:19.372 --> 00:21:21.473
I told you the truth,

326
00:21:22.772 --> 00:21:25.143
so put him behind bars.

327
00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:28.683
You promised to help!

328
00:21:31.913 --> 00:21:33.352
Yeo can't do this.

329
00:21:34.923 --> 00:21:36.782
How can he investigate in that state?

330
00:21:37.022 --> 00:21:38.453
Feeling sorry has nothing to do...

331
00:21:38.453 --> 00:21:39.622
with work.

332
00:21:40.893 --> 00:21:42.663
Tell him to back you up.

333
00:21:42.663 --> 00:21:44.292
You should lead this.

334
00:21:45.092 --> 00:21:46.292
Keep it quiet...

335
00:21:46.292 --> 00:21:47.762
and be prudent.

336
00:21:47.762 --> 00:21:48.862
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:21:49.332 --> 00:21:51.772
I'll meet with Choi Hyun Tae first.

338
00:22:00.842 --> 00:22:02.012
What about Ah Reum?

339
00:22:03.612 --> 00:22:04.612
Pardon?

340
00:22:04.812 --> 00:22:07.723
Did Ah Reum go through interrogation?

341
00:22:08.983 --> 00:22:10.493
Why do you care?

342
00:22:12.852 --> 00:22:14.292
Please don't take me the wrong way.

343
00:22:14.362 --> 00:22:16.362
I'm just worried about her.

344
00:22:16.362 --> 00:22:17.362
So?

345
00:22:17.893 --> 00:22:19.993
If you were so worried about her,

346
00:22:19.993 --> 00:22:21.403
why did you go find them after your release...

347
00:22:21.403 --> 00:22:23.262
and stab her mother?

348
00:22:26.832 --> 00:22:27.842
I did.

349
00:22:30.072 --> 00:22:33.643
I won't deny that I went to see them right away.

350
00:22:43.052 --> 00:22:46.052
However, I went there with a good intention.

351
00:22:46.052 --> 00:22:48.193
I went to apologize to them.

352
00:22:50.493 --> 00:22:53.393
Honey, can we talk?

353
00:22:57.302 --> 00:22:58.633
Open the door.

354
00:22:58.633 --> 00:22:59.733
Choi Hyun Tae?

355
00:23:00.772 --> 00:23:03.643
I didn't go there to harm Ah Reum.

356
00:23:04.143 --> 00:23:05.772
No matter how many times I apologized,

357
00:23:06.572 --> 00:23:07.782
it didn't matter.

358
00:23:08.812 --> 00:23:11.352
I thought they would mistake me...

359
00:23:11.352 --> 00:23:13.622
if I went on further.

360
00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:15.582
I was about to quit.

361
00:23:15.983 --> 00:23:16.993
Then...

362
00:23:18.052 --> 00:23:19.522
I have something to talk to you about.

363
00:23:20.253 --> 00:23:22.062
Come home by 4pm tomorrow.

364
00:23:51.493 --> 00:23:53.622
She made me take sleeping pills.

365
00:23:53.622 --> 00:23:55.092
She was going to make me faint...

366
00:23:55.092 --> 00:23:56.693
so that she could kill me.

367
00:23:56.693 --> 00:23:58.393
She did it on purpose.

368
00:24:03.633 --> 00:24:06.433
Make a visit to her house.

369
00:24:07.042 --> 00:24:08.072
I'm sure...

370
00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:10.913
the mortar will still have traces of the pills.

371
00:24:11.973 --> 00:24:15.213
Then why did you stab her?

372
00:24:21.483 --> 00:24:22.483
No...

373
00:24:39.832 --> 00:24:41.003
Honey...

374
00:25:10.673 --> 00:25:12.633
It was Choi Hyun Tae's self-defense?

375
00:25:12.872 --> 00:25:13.872
Yes.

376
00:25:14.302 --> 00:25:16.572
Do you really believe his nonsense?

377
00:25:17.243 --> 00:25:20.812
Here. Yoon Jung Hee's fingerprints are on it.

378
00:25:22.512 --> 00:25:24.012
Here. It's a small amount,

379
00:25:24.012 --> 00:25:26.552
but we found components of sleeping pills in him.

380
00:25:27.022 --> 00:25:28.223
Lastly,

381
00:25:28.223 --> 00:25:30.753
this dish has traces of the spilling pills.

382
00:25:31.753 --> 00:25:34.163
Yoon Jung Hee attempted to murder.

383
00:25:34.163 --> 00:25:35.693
It was Choi Hyun Tae's self-defense.

384
00:25:35.693 --> 00:25:36.762
No!

385
00:25:37.562 --> 00:25:38.893
No.

386
00:25:38.893 --> 00:25:41.332
He knows that Jung Hee is in a coma.

387
00:25:41.332 --> 00:25:43.163
He's lying in a way that's advantageous for him.

388
00:25:43.163 --> 00:25:45.973
I don't trust everything that he's saying!

389
00:25:45.973 --> 00:25:47.243
But what can I do?

390
00:25:47.243 --> 00:25:48.542
All evidence and circumstances...

391
00:25:48.542 --> 00:25:50.743
point to Yoon Jung Hee trying to murder.

392
00:25:52.512 --> 00:25:53.743
Are you crazy?

393
00:25:54.342 --> 00:25:55.683
Hold it.

394
00:26:00.723 --> 00:26:03.522
I'm Yoon and you're Choi.

395
00:26:03.522 --> 00:26:05.022
Like Ah Reum said,

396
00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:07.292
if Yoon was already attacked,

397
00:26:09.463 --> 00:26:12.133
Choi couldn't have gotten stabbed...

398
00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:13.762
while he was standing.

399
00:26:23.403 --> 00:26:24.913
She would stab him around here.

400
00:26:25.743 --> 00:26:27.042
But Choi...

401
00:26:27.582 --> 00:26:29.183
has a cut on his left...

402
00:26:29.183 --> 00:26:31.112
that went straight in.

403
00:26:31.512 --> 00:26:32.913
This is how it must have went.

404
00:26:33.153 --> 00:26:34.383
Take a seat.

405
00:26:37.622 --> 00:26:38.622
Here.

406
00:26:40.393 --> 00:26:41.963
If I'm Choi...

407
00:26:42.463 --> 00:26:43.493
Wait.

408
00:26:44.993 --> 00:26:46.733
It must have been like this.

409
00:26:58.913 --> 00:27:00.643
Because he wants to frame Yoon...

410
00:27:00.643 --> 00:27:01.943
as an attempted murderer,

411
00:27:01.943 --> 00:27:04.552
he forged the cut on himself.

412
00:27:04.552 --> 00:27:05.983
That would make more sense.

413
00:27:06.983 --> 00:27:08.453
Anyway, let go of my hand.

414
00:27:08.453 --> 00:27:10.223
It's scaring me.

415
00:27:10.223 --> 00:27:11.223
I'm sorry.

416
00:27:12.453 --> 00:27:15.463
Anyway, it's possible Choi attempted murder.

417
00:27:15.663 --> 00:27:16.762
I don't think so.

418
00:27:16.762 --> 00:27:17.862
Ms. Ma.

419
00:27:18.493 --> 00:27:20.933
That's Ah Reum's opinion.

420
00:27:20.933 --> 00:27:22.203
She could be lying...

421
00:27:22.203 --> 00:27:23.673
to protect her mom.

422
00:27:23.673 --> 00:27:26.433
Didn't I explain enough?

423
00:27:26.673 --> 00:27:29.272
I heard everything when you interrogated her.

424
00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:32.213
Ah Reum asked you to get Choi in jail.

425
00:27:33.713 --> 00:27:35.312
Are you saying...

426
00:27:35.812 --> 00:27:37.812
I don't have credibility?

427
00:27:41.622 --> 00:27:42.683
Fine.

428
00:27:42.883 --> 00:27:44.653
If I get Yoon's testimony,

429
00:27:44.653 --> 00:27:45.923
will you admit to it?

430
00:27:47.122 --> 00:27:48.393
How?

431
00:27:48.393 --> 00:27:50.433
She's still in a coma.

432
00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:51.493
I'll be back.

433
00:27:51.693 --> 00:27:53.433
Gosh.

434
00:28:05.457 --> 00:28:08.689
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E05 Witch's Court "The Case of Yoon Ah Reum"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

435
00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:20.762
I'm sorry, but she needs peace and quiet.

436
00:28:21.663 --> 00:28:24.493
Please turn off the flash.

437
00:28:25.663 --> 00:28:26.862
I apologize.

438
00:28:40.312 --> 00:28:43.713
My wife developed a rare disease...

439
00:28:44.512 --> 00:28:47.383
and fell into a coma 15 years ago already.

440
00:28:48.223 --> 00:28:51.322
There have been all sorts of rumors,

441
00:28:51.322 --> 00:28:52.893
that she's in hiding,

442
00:28:53.193 --> 00:28:55.562
or that she was gambling.

443
00:28:59.092 --> 00:29:00.302
But I...

444
00:29:03.463 --> 00:29:05.203
have been...

445
00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:09.542
waiting for her to wake up again.

446
00:29:17.653 --> 00:29:18.883
My wife...

447
00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:23.552
Because...

448
00:29:24.953 --> 00:29:27.022
I believe that my dear Suh Rim...

449
00:29:28.923 --> 00:29:31.493
will open her eyes again...

450
00:29:33.933 --> 00:29:36.562
and smile for me as she used to.

451
00:29:42.572 --> 00:29:45.342
Okay. We'll end the interviews here.

452
00:29:45.542 --> 00:29:48.582
She needs her rest, so please leave.

453
00:29:53.153 --> 00:29:54.253
Thank you.

454
00:29:55.352 --> 00:29:56.582
Thank you.

455
00:30:10.102 --> 00:30:11.372
Call Mr. Bae...

456
00:30:12.802 --> 00:30:15.003
and tell him...

457
00:30:16.243 --> 00:30:17.913
to move her.

458
00:30:19.042 --> 00:30:21.713
Isn't it better for her to be in the media more?

459
00:30:21.913 --> 00:30:23.512
Once is enough for a show!

460
00:30:25.112 --> 00:30:26.753
It gets boring the second time.

461
00:30:33.393 --> 00:30:35.463
I won't be able to come for a while.

462
00:30:36.122 --> 00:30:38.993
Don't wake up. Just...

463
00:30:39.862 --> 00:30:41.203
keep sleeping.

464
00:30:44.032 --> 00:30:45.302
That is how...

465
00:30:46.503 --> 00:30:48.302
you can help me.

466
00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:15.562
Doctor.

467
00:31:16.463 --> 00:31:19.332
When do you think she'll recover?

468
00:31:19.802 --> 00:31:22.643
It's too difficult to say.

469
00:31:25.872 --> 00:31:28.183
Even if she lost blood and suffered liver damage,

470
00:31:28.743 --> 00:31:30.082
shouldn't she...

471
00:31:30.582 --> 00:31:32.953
regain consciousness after a day or two?

472
00:31:33.213 --> 00:31:35.923
I think it's taking longer because she took...

473
00:31:36.022 --> 00:31:37.792
sleeping pills regularly.

474
00:31:37.993 --> 00:31:41.092
Excuse me. Did you say sleeping pills?

475
00:31:41.592 --> 00:31:43.092
Not anti-anxiety pills?

476
00:31:43.733 --> 00:31:44.792
No.

477
00:31:45.463 --> 00:31:47.832
Come here. It's Daddy.

478
00:31:48.433 --> 00:31:50.832
Why do you keep trying to avoid me?

479
00:31:51.602 --> 00:31:54.272
Stay still. Daddy needs to talk to you.

480
00:31:55.272 --> 00:31:57.842
No. Get away from me!

481
00:31:57.842 --> 00:31:59.042
Ah Reum!

482
00:32:00.443 --> 00:32:03.953
If you keep doing that, Daddy will punish you.

483
00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:07.883
Just like back then.

484
00:32:57.572 --> 00:32:58.802
My leg.

485
00:33:00.372 --> 00:33:02.903
Why are you here? What are you here to do?

486
00:33:05.072 --> 00:33:06.473
What are you doing?

487
00:33:09.213 --> 00:33:11.653
How are you in the same hospital as Yoon Jung Hee?

488
00:33:11.782 --> 00:33:13.723
Move to another hospital. Got it?

489
00:33:13.753 --> 00:33:14.923
Look here!

490
00:33:15.423 --> 00:33:17.052
He's the victim.

491
00:33:17.052 --> 00:33:19.493
He wants to stay here at this hospital.

492
00:33:20.193 --> 00:33:21.362
Is there a problem?

493
00:33:21.562 --> 00:33:23.292
- What? - Seriously.

494
00:33:27.203 --> 00:33:29.503
Stop it already, doctor.

495
00:33:29.762 --> 00:33:32.503
That's right. You're a prosecutor now.

496
00:33:33.473 --> 00:33:36.602
You were like this five years ago, and still...

497
00:33:36.842 --> 00:33:38.943
Why are you so adamant...

498
00:33:38.943 --> 00:33:41.883
on splitting up Ah Reum and me?

499
00:33:43.883 --> 00:33:44.883
What?

500
00:33:45.183 --> 00:33:46.913
Ah Reum's mom...

501
00:33:51.653 --> 00:33:53.993
may go to jail now.

502
00:33:54.463 --> 00:33:57.233
Then whom will poor Ah Reum...

503
00:33:57.592 --> 00:34:00.463
rely on in this world?

504
00:34:00.903 --> 00:34:01.933
Whom?

505
00:34:02.302 --> 00:34:03.733
You crazy scumbag.

506
00:34:05.703 --> 00:34:07.572
Say that again.

507
00:34:07.973 --> 00:34:09.573
- Say that again! - Mr. Yeo!

508
00:34:09.872 --> 00:34:12.772
- Say that again! - Stop it!

509
00:34:15.383 --> 00:34:16.542
Help!

510
00:34:18.253 --> 00:34:20.582
Please help! Help!

511
00:34:23.222 --> 00:34:24.222
Let go!

512
00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:29.693
I failed five years ago,

513
00:34:30.093 --> 00:34:31.633
but not this time.

514
00:34:35.263 --> 00:34:39.503
A prosecutor was filmed assaulting a witness.

515
00:34:40.003 --> 00:34:42.503
Around 4pm this afternoon, the prosecutor...

516
00:34:42.503 --> 00:34:45.142
investigating the stabbing incident...

517
00:34:45.372 --> 00:34:48.042
went to see the witness...

518
00:34:48.142 --> 00:34:51.483
and punched him in front of the security camera.

519
00:34:52.013 --> 00:34:55.182
How are we supposed to trust prosecutors?

520
00:34:56.483 --> 00:34:59.423
The prosecutor in question must be punished severely,

521
00:35:00.292 --> 00:35:03.093
and the investigations must be stopped...

522
00:35:03.562 --> 00:35:04.792
right away!

523
00:35:05.432 --> 00:35:07.662
A fair investigation must be conducted...

524
00:35:08.303 --> 00:35:11.303
and the true perpetrator be found...

525
00:35:17.642 --> 00:35:20.513
How are the ratings?

526
00:35:21.713 --> 00:35:22.812
It hasn't changed.

527
00:35:23.383 --> 00:35:25.883
Kim's ratings won't go down.

528
00:35:29.383 --> 00:35:31.622
Even with all that nonsense,

529
00:35:32.693 --> 00:35:36.263
it won't budge, is that it?

530
00:35:41.463 --> 00:35:42.503
Sir.

531
00:35:47.073 --> 00:35:48.573
- Hello? - Hey!

532
00:35:48.843 --> 00:35:50.673
Gap Soo!

533
00:35:50.912 --> 00:35:53.272
What are you doing?

534
00:35:53.783 --> 00:35:56.283
I know you put on a show with Suh Rim.

535
00:35:58.153 --> 00:35:59.283
Look.

536
00:35:59.713 --> 00:36:02.483
Other wives even go to bathhouses...

537
00:36:02.783 --> 00:36:04.253
during elections...

538
00:36:05.153 --> 00:36:07.963
and scrub people's backs.

539
00:36:09.722 --> 00:36:11.832
What's a few photos?

540
00:36:11.832 --> 00:36:15.162
Is that why you won't sell the hotel? To buy votes?

541
00:36:17.602 --> 00:36:20.772
I'll make a profit and share it with you.

542
00:36:22.003 --> 00:36:24.242
- Please stop. - Hey, you. Gap Soo.

543
00:36:24.673 --> 00:36:28.412
Did you forget who got you to where you are?

544
00:36:29.483 --> 00:36:30.582
Look!

545
00:36:30.812 --> 00:36:33.283
That White Town you're building right now.

546
00:36:34.122 --> 00:36:37.352
Will you build it in Seoul instead of Yeongpa?

547
00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:43.733
Think hard about from whom you will benefit from...

548
00:36:45.033 --> 00:36:46.792
going forward.

549
00:36:55.242 --> 00:36:57.343
What about Kim's brother-in-law?

550
00:36:59.812 --> 00:37:00.883
Is it ready?

551
00:37:01.542 --> 00:37:03.443
Yes, sir. I'm in contact.

552
00:37:05.812 --> 00:37:07.522
Set up a meeting.

553
00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:12.193
Let me see his son as well.

554
00:37:12.392 --> 00:37:13.452
Yes, sir.

555
00:37:19.263 --> 00:37:21.062
What did he say? Do you have to resign?

556
00:37:21.533 --> 00:37:22.562
Or probation?

557
00:37:23.872 --> 00:37:26.303
This should give you three months easy.

558
00:37:27.303 --> 00:37:29.803
Why don't you open a lawyer's office?

559
00:37:29.803 --> 00:37:32.242
You look like you'd be a natural.

560
00:37:34.443 --> 00:37:35.713
Do you not like lawyers?

561
00:37:36.142 --> 00:37:38.312
- You're a good fighter... - Ms. Ma.

562
00:37:38.312 --> 00:37:40.622
- I was going to stop. - Please help.

563
00:37:42.222 --> 00:37:43.483
Please help me.

564
00:37:57.073 --> 00:38:01.343
(Prosecutor Assaults Witness)

565
00:38:15.653 --> 00:38:16.653
Let's go.

566
00:39:28.662 --> 00:39:30.562
Stay here until your mom wakes up.

567
00:39:31.263 --> 00:39:33.662
And if anything happens,

568
00:39:35.033 --> 00:39:36.233
press this.

569
00:39:38.472 --> 00:39:39.772
What if...

570
00:39:40.903 --> 00:39:42.602
something happens to Mom?

571
00:39:43.872 --> 00:39:45.472
She'll wake up soon.

572
00:39:46.073 --> 00:39:47.642
Hang in there until then.

573
00:39:48.642 --> 00:39:49.642
Okay?

574
00:40:16.403 --> 00:40:18.343
- I'll see you next time. - Thank you.

575
00:40:24.852 --> 00:40:26.553
You're Jin Wook's friend, correct?

576
00:40:27.553 --> 00:40:29.082
I'm his mom.

577
00:40:29.082 --> 00:40:30.452
I'm Ko Jae Sook.

578
00:40:30.553 --> 00:40:31.852
It's nice to meet you.

579
00:40:32.653 --> 00:40:33.923
I'm Ma Yi Deum.

580
00:40:35.693 --> 00:40:36.693
Ma Yi Deum?

581
00:40:36.693 --> 00:40:38.792
Yes, that's right.

582
00:40:43.772 --> 00:40:45.533
Doctor. Doctor!

583
00:40:46.073 --> 00:40:47.742
I have to see my Yi Deum.

584
00:40:47.742 --> 00:40:50.242
I'm not crazy? I mean it!

585
00:40:50.613 --> 00:40:52.343
You know that too.

586
00:40:52.812 --> 00:40:55.812
I'm all my dear Yi Deum has!

587
00:40:56.042 --> 00:40:57.553
Doctor!

588
00:40:58.182 --> 00:40:59.253
It's unique, right?

589
00:40:59.253 --> 00:41:01.323
I'm probably the only person with the name...

590
00:41:01.323 --> 00:41:02.582
Yi Deum.

591
00:41:03.722 --> 00:41:04.753
Really?

592
00:41:05.392 --> 00:41:07.323
- I think I've heard... - Mom.

593
00:41:09.522 --> 00:41:10.633
Are you okay?

594
00:41:12.162 --> 00:41:14.062
Yes, I'm fine.

595
00:41:14.062 --> 00:41:16.403
Take good care of Ah Reum.

596
00:41:16.932 --> 00:41:18.403
Take care of yourself too.

597
00:41:18.403 --> 00:41:19.832
You're worrying me.

598
00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:21.303
Don't worry.

599
00:41:21.303 --> 00:41:23.142
You take care of your own health.

600
00:41:25.412 --> 00:41:26.613
Be careful, okay?

601
00:41:26.613 --> 00:41:27.613
Okay.

602
00:41:29.343 --> 00:41:30.352
What are you doing?

603
00:41:30.713 --> 00:41:31.852
You said you'd help.

604
00:41:32.452 --> 00:41:33.483
Let's go.

605
00:41:36.122 --> 00:41:37.222
- Careful. - Okay.

606
00:41:44.432 --> 00:41:45.492
See that?

607
00:41:45.832 --> 00:41:47.403
You have to be careful.

608
00:41:48.363 --> 00:41:50.332
It's true with other cases as well, but...

609
00:41:51.573 --> 00:41:52.673
when it involves children,

610
00:41:52.673 --> 00:41:54.742
you have to be extra careful.

611
00:41:54.742 --> 00:41:56.573
I think so too.

612
00:41:56.573 --> 00:41:57.673
Well...

613
00:41:57.772 --> 00:41:58.772
What?

614
00:41:58.943 --> 00:42:00.812
It's a child molestation case.

615
00:42:03.783 --> 00:42:04.952
What's it about?

616
00:42:05.082 --> 00:42:06.952
An apartment security guard...

617
00:42:07.122 --> 00:42:08.222
sexually molested...

618
00:42:08.222 --> 00:42:10.423
a five-year-old in the building.

619
00:42:10.722 --> 00:42:12.852
The victim's aunt reported him.

620
00:42:12.852 --> 00:42:15.222
I'll take this case.

621
00:42:16.093 --> 00:42:17.093
You will?

622
00:42:17.093 --> 00:42:19.463
I get along with children very well.

623
00:42:19.733 --> 00:42:21.562
I can get them to testify.

624
00:42:22.003 --> 00:42:25.332
Young Woong, why did you go to the guard's home?

625
00:42:25.932 --> 00:42:27.943
I peed in my pants,

626
00:42:27.943 --> 00:42:29.872
so my pants were wet.

627
00:42:29.872 --> 00:42:32.673
I see. And then?

628
00:42:33.042 --> 00:42:35.742
I went into his home,

629
00:42:35.943 --> 00:42:38.513
and he told me to take my clothes off.

630
00:42:38.883 --> 00:42:41.153
I said I didn't want to,

631
00:42:41.222 --> 00:42:44.722
but he took the clothes off of me.

632
00:42:46.253 --> 00:42:48.093
What did he do to you...

633
00:42:48.093 --> 00:42:49.763
after he took your clothes off?

634
00:42:49.763 --> 00:42:51.763
And then...

635
00:42:53.602 --> 00:42:55.363
You said he touched your leg.

636
00:42:55.363 --> 00:42:57.173
Yes. That's right.

637
00:42:57.173 --> 00:42:59.803
He touched my leg.

638
00:43:01.042 --> 00:43:04.573
His hand was really rough.

639
00:43:04.673 --> 00:43:07.783
What do you mean, his hand was rough?

640
00:43:09.513 --> 00:43:10.952
It scratched your leg.

641
00:43:10.952 --> 00:43:11.952
Yes.

642
00:43:12.082 --> 00:43:14.053
It scratched my leg.

643
00:43:15.153 --> 00:43:16.952
Did you feel that?

644
00:43:19.093 --> 00:43:21.062
You said she smelled like alcohol.

645
00:43:21.062 --> 00:43:22.062
Tell her that too.

646
00:43:22.062 --> 00:43:26.363
He smelled a lot like alcohol.

647
00:43:28.062 --> 00:43:31.573
He pulled my arm.

648
00:43:31.573 --> 00:43:33.303
That must have hurt a lot.

649
00:43:33.303 --> 00:43:34.772
It hurts.

650
00:43:47.783 --> 00:43:49.122
Oh my.

651
00:43:49.122 --> 00:43:50.653
(Scene of the crime)

652
00:43:50.653 --> 00:43:52.292
(Yoon Ah Reum's mother's home)

653
00:43:52.292 --> 00:43:53.392
Why is it so big?

654
00:43:53.392 --> 00:43:54.892
A person could fit in here.

655
00:43:58.233 --> 00:44:00.503
Ms. Ma. That's not it.

656
00:44:00.503 --> 00:44:02.432
Fine. Okay.

657
00:44:05.832 --> 00:44:07.843
What are you saying is here?

658
00:44:08.443 --> 00:44:10.272
The doctor said...

659
00:44:10.343 --> 00:44:13.613
she may not be waking up due to the sleeping pills.

660
00:44:14.283 --> 00:44:15.412
So?

661
00:44:15.412 --> 00:44:18.013
I thought she was taking anti-depression meds.

662
00:44:18.082 --> 00:44:20.582
Some of them may have had sleeping aids.

663
00:44:20.582 --> 00:44:22.022
It makes no sense that she called...

664
00:44:22.022 --> 00:44:24.053
Choi Hyun Tae over and then took sleeping pills.

665
00:44:24.053 --> 00:44:25.593
Voluntarily, that is.

666
00:44:25.992 --> 00:44:27.463
If not voluntarily,

667
00:44:27.693 --> 00:44:29.363
are you saying he forced them on her?

668
00:44:29.823 --> 00:44:31.633
He probably tricked her into taking them...

669
00:44:31.633 --> 00:44:33.492
and tried to kill her quietly.

670
00:44:33.863 --> 00:44:35.633
But he failed because she woke up...

671
00:44:35.633 --> 00:44:36.832
while he was trying to.

672
00:44:37.272 --> 00:44:38.633
How could he get her to take them?

673
00:44:39.102 --> 00:44:42.343
I'm sure she wouldn't drink even water from him.

674
00:44:43.272 --> 00:44:44.372
He probably put it in food...

675
00:44:44.372 --> 00:44:47.042
that could hide sleeping pills easily.

676
00:44:47.642 --> 00:44:48.812
Like what?

677
00:44:49.682 --> 00:44:52.283
Something she ate or drank daily without thinking.

678
00:44:53.153 --> 00:44:56.022
Something he could leave outside secretly.

679

(Kup Milk)

680
00:45:04.863 --> 00:45:07.562
I sent you a sample via quick service.

681
00:45:07.763 --> 00:45:10.272
I'll ask the hospital to send you a blood sample...

682
00:45:10.272 --> 00:45:12.432
from Yoon Jung Hee, so have it analyzed.

683
00:45:12.573 --> 00:45:13.872
Prepare a search warrant...

684
00:45:13.872 --> 00:45:16.772
for Choi Hyun Tae's home if the compounds match.

685
00:45:18.213 --> 00:45:19.272
Ms. Lee.

686
00:45:20.412 --> 00:45:23.283
Wasn't Yoon Jung Hee examined this morning?

687
00:45:23.883 --> 00:45:25.553
The prosecutor asked for a blood sample...

688
00:45:25.553 --> 00:45:27.383
to run an analysis.

689
00:46:21.943 --> 00:46:23.102
Are you okay?

690
00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:25.412
Be careful.

691
00:46:26.042 --> 00:46:27.042
Okay.

692
00:46:31.983 --> 00:46:33.852
I put the tracker on her.

693
00:46:33.852 --> 00:46:35.483
I'll text you the link.

694
00:46:35.483 --> 00:46:38.292
Once you install the app, you can track her.

695
00:46:38.522 --> 00:46:39.653
Thank you.

696
00:46:39.923 --> 00:46:41.562
I'll send the money after I check it.

697
00:47:27.872 --> 00:47:30.042
(Haewoom Junior High)

698
00:47:35.013 --> 00:47:36.783
We have the analyses.

699
00:47:37.312 --> 00:47:39.582
Both samples had the same compound,

700
00:47:39.582 --> 00:47:41.952
and it's called zolpidem.

701
00:47:52.633 --> 00:47:54.202
Darn it.

702
00:47:54.202 --> 00:47:55.403
(Notice of Emergency Water Shut-Off)

703
00:48:07.312 --> 00:48:10.883
(Choi Hyun Tae's home)

704
00:48:14.783 --> 00:48:16.553
It's been vacant for a while.

705
00:48:19.823 --> 00:48:21.062
I'm nervous about this.

706
00:48:21.292 --> 00:48:23.193
Let's search as much as we can.

707
00:48:35.573 --> 00:48:36.602
Mr. Koo.

708
00:48:37.872 --> 00:48:38.943
Did you find anything?

709
00:48:39.412 --> 00:48:40.412
No, nothing.

710
00:48:41.113 --> 00:48:42.312
What if it isn't here?

711
00:48:51.952 --> 00:48:53.022
Who's this?

712
00:48:53.292 --> 00:48:54.693
This is Cho Gap Soo.

713
00:49:20.983 --> 00:49:23.253
I guess elections really are scary.

714
00:49:23.352 --> 00:49:25.722
This is a competitor's brother-in-law's case.

715
00:49:27.062 --> 00:49:28.892
I'm just giving you information.

716
00:49:29.463 --> 00:49:32.062
It's up to you to decide whether or not...

717
00:49:32.432 --> 00:49:34.033
to accept it.

718
00:49:35.263 --> 00:49:37.832
I'd be grateful, as long as it's a sure thing.

719
00:49:39.233 --> 00:49:40.602
It is for sure.

720
00:49:42.073 --> 00:49:43.573
Is this for free?

721
00:49:46.242 --> 00:49:50.042
Based on what I saw of you at Professor Sun's trial,

722
00:49:50.812 --> 00:49:52.852
you wouldn't believe me...

723
00:49:53.283 --> 00:49:55.582
even if I said I was just being nice.

724
00:49:56.153 --> 00:49:57.423
You saw right.

725
00:49:58.153 --> 00:50:01.363
I can't accept it if you ask for something too big.

726
00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:06.263
If this case gets resolved favorably,

727
00:50:06.763 --> 00:50:09.903
let's take a photo together later on.

728
00:50:12.403 --> 00:50:13.642
Is that all?

729
00:50:49.173 --> 00:50:50.173
Come out.

730
00:50:56.542 --> 00:50:58.883
While Kim's brother-in-law was in jail,

731
00:51:00.013 --> 00:51:02.053
this man was his cellmate.

732
00:51:06.553 --> 00:51:07.892
Not long ago,

733
00:51:08.662 --> 00:51:11.593
I got him a stolen car.

734
00:51:12.593 --> 00:51:15.263
Whatever. Get to the point.

735
00:51:15.763 --> 00:51:17.772
Okay. But...

736
00:51:18.332 --> 00:51:20.202
after getting him the car,

737
00:51:20.943 --> 00:51:23.642
I kept remembering what he said in jail.

738
00:51:24.513 --> 00:51:27.082
So it made me feel a bit icky.

739
00:51:27.742 --> 00:51:28.943
What was it?

740
00:51:30.242 --> 00:51:32.352
He said there was a woman that he loved,

741
00:51:32.682 --> 00:51:34.582
and that he'd marry her as soon as he got out.

742
00:51:35.753 --> 00:51:36.952
But...

743
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:39.593
that her mom was strongly against it.

744
00:51:39.753 --> 00:51:41.763
If she keeps opposing,

745
00:51:42.562 --> 00:51:45.363
I'll get rid of the girl's mom.

746
00:51:45.892 --> 00:51:47.463
As for my girl...

747
00:51:49.062 --> 00:51:50.133
I'll kidnap her?

748
00:51:51.903 --> 00:51:54.343
I'll have to kidnap her if necessary...

749
00:51:55.073 --> 00:51:57.472
to live with her somewhere quiet...

750
00:51:57.812 --> 00:51:59.142
for the rest of our lives.

751
00:52:28.343 --> 00:52:30.443
(Ma Yi Deum)

752
00:52:31.312 --> 00:52:32.372
Hello?

753
00:52:32.642 --> 00:52:34.582
Choi Hyun Tae's goal was to kidnap Ah Reum.

754
00:52:38.312 --> 00:52:39.883
Ever since he got out,

755
00:52:40.182 --> 00:52:42.352
I could never go outside without worrying.

756
00:52:42.653 --> 00:52:45.593
Every time I did, he'd find me and follow me.

757
00:52:45.852 --> 00:52:47.763
I failed five years ago,

758
00:52:48.162 --> 00:52:49.722
but not this time.

759
00:52:50.292 --> 00:52:52.863
Why is it so big? A person could fit in here.

760
00:52:53.533 --> 00:52:55.463
He probably tricked her into taking them...

761
00:52:55.463 --> 00:52:56.733
and tried to kill her quietly.

762
00:52:58.102 --> 00:52:59.673
He probably put it in food...

763
00:52:59.673 --> 00:53:01.702
that could hide sleeping pills easily.

764
00:53:37.742 --> 00:53:39.443
What are you...

765
00:53:41.783 --> 00:53:43.082
Hold on.

766
00:53:44.053 --> 00:53:45.253
Die!

767
00:53:46.753 --> 00:53:47.923
Quiet.

768
00:53:50.292 --> 00:53:53.153
Stop it. Shut it.

769
00:54:04.803 --> 00:54:05.972
Hold on!

770
00:54:12.843 --> 00:54:13.883

Mom?

775
00:54:44.343 --> 00:54:46.812
Mom. Are you awake?

776
00:54:56.582 --> 00:54:59.653

Hello?

780
00:55:53.343 --> 00:55:55.582
Ah Reum. Where are you?

781
00:56:01.182 --> 00:56:02.383
You missed me, right?

00:56:14.702 --> 00:56:15.803
Please...

785
00:56:17.332 --> 00:56:19.202
Something happened. I'm sure of it.

786
00:56:38.553 --> 00:56:39.593
What?

787
00:56:40.693 --> 00:56:42.093
Choi Hyun Tae is missing.

788
00:56:43.122 --> 00:56:45.693
Mr. Koo. I'll send you a license plate number.

789
00:56:45.693 --> 00:56:46.832
Please track it.

We have 2km more to go.

(Witch's Court)

794
00:58:05.372 --> 00:58:06.912
I'll kill you all!

Ms. Ma!

797
00:58:09.443 --> 00:58:12.513
The prosecutors did not spare their safety,

798
00:58:12.513 --> 00:58:14.582
resulting in our capturing the hideous criminal.

799
00:58:14.582 --> 00:58:16.082
You won't lose out.

800
00:58:16.082 --> 00:58:18.022
She wasn't stabbed to benefit you.

801
00:58:18.022 --> 00:58:19.423
Don't just bark.

802
00:58:19.423 --> 00:58:20.423
Bite me.

803
00:58:20.423 --> 00:58:21.662
Don't do anything rash.

804
00:58:21.662 --> 00:58:23.292
I was sexually assaulted.

805
00:58:23.292 --> 00:58:25.332
I'll be watching.

806
00:58:25.733 --> 00:58:27.403
It's time.

807
00:58:27.803 --> 00:58:29.763
I'd like to meet your mother.

Is she away?

809
00:58:30.932 --> 00:58:32.472
Take her somewhere quiet.

810
00:58:32.472 --> 00:58:35.042
There's nothing going on with you and her, right?
