1
00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:10.085
I told you, Ji Won...

2
00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:11.655
(Episode 18)

3
00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:12.655
I mean, sir.

4
00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:14.755
I told you to take some calming pills.

5
00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:18.196
Were you that nervous?

6
00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:20.095
To the point that you walked like this?

7
00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:21.696
- Mr. Kim. - Yes?

8
00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:24.106
Stop it already.

9
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.406
I mean, even I got so nervous that my heart almost stopped.

10
00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.275
Will you do it like this for our meeting with the model next week?

11
00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.576
That was awesome. So cool.

12
00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:48.296
Goodness, you barely have any stuff.

13
00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:51.525
Did you take your winter clothes and underwear?

14
00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:54.665
You should take some water pouch and painkillers.

15
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.735
Right, did you take sleeping socks and a blindfold?

16
00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:59.406
I'm taking everything I need.

17
00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:01.576
If I'm missing something, I can always buy it.

18
00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:05.176
You're always looking for a chance to spend money.

19
00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:09.446
You should just get married, not boast about moving out.

20
00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:12.385
Mom, I'm telling you once again.

21
00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:15.915
I am determined not to get married. I am an independent woman.

22
00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:18.556
I told you that I will live an independent life,

23
00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:21.495
and you also agreed.

24
00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:25.525
If you made food whenever you talked back, you'd feed the whole nation.

25
00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:27.265
Take this.

26
00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:28.396
What is this?

27
00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:30.605
I don't know. I'm not seeing you off.

28
00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.806
Of course. There's no need. I'm leaving. Bye.

29
00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:42.676
Gosh, that brat.

30
00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.825
Is that the fridge? That's fine.

31
00:01:58.426 --> 00:01:59.665
And the closet...

32
00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:05.165
It's okay. It's fine.

33
00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:10.445
The bed. It'll be fine once I put the bedding on. It's usable.

34
00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:12.806
Everything is good enough.

35
00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:16.546
Except for you.

36
00:02:22.255 --> 00:02:25.456
Hey, objectively speaking, I'm the best thing in this room.

37
00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:28.625
Ah Reum, pack your stuff. You should go home.

38
00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:30.025
I'll take you back.

39
00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.465
Don't you want me to be happy?

40
00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:36.336
How dare you try to stop me instead of congratulating me?

41
00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:39.306
- This place is great. - Great?

42
00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:42.275
Wow, you are completely blinded.

43
00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:45.275
You said this place is furnished. Where is the furniture?

44
00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:47.445
Is this fridge part of the furnishing?

45
00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:51.016
Look at this. You won't get any sunlight.

46
00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.755
Look at the color of the wallpapers.

47
00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:56.416
When it rains, it'll get moldy.

48
00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.356
And do you like bugs?

49
00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:00.456
It looks like you'll see one every single day.

50
00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:04.366
Give me the number of the real estate guy. I'll get you out.

51
00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:05.625
Forget it. Go.

52
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:07.796
- Go home. - Stop it. The dust.

53
00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:09.236
- Go. - Stop it, I mean it.

54
00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:14.676
You were the number one most researched guy.

55
00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:19.345
Your name didn't go down all night. I don't need any vitamins anymore.

56
00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:21.916
It felt really great.

57
00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:23.845
I had no idea you were hungry for success...

58
00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:26.815
- over the last 20 years. - Do you know what my dream is?

59
00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:30.155
It's to count cash until my fingerprints get worn out.

60
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:32.285
I can't make that come true.

61
00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:33.695
I can't do that for you.

62
00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:35.495
You can. Why?

63
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.225
Because we just got an offer for a TV ad.

64
00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:40.766
- A TV ad? - Look in the side pocket.

65
00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:46.636
(Rubber glove commercial)

66
00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:48.775
Why did I get this commercial?

67
00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:52.306
It's for the both of you. You and Jin Jin.

68
00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:54.016
The newlyweds.

69
00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:57.345
Don't you think it'll be so sweet?

70
00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:05.826
Let's do it. You're doing it, okay?

71
00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:07.856
Jin Jin and rubber gloves?

72
00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:15.366
You're peaking all over again.

73
00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:17.435
Your skin's so much clearer.

74
00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:19.265
Since you started "We Got Married".

75
00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:22.536
You're so popular. It's no joke.

76
00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:25.546
People were looking up Anthony until early morning.

77
00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:28.546
- Really? - You're his fans' hope and dream.

78
00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:31.786
They're living vicariously through you.

79
00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:36.786
I totally understand. It's a crazy honor and blessing.

80
00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.226
There he is. Anthony.

81
00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.666
- Hello. - Hello.

82
00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:45.926
Are you feeling better, Jin Jin?

83
00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:48.835
Yes. I'm all better now.

84
00:04:56.875 --> 00:05:00.645
Very nice. One more take. Okay.

85
00:05:00.645 --> 00:05:03.575
Look at the camera. Very nice.

86
00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:05.046
Once more.

87
00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:08.255
That's just great.

88
00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:10.625
Look at the camera now.

89
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.486
Okay. A bit more.

90
00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:15.796
Very nice.

91
00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:18.995
Hug each other warmly.

92
00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:20.536
That's great.

93
00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:23.495
Look at each other.

94
00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:24.866
Nice.

95
00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:29.036
Look lovingly at each other. Great.

96
00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:31.976
That's great.

97
00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:39.185
That's a wrap. Well done, and thanks.

98
00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:41.685
- Well done. - Thank you.

99
00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:43.656
- Thank you. - Great job.

100
00:05:43.656 --> 00:05:45.356
- Thanks. - Thank you.

101
00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:46.885
- Thanks. - Thank you.

102
00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:48.825
You were like someone else.

103
00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:52.065
You always trembled around Anthony, but not today.

104
00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:54.695
You have no idea. I was shaking so badly.

105
00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:57.205
- You're a liar. - It's true.

106
00:05:57.205 --> 00:05:58.765
You did much better than expected.

107
00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:01.806
- I haven't done many couple shoots. - It's fine.

108
00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:03.306
- It was great. - It's true.

109
00:06:03.306 --> 00:06:06.005
- Hey, Jin Jin. - Yes?

110
00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:08.546
- Can I ask you something? - Sure.

111
00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:11.085
It's about the commercial.

112
00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:12.486
What commercial?

113
00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:17.125
Did President Jang not tell you yet? Well...

114
00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:21.656
- Do you think... - Wait.

115
00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:24.625
- Jin Jin. - Yes?

116
00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:29.366
The hamburger place you mentioned... Can I have the number?

117
00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:32.106
Sure. Just a moment.

118
00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:36.935
Here.

119
00:06:38.245 --> 00:06:39.375
Thanks.

120
00:06:44.015 --> 00:06:46.815
Are you still here? Get lost.

121
00:06:46.815 --> 00:06:49.156
You're lucky I stayed.

122
00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.455
Hey, it's really clean.

123
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:55.796
Don't you let yourself go because you moved out.

124
00:06:55.796 --> 00:06:58.026
Although you're a total slob already.

125
00:06:58.026 --> 00:06:59.625
You're even worse.

126
00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.366
I'm blessed in that sense.

127
00:07:01.366 --> 00:07:03.435
What are you talking about? Is that them?

128
00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:05.005
It's not Jin Jin?

129
00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:07.736
- Hello. - Hello.

130
00:07:09.036 --> 00:07:11.875
- Hey. - You didn't wash your hands.

131
00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.716
- Jung Woo Sung? - Gong Ji Won?

132
00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:17.645
It's great to see you again.

133
00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:21.156
Yes, Sorry, I didn't wash my hands after cleaning up.

134
00:07:22.286 --> 00:07:25.056
- You haven't changed at all. - Why is he here?

135
00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:27.026
My face went through turbulent times.

136
00:07:27.026 --> 00:07:29.755
It's great to see you. I'm glad you look the same.

137
00:07:30.255 --> 00:07:32.926
- Yes. - A housewarming party?

138
00:07:32.926 --> 00:07:34.536
I came to help clean up.

139
00:07:34.536 --> 00:07:38.005
I'm done here. I have to go to work. I'm on the night shift.

140
00:07:38.005 --> 00:07:41.075
I thought Jin Jin would be here. That's why I stayed.

141
00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:42.435
She's on her way.

142
00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:44.005
- Is she? - Yes.

143
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:47.416
Should I stay, or should I not?

144
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.875
- You shall not. - Right? I should go.

145
00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:51.046
- Go. - See you.

146
00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:52.116
- What a pity. - Bye.

147
00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:54.116
- Thank you. - See you again.

148
00:07:54.116 --> 00:07:56.385
- Bye. - Take care.

149
00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:03.526
Are you and Jung Woo Sung...

150
00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:06.166
Hey, would you kiss him?

151
00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.395
Gosh, no. No way.

152
00:08:08.395 --> 00:08:10.635
It takes 0.1 second to judge a man.

153
00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:14.135
Whether you can kiss the guy or not.

154
00:08:14.135 --> 00:08:17.745
If you can't kiss him, you don't stand a chance of dating him.

155
00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:21.346
- It's a no. - Okay.

156
00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:24.185
What? Why are you giving me that look?

157
00:08:27.185 --> 00:08:29.116
Go home, okay?

158
00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:31.556
It's dark. I must come with you.

159
00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:34.756
My friend lives just there. Go before I turn nasty.

160
00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:37.225
- See you. Bye. - Jin Jin.

161
00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:38.465
Jin Jin.

162
00:08:42.095 --> 00:08:45.205
Yes. Yes.

163
00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:49.276
The second alley past the convenience store.

164
00:08:49.276 --> 00:08:52.075
Don't go towards the motels.

165
00:08:54.115 --> 00:08:56.516
I see the convenience store.

166
00:08:57.085 --> 00:08:58.246
- Do you? - Yes.

167
00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.985
- Okay, I'll come out. - Okay.

168
00:09:02.656 --> 00:09:04.556
- I'll go. - What?

169
00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:06.926
Let me go.

170
00:09:16.396 --> 00:09:17.865
Cheers.

171
00:09:27.646 --> 00:09:31.546
The second alley? Is that the one?

172
00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:36.876
Is this not it?

173
00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:42.916
Oh no.

174
00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:05.345
The receiver cannot answer the phone...

175
00:11:17.085 --> 00:11:18.526
Sa Jin Jin.

176
00:11:25.825 --> 00:11:27.996
Where does she live?

177
00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:29.735
Where am I?

178
00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:34.906
Sa Jin Jin.

179
00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:39.575
Jin Jin.

180
00:11:42.715 --> 00:11:45.815
Jin Jin! Jin!

181
00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:47.585
Sa Jin Jin!

182
00:12:29.595 --> 00:12:31.065
Gong Ji Won.

183
00:12:32.796 --> 00:12:35.796
- I thought I would die. - What's wrong with you?

184
00:12:38.565 --> 00:12:40.136
What's wrong with you?

185
00:12:40.876 --> 00:12:42.806
You should've stayed there.

186
00:12:43.845 --> 00:12:46.176
Don't go wandering off.

187
00:12:46.176 --> 00:12:48.876
I'll come to you. Just wait.

188
00:12:48.876 --> 00:12:51.845
Why don't you ever listen?

189
00:13:20.869 --> 00:13:24.101

190
00:14:51.705 --> 00:14:52.865
Are they gone?

191
00:14:55.475 --> 00:14:57.205
I almost fell asleep.

192
00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:02.345
We did this much. The rest is up to them.

193
00:15:02.345 --> 00:15:04.345
They should get the hint.

194
00:15:06.315 --> 00:15:09.056
Shall we drink beer all night?

195
00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:11.985
No. You can go.

196
00:15:12.085 --> 00:15:15.355
I'll stay the night. You can't sleep alone on your first night.

197
00:15:15.355 --> 00:15:16.695
You'll be too scared.

198
00:15:16.695 --> 00:15:20.095
I won't be. I'll enjoy the life of a non-married woman.

199
00:15:20.225 --> 00:15:21.595
Sleep in your comfortable bed.

200
00:15:21.896 --> 00:15:24.806
I'll be fine. I'll really be okay.

201
00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:43.825
Do you like living alone?

202
00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:45.386
It's paradise on earth.

203
00:15:45.485 --> 00:15:49.225
You can't live alone when you've never washed your underwear before.

204
00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:53.595
I hope you have a daughter just like you.

205
00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:55.136
Then you'll know how I feel.

206
00:15:55.136 --> 00:15:58.435
I said I won't get married. I'll just date men.

207
00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:01.306
Okay, fine. Just find a date.

208
00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:02.876
I will, okay? I will.

209
00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:07.016
I liked your parcel.

210
00:16:07.345 --> 00:16:08.876
A nice assortment.

211
00:16:09.046 --> 00:16:11.546
Here's my compliment. Thank you.

212
00:16:15.685 --> 00:16:17.225
How can I sleep without you?

213
00:16:19.426 --> 00:16:20.996
Don't be so silly.

214
00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:22.656
I have to watch a drama.

215
00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:25.365
Okay. Bye.

216
00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:41.746
This is stupid. I'm 35.

217
00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:09.706
See you.

218
00:17:15.415 --> 00:17:16.575
No.

219
00:17:21.556 --> 00:17:22.986
I hate seeing your back.

220
00:17:24.686 --> 00:17:26.026
I hate you being angry.

221
00:17:26.996 --> 00:17:30.665
You didn't care when I was sick and disappeared like that.

222
00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:32.496
I hate that you don't care!

223
00:17:45.946 --> 00:17:47.415
What's this mess?

224
00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:50.216
I hate myself the most.

225
00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:54.686
I hate myself for being...

226
00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:58.085
in this mess because of you.

227
00:18:36.655 --> 00:18:37.696
No.

228
00:18:39.026 --> 00:18:40.365
I hate seeing your back.

229
00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:42.936
I hate you being angry.

230
00:18:44.135 --> 00:18:47.806
You didn't care when I was sick and disappeared like that.

231
00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:49.605
I hate that you don't care!

232
00:19:03.956 --> 00:19:05.385
Did you have breakfast?

233
00:19:05.986 --> 00:19:07.026
Yes.

234
00:19:07.796 --> 00:19:09.956
Why don't you come to eat with us?

235
00:19:10.996 --> 00:19:13.296
Are you not starving at home?

236
00:19:15.395 --> 00:19:17.006
You don't look well.

237
00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:21.135
Why do you look like you barely get any gruel?

238
00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:23.776
Do you work a lot?

239
00:19:23.776 --> 00:19:25.246
I slept in.

240
00:19:25.806 --> 00:19:27.875
I'll wake up in time for breakfast.

241
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.716
Yes, you do that.

242
00:19:30.075 --> 00:19:32.786
A good breakfast gives you energy for the day.

243
00:19:32.786 --> 00:19:33.815
Right.

244
00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:37.155
Are you going on a business trip?

245
00:19:37.556 --> 00:19:40.696
Yes. And I'll see my brother.

246
00:19:43.296 --> 00:19:45.466
Yes, yes.

247
00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:50.065
How would we have known Director Shin had his eyes on you?

248
00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.605
The role is just perfect for you.

249
00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:56.036
Anyway, you'd better risk your life on this interview.

250
00:19:57.345 --> 00:19:59.806
Oh, by the way, you know...

251
00:20:00.306 --> 00:20:02.845
the director has a nasty temper, right?

252
00:20:03.575 --> 00:20:06.446
Just give in like a wet leaf on the ground.

253
00:20:06.815 --> 00:20:09.016
Then we'll go to Cannes.

254
00:20:09.016 --> 00:20:10.756
There you go again.

255
00:20:11.256 --> 00:20:14.456
Don't get your hopes up. You'll just get that much disappointed.

256
00:20:14.456 --> 00:20:15.895
I'm so excited.

257
00:20:16.155 --> 00:20:17.726
It's your birthday.

258
00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:19.696
Could this be a present?

259
00:20:20.226 --> 00:20:22.796
And Director Shin just happened to live on Jeju Island?

260
00:20:22.895 --> 00:20:25.865
This is a gift from your mother.

261
00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:28.276
This is meant to be.

262
00:20:29.976 --> 00:20:31.405
Stop being so silly.

263
00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:34.075
Anyway, have fun celebrating with Ji Won,

264
00:20:34.075 --> 00:20:35.746
and good luck with Director Shin.

265
00:20:35.746 --> 00:20:38.786
I'll join you early tomorrow morning.

266
00:20:39.216 --> 00:20:40.456
I'll expect good news.

267
00:21:06.446 --> 00:21:08.115
This is from my mom.

268
00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:10.516
Thanks, Mom.

269
00:21:11.415 --> 00:21:13.516
I wish I were born in the spring.

270
00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:16.216
Mom would feel less cold.

271
00:21:17.155 --> 00:21:20.655
Fall is a romantic season. The sky's so blue.

272
00:21:22.526 --> 00:21:23.556
Is it?

273
00:21:25.266 --> 00:21:27.895
Thanks to your mom, I get to visit Jeju Island every year,

274
00:21:28.365 --> 00:21:32.806
take a break, and not worry about what to get you.

275
00:21:33.736 --> 00:21:34.936
It's lovely.

276
00:21:35.806 --> 00:21:38.675
How was she born on Jeju Island?

277
00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:40.145
I wonder too.

278
00:21:41.415 --> 00:21:43.746
My mom's such a great person.

279
00:21:46.815 --> 00:21:48.115
That's why you should...

280
00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:50.625
care more about your birthday.

281
00:21:52.556 --> 00:21:55.026
How upset would your mom be to know you don't...

282
00:21:55.296 --> 00:21:56.996
care about your birthday?

283
00:21:58.466 --> 00:22:03.065
She'll say, "My poor son doesn't even get any birthday soup."

284
00:22:04.065 --> 00:22:05.806
For her sake alone,

285
00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:09.736
let people congratulate you and give you presents.

286
00:22:13.405 --> 00:22:14.446
No.

287
00:22:15.645 --> 00:22:17.315
I just need you.

288
00:22:18.246 --> 00:22:19.315
What?

289
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:22.786
You're my biggest gift.

290
00:22:25.925 --> 00:22:27.196
Aren't I yours?

291
00:22:29.855 --> 00:22:31.925
You aren't. Of course, you aren't.

292
00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:33.625
- What? - My goodness.

293
00:22:43.276 --> 00:22:46.246
Your neck looks too short in that.

294
00:22:47.145 --> 00:22:49.075
- Does it? - Your neck...

295
00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:53.415
Yes, I think so too.

296
00:22:59.825 --> 00:23:01.425
Your torso looks too long.

297
00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:03.056
Does it?

298
00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:05.696
- Hong Hee, does it? - Your torso...

299
00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:07.236
It looks too long.

300
00:23:09.065 --> 00:23:10.736
Yes, I think so too.

301
00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:12.605
I liked this.

302
00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:21.645
Jin Jin, this is it. We'll take this.

303
00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:25.686
- Hong Hee, is this it? - Yes.

304
00:23:26.046 --> 00:23:27.456
Why are you so picky?

305
00:23:27.456 --> 00:23:30.686
Who made you the fashionista you are?

306
00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:34.355
It's all thanks to my picky and great sense of style.

307
00:23:34.355 --> 00:23:35.595
It is, right?

308
00:23:42.365 --> 00:23:43.966
Is it fun to be on "We Got Married"?

309
00:23:44.536 --> 00:23:45.536
Yes.

310
00:23:47.236 --> 00:23:48.675
What about Jin Jin?

311
00:23:51.075 --> 00:23:53.006
What do you think about her?

312
00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:55.345
Jin Jin?

313
00:24:01.355 --> 00:24:04.186
She's nice, pretty,

314
00:24:06.556 --> 00:24:08.956
- and she's like the moonlight. - What?

315
00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:10.895
She lingers on.

316
00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:14.796
What about you? What's Jin Jin to you?

317
00:24:14.796 --> 00:24:17.266
What's Jin Jin like as a childhood friend?

318
00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:23.635
She's nice and pretty.

319
00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:29.976
- And she's like the starlight. - What?

320
00:24:30.486 --> 00:24:31.915
She twinkles.

321
00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:37.425
Both of them are in the sky.

322
00:24:45.325 --> 00:24:48.395
- President Gong. - Hey, you're here.

323
00:24:48.766 --> 00:24:50.736
Where have you been while skipping work?

324
00:24:51.436 --> 00:24:53.335
You don't have to know everything.

325
00:24:53.835 --> 00:24:56.175
How did the meeting preparation go? I heard you stayed up last night.

326
00:24:56.175 --> 00:24:58.175
Yes, I slept very well on the flight.

327
00:24:58.175 --> 00:25:00.276
I couldn't even say hi to the flight attendants.

328
00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:03.246
Instead, let's go say hi...

329
00:25:03.246 --> 00:25:05.486
to our buyers.

330
00:25:08.415 --> 00:25:10.625
Next is a graph of the analysis of the ingredients...

331
00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.085
included in the hot spring products.

332
00:25:12.085 --> 00:25:14.395
Using this as a background,

333
00:25:14.395 --> 00:25:17.996
we'll share our marketing strategy to dive into the global market.

334
00:25:18.425 --> 00:25:19.895
(Mineral Ingredients in Hot Spring Products)

335
00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:21.565
As you can see from the graph,

336
00:25:21.565 --> 00:25:24.036
our products are rich in mineral,

337
00:25:24.036 --> 00:25:26.966
and we'll continue to develop products that stand out.

338
00:25:26.966 --> 00:25:29.206
Not only that, but we're developing and researching nonstop...

339
00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:32.246
for unique ingredients to improve our products.

(National Chemicals Overseas Buyers' Meeting)

341
00:25:59.936 --> 00:26:03.436
Gosh, Mr. Yu. We need more investors.

342
00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:06.175
- The scenario is really great. - I'll help you out too.

343
00:26:06.175 --> 00:26:09.476
I wrote it with a lot of effort. You haven't read it, have you?

344
00:26:09.476 --> 00:26:11.615
- Send it to me. - I will.

345
00:26:12.085 --> 00:26:16.216
Ms. Choi is really persistent, right?

346
00:26:17.256 --> 00:26:19.355
You're Anthony, whom Choi Jeong Eun sent over.

347
00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:21.325
Yes, I'm Lee Chul Min.

348
00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:23.456
Is there a Terius?

349
00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:25.625
How about an Albert?

350
00:26:25.865 --> 00:26:28.095
- Right? And an Archie. - Archie!

351
00:26:28.095 --> 00:26:31.135
You have a great memory. How did you remember that?

352
00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:34.476
Even when I'm lonely or sad

353
00:26:34.706 --> 00:26:38.046
Thank you for joining us. Please call us back. Safe flight.

354
00:26:38.145 --> 00:26:39.175
- Thank you. - Have a good day.

355
00:26:39.175 --> 00:26:40.276
Thank you, bye.

356
00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:46.746
That was a difficult pitch.

357
00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:49.286
I really need more sugar. I mean it.

358
00:26:50.786 --> 00:26:52.585
What do we need now?

359
00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:54.956
A cup of coffee. Let's get a strong cup.

360
00:26:55.756 --> 00:26:58.966
- I have to stop by my room. - Sure.

361
00:26:58.966 --> 00:27:00.466
- I'll be there soon. - Okay.

362
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:08.736
- Hey, isn't he that guy? - Who?

363
00:27:08.936 --> 00:27:11.276
- Anthony's brother. - Who's Anthony?

364
00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:12.645
Anthony, the character from "Candy Candy"?

365
00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:15.216
You idiots. Sa Jin Jin's husband from "We Got Married".

366
00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:17.415
Oh, the guy who married Sa Jin Jin?

367
00:27:17.516 --> 00:27:21.315
Hey, but Anthony's brother is much better-looking than he is.

368
00:27:21.315 --> 00:27:23.855
- He's so handsome. - Ask him if he's his brother.

369
00:27:23.855 --> 00:27:26.056
- You ask. - Why would I?

370
00:27:27.026 --> 00:27:29.325
Gosh, I like your thighs.

371
00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:32.796
I see why madams love you.

372
00:27:32.796 --> 00:27:34.466
You get a lot of calls, don't you?

373
00:27:34.996 --> 00:27:38.206
- No. - I think you would.

374
00:27:38.635 --> 00:27:41.405
Look at your body. Fantastic.

375
00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:46.946
- Right, wasn't he an idol star? - Were you an idol star?

376
00:27:47.115 --> 00:27:48.175
Yes.

377
00:27:48.175 --> 00:27:51.016
Idol stars are very problematic.

378
00:27:51.016 --> 00:27:52.345
They start acting without a foundation,

379
00:27:52.345 --> 00:27:55.585
and they always hear things about how horrible they are.

380
00:27:55.585 --> 00:27:58.625
Aren't you doing pretty well now thanks to your idol star days?

381
00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:00.925
He's on "We Got Married" with Sa Jin Jin.

382
00:28:00.925 --> 00:28:03.155
Sa Jin Jin? That Sa Jin Jin?

383
00:28:03.155 --> 00:28:05.125
He's her husband.

384
00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:08.895
I heard she's been a fan since she was young.

385
00:28:08.895 --> 00:28:10.966
Sa Jin Jin...

386
00:28:11.436 --> 00:28:12.865
She wouldn't sleep with me.

387
00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:17.845
Did you sleep with her? You did, didn't you?

388
00:28:17.845 --> 00:28:20.776
Come on, it's between us.

389
00:28:20.776 --> 00:28:21.875
Was she great?

390
00:28:23.016 --> 00:28:25.716
I can tell that you gave her a good time.

391
00:28:26.016 --> 00:28:28.556
She'll have a funny walk very soon.

392
00:28:28.556 --> 00:28:32.155
If you see a brat who's walking funny...

393
00:28:32.155 --> 00:28:34.526
- on the street... - How dare you?

394
00:28:34.526 --> 00:28:36.355
What's with him? Let go of me.

395
00:28:36.355 --> 00:28:39.325
- Who do you think you are? - My gosh.

396
00:28:39.325 --> 00:28:42.466
You jerk, let me go. Don't you know your place?

397
00:28:42.466 --> 00:28:44.105
Do you know who I am?

398
00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:46.236
- He's right! Let go of him! - Do you know?

399
00:28:46.236 --> 00:28:49.036
- My gosh. - Let go of me.

400
00:28:49.706 --> 00:28:51.105
Are you okay?

401
00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:53.746
- You impudent punk. - What a rude, little jerk.

402
00:28:54.875 --> 00:28:57.615
- Do you know who I am? - I don't.

403
00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.615
And I don't want to know.

404
00:29:48.095 --> 00:29:49.196
Chul Min.

405
00:29:55.675 --> 00:29:57.706
What brings you here?

(Children of 20th Century/20th Century Boy & Girl)

407
00:30:40.216 --> 00:30:42.915
What's for the honeymoon? Anywhere you want to go?

408
00:30:42.915 --> 00:30:45.085
You have to be careful not to create scandals.

409
00:30:45.085 --> 00:30:47.355
Is something going on with Anthony?

410
00:30:47.355 --> 00:30:51.165
He's so cool that I can't do anything about him.

411
00:30:51.165 --> 00:30:53.665
- I know that. - You couldn't sleep...

412
00:30:53.665 --> 00:30:55.536
- because of Jin Jin? - Yes.

413
00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:58.105
I've been wanting to set Mr. Gong up on a blind date,

414
00:30:58.105 --> 00:31:00.065
but he refused me so often.

415
00:31:00.065 --> 00:31:03.175
Please don't misunderstand. We're just friends.

416
00:31:03.375 --> 00:31:05.006
Why did it have to be us?

417
00:31:05.006 --> 00:31:07.716
- You should go. - I'm not going on the blind date.
